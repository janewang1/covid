Almost one billion people call these neighbourhoods home, representing the majority of the urban population in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Also known as slums or squatter settlements, informal settlements face significant deprivations, including poor water and sanitation conditions, insufficient living area, low durability of housing, and insecurity of land tenure (UN-Habitat 2003) . Occupation and construction take place simultaneously, over many years or decades, as the urban poor meet their housing needs in the absence of affordable alternatives (Acioly and French 2012) . Many of these characteristics of informal settlements act as socio-environmental determinants of health, increasing risk of morbidity and mortality from common diseases such as diarrhoea and, increasingly, from COVID-19 (Lilford et al. 2017 , Wilkinson 2020 .COVID-19 is compounding the severe health vulnerabilities and inequalities facing the urban poor, prompting a re-evaluation of the contemporary approach to settlement upgrading. Even the most basic COVID-19 prevention measures, such as hand washing (limited water supply), social distancing (high density living), and working from home (informal sector employment), are not possible for informal settlement residents (Corburn et al. 2020) . Many upgrading projects are now on hold and upgrading funding may reduce given constrained government and aid budgets and competing demands from other sectors. The pandemic has also starkly highlighted the interconnectedness of the health of all urban residents, bringing into consciousness the plight of the urban poor who are disproportionately suffering.In this current context and moving forward, we advocate that tweaking current upgrading approaches is insufficient; rather, a transformation is needed. We articulate a vision for a transformational approach and then scope the conceptual scaffolding, comprising three core tenets -planetary health, transdisciplinarity, and a people-centred approach -to stimulate theoretical and critical reflection. Our aim is to reconceptualize entrenched approaches that perpetuate urban poverty and vulnerability, toward a more just informal settlement revitalisation practice in a COVID-19 world.Poor health in informal settlements results not only from spatial and environmental conditions but from structural inequalities that are created and maintained by systems and institutions. Population-level inequalities are replicated and reinforced within informal settlements; hence, the elderly, women, children and people less abled are especially vulnerable. These social and health inequalities predispose informal settlement residents to high prevalence of co-morbidities, resulting in multifactorial susceptibility to COVID-19. Additionally, informal settlement residents struggle to access the typically overburdened and under-resourced local health services. Therefore, alongside the risk of direct COVID-19-related deaths, vulnerable populations are also prone to experiencing excess all-cause mortality related to disruptions in health infrastructure (Corburn et al. 2020) .Alleviating the chronic and acute human health and wellbeing problems in informal settlements is a key motivation for upgrading interventions. Learning lessons from previously-failed attempts to eradicate, evict, replace and relocate slum dwellers to formal housing, the contemporary global paradigm centres on in-situ upgrading to improve environmental quality, health, wellbeing and livelihoods (Satterthwaite et al. 2020) . Upgrading programs include a standard set of components: providing safe water and sanitation, paving streets, improving stormwater drainage, formalising electricity and solid waste collection, and land tenure regularisation, all delivered through a communitybased approach (UN-Habitat 2015) . While there is diversity across countries in how it is framed and implemented, the contemporary upgrading model has been in operation for several decades. It is guided by the (de-facto) global definition of slums that includes five household-level indicators (UN-Habitat 2003) , and is enshrined in global frameworks such as the Millenium Development Goals (Goal 7, Target 7D) and more recently the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11, Target 11.1).Scholars, practitioners and communities are increasingly critiquing the contemporary upgrading model, with concerns falling into four areas. First, current upgrading practice is too piecemeal. Small-scale (settlement by settlement) implementation is slow, cannot address the sheer number of settlements requiring attention, and does not adequately consider city-wide interconnections. Second, upgrading is too often seen as a technical product, not a process of community empowerment and partnership-building. 'Participation' is often token with residents required to fit into 'top down' project parameters (Satterthwaite et al. 2020) . Third, upgrading projects do not adequately respond to the complexity of the humanenvironment interface. Narrow, 'low hanging fruit' interventions prevail over holistic approaches that could produce more comprehensive improvements. Fourth, the vast majority of upgrading research, policy, and practice is framed from a technical standpoint, i.e. the need to provide water or pave streets. This framing is limited in its engagement with the underlying structural injustices that perpetuate urban poverty and socio-spatial exclusion driving informal settlement formation and expansion, as well as limited in their critical reflection on the history of colonialism, ongoing paternalism and soft-diplomacy exercised by high-income countries on low-income countries in the global South. Overall, then, it seems that business as usual 'upgrading' requires a critical rethink.We posit that a refreshed approach is needed which has transformation as a driving goal of informal settlement research, policy, and practice. Transformation necessitates a critical engagement with the institutional structures and processes that create and sustain inequalities beyond that of the individual, household or community, and beyond a narrow technical 'solutions' focus.Our vision for a COVID-19 world is to achieve transformation through the comprehensive 'revitalisation' of informal settlements. To revitalise is to transform, to imbue something with new life and vitality, within a process of growth towards a superior form of being. The label 'revitalisation' signals a step change in thinking and practice beyond the label of 'upgrading' and articulates the type of change needed in theory and practice. Drawing from our experience across many countries, and across research and practice, we propose a conceptual framework (Figure 1 ) with three core tenets for a revitalisation praxis: (1) planetary health, (2) transdisciplinarity, and (3) a peoplecentred approach.We posit that planetary health offers an opportune framing for addressing informal settlements. Planetary health is defined as 'the health of human civilisation and the state of the natural systems on which it depends' (Whitmee et al. 2015) . It spans interrelated issues of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, water and sanitation, air pollution, gender equity, climate change, urbanisation, and displacement. This big-picture framing demands comprehensive interventions that address multiple variables in complex urban environments through a systems-level approach (Brown et al. 2018) . It positions health as multidimensional and encourages interrogation of systems phenomena across cascading and nested scales: global, regional, country, city, settlement, housing unit and individual. In doing so, it moves upgrading interventions away from a narrow focus on the immediate housing environment to interrogating the location within the city and the sociospatial inequalities faced by residents related to employment, commuting time, accessibility of health services, etc. Importantly, it is underpinned by an implicit normative and environmental justice agenda that provides space for a (human-rights based) new revitalisation practice for informal settlements, considering impacts on those currently most vulnerable and those of future generations.A planetary health framing lends itself to a transdisciplinary approach. Transdisciplinarity, as distinct from inter-disciplinarity, involves not only various academic disciplines but also non-academic sectors such as industry, government, and communities, to codefine problems and co-deliver integrated solutions (Hoffmann et al. 2019) . Transdisciplinarity broadens the scope for non-academic knowledge systems and understanding, such as community and indigenous knowledge. It is often linked with practical action to generate new empirical and theoretical knowledge whilst also delivering material changes, especially for the poor, vulnerable, and marginalised, through novel research design and implementation.Given the complexity of informal settlement environments, transdisciplinarity offers a framework for integrating broad expertise to deliver systems change impact, which may help overcome the limitations of previous 'upgrading'. Furthermore, implicit in the transdisciplinarity approach is the importance of partnerships and capacity building beyond the 'ivory tower' of universities. It can foster spaces to strengthen the voice and agency of those often most excluded, and in doing so it implicitly reshapes the power dynamics of data generation and knowledge production, upon which informal settlement interventions are designed, decided, implemented and evaluated.Our vision requires centring informal settlement residents and communities as key actors in the process of revitalization. We must build on the laudable progress made by informal settlement community groups and federations who, over many decades, have organised, built their capacity, and undertaken pioneering data collection and knowledge generation even in the face of significant obstacles and repression (Satterthwaite et al. 2020) . We must further fundamentally restructure the partnership ecosystem between community and government, as well as with other sectors such as academia and philanthropy, with a goal of more equal and trusted engagement. This requires deeper consideration of residents' experiences, needs and priorities, especially those often overlooked, such as women and girls, older people, and those less able, and their intersectional compounding identities, marginalities and vulnerabilities.From an urban studies perspective, a people-centred revitalisation approach demands a more nuanced view of the inherent socio-spatial and economic interrelationships between informal settlements and their surrounding city and regional ecosystems. The conceptual 'formal/informal' binary divide which has dominated thinking to date appears no longer fit for purpose. Rather, we can be better served by considering formality as a continuum which accounts for a more nuanced view of informal settlements in their broader urban ecosystems. Adopting a citywide approach to revitalisation, where the planetary health interrelationships between informal settlements and their city as a whole are considered, is essential for moving beyond the contemporary piecemeal, siloed upgrading approach.The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to question contemporary approaches towards informal settlements. We argue that tweaking the current upgrading approach is inadequate in a COVID-19 world. Rather, a transformation towards a planetary health, transdisciplinary, people-centred, 'revitalisation' of informal settlements is needed. This paradigm shift is needed now; it is not a task for when COVID-19 'is over' given the likely protracted nature of the pandemic and the need to address the immediate informal settlement vulnerabilities. To be clear, we should continue with in-situ responses, regularising land tenure, and strengthening existing community organisations. At the same time, we should expand transdisciplinary research (e.g. the Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments program (Brown et al. 2018) ) and amplify existing research-practice partnerships for impact. Building on these existing efforts with an explicit view to transformation may help redress the socio-spatial structural injustices perpetuating urban health inequalities so that cities and all their residents are better placed to overcome COVID-19 and similar crises in the future.","Australia","first author","2020-09-01",9

Scientists are also affected by extreme events yet are not often themselves the subject of study.Extreme events have always affected individuals and are explicitly recognized as mitigating circumstances in grant proposal schemes or in considering ""output"" relative to opportunity, with allowances provided for family responsibilities in some countries (Malisch et al., 2020; Myers et al., 2020) . These individual disruptions (or life choices, in the case of parenting) contrast with the collective extreme event being experienced by societies all around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Scientists are considered one of the more resilient segments of the work force, in terms of maintaining employment, but in many countries have still been affected due to social distancing requirements that have closed or reduced office and laboratory use, curtailed travel for activities such as project work and conferences, and halted research voyages on ships and small boats, and field and laboratory work in general.The extremes of the spectrum of anticipated COVID-19-related impacts for scientists who have retained employment are ""this is going to be a productive period"" (e.g. Fleming, 2020) vs. ""this is going to be a very big disruption to productivity"" (e.g. Ling, 2020) . Anecdotal evidence of impacts on early career researchers (Pain, 2020) , parents (Staniscuaski et al., 2020; 500 Women Scientists, 2020) , and women (Minello, 2020; Vincent-Lamarre et al., 2020) suggests declines in productivity as a result of COVID-19 are likely (https://www.thelily.com/women-academics-seem-to-be-submittingfewer-papers-during-coronavirus-never-seen-anything-like-it-saysone-editor/; https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/21/ early-journal-submission-data-suggest-covid-19-tanking-womensresearch-productivity). Part-time volunteer editors may also have additional responsibilities that may affect manuscript handling times (https://publicationethics.org/news/letter-cope-chair-april-2020). Cessation of day care and school in many countries has required parents to increase caring responsibilities while also maintaining various levels of work-related activity (Staniscuaski et al., 2020) , which may have been intensified by an increase in the number of virtual meetings.For some researchers, time savings, and increased production of publications, might be a benefit of reduced travel. In one of our organizations, for example a group of 90 marine scientists went from spending >300 person days per month travelling for work to 0 days for the months of March-June 2020. Field work, including for research voyages, has also ceased in many locations. While some of this time could still be directed to completing the same work-related tasks remotely, this represents considerable potential savings in time previously spent travelling. Grant submission deadlines have been delayed in many countries and even cancelled, which might lead to an increased focus on the production of manuscripts and on undertaking review assignments.We evaluate potential COVID-19-related trends in researcher productivity in aquatic science during the first half of 2020. While productivity may take a range of forms, we use the evidence base available from one important area of activity that aquatic scientists undertake-submission of manuscripts to journals and review of manuscripts submitted to these journals-as a proxy for productivity.We test four null hypotheses to assess for changes in these proxies of productivity during the COVID-19 disruption period.(1) There is no change in the number of manuscripts being submitted.(2) There is no change in the geographic pattern of submissions, based on the country of the corresponding author.(3) There is no change in acceptance (or completion) rate for review requests.(4) There is no change in the time taken to complete reviews.While gender differences in scientific publication submissions have been posited (e.g. Vincent-Lamarre et al., 2020; Staniscuaski et al., 2020) , with the data collected by journals, and the form in which data were shared with us, it was unfortunately not possible to investigate this aspect.Two datasets were assembled to assess the productivity of aquatic scientists associated with publishing in peer-reviewed journals.The first dataset assembled information on article submission and reviewing rate provided by seven aquatic science journals. We selected journals that had been publishing papers for at least the last decade to have a sufficient reference period. The seven journals were Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, Fisheries Oceanography, Fisheries Research, ICES Journal of Marine Science, Limnology and Oceanography, Marine and Freshwater Research, and Marine Ecology Progress Series. Since the data provided by these journals and their publishers are confidential, they are presented in an anonymized manner. Changes in editorial software systems over time meant that some data were not consistently collected over the entire time period-when that was the case, those data were removed from analyses for that particular journal (e.g. time in review data was inconsistently archived). The second data set was derived from employee submission records for intended peer-reviewed articles from the national Australian science agency (CSIRO) and by a regional division of the United States National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA/ NMFS). Both these government organizations require employees to register all manuscripts prior to submission and, while not specific to any particular journal, these data can be used as another proxy for productivity.For each journal, we received data on the number of submissions per month and compared February-June 2020 with data from the same months in previous years (e.g. February-June 2009-2019) (Hypothesis 1). We first checked for trends over time that could confound detection of a COVID-19 effect. In the case of trends (e.g. increase or decrease in submissions over time), we calculated the expected number of submissions based on a linear trend for monthly data prior to 2020 and calculated the difference between the observed and expected values for each of the months February-June 2020. Where there was no trend over time, we subtracted the number of submissions for each 2020 month (February-June) from the average number of submissions in that month prior to 2020 (e.g. February 2020 À the average of February 2009-2019). Negative values indicate fewer than expected submissions, and vice versa.Country of origin for the corresponding author (most often the first author) for submissions was also provided (Hypothesis 2). We assume this was where the author resided. Geographic patterns in submissions were considered at a regional scale by allocating the corresponding author country to a region (North America, Europe, Australia/Pacific, Asia, Africa, and South America), as submissions for individual countries were too few to detect changes for the COVID-19 period. As there were trends over time for most region-journal combinations, we calculated the difference between the observed and expected numbers of submissions for each region in 2020 compared to the expected number based on the linear trend prior to 2020, as for Hypothesis 1.In seeking reviewers for a submitted paper, an editor will issue individual requests for each paper (P), which are accepted (A), declined, or ignored at some rate (%A). Sometime later (t2), a percentage of these accepted reviews are completed and returned (%C), and a decision (D) is then made some days later by an editor (t3).Data provided on this process differed by journal, depending on their record-keeping system and were variously based on the number or percentage of reviews accepted or completed (divided by the number of invitations issued), per paper, per month, or per year. We used only data on reviews accepted (A) or completed (C) for original submissions and not revised manuscripts, and hereafter use the general term ""review acceptance rate"" to describe this proxy. As annual data were provided by some journals, inclusion of January 2020, before most of the isolation measures were implemented around the world, is expected to reduce any COVID-19 effect. Individual or monthly data were aggregated to an annual review acceptance rate to facilitate comparisons by journal, where the year 2020 (i.e. January-June) was assumed to encompass the COVID-19 effect (Hypothesis 3). For two journals that provided monthly data, there were no differences between review acceptance rates for the period January-June in pre-2020 years, and the whole year. For each journal, we calculated the anomaly in review acceptances using the form of the data provided-either the review acceptances (%A) or completions (%C) data for 2020. Several journals also provided data on the ""time in review""-based on the time that the first (or all) reviewers took to complete (t2) their review(s) of a submission (Hypothesis 4). One journal also provided data on the time between an editor sending a review request and the acceptance by the reviewer [t1 in (1)]. Data on review acceptance rate and time in review were both inspected for temporal trends and, if necessary, detrended for each journal before calculating differences (anomalies) from expected values based on the trend.The CSIRO (Australia) requires employees (lead authors and junior authors for submissions not led by CSIRO authors) to register submissions to peer-reviewed journals. These data allow (i) a test of marine science manuscript submissions across a range of journals and (ii) a comparison of the relative productivity change in 450 marine scientists employed by CSIRO with the 4000 scientists employed across other research domains in CSIRO. As for Dataset 1, the number of submissions per month was determined for the Marine Division, and across all other divisions for the period 2015 to May 2020. Data were detrended if necessary and submissions for 2020 were compared to the period 2015-2019.Similarly, the NOAA/NMFS (USA) requires submissions to be approved by a senior manager. Annual data for the period January-May 2015-2020 were provided. The anomaly from the annual trend was calculated for each year, and then 2020 compared to the period 2015-2019.The submission dataset was based on 32 756 submissions to seven journals spanning the period January 2009-June 2020 ( Table 1) . Four of the submission time series were detrended (see Supplementary material). The number of submissions for the months of February-June 2020 was below expected numbers in February (five of seven journals) and March (four of seven) and above or equal to the expected numbers in April (six of seven), May (four of seven), and June (six of seven) (Figure 1) . Overall, only two journals experienced a decline (C: 6%, E: 129%) and five an increase (A: 13%, B: 11%, D: 9%, F: 2%, and G: 16%) in submissions over the COVID-19-affected months of 2020. A total of 68% of the possible 35 journal-month combinations (February-June 2020, 7 journals) had deviations above the expected number of submissions. Across all journals, we calculated that three more papers were submitted to these seven journals during these COVID-19-affected months than would have been expected based on the total observed submissions for the same period in other years, representing a 0.2% increase in submissions.There were fewer than expected submissions from North America (six of seven journals), Australia/Pacific (four of seven), and Asia (four of seven) during the February to June 2020 period ( Figure 2 ). The three other regions had more increases than decreases in submissions-Europe (four of seven journals), Africa Impact of COVID-19 on aquatic science community (four of seven), and South America (five of seven). Across all journals, there were 30 and 27 more submissions from Asia and Europe, respectively, while North America had 97 fewer submissions, than expected.The acceptance rate for undertaking reviews was lower in 2020 compared to the values prior to 2020 for three of six journals that provided these data, although rates were highly variable among journals ( Figure 3) . One of the journals had higher than usual acceptance rates (Journal F: þ16.7%) and one much lower (Journal A: -23.1%). Averaged across all six journals with these data, the review acceptance rate was only 1.8% lower for the COVID-19 period considered here.The average time manuscripts were in review could be calculated from data provided by five journals (Table 1) and is reported here annually, which was the most common time scale available ( Figure 4 ). All five of the journals experienced more rapid review times than expected, by between 4 (Journal G) and 7 days (Journal A). These absolute changes corresponded to between 4.6% and 21% faster than expected (Figure 4) . At an even finer temporal scale, Journal G provided data showing that the response time to accept an editors' review request (detrended) was faster by about half a day (0.67) for the 2020 period compared to the expected value of 3.08 days, a reduction of $21.7%. The worldwide disruption as a result of COVID-19 responses by national governments is unprecedented in the level of impact on society. Beginning in February 2020, measures imposed to slow the spread of the disease dramatically reduced domestic and international travel, shut workplaces and schools, and led to widespread job losses. This disruptive time has required a rethinking of values and work-private priorities at all levels of society (e.g. Corbera et al., 2020) and has been postulated to have an impact on scientific productivity (Ling, 2020; Myers et al., 2020) . We tested four hypotheses related to scientific productivity during the initial months of restrictions associated with COVID-19 (February-June 2020). Our analyses of aquatic scientist productivity were based on journal submissions and reviewing patterns, which are only one area of scientist productivity, but given the importance for career progression and funding success, an area that many scientists prioritize (e.g. Peoples et al., 2016) . It is also an activity that can be conducted even when travel or fieldwork is interrupted. Submission of manuscripts is a final stage in research, coming after a long series of steps, including grant submission, field, experimental or modelling research, and analysis and synthesis. Preparation of a manuscript may take weeks to months, and disruption in this final stage can often delay submission, resulting in fewer papers received by journals. If the shutdown period allowed scientists to instead focus on this final stage, we expected to see an increase in submission rates.Within this sample of seven journals, some had large declines in submissions and others had moderate increases. The variation among journals may reflect insufficient sample sizes, or differences between the researcher communities that submit to these journals. The monthly data showed that declines were greatest in the first months of the shutdown-February and March 2020, Figure 1 . Submission patterns per month in 2020 for seven major aquatic science journals, as a difference from the expected value (detrended linearly where there was an increase or decrease in submissions, as noted in Table 1) .with more typical rates from April onwards. This may reflect scientists settling into new routines. However, not all groups appear to be coping equally (e.g. Minello, 2020; Myers et al., 2020) . Overall, we observed no consistent decline and, therefore, cannot reject Hypothesis 1. This pattern varied by journal, which may also indicate differences in the scientific research areas that are most impacted (see Myers et al., 2020) . We contend that our sampled journals are representative of the science addressing freshwater, fisheries and marine ecosystem research questions, other marine science specialities such as physical oceanography are submitted to a different set of journals, and different patterns may be found for other research communities. We also cannot exclude the possibility that some scientists have been more productive and that this balanced the productivity decline in negatively impacted scientists. We note that we were unable to examine gender or other demographic differences (e.g. incountry restrictions, career stage, carer responsibilities, e.g. Myers et al., 2020) , as such information was not gathered by the journals included in this analysis. Such analyses may be attempted in future based on published articles for which ancillary information such as gender can be added via Internet searches.The geographic patterns in submission rate did not consistently show increases or decreases, which might be expected based on different applications of social isolation policies. Asia, which has had varied responses to COVID-19, showed a relative increase in submissions, as did Europe, where social distancing policies have been implemented less widely and/or commenced later in the year (June-July), while North America had an overall decrease. Thus, Hypothesis 2 cannot be rejected-at the scale we considered the patterns there was no consistent regional shift in submissions. The data for single-government institutions in Australia and the United States had larger decreases in productivity, close to 20%, and this is consistent with early responses to isolation and social distancing in the developed countries such as Australia and the United States. Australia's COVID-19 outbreak also followed severe societal disruption due to the worst bushfire season on record. It would be useful to examine submission rates from universities and other types of research agencies; however, such data are rarely gathered.The acceptance rate for reviews varied, with some journals showing relatively large declines, and others increases. Thus, Hypothesis 3 that COVID-19 would affect the willingness of scientists to review papers was not rejected. Interestingly, the time to review was quicker for all journals, thus rejecting Hypothesis 4. Scientists who did accept a request to provide a review were completing this task more quickly. This might be considered evidence for additional time allocated to reviewing, or fewer competing tasks. A single journal also provided data that showed the response to a request to review was received faster than in pre-COVID-19 years, indicating a greater willingness to review submissions by some scientists.Our results also provide comfort to editors-if more papers are going to be submitted during the COVID-19 months without an equivalent increase in reviewing, more pressure would be -25% -20% -15% -10% -5% 0% 5% Figure 3 .

""Total"" represents the total deviation in submissions in 2020 for each geographic region across all seven journals.Impact of COVID-19 on aquatic science community placed on the existing reviewing community. However, we found no decline in submission and only a small decline in reviewing rate. From the data analysed here, we cannot determine whether the individuals who reduced their reviewing load also reduced their submissions, or if those who increased their number of submissions also increased their reviewing rate. It is well known that reviewing activity is not spread evenly among researchers (https:// publons.com/blog/spread-of-peer-review-workload/) and COVID-19 may exacerbate this in future.As with many facets of life under COVID-19, the experience so far in 2020 has offered a chance to reflect on effort allocated to writing manuscripts and reviewing tasks that add to the excessive workload already carried by many scientists. While these analyses cannot reveal individual narratives-e.g. some scientists have had higher productivity and others lower-we have shown that the COVID-19 disruption has not dramatically reduced productivity by the aquatic science community as indicated by total manuscript submissions or review acceptance rates to seven journals, and from two large national research institutes, that we assume are representatives of the overall aquatic science community. In the coming years, it will be interesting to track the long-term impact on publishing and other forms of scientific productivity, particularly to quantify this disruption on the career progression for COVID-19-disadvantaged individuals and groups.Supplementary material is available at the ICESJMS online version of the manuscript. .

Not because I could not find words, but because the words I needed did not exist in the English I spoke, wrote, made with or through or by. As a former playwright, emerging academic and sometime essayist, I saw language as pliable matter and considered myself a wordsmith yet finding myself in need of a new lexicon for unprecedented times, I set forth to make one.One Webster Pack seven days three multis one vit C one turmeric caps one zinc caps extracted from foil-backed blister pack of 10 tabs labeled by hand with black Sharpie® PERMANENT MARKER-MARQUER PERMANENT-Chisel Tip Pointe Biseautee Punta Bisalada one pack ends say Wednesday as we used to know it next must be labeled with care TH, F, SA, SU, M, TU, W, TH, F, SA my pharmacopeia horological blister pack time piece dose of the day by day, day by day things I count clockwise anticlockwise clockwisdom anticlockwisdom intuitive it's all in the detail Moandays, Blursdays, Satalldays and every other daze one or even two pillules-is that a word, pillule, and why does it autocorrect to pillage-and how does it differ from a Circadin-MR 2mg prolonged release tablet containing melatonin from a box of 30 tablets Protect from light and Nil Repeats.I am your tawny malt, your caramel comfort, your medicinal snort at the end of a day. I am your tonic, your reward, the sandpaper on your sensitivities, buffing and blunting the splinters of over-stuffed, long, loud, hyper-stimulating meetings, this endless looking, curating yourself for virtual consumption. Soft on the tongue, and soothing to the throat, warming to the belly, and easeful on the nerves, I am a wee whiskey witch, a prelude to the descent, a clack of ice cubes in a glass, happy hour handbag, preamble to nightly news, your burnisher of day's ends.Woman One brings the blades to Woman Two's head and begins to shear her hair. A slow mo-mow. We see the clippers push against the hair and shave it from the head. The first signs of pale scalpture. 5 A lunar landscape. Woman One stops. Woman Two rubs her hand over her head. Woman One resumes the clip. Woman One circles Woman Two, north, south, east, west. Woman Two's smile grows broader and broader. Now shorn of all hair she casts off the garment and shakes her body like a wet dog. Hair suspended in air. Freeze frame.The now or neverness of things powered by the unfathomable enormity of it. The impossibility of pitching one's will, or stamping one's foot, or making any difference to anything. Not a yielding or an acceptance but a friction arising in that gap between what might be desperation and a kind of collapsed surrender. There's a bristling resistance, and it's that energy, if anything, that can move things. A refusal to buckle, yet with a tip o' the hat, a small obeisance, a nod to greater forces at work as one tries to find grace in the buffeting chaos of it all.You're asking me about nature today, just when I have started having a soft spot for machines. Nature, in the time of COVID, I envy you. I envy you, bird and you tree, you, kangaroo and you, my small brown dog starting your evening barkathon as the night comes down, or in, or over like a blanket. Your contempt for me, for us, never shown, you go on flying, landing, bending, shading, molting, breeding, barking.My iPhone. And that old-fashioned red lamp with the bendy-flexy stand, crimson shade. Is the fire box-wood heater-a machine or a beast that must be fed twigs and kindling and balls of newspaper and log after log in return for a steady generosity of warmth? The vacuum cleaner in that cupboard.

The nightly news anthem, and the play-in before Coronacast is about all that I can manage. Tolerate. Muster. Take your pick. In the words, though, there's my music. In the contortions and distortions of language and in the nightly spillage, the overflow, the allophony. Here I find pleasure and reason, in the mellifluousness of this sound beside that, this consonant beside that diphthong, the jar and the jolt of that plosive beside that anapaest. How much do I love each of these words, the way sound is arrayed in them and what has it to do with COVID, nothing, with pandemic, nothing, with climate change, nothing, with the new world disorder, nothing.If you listen you can hear the Sea of Chaos. You are just a shred of Flotsam or Jetsam-it matters not which-bobbing about in its immensity. It cares nothing for you. You are a mere bubble in the bubblesomeness of its foam, a mere speck in its phosphorescence, a mere smear on the surface of its slick and sheen. Be tossed. Try to enjoy it. Life is short and you are a grain of salt in the salad dressing and nothing more. It's still now. The sun is low. There is a dance in progress between loss and joy, joy and loss. They break the water's surface and glisten a moment, above, like flying fish.A new mask, this prototype adds oxygen, it appears, making for a cleaner breathing experience and knowing one day I may be able to afford better quality air than you can, it all seems so wrong.

You no longer understand what any of this means, and when you do sleep, your dream districts are all red light and you stagger from nightmare to reverie, with a drink in your hand, in an unwashed gown. You love these words now, how they slump on each others' shoulders, and you just want to leave tiny stains and traces on things with inky hands before you cast yourself into tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.Men. White men. Old White men. The future is only visible if they are somehow persuaded to loosen their grip on the world. Yesterday, on a bench outside the church was a tomato sauce-stained chip box, and on the ground plastic forks and serviettes and empty bottles of a premixed bourbon drink. Note the performance of not-caring this diorama portrays. A mise-en-scène in the remains of a snack stop by men who have enacted for the benefit of one another their contempt for care. Who have performed their scorn for the softness of care for each other, for earth, land, country. Is this what care-free means and if so how can we slice through this thick-skinnedness and make it pulpy enough to allow feeling to course where it has been locked inside muscle and meat?The sunset is yours too. The stars. The cold air. The dirt, the mulch, the leaf litter, the moss, the marvelous moss. I love you moss. Is nature queer? Let's say so.

My verbal emissions. My neologologic.Unable to pick up a pen and put it to paper I attempt to catch it here, the music of lock down. First, in birdsong. Where I have been living it is birdsong that announces the day, punctuates the day, declares the day over. Birds are the town criers of Anglesea, and as I write that sentence I wonder if anyone ever had cause to write those words, in that order before, or will again.There is something so compelling here, lodged in the utter impossibility of using mere words to speak to this. I want to write: ib uyg nd kin kjhuvhmn nuhuenvciurjni evniovej. I want to write xkjck c8weuyb wee;owe;qoweuybvo. I want to speak plant and dog and cloud and rain and rainbow. I want to speak bird, and not this bird but that bird. I want to speak Border Terrier, with a wee Scot's brogue, so I can commune with my dog, and I want to speak lamppost. I want to speak daphne and seedpod. I want to speak peppercorn tree and grevillea. I want to speak grass.Loretta and I went for three walks today. It was icy, first up. Decaying leaves were slippery under my feet and there was possum scat and Loretta tried to eat it. I ate all the wrong things too for breakfast. Tropical fruits. And bagels. Where do I think I am? Outside, the peppercorn trees loom larger than all others. The torsions and extensions of their balletomane bodies, the elevation. These are trees with tone and heft. I cannot hear them speak, much as I want to. But I smell them. I see them brush their leaves against the bluestone in a murmuration and admire them deeply, in their humility and grace. Respect.Second walk is around the block. Decaying ginkgo leaves, their stinking fruit. Odd succulents around trees, where humans have decided to green their patch of street, now greening is a verb. Third walk, longer, but by now, my receptors are blunted by a long work day on a day one does not usually work. How to hear into? How to listen through?The dramaturgy of the quotidian prepositional, the deep soundings of the animate, the pulse of life and liveness, living and lithe. The compositional complicity of subject-world is, for me, the first question of autoethnography. It is a way of calling up the textures and densities of worlds of all kinds formed out of this and that-identities, situations, scenes, sensory conditions, bodies, meanings, weights, rhythms, absence. A way of sidling up to the interesting or unbearable atmospheres and events of those worlds. A hinge onto a moment of some world's legibility. (Stewart, 2013, p. 667) In March 2020, I began publishing a neologism a day at a personal blogsite called Mmmmy Corona. When the Massive_Microscopic_Sensemaking Project (hereafter MMSP) 24 began I found new apertures through which to splice the micro-w/rites of my be-musings onto a communal canvas. As Ross Gibson writes, After all, it is from these quotidian montages that epiphanies sometimes spark. And through these tiny fissures in commonsense, so long as you can believe that a logic other than chance or chaos subtends them, you might eventually register some gleams of new understanding about the forces that jostle people and nature in space throughout time. (Gibson, 2015, p. 34) My epiphany of 2020 is that if there are any throughlines to COVID-19, they lie within narratives of capriciousness. This word denotes both sudden unaccountable changes of behavior or mood or else changes arising, unpredictably, according to no discernible rules. To reflect this dynamism, I adopt capriciously queerelous methods, reducing 10,000 words generated in reply to 21 prompts of the MMSP into 21 textracts, under 21 25 neologisms, chosen and distributed at random 26 as sub-headings. The resultant essamblage, 27 with its virulent twin-engines, merges genre-bending notions of the essayistic (Singer & Walker, 2013) with ideas of bricolage as made through working with what lies at hand. 28 In so doing, it illustrates how rhetorical instruments may be used to disrupt and order, clarify and subvert (Murray, 2017, p. 254) .To underwrite some of the disorientations and precarities of this cultural moment, I also pay homomage 29 to controversial rhetorical theorist, the late Mary Daly, whose cunnilinguistic texts were formative for many feminists of my generation. I remain influenced, as other queer rhetoricians are, by how Daly ""worked with and in and through [words] ; the way she talked about their power, or rather a woman's/ womyn's power and ability to challenge the patriarchy through the conscious manipulation and transformation of them"" (Hawkins, 2018, p. 191) . Such trans-for-motions, I find, embolden me to work the hyphens, as Michelle Fine would say (Fine, 1994) moving through them toward a beyond where I find myself making a MIQAE, 30 a new method for queering autoethnography, that is, I propose, a fitting response to ""the erasures and violences that punctuate our everyday"" (Holman Jones & Harris, 2019, p. 119).Making a MIQAE deploys ideas from creative writing scholarship such as prepositional thinking whereby ""[t]he rub between edges, the crossing of thresholds, insides and outsides, outsides with insides . . . creates new neural pathways, allows for slantness, oblique and not so oblique resistances, push-through, and importantly, processual thinking"" (Rendle-Short, 2020, p. 7), alongside material practices that perform ""the poetics of the disjunctive and the awkward combinations of fitting and not fitting . . ."" (Walker, 2014, p. 217) . For if ""queerness, like activism, is a way of being, a mode, perspective, an enactment of citizenship and a notyet"" (Holman Jones & Harris, 2019, p. 65), then qae (queerelous autoethnographic essamblage) is a form of becoming, anti-literary, proprioperformative, and prepositionally promiscuous such that ""that which is lodged alongside, between and around, and under the words you read here, is where its meaning resides"" (Murray, 2017, p. 279) .I offer this riotous essamblage as one more qae to that other door held resolutely ajar by Holman Jones and Harris (2019), having been prised open by queer and feminist thinkers before them, when they exhort those of us who would explore the complexities of critical sense-making to commit to ""an evolution in which the story as enactment becomes something more than a recording of past events"" (p. 64.) It performs my commitment to w/rites of ""meaningful irreverence"" that give shape to my grapplings inside The Great Pause. At the same time, it illustrates potencies of artful creative practice to expose meanings inside the mayhem, rage, fear, and uncertainty of the pandemic and beyond into the massive and long-awaited sociopolitical shockwaves that now ensue.The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7078-0952 Notes 1.

For instance using these 48 techniques Buhl and colleagues have found the critical density for the onset of collective 49 movement [23] , the interaction range of locusts (13.5cm) , and the way that hopper band 50 directional changes are affected by locust density [17] . One downside of SPP models is 51 that there are few analytical tools available to study their behaviour. In contrast, 52 continuum models can be analysed using an array of tools from the theory of partial giving a representation of the average behaviour of the group. The latter (continuum) 56 approach is adopted in this paper.The non-local aggregation equation, first proposed by Mogilner and 58 Edelstein-Keshet [25] , is a common continuum PDE analogue of SPP models [26, 27] . It 59 based a conservative mass system of the form 60 ∂ρ ∂twhere Q is defined as some social interaction potential, ρ is the density of species in 61 question, and is the convolution operation. For this type of model the existence and 62 stability of swarms has been proven [25] , and both travelling wave solutions [25] and 63 analytic expressions for the steady states [28] have been found. This model has been 64 further extended to include non-linear local repulsion which leads to compact and 65 bounded solutions [29] . While usually used for single populations, the model has been 66 further adapted to consider multiple interacting species [30] . 67 In a 2012 paper, Topaz et. al. [31] used a multispecies aggregation equation to model 68 locusts as two distinct behavioural sub-populations, solitarious and gregarious. By 69 considering the locust-locust interactions and the transition between the two states, 70 they were able to deduce both the critical density ratio of gregarious locusts that would 71 cause a hopper band to occur and visualised the rapid transition once this density ratio 72 had been reached [31] . For simplicity the model focused on inter-locust interactions and 73 ignored interactions between locusts and the environment. While there exists some 74 continuum models of locust food interactions to investigate the effect of food on peak 75 locust density [32] or to consider hopper band movement [33] , we are not aware of any 76 studies that consider locust-locust and locust-food interactions as well as gregarisation 77 in a continuum setting. local density defined as ρ(x, t) = s(x, t) + g(x, t). For later convenience we will also 98 define the local gregarious mass fraction asand the global gregarious mass fraction asIt is possible to write s and g in terms of Eq (5) asWe assume that the time-scale of gregarisation is shorter than the life cycle of locusts, ignoring births and deaths and thus conserving the total number of locusts. We also allow for a transition from solitarious to gregarious and vice-versa depending on the September 16, 2020 6/32 local population density. Hence, conservation laws give equations of the form ∂g ∂t + ∇ · (J g local + J g non-local ) = K(s, g), (3a)where J (s,g) local is the flux due to local interactions, J (s,g) non-local is the flux due to 102 non-local interactions, and K(s, g) represents the transition between the solitarious and 103 gregarious states.In addition to locusts we include food resources, let c(x, t) denote the food density 105 (mass of edible material per unit area). We assume that locust food consumption 106 follows the law of mass action and on the time-scale of hopper band formation food 107 production is negligible, givingwhere κ is the locust's food consumption rate.Finally, for later convenience we will also define the local gregarious mass fraction as 110and the global gregarious mass fraction asIt is possible to write s and g in terms of Eq (5) asLocal interactions. We now turn to specifying the local interaction terms in Eq (3a) 113and Eq (3a). These are captured by taking the continuum limit of a lattice model, we 114 do this by following the work of Painter and Sherratt [34] . We begin by considering 115 solitarious locust movement on a one-dimensional lattice (we assume that local 116 gregarious locust behaviour is the same resulting in a similar derivation). Let s t i be the 117 September 16, 2020 7/32 number of solitarious locusts at site i at time t, and let g t i ,ρ t i , and c t i be similarly defined. 118 We assume that the transition rate for a locust at the i th site depends on the food 119 density at that site, and the relative population density between the current site and 120 neighbouring sites. If we let T ± i be the rate at which locusts at site i move to the right, 121 +, and left, −, during a timestep, then our transition probabilities arewhere F is a function of food density, τ is a function related to the local locust density, 123and α and β represent probabilities of movement. If nutrients are abundant at the 124 current site, then we assume locusts are less likely to move to a neighbouring site, which 125implies F is a decreasing function. We set,where c 0 is related to how long a locust remains stationary while feeding. We further 127 assume that as the locust population density rises at neighbouring sites relative to the 128 population density of the current site, the probability of moving to those sites decreases 129proportional to the number of collisions between individuals that would occur. Using Thus, our transition probabilities areThen the number of individuals in cell i at time t + ∆t is given byFrom this, we can derive the continuum limit for both solitarious and gregarious locust September 16, 2020 8/32 densities, and find our local flux aswhere D and γ are continuum constants related to α and β respectively. In higher dimensions, the expressions for fluxes are:Non-local interactions. For our non-local interactions we adopt the fluxes used by Topaz et. al. [31] . By considering each locust subpopulation, solitarious and gregarious, as having different social potentials, we obtain the following expressions for the non-local fluxWe also adopt the functional forms if the social potentials used by Topaz et. al. [31] , as 134 they are used extensively in modelling collective behaviour and are well studied [28] .They are based on the assumption that solitarious locusts have a long range repulsive 136 social potential and gregarious locusts have a long range attractive and a shorter range 137 repulsive social potential. The social potentials are given by,where, R s and r s are the solitarious repulsion strength and sensing distance respectively. 139Similarly, R g and r g are the gregarious repulsion strength and sensing distance. Finally 140 A g and a g are the gregarious attraction strength and sensing distance.Gregarisation dynamics. For the rates at which locusts become gregarious (or 142 solitarious) we again follow the work of Topaz et. al. [31] . We assume that solitarious locusts transition to gregarious is a function of the local locust density (and vice versa). 144This gives our equations for kinetics as,where, f 1 (ρ) and f 2 (ρ) are positive functions representing density dependant transition rates. To make our results more directly comparable we again use the same functional forms as Topaz et. al. [31] ,where δ 1,2 are maximal phase transition rates and k 1,2 are the locust densities at which 146 half this maximal transition rate occurs.A system of equations for locust gregarisation including food interactions.By substituting our flux expressions, (8a) through to (9b), and kinetics term (10), into our conservation equations, (3a) and (3b), and rearranging the equation into a advection diffusion system, we obtain the following system of equationsThen dropping the bar notation the dimensionless governing equations areNote that we have introduced the following dimensionless parameters,For notational simplicity we drop the · * notation in the rest of the paper. . Finally, while the support of g is 169 infinite (due to the linear diffusion) the bulk of the mass is contained as a series of 170 aggregations, we will approximate the support of a single aggregation as Ω. Using these 171 assumptions we can rewrite Eq (13a) as a gradient flow of the form,with the minimisers satisfyingNext, we follow the work of [29, 32, 35] and with a series of simplifying assumptions we 175 consider both the large and small mass limit in turn. First, define the mass of locusts as 176To find the large mass limit, we begin with Eq (14) and assume that g(x) is 177 approximately rectangular and for a single aggregation that the support is far larger with support,The accuracy of this approximation is illustrated by The max value and support are labelled ||g|| ∞ and Ω respectively. For both the simulation and calculations D = 0.01, γ = 60, R g = 0.25, r g = 0.5, A g = 1, and c = 0 and 1. As the mass M is increased the gregarious locust shape g becomes increasingly rectangular as the maximum locust density does not depend on the total mass. In addition as the amount of food is increased from c = 0 on the left to c = 1 on the right, the maximum density for the gregarious locusts increases.For the small mass limit, we begin with Eq (14) and approximate the social 188 interaction potential using a Taylor expansion, e −|x| rIn addition, we ignore the effect of linear diffusion 190 within Ω. These assumptions give Eq (14) asFollowing [32] , gives an estimate of the maximum gregarious locust density, ||g|| ∞ , aswith support,where B is the β-function (for definition see [36] , page 207).The results of these approximations can be seen in Fig 2. While these 195 approximations are less accurate than those of the large mass limit, they illustrate that 196 as the amount of food increases so too does the maximum hopper band density.However this effect is less pronounced than in the large mass limit. It also demonstrates 198 how the maximum hopper band density and support both increase with an increase in 199 locust mass. in terms of the global gregarious mass fraction Eq (6) and the total density aswhereQ s andQ g are the Fourier transform of Q s and Q g respectively.From this, it can be seen that asρ increases the gregarious fraction required for 214 hopper band formation increases suggesting an upper locust density for hopper band amount of available food increases.For our specific functions Q g = R g e − |x| rg − A g e −|x| and Q s = R s e − |x| rs , taking the one 218 dimensional Fourier transforms of Q s and Q g using the following definition,gives the following relationship,From this we can find the maximum homogenous density,ρ, that locust aggregations 221 can still form. So taking Eq (21) and substitutingφ g = 1 we can solve forρ as,where ||g|| ∞ is maximum density for the large mass limit given by Eq (15) .Finally, we calculate if it is possible for a particular homogeneous density of locusts to become unstable (and thus form a hopper band). By calculating the homogeneous steady state gregarious mass fraction as,then by combining with (21) we obtain an implicit condition for hopper band formation 224In Eq (22), if the values on the left are not greater than those on the right then it is not 226 possible for a great enough fraction of locusts to become gregarious and for instabilities 227 to occur. As the value of the right hand side decreases as the amount of food increases, 228we can deduce that the presence of food lowers the required density for hopper band 229 formation.Time until hopper band formation with homogeneous locust densities. We 231 also estimate time until hopper band formation with homogeneous locust densities and 232 September 16, 2020 16/32 a constant c. By assuming that s and g are homogeneous we can ignore the spatial 233 components of Eq (12a) and Eq (12b). We again denote the combined homogeneous 234 locust density asρ however nowρ = s(t) + g(t). Finally, assuming that g(0) = 0, we 235 find the homogeneous density of gregarious locusts as a function of time is given byWhich we then solve for t * such that g(t * ) =φ gρ , whereφ g is given by Eq (20) . Thisgives an estimation for time of hopper band formation (i.e. the time required for the 238 homogeneous densities to become unstable) as,Thus, as increasing food decreases the gregarious mass fraction required for hopper band 240formation it follows that it also decreases the time required for hopper band formation. 241Center of mass. Another property of the model is how the center of mass for the 242 locusts behaves. For a single population with diffusive terms it has been shown that the 243 center of mass does not move [29] . Using a similar method we look at how the total mass fraction (see Eq (5)), which givesWe now consider the behaviour of the center of mass. For notational simplicity we let Then the position of the center of mass, C, of ρ, is given byThe motion of the center of mass is then given by,where Eq (25) is obtained using integration by parts and our boundary conditions.Then, considering the diffusion terms in Eq (25), we get − D * ∇ρ, 1 − γD * ρ 2 ∇ρ, 1 = − D * ∇ρ, 1 − γD * 3 ∇ρ 3 , 1 , = 0, by our boundary conditions and integration by parts. This givesThen using integration by parts and our boundary conditions on Eq (26), we obtainsymmetric, we find and alternate expression for Eq (26) asSumming Eq (27) and Eq (28) , and dividing by 2M we find for time, a full detailed derivation can be found in S2 Appendix.Parameter selection and initial conditions. The bulk of the parameters, 269 R s , r s , R g , r g , A g , k, and δ, have been adapted from [31] to our non-dimensionalised 270 system of equations. We explore two parameter sets that we will term symmetric and solitarization. This is the default parameter set from Topaz et. al. [31] with an adjusted 275 k 1 term that is calculated using Eq (22) and the upper range for the onset of collective 276 behaviour as ≈ 65 locusts/m 2 [31, 38] . This behaviour is characteristic of the Desert 277 locust (Schistocerca gregaria) [10] .magnitude longer than gregarisation, and the density of locusts for half the maximal 280 transition rate is lower for solitarization. This is the alternative set from Topaz et. 281 al. [31] . The Australia plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera) potentially follows this 282 behaviour taking as little as 6 hours to gregarise but up to 72 hours to solitarise [37, 39] . 283The complete selection of parameters can be seen in Table 1 . At the densities we are investigating we will assume that the majority of movement 285 will be due to locust-locust interactions rather than random motion, so we set our s(x, 0) = ρ amb 16.6 (16.6 + µ) and g(x, 0) = 0, (29) where ρ amb is a ambient locust density and µ is some normally distributed noise, 302 µ ∼ N (0, 1). To ensure that simulations were comparable, we set-up three locust initial 303 condition and rescaled them for each given ambient locust density. Finally, the initial 304 condition for food is given by a smoothed step function of the form,with α = 7, x 0 = L/2, F M being the food mass and ζ being the initial food footprint. 306 We will also introduce ω = 100ζ/L which expresses the food footprint as a percentage of 307 the domain.The effect of food on hopper band formation. To investigate the effect that two food masses were tested, F M = 1.5 and 3. As a control we also performed 315 simulations with both no food present and a homogeneous food source, represented by 316 ω = 0 and ω = 100 respectively, for each ambient locust density. 317 We varied the ambient locust density ranging from ρ amb = 0.8 to ρ amb = 1.4 for the 318 symmetric parameters. This range was selected based on Eq (22) so that in the absence 319 of food hopper band formation would not occur. We also ran three simulations for each 320 combination of ρ amb , ω, and F M with varied initial noise and took the maximum peak 321 density across the three simulations, as we found in certain cases the initial noise had an 322 effect on whether a hopper band would form.For the asymmetric variables we varied ρ amb from ρ amb = 0.3 to ρ amb = 0.55, to test 324 the effect food had on the time frame of hopper band formation. From Eq (22) there Eq (23) this will only occur outside or right at the end of our simulated time frame. We 327 ran a single simulations for each combination of ρ amb , ω, and F M .The results for the symmetric parameter experiments are displayed in Fig 4. The 329 plots show the final peak gregarious density for the varying food footprint sizes and 330 ambient locust densities. In the blue regions there was no hopper band formation and in 331 the green regions there was successful hopper band formation. It can be seen in the 332 plots that as the food mass is increased the minimum required locust density for hopper 333 band formation decreases. This effect is more pronounced within an optimal food width 334and this optimal width increases as as the amount of food increases. By looking at the instantaneous relative advantage vs the global gregarious mass 358 fraction prior to hopper band formation in Fig 7, with this effect being more pronounced at some optimal food width.Analytical investigations of our model shows that a spatially uniform food source has 376 a variety of effects has on locust behaviour. Firstly, by considering a purely gregarious 377 population we found that the maximum locust density is affected by the amount of food 378 present, in that increasing food leads to increased maximum density. Then, by 379 performing a linear stability analysis we found the gregarious mass fraction required for 380 hopper band formation depends on both the ambient locust density and the amount of 381 food present, with increasing food decreasing the required gregarious mass fraction.Using this relationship we then found that our model also has a theoretical maximum While it has been shown that highly clumped food sources lead to a greater 390 likelihood of gregarisation [20] , using numerical simulations we have shown that there 391 exists an optimal width for these food clumps for hopper band formation. This effect 392 was shown to lower the required density for hopper band formation via the symmetric 393 parameters and the required time via the asymmetric parameters. This optimal width is 394 dependent on the amount of food present relative to the locust population. This effect 395appears to be brought about by the depletion of the food source, if the food source is 396 not sufficiently depleted, then a gregarious hopper band will fail to form because a 397 portion of the gregarious population will remain on the food.In 1957 Ellis and Ashall [41] found that dense but patchy vegetation promoted the 399 aggregation of hoppers and that sparse uniform plant cover promoted their dispersal.found that as the gregarious mass fraction increases so too does the foraging advantage 402 of being gregarious. This effect is increased by the mass of food present but is increasingly easy to quantify during field surveys, and aerial surveys including drones 418 and satellite imagery [21, 37] . Future research should focus on developing decision 419 support systems integrating predictive gregarisation models and GIS data from surveys. 420","Australia","first author","2020-09-21",9

A number of countries have faced a shortage of ventilators for COVID-19 patients due to pre-pandemic deficiency. There has been demand for additional care sites and health care to handle a surge in patients. Reported hospitalisation rates are age related, ranging from 0-1% (in people aged 29 years or younger) to 80% (in people aged 80+ years) [2] . Of hospitalised patients, 4.6 to 45.9% have required treatment in the ICU [2] [3] [4] . Of all those requiring critical care, 75%, 76% and 88% ended up receiving treatment on a ventilator in the UK, the USA and Italy respectively [5] [6] [7] . The length of stay in ICU for COVID-19 patients on ventilators has been longer than in non-crisis periods (median 10 days IQR between 8-14 days in Italy) [7] and median 18 days IQR 9-28 in USA) [8] . Over a quarter (26 to 38%) of those admitted to ICU have died [3, 6, 7] , and overall, people older than 75 years have experienced the highest COVID-19 mortality rates (from 33.5% in UK, to 75.5% in France) [8, 9] .ICUs have some capacity to respond to increased demand by surging ICU beds, repurposing hospital spaces, purchasing additional ventilators and hiring and/or training the health workers needed to care for critically ill patients. However, with rapidly increasing and sustained demand such measures might be insufficient, and the need for resources may rapidly exceed capacity. In this situation, healthcare systems need to have evidence-based, equitable, and publicly defensible policies in place on how to ration potentially life-saving treatments [10, 11] . Rules to guide allocation of life sustaining treatments will need to incorporate ethical considerations such as social justice, non-prejudice, prevention of preferential treatment of population subgroups, and be transparent to clinicians and the public to prevent moral distress and outrage.While many health services have ICU admission policies in place for routine care, a recent survey of US services found vast heterogeneity in ventilator triage policies for COVID19.Policies were based (exclusively or in combination) on subjective perceptions of benefits to patients and medical need, ethical considerations, and objective clinical scoring systems [12] .A common gap in these recommendations is the lack of integration of patient values and treatment preferences [13] .We conducted a scoping review of publications that provide prognostic prediction tools or models, and/ or objective triage recommendations which can inform allocation of ICU beds and/or ventilators. The specific objectives were:1. To identify criteria for ICU admission and ventilator allocation used in epidemic situations as well as during routine care 2. To identify prognostic tools used in patient care during and outside epidemic situations that can potentially enhance confidence in decision-making about resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3. To discuss applicability of these tools for ICU triage in future global emergenciesFor this scoping review, we searched the databases Medline and Embase on 1 st May 2020 for English language articles published since 1 st January 2002 (the year in which a SARS outbreak emerged) [14] . Additionally, we manually searched institutional websites of professional intensive care societies, reference lists of systematic reviews, pandemic guidelines from World Health Organization and Centre for Disease Control, and consulted Fourteen of the pandemic-related articles and 8 of the routine care papers included factors that applied to patients with pneumonia. Other conditions to which risk prediction tools/factors were applied included influenza, sepsis, acute injuries due to natural disasters in adults and children, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and heart failure. Most of the pandemic-related publications suggested criteria for ICU admission, ICU discharge or ventilator allocation, although not all addressed all three questions.A summary of references for recommendations to consider in the decision to escalate care, admit individuals to ICU, and allocate ventilators is presented in Table 1 . One domain for decision making included variables and scores to determine patients' need for higher-level care (column A) to patients who may not yet be in ICU, ventilated or receiving other organ support but may do so later (Table 1 , column A). Another domain for decision-making included predictors for patients who stand to benefit from ICU care or mechanical ventilation the most and should be prioritised (Table 1 , column B).The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and its variants was the most widely used (or reported) for both ICU admission and discharge criteria, as well as to recommend ventilator allocation or removal.Patients who stand to benefit the most from ICU admission typically suffer from a critically severe, treatable and potentially reversible deterioration of health. ICU treatment should also be consistent with the values and preferences of the patient [13, 74] . When patients' are deteriorating despite ongoing ICU care, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies, and transfer to ward and palliative care has to be considered. This process is known as 'reverse triage' [75] and variables to facilitate these decisions are listed in Table 1 , column C. Withholding or withdrawing treatments must include discussions with the patient (if possible) and their family. Ideally during pandemic triage the possibility of future deterioration and need to discharge from ICU later should already be discussed on admission to ICU.Multiple studies investigated predictors for mortality in the ensuing weeks and months after ED or ICU admission to inform decision-making, mostly in non-pandemic situations ( Table   1 , columns D and E). These prediction models can assist clinicians and patients in the decision-making about the appropriateness of ICU care by providing information about the expected recovery (or likely downward trajectory) following ICU admission and/or ventilator treatment [39, 76, 77] .Amongst the sixteen pandemic-related publications, several expert consensus documents outlined factors that inform the allocation of ICU care and ventilator treatment ( Table 2 ).The usual criteria for requiring critical care interventions applied such as refractory hypoxaemia, respiratory acidosis, evidence of impending respiratory failure, shock, requiring, vasopressor or inotropic support, decreased urinary output, evidence of organ failure, and altered level of consciousness.The SOFA, qSOFA, and mSOFA score cut-offs were used to either determine priority for ICU or ventilator access or removal from a ventilator and/or discharge from ICU in futile situations. Likewise, the AGILITIES score and Simple Triage Scoring (STSS) for adults, the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD) triage score, the COVID-19 clinical risk score, and the Community Assessment Tools (CATs) criteria for adults and children were used to prioritise ICU admission or recommend ICU discharge due to a lack of benefit.Age was a variable in six of the 15 predictive approaches for pandemic situations [8, 18, 19, 25, 27, 78] . Two studies outlined criteria for patients who do not require organ support or ICU because they are below the critical illness threshold [11, 23] .[21] [3, 20, 23, [27] [28] [29] 81 ] [10, 22, 28, 39, 47, 81 ] [8, 27] [73,77] SCORES / INDICES SOFA/qSOFA/mSOFA [21, 49] [3,11,15,17,18,23] [11,15,17,21-24] [17,22,24,51] [29]ICU scoring: APACHE II, PIM2, PELOD, ProVent14, SAPS II, SMART-COP, SI, STSS, SMS-ICU [21, 37, 40, 47, 56, 58] [ 10, 36, 45, 46] [39, 45, 46] [30, [33] [34] [35] [36] 38, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] 47, 56, 58, 62, 82] [ 31, 40, 41, 58] Other routine scores: ALT, EWS, CURB65, CriSTAL, HOTEL, IDSA/ATS, mBTS, MPM, NIVO, REMS, SCAP, SCS, TIMM, WPS [37, 47, 54, 56, 58, 59, 62] [47] [53,55,57,71,72] [37,50,53,54,58,60,61, 65,69,71] • Patients with initial SOFA<11 who showed improvement (SOFA decreases) at 48 and 120-hour, and those with initial SOFA <8 with little (<3 points decrease) or no improvement in the previous 72 hours [20] • SOFA score <7 or single organ failure [23, 28] • Other more stringent criteria were SOFA <6, age 12-40 years, and absence of life limiting conditions.[18] • Hypoxaemia (SpO2 <90%) or impending respiratory failure [11, 20] or SpO2 <92% with increased respiratory rate/exhaustion[26] • Clinical evidence of shock (Systolic Blood Pressure < 90mmHg) [11, 20] Intermediate priority for ICU or ventilator• Patients with SOFA score 6-9, age 41-60 and minor comorbidities with small impact on long-term survival.

The majority of these prognostic indicators were derived from large patient population studies and predicted in-hospital or post-discharge mortality. Only four indicators were based on expert consensus, of which three [29, 49, 51] used SOFA or qSOFA for predicting outcomes, while a ward-based rule to predict mortality used the CURB65 score [69] . The tools applied predominantly to adult patients in routine ICU care (18 studies) or patients being assessed in emergency departments (21 studies), with only a few (5 studies) used in routine ward care.Unlike pandemic tools, which focus on acute organ failure, many routine care decisionmaking algorithms rely more on patient history of chronic illness [34, 38, 41, 46, 52, 60, 61, 65, 66, 68] , admission type (emergency, medical, elective surgery, non-trauma) [30, 31, 35, 38, 39, 41, 65] , and age [38, 39, 46, 54, 57, 59, 60, 62, 65, 68, 70, 71] .ICU-based algorithms relied predominantly on laboratory variables or acute treatments such as those for sepsis or respiratory failure [35, 37, 39, [41] [42] [43] 46] and two relied solely on a single biomarker cut-off: Secretoneurin [44] and Procalcitonin respectively [45] . Five of the 18 articles on routine care included algorithms to predict clinical deterioration with a need for ICU admission [36, 37, 40, 46, 49] . Only one article included a tool to predict the need for vasopressor treatment and respiratory support [37] . Two articles provided information on patients who are unlikely to benefit from (ongoing) ICU treatment [39, 46] .Emergency department decision-making algorithms combined laboratory tests and clinical history or examination: Severe community acquired pneumonia score (SCAP), Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society IDSA/ATS), the Shock Index (SI), Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score, Simple Clinical Score (SCS), Emergency Severity Index (ESI), Triage Information Mortality model (TIMM), and Criteria for screening and triaging to appropriate alternative care (CriSTAL). Two studies predicted in-patient mortality based only on frailty syndrome [52, 68] , and six studies based mortality predictions purely on laboratory test results [48, 50, 63, 64, 66, 67 ].Six of the 21 studies among patients in the emergency department predicted the need for potential transfer to ICU based on clinical and laboratory variables [54, 56, 58, 61, 62, 66] . The other studies predicted mortality at different time points. One study focused on decisionmaking about ICU admission in patients on chronic dialysis [67] . Two studies provided recommended a score cut-off for referral to palliative care [61, 65] .A simplified example of triage recommendations for pandemic times based on predicted prognosis is illustrated in Figure 2 . The parameters and accompanying cut-off points are extracted from the comprehensive factors used in both pandemic and routine care shown in Supplement 2. Elements from this catalogue of triage criteria could be used to design locally relevant triage tools.The concept of a waiting list may not apply under normal circumstances, but in overwhelmed health systems, people with characteristics in group 4 may have to be managed on the ward until an ICU bed becomes available and no patient with a higher priority profile is competing for an ICU bed.Patients who are deemed to be beyond salvageable -group 5 with the poorest prognosisusually have already experienced a catastrophic event like a cardiac arrest and/or are unconscious and/or are refractory to vasopressors and/or need or have been on mechanical ventilation for 14+ days and/or have documented advanced chronic illness/frailty/age. The general recommendation is not to use scarce resources on these patients during a public health crisis. Importantly, no decision should be based on single parameters or undesirable individual characteristics.A number of publications identified in this scoping review explored social, ethical, and political considerations when making decisions about patients' access to ICU and ventilator treatment ( Table 3) . Key principles included institutional and public transparency about the decision-making process, consultation with interdisciplinary groups, and establishing local partnerships for implementation of decision-making processes in a local context. Studies varied in their approach to including patients' illness severity scores in the decision-making process, with some supporting their inclusion due to objectivity and validity for patient groups [11, 18] , and others recommending against their use in isolation to predict individual patient outcomes [80] .Guidelines warned against making judgments about the worth of individuals, and unintentionally discriminating population subgroups such as the elderly or obese, or people with certain conditions as well as specific ethnic groups or people in non-health occupations.This scoping review identified key principles of decision-making about allocation of intensive care beds and ventilator treatment during pandemics including the need for a local expert committee of decision-makers, use of best available objective clinical criteria, careful steering from unintentional discrimination of vulnerable groups, consistent application of rules, transparency, and ethical justification of service limitations. Our review identified a range of tools to support the decision-making process and outlined their characteristics (62 publications on guidelines, frameworks, algorithms, laboratory parameters and predictive tools).In addition, we systematically collated scores and algorithms that can be used for triage decision-making in routine care (in non-pandemic situations) in the emergency department, on the wards, or in the ICU. Some of the identified tools were derived from influenza pandemics and non-respiratory disease public health emergencies, yet they can be extrapolated to other public health emergencies including COVID-19.It is generally accepted that triage protocols should only be activated when resource scarcity is imminent [21, 46] ; be locally relevant through a committee of expert decision-makers; make best use of relevant objective criteria; be carefully steered from unintentionally discriminating vulnerable groups; consistently apply agreed rules; and be publicly transparent and ethically justifiable. ICU admission criteria vary from country to country [89] and can change overtime as technology advances, but generally rely on expert assessment of the patient's illness severity, the health system culture, resources, patient preference, and ethical considerations. Admission is considered appropriate from the medical perspective, for those who are likely to require mechanical ventilation, or support for single or multiple organ failure [89] . However, when resources are overwhelmed by a surge in number of cases requiring escalation of care, these criteria need to vary towards ""crisis standards of care""[90].We found mixed support for some of the subjective criteria in the expert consensus and triage publications. Fears of discrimination of elderly, functionally impaired, cognitively impaired, obese or immunosuppressed patients when allocating resources have been publicly expressed [18] . Under the ""life cycle principle"" younger patients receive priority because they have had the least opportunity to live through stages of life [18] . A different ethical principle to make allocation decisions is the ""maximizing life-years"" which takes into account a patient's life expectancy based on age, co-morbidities and other factors (hence prioritising the young) [29] .The principle behind giving healthcare workers priority [85] is a 'multiplier effect'. When healthcare workers recover they can contribute to saving the lives of many others. Although this principle may have some ethical validity, it did not receive much support in the consensus statements.Triage aims to maximise positive health outcomes for the largest possible number of patients.Triage protocols can have negative consequences for patients who are already hospitalised or treated in ICU for conditions not related to a pandemic (e.g. stroke or myocardial infarction) who would not have been denied access under normal conditions [23] . Those admitted to ICU, should be reassessed at 48 and up to 120 hours to determine ongoing eligibility for ICU resources [21, 24] or to discharge them to palliative care. While an early, gradual and personalised approach to prognostic disclosure in routine practice is recommended in terminal illness [95] , this may not be possible in mass emergencies. Early prognostic disclosure may be necessary during pandemics and other public health emergencies, and ""advance care planning"" will have to be expedited at the time of admission. Patient and family involvement in treatment decisions may be limited by hospital policies concerned with service capacity and healthcare worker safety. However, when possible, recognising triggers for early palliative care referral and/or treatment withdrawal [96] and adhering to patient preferences [97] should be integral to management policies.It has been recommended to invite input from members of at-risk groups or their caregivers into algorithms to determine access to ICU and ventilators during pandemics [18, 93, 98 ].However, this may not work in all cultures, and time pressure will likely be prohibitive of consultation with all stake holders. Unfortunately, efficient allocation of ventilators may unintentionally further increase social inequalities [99] . Supplementary strategies to build trust during a pandemic include public transparency on the objective decision-making framework [18, 98] and disseminating information about decision-making frameworks to the public.We did not conduct risk of bias assessment of included studies as the purpose of this scoping review was to collate a wide range of risk prediction and decision tools, which will have to be adapted to local settings. We excluded some validation studies from low-income countries [104] which showed good predictive ability of the combined variables as there was the chance of lesser generalisability of their patient population to health systems in industrialised nations -the focus of our study.The catalogue of resources we assembled provides guidance on variables used to prioritise patients for critical care in the face of scarce life-sustaining resources. Patients' clinical or demographic characteristics alone and rigid triage systems are not the preferred way of allocating resources in a constrained healthcare system. The patient perspective needs to be taken into account. Discrimination against certain population groups must be avoided at every level of disease severity. A combination of variables used in prognostic scores (based on chronic and acute risk factors) and other decision tools presented here can be combined to create locally-relevant triage algorithms to assist decisions about ICU admission and discharge and/or access to ventilator treatments during a pandemic. This unique resource will help service managers and clinicians with the emotional and ethical burden of having to select some patients over others for life-sustaining treatments. More importantly objective guidelines will provide transparency about rationing resources to the patients and communities they serve.The authors declare that they have no competing interestsNo funding was available for this work.All rights reserved.

Spectrum of antiviral activity and nature of assessment for four antiviral hit drugs.Simeprevir was reported to be an inhibitor of the 3CLPro protease by Abhithaj et al. 23 They used a pharmacophore search followed by grid-based ligand docking (GLIDE, Schrodinger) and binding energy estimates from the MMGBSA method of -81.7 kcal/mol. However, they did not use MD to simulate the interaction of Simeprevir in the 3CLPro binding site. Similarly, Sofosbuvir was reported to be a strong inhibitor of the protease by Lo et al. 24 Using a Vero E6 cellular infection model, they also reported that Simeprevir was the only drug among their prioritized candidates that suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication at below 10 μM.Dose-response studies showed that Simeprevir had an EC50 of 4 μM, and CC50 of 20 μM, similar to Remdesivir in their experiments. The potential protease inhibition properties of Lopinavir and Ritonavir were reported by Bolcato et al., who used supervised MD to calculate the trajectories of the ligands in the protease binding site. 25 Costanzo and colleagues likewise reported high protease binding for these two antiviral drugs. 26 They also reported updates on experimental drugs successfully employed in the treatment of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Patient recovery has been reported after treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir (used to treat HIV infection) in combination with the antiflu drug oseltamivir. Muralidharan 31 In their assay, Simeprivir exhibited an IC50 of 14±3 µM.The most interesting potential protease inhibitors from our study are the ergot alkaloids ergotamine, mergocriptine, the thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag (ranked 13 with ΔGMMPBSA=-28.2 kcal/mol, see Supplementary Table 1) , bemcentinib, PC786, and montelukast.These drugs were predicted to have better binding energies than the antiviral drugs discussed above and have a higher degree of novelty.Gurung et al. reported potential binding of ergotamine to the SAR-Cov-2 main protease in a preprint. 32 The employed AutoDock Vina but without subsequent MD simulation of the complex. They reported the binding energy as −9.4 kcal/mol for dihydroergotamine and -9.3 kcal/mol for ergotamine. Mevada et al. also reported the in-silico estimates of the binding of ergotamine to the protease using AutoDock Vina for the virtual screening. 33 They found the drug bound with an energy of -10.2 kcal/mol, calculated using Vina (no subsequent MD simulation). Gul et al. used a similar docking approach, this time with MD simulation, and identified ergotamine and its derivatives dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine to have high binding affinity to SARS-Cov-2 3CLpro. Ergotamine is an alpha-1 selective adrenergic agonist and vasoconstrictor that had a high docking binding energy against SARS-Cov-2 M pro of -8.6 kcal/mol. Dihydroergotamine, the 9,10-alpha-dihydro derivative of ergotamine, showed similar high affinity of -8.6 kcal/mol and bromocryptine -9.2 kcal/mol. Ergotamine has also been predicted to bind tightly to the SARS-Cov-2 spike (S) protein. 34 Figure 3 shows a LigPlot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in ergotamine and mergocriptine with protease active site residues. These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist used treat asthma and allergic rhinitis.It reduces pulmonary responses to antigen, tissue eosinophilia and IL-5 expression in inflammatory cells and decreases elevated levels of IL-1β and IL8 in viral upper respiratory tract infections. 35 Several computational have suggested putative binding to the terminal site of M pro .Montelukast has been shown to inhibit at least one other protease, eosinophil protease. 36 Mansoor and colleagues proposed that it could bind to M pro on the basis of a simple molecular docking study. 37 Wu et al also reported putative binding of montelukast to M pro in a computational study using the same Internal Coordinate Mechanics modelling methods. 38 No accurate binding affinities were reported in either study. Figure 4 shows a LigPlot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in montelukast with protease active site residues.These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference. Bemcentinib selectively inhibits AXL kinase activity, which blocks viral entry and enhances the antiviral type I interferon response. It's in vitro activity against SARS-Cov-2 has been assessed by several groups. In a Vero cell assay, Liu et al reported 10-40% protection at 50µM. 30 However, in an alternative assay using human Huh7.5 cells, 39 Bemcentinib exhibited an IC50 of 100nM and CC50 of 4.7µM. They also developed an assay in Vero cells and reported the IC50 was 470nM and CC50 was 1.6µM, considerably higher activity than that reported by Liu et al. As a result it is an investigational treatment for COVID-19 (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu). Figure 5 shows a LigPlot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in bemcentinib with protease active site residues. These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference. PC786 targets the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) L protein and is designed to be a topical inhalation treatment. There is very little published work on the SAR-Cov-2 efficacy or predicting binding affinity to M pro . Panda and coworkers reported a binding energy ΔGbind of PC786 of −179.79, tighter binding than calculated for lopinavir (−131.49 kJ/mol), using a combined docking and MD approach. 40 Like our study, they employed Autodock Vina to dock a molecular library into the active site of M pro , followed by MD simulation using GROMACS. Figure 6 shows a LigPlot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in PC786 with protease active site residues. These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference. The predicted binding energies of the 84 drugs in the short list are summarized in Supplementary   Table 1 . We have also reviewed the literature for other in silico studies that have also identified some of these hit compounds as potential M pro inhibitors and have listed experimental in vitro and in vivo results and clinical trials in progress for drugs on the list. Two thirds of the drugs on the list have been reported to be potential inhibitors of SARS-Cov-2 target proteins, largely M pro but also RdRp, spike, helicase, human ACE2, 2'-O-methyltransferase nsp16/nsp10 complex, nsp1, PL pro , nsp3, and nsp12. Satisfyingly, those with the best predicted binding affinity from our study have also been of greatest interest clinically, with more in vitro assay results and clinical trials for drugs with the highest binding affinities. This suggests that our screening and MD simulation methods are sufficiently robust and accurate to identify drugs for repurposing against SARS-Cov-2 and, more broadly, other coronaviruses. The 33% of drugs in the hit list that have no reported studies are therefore also of interest as novel drugs for COVID-19. We discuss some of the more interesting and novel hit compounds with higher binding affinities.Eltrombopag is a TPO agonist that acts at the transmembrane domain of its cognate receptor C-Mpl via a histidine residue that occurs only in humans and apes. It scored highly in the docking studies, suggesting it could inhibit the 3CL protease and exhibit antiviral activity. Several other in silico screening studies also identified eltrombopag as a potential SARS-Cov-2 drug. Eltrombopag has also been proposed as a potential drug against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the basis of predicted strong binding to a pocket in the fusion cores of S2 domain. 41 Eltrombopag was also identified as a high binding affinity to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary binding site for the spike protein. Their virtual screen also used Autodock Vina, but no subsequent MD simulation was used for the top hit compounds from the screen. SPR was used to assess the binding of the drug to M pro . Figure 7 shows a LigPlot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in eltrombopag with protease active site residues. These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 Eltrombopag is of particular interest as a M pro inhibitor lead because it is novel and is also a member of a large class of small molecular TPO receptor agonists that may also exhibit activity against the viral protease, and potentially the spike protein and human ACE2. 43 . However, given the clotting disorders that SAR-Cov-2 generates, the TPOR agonist activities would need to be minimized to prevent platelet enhancement, while retaining or enhancing the antiviral activities.Apart from the drugs discussed above, several other drugs in the list in Supplementary Table   1 Our virtual screening approach that applies Autodock Vina and MD simulation in tandem to calculate binding energies for repurposed drugs has identified 84 promising compounds for treating SARS-Cov2 infections. The screening was applied against the viral main protease M pro (3CLpro). The top hits from out study consisted of a mixture of antiviral agents , natural products and drugs that were developed for other applications and that have other models of action. The prognostic value of our computational approach has been demonstrated by the fact that it identified a diverse range of drugs that have been reported in other computational studies or that exhibit useful SARS-Cov-2 antiviral effects in vitro. The antiviral drugs simeprevir, sofosbuvir, lopinavir, ritonavir and remdesivir exhibit strong antiviral properties and several in in clinical trial or use against SARS-Cov-2. These drugs have been identified as binding to M pro also by numerous virtual screening studies and by in vitro assays. The more interesting and least studied lead drugs amongst our candidate list, bemcentinib, PC786, montelukast, ergotamine and mergocriptine, were predicted to have binding affinities equal to or greater than the antiviral drugs, and have also been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. A few computational studies mostly using less rigorous methods than those we employed here, have also suggested that these drugs may bind to M pro .This high validation success rate strongly suggests that this type of virtual screening approach is capable of identifying compounds with potentially useful activity against SARS-CoV-2 and, by analogy, other coronaviruses. In particular, the 28 drugs for which no SARS-CoV-2 activity has been yet reported may be of particular interest for in vitro screening. The results of the current drug repurposing study provides information that could be useful to identify additional candidate drugs for testing for use in the current pandemic, as well as a rational computational paradigm for identifying therapeutic agents for future viral pandemics.The crystal structure of the COVID-19 M pro (Figure 8 ) was downloaded from the RCSB PDB (http://www.rcsb.org; refcode 6Y2F). 18 The top screened compound complexes with protease were minimized with CHARMm force field.The topology files of the ligands were prepared from Swissparam (http://www.swissparam.ch/) 57 and minimized in Gromacs2020 (http://www.gromacs.org/). 58 is sufficiently long for convergence. Duplicate production runs starting with different random seeds were also run to allow estimates of binding energy uncertainties to be determined.The binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were evaluated in two ways.The traditional method is to calculate the energies of solvated SARS-Cov-2 protease and small molecule ligands and that of the bound complex and derive the binding energy by subtraction.ΔG (binding, aq) = ΔG (complex, aq) -(ΔG (protein, aq) + ΔG (ligand, aq)We also calculated binding energies using the molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) tool in GROMACS that is derived from the nonbonded interaction energies of the complex. The method is also widely used method for binding free energy calculations. where ΔG (R:L,solv), ΔG (R,solv) and ΔG (L,solv) are solvation free energies of complex, receptor and ligand, respectively.While this manuscript was in preparation, Guterres and Im showed how substantial improvement in protein-ligand docking results could be achieved using high-throughput MD simulations. 60 As with our study, they also employed AutoDock Vina for docking, followed by MD simulation using CHARMM. The MD parameters they advocated were very similar to those used in our study.Proteins were solvated in a box of TIP3P water molecules extending 10 Å beyond the proteins and the particle-mesh Ewald method was used for electrostatic interactions. Nonbonded interactions over 10 and 12 Å were truncated. Their systems were minimized for 5000 steps using the steepest descent method followed by 1 ns equilibration with an NVT setting. For each protein-ligand complex, they ran 3 × 100 ns production runs from the same initial structure using different initial velocity random seeds and an integration step size of 2 fs.

Since the outbreak, a massive amount of research efforts have been poured into many aspects of this highly infectious disease. To help the research community, in March 2020, the White House and the Allen Institute for AI teamed up with many researchers and released the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset(CORD-19) [1] . As of 27/Jul/2020, CORD-19 contains over 199,000 research papers and nearly half of them are open-access with full text available [2] . The amount of articles' rapid growth has posed a challenge for the research community to keep up to date. Also, the general public is interested in many aspects of the disease, especially those findings related to dayto-day life. Hence, the CORD-19 dataset is shared on Kaggle. Community actions are required to help with developing tools that facilitate the understanding of virus [2] using machine learning(ML) technology. The ability to analyse the data and provide insights promptly pose a challenge since ETL and ML requires considerable computing power.In recent years, both industry and academia have adopted cloud computing paradigm, especially in the form of Hybrid Cloud Environment (HCE). [3] Adopting HCE enables user to utilise their existing computing infrastructure, and instantaneously acquires additional resources from external cloud service providers (CSP) on demand whenever requirement arises. In context of processing voluminous amounts of data such as the CORD-19 dataset, HCE provides cost saving measure by using an existing on-premise cloud, meanwhile, supplies the capability to gain extra computing, storage or networking resources from other CSP. However, building an application using HCE is also a demanding task; it requires detailed knowledge of cloud computing techniques.In this context, we propose a system design and implementation to accelerate ETL process and text classification with ML technology in a hybrid cloud environment. The architecture design is aimed to address the following characteristics: scalability, availability, stability, high performance and portability. To achieve these goals and for ease of development, the proposed application deploys on top of Aneka Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) platform. [4] Aneka PaaS is a range of tools, providing high level Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) and Software Development Kits(SDKs) for simpleness of implementing a scalable application. It allows developers to focus on developing their program logic without spending too much time considering deployment and scalability. When additional resources are required, one can easily acquire extra resources from additional CSP via Aneka dynamic provisioning mechanism.In this paper, we make the following key contributions:• We present a system architecture design that achieves various characteristics: scalability, availability, stability, high performance and portability. • The system is implemented and tested using real world CORD-19 dataset in a real hybrid cloud environment built using on-premise private cloud and the Melbourne Research Cloud(MRC). • The architectural design can be easily generalized and quickly adopted in similar scenarios. The system is not only applicable for the CORD-19 dataset but also for a broader scholarly article indexing and analysing.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II outlines the background information about Aneka PaaS and other technologies used in the system. System architecture is detailed and discussed in Section III. Section IV explains the system design and implementation by using UML diagrams and workflows, in addition, some example queries and visualizations are given. Afterwards, Section V describes the testbed built on a hybrid cloud including an on-premise private cloud and MRC. Our performance evaluation shows linear scalability can be achieved by utilizing Aneka PaaS with little overheads. Finally, the last section concludes the paper with summary and future works.Since the CORD-19 dataset made available, it has been downloaded for more than 200,000 times and many applications have been created [2] . For instance, Amazon Web Service (AWS) provides a search engine over the CORD-19 dataset and a question answering system powered by AWS Kendra [5] . Azure [6] , TekStack [7] , and COVID-Miner [8] developed full-text search engines. VIDAR-19, which extracts and visualizes risk factor from articles, was presented by F. Wolinski [9] . COVID Seer [10] and COVID Explorer [11] were developed by the Pennsylvania State University. COVID Seer is a multi-facet search engine powered by ElasticSearch and COVID Explorer has visualization and advanced filtering features utilizing automatic unsupervised ML.One drawback with existing systems is that they are not keeping updated with the growing dataset. Some of these are still using the initial version of CORD-19, even though the current dataset has grown threefold since the initial release. Hence, we address this issue by introducing additional workflows to keep up-to-date with current version of CORD-19 dataset and ingest newly published articles. These workflows allow users to have a latest view of state-of-the-art COVID-19 research outputs.To implement the system quickly, the best solution is to select some proven technologies in both industry and academia. After evaluating many difference technologies, we decide to go with the following: (a) Aneka PaaS [4] for core processing and deployment; (b) Microsoft .NET Framework and ML.net [12] for development; (c) Grobid [13] for ML based scientific paper parsing; (d) Minio [14] for scalable S3 compatible shared storage; (e) Elastic Stack [15] including ElasticSearch for fulltext indexing and Kibana for data visualization.Aneka PaaS provides a platform for users and developers to develop and deploy distributed application with ease. An overview of Aneka is shown in Fig 1. It comprises of three major layers with rich collection of components: Microsoft .NET Framework/.NET Core is a free software development framework developed by Microsoft. It is a complete platform that supports various languages, such as C#, VB, F#, etc. With the strategic tradition to .NET Core, it also provides cross-platform support including Windows, Linux and MacOS. Since Aneka itself is developed with .NET framework, it becomes a natural choice for our application. In addition, Microsoft made an extensive machine learning framework for .NET developers. It implements many traditional and proven ML algorithms; users who don't have detailed knowledge of ML techniques can still easily use ML technology in their application. This significantly lowers the barrier for developer to utilize ML technology.Elastic Stack (ES) [15] is widely used in industry; it is also know as ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana). Elastic Search is a distributed full-text indexing and search engine based on Apache Lucene library; Logstash provides data collection and log-parsing engine through various of agents called Beats; Kibaba is a data visualization platform using searching, filtering and aggregation functions provided by ElasticSearch. Since we implement customized data collections and processing logics by Aneka, we only use ElasticSearch and Kibana in our system.In addition to the technologies above, we also used an open source program called Grobid [13] in our update workflow. Grobid is a machine learning library designed explicitly for extracting text data from technical or scientific documents. It is capable of converting PDF file to TEI/XML while maintaining section and structure format. It has been actively developed since 2008 and open-sourced in 2011.This section outlines an overview of the system architecture visualized in Fig. 2 . The system utilizes a hybrid cloud environment: an on-premise private cloud for storing and Fig. 1 . Aneka Framework Overview [16] processing data and Melbourne Research Cloud (MRC) for hosting and serving public-facing ES traffic.While designing a data-centric processing system, the first thing to consider is how to store and distribute the data efficiently. Although Aneka PaaS supports data distribution via task payload and FTP, it is not efficient and scalable in our usecase. Therefore, we decide to use a centralized storage cluster powered by Minio [14] , an open-source object storage software. Minio provides S3 compatible API and shared-nothing architecture for scalability and availability. It is a shared file system that can be accessed by all Aneka workers/master and application server. When requirement arises, data can be easily replicated to external CSP over VPN connection, creating a multi-cloud storage cluster. The second component is the computing service provided by Aneka PaaS as described in Section II. Aneka makes it easy to perform parallel processing by encapsulating task scheduling and execution. The third component is an ES cluster replicated to a MRC public instance over the Internet/VPN. The on-premise primary ES cluster is for data persistence. The secondary instance is configured for read-only accessing and serving public-facing traffic. Due to resource constraint, we are running on a single node at both sides with regular automated snapshot/backup.The architecture design is quite straightforward, but it addresses some common system design principles as follows: 1) Scalability: All major components are horizontally and vertically scalable. When additional capability is requisite, one can easily scale up or out by providing more powerful nodes or add more nodes. 2) Availability: Minio and ElasticSearch use sharednothing architecture, which is designed for highly available systems. Aneka also has robust mechanism to handle task/node failure automatically. 3) Stability: This can be achieved using fail-fast and idempotent processing. If a task fails for any reason, it can be rescheduled either periodically or automatically without affecting the whole system. 4) Performance: High performance is achieved by facil- itating Aneka's distributed scheduling and execution capability. 5) Portability: Application developed with the Aneka SDK/API is portable. It can execute in any environment that supports .Net framework, regardless of cloud service provider. Portability can be easily achieved by moving the application to another CSP like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. The main system logic is implemented in the application server component. The application server works as a collaborator performing some housekeeping tasks. It periodically checks for dataset update, downloads PDF files from various sources and submits tasks to Aneka master. It also monitors the ML model bucket. When a new training set becomes available that can improve the ML model, the application server submits a task to Aneka master for training. The actual data processing tasks are performed by worker nodes. Fig.  3 . Firstly, we describe four storage buckets followed by their purposes. Afterwards, the application workflows are explained.There are four types of data stored in four buckets: 1) RAW: This bucket contains PDF files need to be extracted. 2) Staging: This bucket contains TEI/XML, metadata and JSON files that have been extracted from PDF files or downloaded from the public dataset. 3) Completed: Processed files are moved from the staging area to this bucket for archiving/referencing purposes. This also avoids duplicate processing. 4) ML Models: Dataset for ML Model training and pretrained model are stored in this bucket.The first workflow is checking for data source update. The application checks for the latest version from CORD-19 dataset and other sources. If new data is available in CORD-19 dataset, it ingests incremental data into the staging bucket. Since every article is binary checksummed with SHA1 and all processed articles are stored in a separated bucket, an incremental update is possible by comparing checksums.Because checksum values are used as object keys in S3/Minio, complexity for checking is O(1). If new PDF files are available from various sources, they are stored in the RAW bucket first. Periodically, RAW PDF files are sent as AnekaTask for text extracting using Grobid on worker nodes.Secondly, the ML model bucket is checked periodically. We use SdcaMaximumEntropy multi-class trainer provided by ML.net to train our model and save it to the bucket. Since high quality training dataset is crucial for achieving higher accuracy, if better quality labelled data is available, the system will train a newer model and compare its accuracy with the old one, keeping the better model for later inferencing.The main data processing workflow is described in the following algorithm 1. The UML class diagram in Fig. 4 shows classes comprised the application. To define an Aneka task, developers only need to make the class sterilizable and implement Aneka.Tasks.ITask interface with only a single method to program the execution logic.Moving on to the application demonstration, Fig. 5 and Fig.  6 illustrate two example queries we searched, aggregated and visualized on ElasticSearch and Kibana as general interest. Since the data is ever changing, these are exported at the time of querying and for illustration purposes only.Question 1: What are the hottest research areas? The result shows population(virus spread patterns), vaccine, Effectiveness of PPE and risk factors are among the most studied areas. Question 2: Which country is contributing the most efforts In this section, we introduce our testing environment, present benchmark results and also share our observations based on the experimental findings. Table I lists the specifications of our test environment. The Aneka master was setup to run in a converged mode, which means it also doubles as a worker node. In our performance benchmark, the single node execution was performed on the master node. In our testbed, the nodes are virtualized instances with Linux KVM running on top of three physical hosts. Each host has 2x1 GBE configured with LACP(802.3ad), layer 2+ hashing and connected to the same gigabit managed switch. The experiments were done with smaller sets of articles N = {10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000} randomly taken from CORD-19 dataset, running with M = {1, 2, 3, 4} Nodes to demonstrate performance and scalability. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show execution time for a single node and multiple nodes.As expected, for a single node, the execution time increases linearly in relation to the size of input. For multiple nodes, the processing time can be significantly reduced; we are able to 1) Processing time of each article is near constant, the fluctuation is relatively small from 18.2ms to 18.7ms. This is largely caused by I/O bound and network latency since each article is read from storage server before processing and persisted to the ES cluster afterwards. 2) Using two nodes theoretically reduces processing time by half comparing to a single node. The actual result is less than 2x since there is communication and task scheduling overhead. 3) When dataset is not large enough, after reaching the diminish return point, further increasing number of nodes will not reduce processing time much further as theoretically expected due to overheads. e.g. for 10000-20000 articles, the benefit of using more than two nodes is less rewarding, meaning using two nodes is the best in this problem size. For larger input, using more nodes is still beneficial.In this paper, we proposed a system architecture for indexing and analysing scholarly articles, in particular, the CORD-19 dataset. We also presented an application design and implementation. By using the Aneka PaaS solution, parallel data processing application can be effortlessly developed. It significantly reduces entry barrier for a developer to develop such a distributed system.For future work, the ML model can always be improved with higher quality labelled datasets. A significant contribution is the CODA-19 dataset [17] . The authors used 248 human workers provisioned by AWS Mechanical Turk and created a human-annotated dataset. We may utilize this dataset to improve our model but it requires some additional work.Also, we are planning to test the system to the limit with a more extensive collection. S2ORC [18] is a general-purpose corpus containing 136M+ paper nodes with 12.7M+ fulltext papers(as of 27/July/2020) from many different sources.

Since its detection, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 has spread throughout the world at an unprecedented rate, impacting the lives of almost every citizen across 213 countries and territories [1] [2] 13] . Whilst COVID-19 is gradually being controlled in many countries, it is still spreading throughout the world at a rapid pace. As of August 2020, COVID-19 had infected over 25 million people and responsible for the death of over 850 thousand people worldwide. Figure 1 shows the countries case distribution [1].Due to the coronavirus pandemic, governments worldwide have enforced strict containment measures such as lockdowns, border closures, quarantining of infected individuals and social distancing. As a result, a considerable proportion of the population employed within schools, universities, companies, and government agencies have transitioned to remotely working from home with no signs of that trend slowing. [4] . In a report published by Gartner, 74% of CFO's interviewed intended to permanently move at least 5% of their workforce to work from home to save costs [5] after the pandemic. These changes, however, have ultimately increased the attack surface for cyber criminals [6] .In the past, Cybercriminals have launched cyberattacks close to significant world events such as the coronavirus pandemic. [20] surveyed 319 people post Hurricane Harvey to determine if cybercriminals use natural disasters as a basis to launch phishing campaigns [20] . Just over 36% of respondents received phishing emails during the disaster, and surprisingly 10% of respondents clicked on the links provided. Similarly, throughout the COVID19 health crisis, cybercriminals have become highly active by taking advantage of the massive increase in workload, education, and leisure-related online activity. Most of the malicious activity has included fraudulent emails and messages via social media, which contain malicious links or attachments. Malicious cyber actors are actively targeting individuals and organisations with COVID-19 related applications, making it difficult for individuals to detect malware [19] . For example, front line health staff at UW Medicine heavily utilised telehealth to assist patients remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, staff reported a dramatic increase in phishing emails (spear phishing) enticing them to download malware [6] via malicious links. In addition to hindering front line staff in an already crippled health system, the spread of malware or ransomware on health care systems can delay the diagnoses and treatment of COVID-19 patients.To tackle this growing concern, this paper proposes a model to detect COVID-19 URL's shortly after domain name registration using machine learning based classification techniques. We have used recent malicious domain names detected during the COVID-19 pandemic and process the data for feature extraction using our developed tools. Our model leverages a minimal number of features which are available at the time of domain registration, such as the number of hyphens, the number of numeric characters, the Shannon's entropy, the URL length and categorised based on the malicious threat weighting. Although entropy has been used in previous literature to improve detection performance, empirical data in this study suggest that entropy provides better performance in our experimental evaluation. The rest of the paper is organised as follows; section 2 outlines current COVID-19 related literature and section 3 describes our proposed model. Section 4 describes the data set and experimental setup. Section 5 discusses the experimental results. Finally, section 6 provides the conclusion and future work followed by references.During this COVID19 time, the cybercriminals are taking advantage of sending fraudulent email and messages through social media that attempt to trick you into clicking on malicious links or opening attachments. The malicious cyber actors have been using the Coronavirus as a guise to lure and actively target individuals and Australian organizations with COVID-19 related malicious activities, making it difficult for the individual to detect or unknowingly install malware [26] . Alarmingly, since January 2020 more than 160 thousand new malicious domain names have been created containing COVID-19 related keywords [27] . The malicious activities increase by 2000% due to COVID19 [28] . In response to this trend, the Australian governments recently issued notices educating users not to click COVID-19 related links [29] . Whilst this approach may prevent some phishing attacks it does not stop unsuspecting users from clicking malicious links. Unfortunately, the number of phishing attacks have risen as more companies shift their workforce online [30] . This is alarming considering at least 36% of all data breaches reported in Australia before the COVID-19 crisis originated from phishing campaigns [31] .In this section, we are illustrating the senarion of growing malicious attack patterns and attack types of malicious software during COVID-19 pandemic.During covid-19 the malware samples increses exponentially. The following Fig.1 illustrates the graphical representation of malware trends from April 2019 to April 2020 [33] . The figure demonstrates a simple comparison of malware samples from pre-covid-19 (April'19 -January '20) and during covid-19 (Feb'20 to April '20) . It has been clear that there is a sharp jump in the number of samples posted from Feb'20 to end of March 2020 when the COVID-19 spread all over the world. The distiribution of malicious file types has been illustrated in Fig. 4 which has been collected from Falcon Sandbox [34] . It is clear that the utmost part of the distribution is malicious URL and then peexe executable, which revealed that during the COVID-19 pandemic a huge number of malicious URL spread through the network traffic. Phishing has become the most popular attack vector for cybercriminals and its impact of this attack is significant since it can involve the risk of identity theft and financial losses. The phishing scam and spam emails are growing enormously during COVID-19. The scammer is using the government and other potential domains to spread the scam or phishing attack to the user by using COVID related temptations [38] . The user is unknowingly using or following the URLs of instructions and loses their classified data and sometimes compromises the computers or user to make money. The Fig. 5 illustrates a sample of phishing scam which uses Australian government credentials using COVID-19 information [38] .The distribution of COVID-19 related phishing campaigns has become so prevalent and problematic, that government agencies around the world have released public statements to prevent users from clicking on malicious links [18] . Figure 5 : Example email phishing scam pretending to be coming from the Australian Government [38] Despite best efforts to minimise phishing related attacks, cybercriminals constantly change their tactics to minimise detection and increase the success of phishing campaigns [25] . To be successful, phishing relies heavily on deceiving victims into downloading malware or disclosing personal information. To achieve this, phishers must jump through several hoops before infecting their victim. Even if a malicious email successfully progresses through spam blockers, the content of the text must then convince the recipient to follow the call to action. As a result, phishers increase clickthrough rate by invoking a sense of urgency, concern, or threat [8] . Cybercriminals also commonly use obfuscation to minimise suspicion by mimicking legitimate URL's [4] . This tactic was observed during the pandemic, and alarmingly since January 2020, more than 160 thousand new malicious domain names were registered to contain COVID-19 related keywords [2] for example, ""covid19guidelines.com"" [18] .A crucial step in mitigating phishing attacks is to prevent people from clicking the malicious link in the first place. A number of methods have been proposed throughout literature to achieve this, such as user education, URL blacklists and machine learning.Minimising the impact of phishing via user education has been widely studied and is one of the preventative pillars heavily utilised by government departments. However, ultimately this approach does not prevent phishing from reaching the inbox of unsuspecting users. This is particularly problematic for younger IT users who have very low awareness of phishing or social engineering.Blacklists are widespread and offer protection against verified phishing sites. Initiatives such as PhishTank, Google Safe Browsing and OpenPhish maintain huge lists of malicious links, however offer little value in detecting new malicious links (otherwise known as zero-hour links) [8, 24] . For a malicious link to be included in a blacklist, it must first be discovered, shared and then validated. This creates a significant window of opportunity which can be exploited by cybercriminals.There is a significant lag between phishing attacks and the blacklisting of the corresponding site as illustrated in [17] , where authors noted that a staggering 47% to 83% of phishing URL's were blacklisted after 12 hours and often drop off the blacklist only to return later. Despite their static properties, the popularity of Blacklists is a result of their ease of implementation and high accuracy. This is largely because they are essentially just a list of malicious links. However, cybercriminals can easily bypass blacklists by obfuscating characters in the path to avoid detection [14] . Overall, the task of managing an updated list of malicious links is an exhausting task and offers little value in preventing zero-hour phishing attacks.This subsection describes the categorizaotn of threat and attack patterns generated durign COVID-19 outbreak due to remote work and remote access. We have explored various data from Kaspersky from their collections [35] [36] [37] . As more users have switched to working from home arrangements, brute force attacks on Remote Desktop Protocol have increased substantially during the first four months of 2020 as shown in Fig. 7 [36] . We can see from Fig. 7 that most of the growing attack in between March 2020 to mid-April. The attack vector has a sharp increase in early March 2020 and most of the attacks in the region where COVID has impacted more during that time period. There are also the increased demand for remote entertainment, web-based attacks. The Fig. 8 illustrates the web-based attack, from January 2020 to April 2020 of remote entertainment and web contents, have increased by 25% in the first four months of 2020 [36] . Fig. 9 illustrates the DoS attack statistics reported by the first quarter of 2020 [37] , which indicates that some of the DoS attacks are high during February 2020 when COVID -19 is spreading around the world. [37] , which indicates that attack region is high in USA followed in Netherland, Germany and France. It is obvious that those regions were impacted havily from COVID-19, during the first quarter of 2020. It is clear that the maliciour intruder targeted the countries during pandemic when COVID -19 is spreading around the world. Kaspersky also demonstrated the attack pattern that around 40% attack origins from the USA which are most vulnerable in COVID-19 [37] . The use of machine learning to detect malicious links has been studied extensively throughout literature. The bulk of these studies focus on the detection of malicious links using features such as the code of the corresponding page, the content of the website, the infrastructure details underpinning the UR or the string of characters within the URL (lexical features),. The detection of malicious links via the lexical features within the URL has been shown to be fast and is low risk since it does not require navigation into the malicious link [15] . In their study, the authors extract brand name similarity, word randomness and over 40 natural language processing (NLP) features from a dataset of over 37000 phishing URL's taken from PhishTank. Although the authors obtain an accuracy rating of 97% using RandomForrest, their approach requires a significant amount of pre-processing.Other studies such as [13] [21] also use word entropy to detect malicious links. [13] use Shannon's Entropy in parallel with other lexical features and achieve an impressive 99% accuracy.[21] separate URL's into n-grams and prove the effectiveness of this approach using Shannon's entropy. The authors make a positive contribution by proving that character distributions within phishing URL's are skewed due to obfuscation techniques used by Phishers. Taking this finding into account, we also include Shannon's entropy as a feature throughout our study.Overall, most studies on the detection of malicious links using the lexical features within a URL obtain their datasets from known blacklist sites such as PhishTank. This approach is accurate since most of these URL's have been verified to be malicious, however, the bulk of these URL's are harvested late in the attack lifecycle. For this reason, many studies improve the detection accuracy of their models using features not available at the time of domain name registration, such as special characters. To minimise the risk of malicious links, it is ideal to detect malicious domain names shortly after registration before they are circulated as malicious links. As [21] shown in their study, many phishing links obfuscate characters in domain names, indicating possible malicious intention at the time of domain name registration. Therefore, the aim of this research is to:The aim of this research is to: To combat the influx of malicious URL's related to the coronavirus, we propose a mode which detects malicious URL's related to COVID-19. The detection of malicious URL's via the lexical features present in the hostname is fast and low risk since navigation into the domain name is required. Most detection models throughout literature have been designed to detect URL's from popular blacklisting sites such as PhishTank. However, most of the features utilised in these models are not available at the time of registration. For example, characters such as percent (%), curly brackets ({}), and the equal sign (=) are commonly used by cybercriminals to obfuscate phishing URL's but cannot be used whilst registering a domain.Our proposed model can detect malicious COVID-19 URL's shortly after registration which is early in the attack lifecycle. The following section describes our proposed model to classify malicious URLs. Fig. 11 illustrates the framework of our proposed detection model which is comprised of three main components: -Our study focuses on the detection of COVID-19 related URL's. Therefore, the model searches for COVID-19 related URL's registered for malicious intent. Initially, URL's (both malicious and benign) are ingested into the comparison engine which searches for COVID-19 related keywords and obfuscated variants such as ""C0vid"", ""Cov1d"" and ""C0ronavirus"".After locating COVID-19 related domain names, all inbound URL's must be standardized for feature selection. Fig. 12 where the x-axis presents the number of URL's and y-axis presents the feature set. Our model uses a minimum number of features. In total, five features have been used throughout this study. These include the length of the domain name, the count of hyphens, the count of numerical characters, entropy calculation and the risk rating. In addition to the before mentioned lexical features, the Shannon's entropy calculation of each domain name is calculated. Cyber criminals often use obfuscation to confuse and lure victims by mimicking legitimate URL's or masking suspicious ones [4] . Therefore, the randomness factor of each URL was included in this study [13] [21] showed that malicious URL's have higher entropy calculations on average when compared to legitimate URL's. Shannon's entropy is calculated using the following equation:Where H(x) determines the Shannon entropy and x is the string being assessed. A higher value of H(x) indicates more randomness in string x.The malicious value determines if a URL has been registered for malicious intent. The model takes known URL's which are known to be both malicious and benign and delegates a risk rating based off the likelihood that the corresponding URL is malicious. Each URL is binary classed as follows:a.) Malicious -High probability the URL is used for malicious intent such as harvesting credentials or contains malicious code. The corresponding URL's resemble known b.) malicious URL's which have been previously flagged by blacklists.c.) Benign -Low probability that the URL is malicious. Does not resemble other known malicious URL's. The classification engine is tested and trained with WEKA's implementation of the following classification algorithms; Support Vector Machines, kNN, Naïve Bayes, Logistic regression and AdaBoostM1.This section describes the collection of malicious data and our proposed experimental setup using ML techniques.To determine which domain names are a potential cyber threat, two classes of data were required: benign and malicious domains. Malicious domains were obtained from DomainTools and was comprised of newly registered domain names related to the coronavirus [2] . DomainTools provides threat intelligence of new and discovered domains and has been used in previous studies [42] All domain names in the dataset contain a corresponding risk rating ranging from 70 to 100 which is a strong indicator of an existing or impending threat. To determine a malicious threat rating, DomainTools measure the proximity to known malicious sites using the domain name, registration information and the underlying infrastructure details.To gather a list of benign domain names, a publicly available list of recently registered domain names was extracted from WhoisDS from the 7 th of April until the 25 th of April 2020 [9] .The dataset was then filtered for coronavirus related keywords such as ""Covid-19"", ""cov-19"", ""coronavirus"" and ""carronavirus"". During this time, a total of 27,841 domain names were registered across the internet containing coronavirus related keywords. Table 2 shows the experimental data set. We performed an analysis of both the benign and malicious links in the dataset. The mean of the host length, number of hyphens, number of numeric characters and the entropy of malicious links were all higher than legitimate links, as shown in the Table 3 . This validates previous studies such as [24] who observed a positive correlation between the host length and the number of numeric characters within malicious links. Entropy was also noted to be higher in [13] [21] on average in malicious links. This was also observed with malicious links within this study. In our classification process, we input the generated feature vectors into the WEKA classification system for which we have written an interface. In all experiments, 10-fold cross validation is applied to ensure a thorough mixing of features. In this procedure, we first select one group of malicious data from a particular data set and divide it into ten portions of equal size; then we select cleanware data of the same size as the group of malware data and also divide it into ten portions. The portions are then tested against each other as demonstrated in Figure 14 . To establish the training set, our detection engine takes nine portions from each of the malware and cleanware to set up the training set. The remaining portions from both malware and cleanware are used for the testing set. As is customary, the training set is used to establish the model and the testing set is used to validate it. The whole process is repeated so that every portion of both malware and cleanware is chosen as testing data; the results are then averaged. To ensure that the input vectors are trained and tested over a broad spectrum of classifiers, we chose the classifier/s from WEKA as they represent differing approaches to statistical analysis of data.This section describes the classification results based on the dataset we have prepared after entropy calculation. In our experiment we have used WEKA in our all experiment. Table   4 to Table 8 respresents the classification results using various ML based classification techniques. Its has been shows that the kNN , NB ( Naïve Bayes) and Logistic regration provide better performance without entropy , however SVM and Adaboost has demonstrated no difference between entropy calculation.In our future work we are investigating it with modifying various paramentes and see why entropy calculation not impacting in classification results. Logistic regression produced unreliable results and hence were discarded. Using kNN without the entropy calculation in the dataset produced the highest accuracy (99.2%) and the lowest false positive rate (2%). The second highest result was produced when using SVM with and without the entropy calculation. Overall, the entropy calculation offered little value when detecting malicious links. When kNN was run with the entropy calculation the overall accuracy decreased to 97% and false positive rate (FPR) increased to 10%. No difference in accuracy or FPR was observed when using SVM.In this paper, we proposed a framework to detect malicious domain names containing COVID related keywords. Using only 5 lexical features, our model detected malicious domain names with a 99.2% accuracy rate. To achieve this, we trained and tested our model using 7849 domain names from WhoisDS and DomainTools. Although the entropy of malicious domains was higher on average than benign domain names, entropy added little value to the overall accuracy rate. Infact, the best accuracy rate was achieved using kNN without the use of entropy.Overall, our model offers a promising solution to minimising COVID related phishing and malware attacks by detecting malicious domain names, early in the attack lifecycle. This is due to its ability to detect malicious URL's with a high accuracy using only the domain name and a minimal number of features.Future work will investigate the incongruence of entropy as a feature. Unlike other studies which used entropy to improve their detection accuracy, we found that the inclusion of entropy offerered little value. This may be due to the changing tactics of cybercriminals who deliberately register domain names with a lower entropy to evade detection. Thus understanding this phenomena would offer a positive contribution to knowledge.","Australia","first author","2020-09-19",9

On the Diamond Princess 19% of the passengers and crew became positive with the pandemic virus (SARS-CoV-2) and there was spread to Japanese responders on shore. 3 Similarly, on the Grand Princess, 17% of those tested had positive results. 3 On a much smaller cruise ship with 217 passengers and crew onboard, 59% were reported to be test-positive. 4 On a fishing vessel, 85% (104/122) of the crew were infected. 5 In terms of merchant vessels, an outbreak on a container ship was reported as infecting 23% (5/22) of the crew. 6 Other such outbreaks have been detailed in media reporting (referred to in a review 7 ) .In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, border controls have been widely used to limit pandemic spread. Such border controls are particularly relevant for two types of pandemic control strategy: (i) the exclusion strategy as successfully practiced by ten Pacific island nations e.g. Samoa and Tonga; 8 and (ii) the elimination strategy as used by New Zealand, 9 and possibly other jurisdictions, e.g. Mainland China, Taiwan, Fiji and five states/territories in Australia.Some of these jurisdictions have completely prohibited maritime vessels arriving at their sea ports from countries which are not COVID-19-free (e.g. the Marshall Islands have prohibited such incoming ships 8 ) . But time periods are also used e.g. a minimum of 14 days at sea before being allowed to enter the Marshall Islands, 8 or 14 days plus a negative PRC test for New Zealand. 10 There is also the standard international requirement for pratique whereby any ""illness during the voyage"" must be notified to health authorities at the destination port. 11 Given this background we aimed to expand on previous modelling work (for air transport spread of COVID-19 12 ) to determine the risk of merchant ships being the source of COVID-19 outbreaks in an otherwise COVID-19 free country.We used a stochastic SEIR type model with key compartments for: susceptible [S], exposed [E] , infected [I] , and recovered/removed [R] . The model is a stochastic version of CovidSIM which was developed specifically for COVID-19 (http://covidsim.eu; version 1.1). Work has been produced from previous versions of this model, 12 13 14 and in two places we detail the relevant equations and their stochastic treatment. 15 16 The model was built in Pascal and the computer code is available on request from the senior author (ME). 100 million simulations were run for each set of parameter values. Such a large number of simulations was necessary due to the very high probability of zero infected crew members boarding a departing merchant ship given the low assumed incidence of infection (see below). The overall framework for the processes modelled is shown in Figure 1 . The parameters were based on available publications and best estimates used in the published modelling work on COVID-19 (as known to us on 27 August 2020). We assumed that 71% of infected COVID-19 cases develop clearly detectable symptoms (Table 1) . Another assumption was the contagiousness in terms of the effective reproduction number (R eff ) which was 3.0 among crew members on board of the ship and 2.5 in the destination country (Table 1 ). Shore leave in the destination country: We selected New Zealand as a case study destination country as it has previously achieved elimination of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 9 and appears to be successfully controlling an outbreak (probably arising from a border control failure) in one region in September 2020. Upon arrival in this destination country, we used a period of shore leave by all the crews of one day (the median time ships are in port based on Ports of Auckland data, the port in New Zealand's largest city). Table 2 and Figure 1 and included a PCR test on all the crews on arrival and mask use by the crews during shore leave. If any crew member tested positive then the shore leave for all that particular crew was assumed to be prohibited and therefore there was no risk of any community outbreak. If a crew member on shore leave developed and self-reported symptoms and then tested positive, this case would be isolated and this could also trigger contact tracing which was assumed to identify 80% of the infected contacts within 48 hours. Identified contacts would be isolated after a delay of one or two days.• For the initial estimate of the numerator we used the global reporting to WHO of new laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 15 August 2020 (n=294,237 new cases). 17 • For the denominator we used the UN global population estimate for 2020 (7,794,799,000). 18 • To adjust for under-estimating of actual infections (compared to reporting of cases) we used the estimate of a 10-fold difference between reported cases and infections based on sero-surveys by Havers et al. for the USA (with this 10 fold factor still probably being an under-estimate). 19 We assumed that prior to the ship leaving for the destination country, the crew members have 1 day of shore leave during which they can pick up the infection at the given probability. Percent of infections that are asymptomatic 29% (50% in scenario analysis)We used the estimate from a very large Spanish survey of 61,075 participants. 20 It found the proportion of individuals with a positive test who were asymptomatic was 32.7% (30. 2-35.4) for the point-of-care test and 28.5% (25.6-31.6), for the immunoassay. Given the immunoassay is likely to be more accurate than the point-of-care test, we used the 28.5% result. This result is similar to that for a working-age adult population i.e. a cohort of health care workers in the UK at 27% of all infections being asymptomatic. 21 Latency period 5 days We used the best estimate from CDC in May 2020 of a mean of 6 days until symptoms (i.e. the latency period plus the prodromal period). 22 We used a standard deviation (SD) of 25% (1.25 days) (calculated using 16 stages; Erlang distribution). Prodromal periodThere is, as yet, insufficient information on this prodromal period for COVID-19, so we used an assumed value for influenza (SD = 25%; 0.25 days, Erlang distribution). Symptomatic period 10 days (split into 2 periods of 5 days each)The WHO-China Joint Mission report stated that ""the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease"". 23 But given that mild cases may have been missed in this particular assessment, we used a slightly shorter total time period of 10 days (SD = 25%; 2.5 days, Erlang distribution).Relative contagiousness in the prodromal period 100% We used the best estimate from CDC in May 2020 of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals of 100%. 22 Contagiousness after the prodromal period 100% and 50%In the first five days of symptoms, cases were considered to be fully contagious. In the second five-day period, this was assumed to be at 50%. The latter figure is still uncertain, but is broadly consistent with one study on changing viral load. 24 Effective reproduction number (R eff ) on board the ship 3.0 (4.0 in a scenario analysis)The enclosed nature of the ship environment (and shared sleeping quarters in smaller vessels of under 3000 gross tonnage), would favour disease spread and so we used a higher value than for the community (see below). Noting the fishing boat outbreak (detailed in the Introduction) where 85% of the crew became infected, 5 we also used a higher value (R eff = 4.0) in a scenario analysis. We assumed no routine mask use on the ship or specific additional physical distancing behaviours by the crew.Merchant ship visits to the destination country 108 per week In the last three quarters of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 there were 5600 merchant ship port visits in NZ by vessels originating in overseas ports (counting each port visit separately where multiple ports were visited). 29 This is 108 port visits per week for such vessels. These vessels include bulk carriers, container ships, reefers, tankers, vehicle carriers and a range of other types of cargo vessels. Voyage length 10 days (scenario analyses ranging from 1 to 30 days)We calculated merchant ship travel times using a specific website for travel times between sea ports (http://ports.com/) and using a typical travel speed of 24 knots (44 km per hour). This gave the shortest trip to NZ (Sydney to Auckland) at 1330 nautical miles (nm) [2463 km] taking 2.3 days at sea. It gave the longest possible trip to NZ (Montreal to Auckland) at 17,100 nm taking 29.7 days at sea. Also, it gave the trip from the world's busiest container port (Singapore) to Auckland at 5828 nm at 10.1 days at sea. It gave the trip from the busiest European container port (Rotterdam) to Auckland at 14,569 nm at 25.4 days at sea. Given the complexities we did not consider port calls and shore leave on route between the original departure point and the first NZ port of call. Also we note that delays can also result in slower voyages than these (e.g. from storms, port congestion etc.). Crew size 20 (scenario analyses: 5, 10, 30) This value varies for the type of merchant vessel, but we used a figure of 20 which is mid-range for the crew size of a container ship (range 10 to 30 crew). 30 A wider range of values was used in scenario analyses.Duration of shore leave 1 day (scenario analyses: 2, 3)We analysed Port of Auckland data (the port in NZ's largest city) for the 140 merchant ship visits detailed on their website for 20 August 2020. This indicated a median stay in this port of 1 day (range 0.3 days to 6 days). 31 However, 31% of these international merchant ships had most recently come from another NZ port prior to the Port of Auckland.Key value Comment captain would be then legally required to alert health authorities in the destination port as part of pratique. On the other hand if a captain knows that the crew are in particular need of shore leave, then such information about onboard outbreaks might not always be divulged. The captain may also discount any outbreaks of respiratory illness as being due to other causes and to have been resolved at the time of arrival. Hence we assumed that port authorities should place little emphasis on pratique as a control process and should require PCR testing of all crew wanting shore leave (as outlined below). Compulsory PCR test on arrival of all crew Variable sensitivity based on time since infection As per our previous modelling work, 12 We assumed all crew would request shore leave and that port health authorities would prioritise the PCR testing of seafarers immediately on arrival to allow for a day of shore leave. E.g. we note that as per some airports, PCR test results can be obtained within a few hours. 33 We also note imminent access to faster testing e.g. FDA approval of a 15 minute test (albeit with different sensitivity and specificity from the PCR test). 34 Mandatory mask use by the crews during shore leave 85% efficacy but only twothirds (66.7%) adherence (and one third adherence in scenario analysis)We used the efficacy value of 85% from a systematic review and metaanalysis (n=2647; adjusted odds ratio = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.34). 35 Adherence to mask use in social settings in NZ (where local citizens are not typically using masks except on public transport where it was mandated in August 2020) was considered likely to be suboptimal at two thirds. In a scenario analysis we set adherence to mask use at one third (33.3%).Self-reporting of crew members whose sickness starts shortly before or during shore leave (i.e. they are among the 71% of infected individuals who become symptomatic) 50% (selfreporting, occurring on average 1 day after symptom onset)We used the same estimated value as in our previous Australia to NZ air travel study. 12 Such reporting can trigger contact tracing amongst the public in the destination country and therefore lower the risk of an outbreak (see next item). But due to the complexities we do not consider backward contact tracing among the crew. Of note is that routinely in NZ, 39.5% of people with ""fever and cough"" symptoms seek medical attention, as reported by the NZ Flutracking surveillance system. 36 This is very similar to international estimates for people with influenza who seeking medical attention at 40% e.g. as used in other modelling. 13 Contact tracing if crew members develop symptoms in NZ, seek medical attention and are confirmed by PCR (see above)We used performance data for the cluster of cases in Auckland in August 2020 where the official estimate was 80% of contacts contacted within 48 hours (as reported by the Prime Minister). 37 We divided this into 60% within the first 24 hours and 20% in the next 24 hours. Of note is that variable performance for contact tracing has been reported for NZ at other times in August 2020, with 86% of contacts traced in 48 hours at one point. 38 The median time to an outbreak would be markedly increased by obligatory PCR testing of crew members before shore leave is permitted i.e. up to 0.46 years (168 days) or after a total of 2592 port visits. Even further reduction of risk occurs when requiring face mask use during shore leave (increased median time to 1.00 years). But relatively little extra gain in risk reduction occurs from any sick crew on shore leave self-reporting symptoms and from the associated contact tracing (Table  3 ). Using the base case value of R eff = 2.5 in New Zealand, a single untraced infection in the community leads to an outbreak in 88.2% of cases (78.5% for R eff = 2.0). When we considered super-spreading events in the community in a scenario analysis the outbreak probability per person was actually reduced to 57.4%. This is because allowing for super-spreading events means that a smaller proportion of infected crew members transmit infection, even though those that do will typically infect more people (assuming the same overall value of R eff ).In scenario analyses, a smaller crew size reduced the outbreak risk (e.g. the median time to an outbreak would be 3.8 years for ships with a crew size of five; Table 4 ). The risk of outbreaks was also lower when making assumptions around lower contagiousness in the destination country (i.e. R eff lowered to 2.0). The risk remained basically unchanged if contagiousness on the ship was assumed to be higher (i.e. R eff increased to 4.0). Increasing the shore leave to either two or three days increased the risk of an outbreak (i.e. it reduced the median waiting time). If super-spreading events were considered in the destination country, this led to the same average number of untraced infections caused by crew members in New Zealand, but as each one of them had a lower risk of leading to an outbreak (see above), the overall outbreak risk was lower than in the baseline study. Figure 2 shows that voyage duration is a key determinant of outbreak risk in the destination country and this risk is especially high for short voyages of under a week (i.e. when infected crews taking shore leave may still be PCR test negative). This Figure also shows that it takes a long time for the onboard epidemic to ""burn out"" and that the outbreak risk in the destination country (when there are no controls) only starts to decline after a voyage time of three weeks, and even then declines quite slowly (Figure 2a) . For a crew size of 20 the risk of community outbreaks is still increasing after four weeks of voyaging if no controls are used (Figure 2c) . Interestingly, if PCR tests are implemented, the effect of longer travel durations generates results that are the inverse: the more the infection can spread on board, the more likely it will be detected. As none of the crew members is assumed to be allowed to go to shore if one is found positive, the probability that infected people entering the destination country decreases with the number of infected people on board. Adding additional interventions like wearing masks, self-reporting symptoms and doing contact tracing further improves the results, but the main effect is obtained by PCR entry screening. With the full set of interventions the median time to an outbreak increased up to 25 years (Figures 2b and 2c) .Wearing face masks when on shore leave (by the crew) Table 4 : Results of the scenario analyses for 108 merchant ship visits per week and the full set of interventions taking place (see last line of Table 3 ) with 100 million stochastic simulations run for each set of parameters (for further information, see text and Table 2 ).The results of this modelling study suggest it would only be a matter of a few weeks (specifically for the base case around 23 days for a total 355 port visits and 7100 days of shore leave) before crew from international trading maritime vessels would trigger COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks in the destination country. Fortunately, however, the risk of such outbreaks can be substantially reduced with available interventions, especially PCR testing before leaving the vessel and use of masks by the crew during shore leave. Of particular note is that even small five person crews will contribute to a risk after voyages of several weeks and this risk does not start to decline until three weeks (and even then the decline is slow).It is likely the results for our case study country (New Zealand) are generalisable to most countries that have sea ports and maritime trade. Nevertheless, the risk could be somewhat less for some nations on a per population or per GDP basis because New Zealand's economy is particularly trade orientated and especially sea trade orientated. That is, it has no international trade by land routes and only a small proportion by air cargo. With a population of 5 million New Zealand has 1120 port visits from vessels with an international origin per million population per year.This appears to be the first modelling study to explore the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks arising from shore leave of maritime ship crews (based on our search of PubMed and preprint sites in August 2020). Another strength is that the work builds on an established model that has been used to also study air transport and other aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (see Methods).But as with all modelling there are important limitations. Some of these relate to parameters, with a particularly critical one being the daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the source country that the ship leaves from. We just used a global average for this incidence to account for the diverse maritime trading patterns that New Zealand has and also because the crews are also internationally diverse (often flying in from another country just prior to the ship's departure). Nevertheless, there are likely to be highly variable risks by source country and countries that the crew come from.Another example of parameter limitations are the R eff onboard such vessels and also the R eff for shore leave by crew. The former is likely to vary by different designs of merchant vessels (container ships vs. tankers vs. bulk carriers etc.) and also by size (e.g. it is likely that in vessels of under 3000 gross tonnage the crew are in shared sleeping rooms). However, we did not have sufficient data to model such heterogeneity. We also didn't account for potential immunity amongst crew from past exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus internationally, which is bound to increase over time. Given the complexities we did not consider port calls and shore leave on route between the original departure point and the first New Zealand port of call. However, such port calls (if shore leave is taken by at least some of the crew members) could be reconceptualised as the new starting point for the voyage. We also did not model risk of transmission to port workers who might go onto arriving ships (eg, pilots and health workers conducting PCR tests), on the assumption that they would take appropriate precautions with physical distancing and use of personal protective equipment.As detailed above, the results in Tables 2 and 3 might make some health authorities decide that the risk of allowing shore leave for crew is tolerable with control interventions such as PCR and masks in place. But for small low-income island states (e.g. the 10 nations in the Pacific that were COVID-19-free in September 2020) the risk might still be considered too high, especially if they have limited surveillance and outbreak control capacity. In these states, either all shore leave could be denied (i.e. cargo movement is performed without the crew leaving the vessel), or the ships which recently visited countries where COVID-19 transmission is occurring are completely prohibited (e.g. until a vaccine against COVID-19 is available).Using simulations, we estimated the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in COVID-19-free settings as a result of merchant ship crews taking shore leave. Our results can inform policy-maker decisions about regulations regarding shore leave for crews and the use of various control measures such as PCR testing and mask use to minimise the risks if shore leave is permitted.","New Zealand","first author","2020-09-11",9

The subfamily coronavirinae contains four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus [1] . The international committee on the Taxonomy of viruses recently adopted addition changes to the nomenclature of Coronaviruses to include the inclusion of subgenera replacing the elsewhile lineage classification system [2] . Under this new system the genus betacoronavirus was further classified into five subgenera Sarbecovirus, Marbecovirus, Norbecovirus, Embecovirus and Hibecovirus [2] . Betacoronaviruses generally infect animals such as mammals and birds, they are the causative agents of many pathogenic diseases such as transmissible gastroenteritis of swine (TGEV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBD), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [3] . Coronavirus have been reported as early as 1930 (1Masters and Pearlman, 2013) but the earliest report of human coronavirus was in the year 1960, where two strains namely hCoV229-E and hCoVOC43 were described [4, 5] . Generally betacoranvirus have been observed to cause paucisymptomatic disease in man and are largely known to be zoonotic. It was not until after the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong and parts of China in 2003, that studies into the zoonotic origin of the incriminated pathogen SARS CoV revealed that the Chinese Rinolophid bats maintained a genetically related strain of the SARS CoV, [6, 7] . This finding sparked up interest in bat CoV research. Another coronavirus termed Middle East severe respiratory syndrome virus (MERS CoV) was reported in the Arabian peninsula in 2012 [8] . Genetically similar strains to the MERS CoV were also isolated from Pipistellus, Tyloncteris and Neoromica bats [9] .In Africa large scale surveillance studies have identified diverse strains of coronavirus (CoV) circulating among African bats from Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria [10] . Studies have also provided evidence that the human coronavirus hCoV229E originated from African bat CoV (AfrBtCoV) [11] . Also the rich fauna and biodiversity in Africa has made it a hotspot for emerging viral diseases. It is also inhabited by a diversity of bats which have been identified to serve as a reservoir of high consequence zoonotic diseases such as Marburg hemorrhagic fever and Rabies [9] . Recently a novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2 was identified to be the cause of a gobal pandemic which originally broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [12] . Some studies have also postulated that the SARS CoV-2 probably spilled over into human population through a zoonotic event involving Chinese SARS-related BtCoV [12, 13] .The recent evidence of African bats as a potential reservoir host for several betacoronaviruses (βCoV) gave rise to the conceptualization of this study which aims to investigate the spatial dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of βCoV among African bats.We searched for and downloaded partial or complete gene coding regions for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase sequences (RdRP) of Afr-BtCoV from GeneBank and the Virus Pathogen resource database http://www.viprbic.org , and Genbank. The data set generated contained African bat βCoV from eight countries, namely Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cameroun, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Madagascar and South Africa (n=94), BtCoV from China, Hong Kong and Philippines in Asia; and France, Spain, Netherland, Italy and Luxemburg in Europe (n=95). Mexico and Brazil (n=3), Australia (n=1) and reference African CoV OC43, CoVHKU1, MERSCoV, and alpha coronavirus from Africa (n=35). Information such as country of origin, Host species, and date of collection were combined with the sequence information for the purpose of accurate phylogenetic determination. The final data stets had information from seven African countries, four European countries and three Asian countries. All the data used in this study can be assessed in Supplementary Table 1 . Majority of the African BtCoV sequences were generated by nRT-PCR using primers targeting the 440bp partial RdRP gene region [14] and Sanger sequencing. Full genome sequences of ZBCoV were generated by both Sanger and ultra high throughput sequencing (UHTP) sequencing [15] .Sequences were aligned using clustal W version 2.1 using default settings, the final alignment was 400bp in length. Phylogenetic trees were constructed in MEGA 7.0 software www.megasoftwre.net using the maximum likelihood method with a general time reversible GTR with a gama distributed rate variation (T4) and a p-distance model with 1000 bootstrap resampling. The final trees were then visualized in fig tree http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/.Aligned sequences were analyzed for evidence of sufficient temporal clock signal using TempEst version 1.5 [16] . The relationship between root-to-tip divergence and sampling dates supported the use of molecular clock analysis in this study. Phylogenetic trees were generated by Bayasian inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 [17] . We partitioned the coding genes into first+second and third codon positions and applied a separate Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY+G) substitution model with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity among sites to each partition [18] . Two clock models were initially evaluated strict and relaxed molecular clock, with four different tree priors, constant population size, exponential population size, Bayesian Skyride plot and Gausian Markov Random Field Skyride plot. Each selected model was run for an initial 30, 000, 000 states. Models were compared using Bayes factor with marginal likelihood estimated using the path sampling and stepping stone methods implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 [17] . The relaxed clock with Gausian Markov Random Field Skyride plot (GMRF) coalescent prior was selected for the final analysis. The MCMC chain was set at 100, 000, 000 states with10% as burn in. Results were visualized using Tracer version 1.8. (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), all effective sampling size ESS values were >200 indicating sufficient sampling. Bayesian skyride analysis was carried out to visualize the epidemic evolutionary history using Tracer v 1.8. (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/).To reconstruct the ancestral-state phylogeographic transmission across countries and hosts, we used the discrete-trait model implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 [17] .The Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) approach [19] was used to explore the most important historical dispersal routes for the spread BtCoV across their countries of origin, as well as the most probable host-species transition. The spatiotemporal viral diffusion was then visualized using the Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Evolutionary Dynamics SPREAD3 software [20] .We analyzed βCoV sequences from seven African countries distributed among eight bat species as shown in Table 1 . The most abundant bat species sampled in this study was Micropteropus. pussilus, and Cameroon had the highest distribution of bat species sampled in this study. This result does not necessarily represent the true picture of bat species diversity in Africa, as some countries lack sequence information for bats due lack of surveillance. Few studies have been carried in Africa on CoV among bats leaving a huge gap in epidemiologic information regarding BtβCoV in Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of Bt-βCoV sequences revealed a significant proportion of the African strains, isolated from fruit bats fell within the sub-genera Norbecovirus formerly known as lineage D consisting of strains from Cameroon, DRC, Kenya, Madagascar and Nigeria. This observation is in agreement with a previous report which identified the widespread circulation of Norbecovirus (Lineage D) among fruit bats in certain African regions [21] . However, it was identified that isolates consisting largely of strains isolated among Neomoricia South African bats clustering within the sub-genus Marbecovirus (formerly Lineage C) together with strains isolated from Italy and Spain (Figure 1 ). The phylogenetic classifications utilized in this study is based on the partial RdrP group unit (RGU), utilized for the rapid classification of field isolates of βCoV [22] . The species-specific phylogenetic clustering observed among the Neomoricia bats suggests limited inter-species βCoV transmission and host specific evolution among these species of bats in Africa as previously reported for BtCoV [23] . Larger epidemiological studies are needed among these species of bats to shed more light as to the cause of this observed trend in Africa. Studies have shown that βCoV of subgenera Marbecovirus such as MERSCoV are capable of both intra-species transmission and inter host transmission [24] . In this study there seemed to be inter-species transmission among the Norbercovirus (lineage D βCoV), evidenced by circulation of same Norbecovirus clade within different species of bats from same country around with the same year of isolation. For instance from Figure 2 it can be seen that Cameroonian bat species Micropteropus pussilus, Epomophorus gambianus and Epomophorus franquenti, were infected by the same Norbecovirus clade, isolated around the year 2013. This is also observed among bat species from DRC ( Figure 2 ).This type of event allows for potential recombination and rapid evolution of this lineage, as previously reported [25] . This type of observation was also reported in an earlier study of an inter-species transmission event of alpha CoV HKU10 in bat species of different orders [26] . Results for root to tip divergence showed the data set had a positive temporal signal (Supplementary Figure 1) with the correlation coefficient = 0.0286 and R 2 = 0.0818. The MCC tree of the Afr-βBtCoV strains shows clearly the two major sub-genera Norbercovirus, and Marbecovirus ( Figure 2 ). We also observed that majority of the Sarbecovirus (formerly lineage B) BtβCoV were isolated in Europe, precisely France and Spain and also China ( Figure 3 ). These consisted of SARSr viruses for instance EP11 strains which have been reported to be widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia [27] . The absence of Sarbecovirus subgenera among the AfrBtCoV in our study seems to support the hypothesis that highly pathogenic CoV's such as SARS evolved outside the African continent. Although the lack of Sarbecovirus in this study does not imply that this group of viruses is not currently circulating among African bats, as the closest subgenra Hibecovirus which was also formerly classified under Lineage B was identified in African Bats from Nigeria and Ghana [15] , clustering with an Australian isolate ascension no: EU834950. This simply reflects the information gap in molecular data of BtCoV owing to poor surveillance in Africa. This also extends to information human coronaviruses such as hCoVOC43, hCoV229E, in which sequence data is limited to just a few countries such as Kenya and South Africa [28, 29] . Phylogenetically the genus Rhinolophus (Horse shoe bat) exhibited highest potential for intra-host diversity for BtCoV with the genus cocirculating both Sarbecovirus and Norbecovirus strains Figure 3 . Our observation was similar to that of a study from Thailand [30] and supports the theory of diverse intra/inter-host transmission among different bat species which has been reported in previous studies [31, 32] . Although we did not find this type of intra host genetic diversification among the African bat species in this study, it is believed that Rhinolophus bats are well distributed in Africa and are capable of zoonotic transmission of pathogenic hCoV such as SARS, as evidenced by a study that identified SARSrCoV antibodies among Rhinolophus bats in Africa [33] .The TMRCA for African Norbecovirus dating back to 1973, 95% HPD , and the TMRCA for Marbecovirus strains 2007 95% HPD (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) . This shows that Marbecovirus is relatively recent and probably evolved from the existing Norbecovirus strains. Evolutionary rate of the African BtβCoV was set at 1.301 × 10 -3 , HPD (1.064 × 10 -3 -1.434 × 10 -3 ), this is slightly higher that the evolutionary rate for the ongoing SARS CoV-2 which has been estimated to have an evolutionary rate of 8.0 × 10 -4 (www.nextstrain.org/ncov/global ). This is also slightly higher than the evolutionary rate reported for the partial RdRP gene of HuCoV OC43 of 1.06 × 10 -4 [34] . A similar topology was also observed for the MCC tree which included βCoV from Asia and Europe, with a MRCA of 1915 (HPD 1880 (HPD -1950 for all the strains, with the African strains showing the consistent TMRCA as described above (Figure 3 ). The African Norbecovirus strains seemed to emerge from their parental strain at around the year 1960 (HPD, 1930 (HPD, -1970 this observation supports the hypothesis that Norbecoviruses could have been circulating in Africa long before they were first isolated. Whereas for the South African Marbecovirus (lineage C) strains seemed to emerge from their parental lineage around the year 1987 (Figure 3) , indicating a more recent introduction into Africa, however studies have dated their origin based on partial RdrP gene to as back as 1859 [35] .Phylogeographic dispersal of the Bat β-CoV revealed numerous inter-continental spread events from China and Hong Kong into Central Africa (DRC and Kenya), Cameroun in West Africa, and South Africa, and also Mexico and Argentina in the Americas into West Africa Figure 4 . These long distance spread events may not necessarily represent actual transmission events, such as inter/intra-host transmission by migrating bat species, as bats have not been known to migrate across the Atlantic Ocean. However reports have shown the possibility of African bats to cover long distances during migration [37] . These observations simply represent genetic similarity and gene flow pathways of BtCoVs, which may due to other factors such as international trade in exotic and wild animals serving as intermediate host of these viruses. There were also dispersal of these viruses between France and some African countries such as Cameroun, South Africa and the DRC. There was also dispersal from Spain into Kenya, South Africa and Madagascar. We also observed dispersal across the Atlantic from Europe to Brazil, as well as across the Indian Ocean from Australia into East and Southern Africa. One limitation to this study is that we were unable to collect consistent data on the bat species from the reference isolates from other continents. Hence the data presented serves as a hypothetical model reflecting genetic dispersal of BtCoV and not species specific movements. The only dispersal event from Italy into Africa was into Nigeria. Studies have shown the potential for African fruit bats to migrate long distances covering thousands of Kilometers, for instance a study using satellite telemetry in Zambia showed that Elodiun hevium is capable of covering thousands of kilometers during migration [36] . Another study showed that African bats were capable of migration exceeding 2000km [37] . Intra-continental dispersal events were observed between Cameroun, DRC and South Africa, as well as direct dispersal from Cameroon into Madagascar. The AfrBtCoV strains displayed steady state population demography as depicted by their Bayesian Skyline plot ( Figure  5 ). The population demography reported in this study might not represent the true picture of the virus population, as the dataset utilized in this study is limited by its size and might not represent the true demographic population of BtCoV in Africa.We have presented data on the phylodiversity and evolutionary dynamics of Afr-βCoV and their possible dispersal across the continent. Mutiple dispersal pathways were identified between Europe and East/Southern Africa; there were also evidence of spread of BtCoV strains from Asia into Africa. We also identified three CoV sub-genera Norbecovirus, Hibecovirus and Marbecovirus circulating among African bat species with the probability of inter-species transmission among bats. We also identified multiple corona virus sub-genera co-circulating in China among the bat specie Rhinolophus sinicus, with the capability of zoonotic transmission [32, 33] . Study limitations include the lack of sufficient sequence data in Genebank covering AfrBtCoV, the relatively short genomic fragment analyzed and our inability to analyze spike protein sequence data of these viruses, as a result of paucity of African BtCoV spike protein sequences in established databases; this would have shed more light on their evolution in relation to infectivity and transmission. We have shown the importance of molecular surveillance of viruses with zoonotic potential such as coronaviruses. We advocate for broader trans-continental studies involving full genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the drivers for their emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population.

While social distancing is effective in normal social interactions, singing can produce a substantially larger number of respiratory droplets and aerosols than speaking, as it is louder and sustained for longer durations [2] . This may require further measures to be put into place to mitigate risks. In contained smaller spaces, the transmission risk may be higher, as respiratory aerosols may saturate the whole indoor environment [3] . Despite this, at present there is not a collective approach or response to the potential risks of group singing. Certain countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have banned all group singing activities [4] .Choir-related outbreaks of COVID-19 in Berlin, Amsterdam, and Washington State had high attack rates of 75.6%, 78.5% and 86.9% respectively [1, 4, 5] . Since restrictions have eased globally, a rise in outbreaks related to singing has been reported [6] . A large proportion of these documented outbreaks associated with singing (approx. 69%), were reported from the United States resulting in over 544 cases [1] .COVID-19 is assumed to be transmitted through respiratory and contact routes; and transmission by respiratory droplets is believed to occur only in close contact (within 1-2 m) with someone who is infectious [7] . However, there is uncertainty about the dynamics of respiratory emissions during singing. Additionally, studies have shown that droplet and airborne transmission may not be mutually exclusive modes of transmission and exist as a continuum [8] . Hence, unravelling the spread of respiratory particles during singing, especially in closed environments, could inform infection control policy and practice.To quantify and understand the spread of infection during singing we performed a detailed flow visualization of aerosols and droplets expelled during singing using an image-based flow diagnostic system. The visualisation technique employs a LED based light source (GS Vitec MultiLED PT) with a spherical lens to control the divergence of the light beam, along with a high-speed camera (nac MEMRECAM HX-7s) to capture the light scattered by the droplets expelled during singing. To capture the video, the head of the subject was adjusted in front of black backdrop/background and the light was positioned in a forward scatter arrangement to maximize the scattering from expelled droplets ( Figure 1 ).Once the position is adjusted, the subject was asked to sing a major scale using the solfège system and the high-speed video was captured with an exposure of 600 µs per frame at a resolution of 2 Megapixels. In addition to singing, the subject also counted from 1 to 10 and coughed voluntarily. The horizontal field of view captured in the high-speed video, from the mouth of the subject, was 26 cm approximately. Frames obtained from the video were first calibrated and a 2-axis stabilisation was applied to subject's head (Further details on this procedure can be found in [9] ). Thereafter, all the frames were processed with a hybrid Particle Tracking Velocimetry technique [10] . This technique first performs a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) procedure to estimate flow velocity and these estimates are subsequently refined using a particle tracking algorithm applied to each droplet. Specifically, for the PIV step we used a variable interrogation window with an initial size of 96 × 96 pixels and a final size of 48 × 48 pixels with an overlap of 75%. For particle tracking we used a correlation window of 64 pixels and particle size range of 2 to 100 pixels in order to cover the entire size range of visible droplets. The flow visualisation together with detailed particle tracking results are included in supplementary video.The results of detailed particle tracking (in supplementary video) reveals that the maximum velocity of droplets expelled, specifically for certain syllables such as 'do', 'fa' and 'ti', is approx. 6 m/s, which is similar to the velocities reported for speaking [11] . Upon further examining the motion of droplets at a distance of 15 cm from the mouth, we observed that almost 90% of the droplets are moving at velocities less than 1 m/s (Figure 2a) . The droplets moving with velocities greater than 1 m/s are moving in the direction between 120° -240° (θ = 0° towards subject (Figure 1) ) and move away from the mouth. Moreover, approx. 75% of droplets observed are moving at velocities less than 0.5 m/s and the motion is equally distributed in all the directions, which implies that they do not settle rapidly and may follow the ambient airflow pattern. These results points toward high aerosol generation, as the behaviour of these droplets is like airborne particles [12] . Nevertheless, to accurately quantify the size, future work using particle counters, is essential to better understand the dynamics of these droplets. Figure 2b shows the distribution of droplet velocities obtained at 15 cm from the mouth for syllable 'fa' and the direction in which these droplets are moving. Approximately 50% of the droplets are moving at velocities less than 0.5 m/s and more than 75% are moving away from mouth (θ = 120° to 240°), which is also evident in the supplementary video. Figure 2c shows the velocity distribution of droplets that are visible while the subject was singing syllable 'sol' & 'la' and the direction in which these droplets are moving. It can be observed that all droplets are moving at velocities less than 0.5 m/s and are equally distributed in all directions. The direction in which these droplets are moving is important because it implies that for a normal choir configuration with multiple rows and heights, these droplets can pose a risk to those in the adjacent rows as well as to those in the distant rows. Figure 2d and 2e shows the distribution for counting and coughing, respectively. In the case of coughing approximately 50% of the detected droplets were moving at velocities greater than 6 m/s whereas in case of speaking only 15% were moving at velocities greater than 6 m/s. We note, the loudness measured during singing was within the range of 66 -72 decibels. Further, it is also worth noting that some degree of variability is expected in the number of droplets expelled between different individuals, and due to other parameters, such as loudness, notes, consonants, and duration of each note sung. Nevertheless, the droplets observed do not appear to be settling down rapidly and without adequate ventilation, these droplets can potentially saturate the indoor environment which can likely explain the very high attack rates of COVID-19 seen in choirs in the US and Europe (almost 87% in Skagit County, Washington) [1] .We note the present study only provides visual evidence of the droplets and aerosols expelled during singing and compare the associated velocities and directions with speaking and coughing. However, these droplets have the capacity to potentially transmit viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We only used a basic major scale for our experiments and during singing various other factors comes into play, such as pitch, rhythm, diction, etc. and it would be valuable to investigate all these aspects for future studies to have a better understanding of droplet and aerosol generation while singing. Nonetheless, the data presented combined with high infection rate among the choir members (60 -90%) [1] points towards the possibility of airborne spread of COVID-19 during singing events, hence, should be considered when designing safety guidelines for public singing events.These findings could inform safety guidelines for restarting choirs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar respiratory infection outbreaks. For example, rehearsals could be done with fewer people, greater physical distancing between singers, or face coverings and masks to reduce droplet and aerosol expulsion [13] . In addition to that either well ventilated large spaces or outdoor performances should be utilised to minimize the risk of infection. ","Australia","first author","2020-09-18",9

Plasma pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, CCL2, CCL4, and CXCL9 were positively associated with COVID-19 severity (Figure 1a ), as were increases in circulating neutrophils, supporting findings from prior reports [2] .As an acute phase reactant that plays a key role in severe infections including pneumonia and sepsis, the complement cascade has been proposed as a possible driver of lung inflammation and the cytokine storm in COVID-19 [3, 4] . Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been shown to activate distinct complement pathways [3, 5] . Complement is a key innate immune pathway that rapidly responds to pathogens and cellular injury and amplifies a range of innate and adaptive immune processes. One of the key drivers of complement-mediated inflammation, is the C5 cleavage product, C5a, which acts through two different seven transmembrane receptors, namely C5aR1 and C5aR2 [6] . The former is a member of the large superfamily of plasma membrane receptors, known as G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in nearly every physiological process in mammals, including immune responses.In line with increased plasma cytokine concentrations, Carvelli and co-workers reported that plasma C5a was elevated in COVID-19 patients, and correlated with disease severity, with median C5a concentrations in ARDS patients reaching >250% those of healthy controls (Figure 1a ) [1] . C5aR1 is highly expressed on myeloid cells in the healthy state, and indeed, no major alteration in neutrophil or monocyte receptor expression was observed in COVID-19 subjects. However, human monocytes co-stimulated with C5a and a toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway activator R848, drove the in vitro production of some of the same cytokines as those observed from COVID-19 patients ( [1] , thus supporting a role for C5a in chemoattracting these C5aR1-expressing cells into the injured lung [7] . Indeed, immunohistochemistry staining and single-cell RNAseq transcriptomic data supported high expression of C5aR1 across myeloid cells and pulmonary macrophages in COVID-19 lungs [1] .There are currently multiple therapeutic candidates that target complement proteins at various stages of clinical development, with many of these drugs now undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19 disease. These approaches include blocking central complement factors C3 and C5, and their downstream activation cleavage products, complement pathway inhibitors (e.g. MASP-2 lectin pathway inhibitors), as well as specific complement effector molecules [3] . In the study by Carvelli and colleagues [1] , a targeted approach to C5aR1 was chosen to limit potentially immunocompromising consequences of blocking broader complement effector pathways, which might increase infection risk. Specifically, a fully human Fc-silent monoclonal antibody (mAb), avdoralimab (IPH5401), selectively blocked the C5a-C5aR1 interaction and its downstream signaling in human myeloid cells (Figure 1d ). This was confirmed by avdoralimab-mediated in vitro inhibition of C5a-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis and upregulation of adhesion molecule CD11b in neutrophils, suggesting that avdoralimab might be useful in preventing neutrophil recruitment in COVID-19 diseased lungs. As avdoralimab is specific to human C5aR1, its in vivo activity was tested in human C5aR1 knock-in (HuC5aR1) C57BL/6J mice (Figure 1e ): intra-nasal instillation of human C5ainduced key markers of acute lung inflammation [1] , consistent with those observed in samples from COVID-19 patients, namely, neutrophil and monocyte infiltration, vascular leakage, hemorrhage, and alveolar wall thickening [8] . These findings support the concept that C5a may constitute a key molecule that contributes to lung pathology in COVID-19 patients. Notably, avdoralimab treatment prior to C5a administration in this study led to marked reductions in leukocyte infiltration to the lung, attenuated lung edema, and reduced features of lung pathology relative to isotype-antibody control-treated animals, confirming a key role for myeloid cell-expressing C5aR1 in this mouse model (Figure 1e ) [1] . Moreover, avdoralimab also blocked C5a-mediated cytokine release from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof blood monocytes isolated from COVID-19 patients (IL-6, TNF-α, CCL2) (Figure 1f ) [1] . Overall, the study by Carvelli et al. [1] provides promising evidence that blockade of a single, yet major GPCR in acute myeloid cell-mediated lung inflammation, might ameliorate the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 ARDS. Evidently, this will require rigorous testing.An open question remains as to whether other complement effectors such as C3a and the terminal membrane attack complex (C5b-9), contribute to COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, blocking C5aR1 with compounds such as avdoralimab, leaves open the possibility that enhanced C5a activity occurs at its other receptor ligand C5aR2, which may have an impact on COVID-19 disease. Although not coupled to G-proteins, C5aR2 has been shown in mouse models of sepsis to worsen mortality, linking C5a-C5aR2-mediated production of HMGB1 [9] . However, recent evidence indicates that C5aR2 signaling might play protective anti-inflammatory roles, as selective C5aR2 activation in human macrophages in vitro has inhibited cytokine secretion in response to a wide variety of immune cell activators [10] . Considering that C5aR2 robustly recruits and may signal through βarrestins [5] , this pathway should be carefully considered when targeting the C5a-C5aR1 axis to simultaneously engage both pathways and potentially yield more favorable outcomes. Another important caveat of the in vivo murine study performed by Carvelli and colleagues [1] is that avdoralimab was administered prophylactically in mice to reduce C5a-mediated lung injury, which might not correlate with an actual clinical setting, assuming that avdoralimab in theory, would be administered to already-infected individuals. Thus, the timing of putative anti-C5aR1 treatments would be an important consideration when treating COVID-19 individuals, ensuring that the blockade of C5aR1-signaling occurs at a time where there is active C5aR1-mediated recruitment of study performed by Carvelli and colleagues [1] , accumulation of C5aR1-expressing macrophages around the arteries and in the thrombus were observed in endoarteritis lesions. Whether blockade of complement C5aR1 signaling might also impact on endothelialitis-associated microthrombosis in COVID-19 disease, remains to be determined.In conclusion, the study by the Vivier and Explore COVID-19 Marseille Immunopole groups [1] potentially opens the door for a new direction in COVID-19 research that focuses on targeting the ","Australia","first author","2020-09-23",9

Using an established ""in silico flow cytometry"" pipeline (31) , I estimated the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells, resting and activated NK cells, M1 macrophages, dendritic cells, CD4 ϩ T cells, and neutrophils in these tissues (see Fig. S1a to c and Table S1 in the supplemental material). These levels were compared to ACE2 expression levels in these lung tissues. This revealed that ACE2 expression is negatively correlated with the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells, resting and activated NK cells, and M1 macrophages (P Ͻ 8 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 , Pearson correlations) (Fig. 1a to c) . However, there are no statistically significant correlations between ACE2 expression and the levels of CD4 ϩ T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils (P Ͼ 0.05) (Fig. S2a to d) . Thus, the levels of a majority of leukocytes involved in antiviral immune responses are significantly lower in lung tissues with high ACE2 expression levels.It is possible that some of the above observations are linked to phenotypic characteristics, such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), race, or smoking status. To test the robustness of our findings, I applied multivariable regression analysis that includes these five covariates (Table S2) , as well as the levels of the above seven leukocyte types or states. This showed that only 4 of the 12 variables significantly contribute to predicting ACE2 expression levels, specifically the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells, resting NK cells, activated NK cells, and M1 macrophages (Fig. 1a to c and Table 1 ). Notably, none of the five added phenotypic covariates showed statistically significant contributions. Consistently, I found limited statistically significant correlations between these variables and ACE2 expression in univariate analyses, irrespective of whether they were analyzed as continuous data or binned into discrete ordinal categories (Fig. S3a to j) . Thus, the FIG 1 Baseline levels of cytotoxic lymphocytes inversely correlate with ACE2 expression in the lung. (a to c) The correlations between the baseline levels of CD8 ϩ T cells, resting NK cells, and activated NK cells (x axes) and those of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 (y axes) in human lung tissue are shown. Data are from the GTEx data set (n ϭ 578). (d to f) The same correlations are shown for lung tissues in the LUG data set (n ϭ 1,349). Regression lines and 95% confidence intervals are shown. Pearson correlation R and P values are shown, q values are Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P values using a false discovery rate of 0.05, and mp values are multivariate P values ( Table 1) . levels of four types of leukocytes that respond to viral infection are low in lung tissue with high ACE2 expression levels independently of phenotypic covariates.Next, whether the above observations could be validated in an independent cohort of individuals was tested. For this, I used, to my knowledge, the largest publicly available lung tissue data set. The Laval University, University of British-Columbia, Groningen University (LUG) data set, including microarray gene expression data of 1,349 human lung tissues, was used. Following determination of ACE2 expression levels and estimation of the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells, resting NK cells, activated NK cells, and M1 macrophages (Fig. S1a to c and Table S1), I found that three of the four also negatively correlated with ACE2 expression in this independent data set (P Ͻ 2 ϫ 10 Ϫ8 ) ( Fig. 1d to f). With a correlation coefficient of R ϭ 0.096, only M1 macrophages did not correlate with ACE2 expression in this data set (Fig. S4) . Thus, our observations indicate that the baseline levels of three types of cytotoxic lymphocytes, specifically CD8 ϩ T cells, resting NK cells, and activated NK cells, are robustly and consistently low in lung tissue with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2.To more rigorously assess our observations, a range of additional analyses was employed. Although highly statistically significant (all P values Ͻ 4.1 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 , Fig. 1 ), the absolute Pearson R values between baseline levels of ACE2 and the three lymphocyte types seemed to be low, as they ranged between 0.2 and 0.3 ( Fig. 1a to c). To test how strong these are in relative terms, the Pearson R and P values of 1,000 randomly sampled other genes were calculated. This revealed that the ACE2 R and P values were significantly lower than expected by chance (all one-sample t test P Ͻ 2.2 ϫ 10 Ϫ16 ; Fig. 2a and b ). In addition, these R and P values ranked in the top 0.4 to 11 percentiles of strongest and most significant correlations for each of the three leukocyte types ( Fig. 2a and b) . Thus, the seemingly low correlations between ACE2 mRNA and cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung are not only highly statistically significant but also strong in relative terms.Further, how well ACE2 mRNA and protein levels correlate was tested. Using the mRNA and protein levels in 52 cell lines, ACE2 mRNA levels were found to strongly correlate with ACE2 protein levels in human cells (Pearson R ϭ 0.8155, P ϭ 1.8 ϫ 10 Ϫ13 ; Fig. 2c ). In fact, ACE2 ranks in the top 1.8 percentile of over 12,000 genes with the strongest mRNA-protein level correlations (P Ͻ 2.2 ϫ 10 Ϫ16 ; Fig. 2d ). Using two ACE2specific antibodies, immunochemistry on 40 human tissues also shows a strong ACE2 mRNA-protein correlation (P ϭ 0.0011, Kruskal-Wallis test; Fig. 2e ), and this is additionally validated by a meta-analysis conducted using nine published studies (Pearson R ϭ 0.7130, P ϭ 0.0013; Fig. 2f and Table S3 ). Therefore, I conclude that ACE2 mRNA and protein levels very strongly correlate, both in human cells and in human tissues.Above, I found that baseline ACE2 levels in the lung negatively correlate with CD8 ϩ T cells and resting and activated NK cells in multivariate analyses and in an independent data set ( Fig. 1a to f) . Several cytokines, including C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) to CCL5, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, CXCL16, and interleukin 18 (IL-18), are known to chemotactically attract CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) . Consistently, I find that the baseline levels of these chemokines in human lung tissue typically significantly correlate with the baseline levels of CD8 ϩ T cells and resting and activated NK cells ( Fig. 2g and Fig. S5 ). Additionally, as expected given the results above, significant negative correlations were found between the levels of ACE2 and the levels of six of these eight cytokines in the lung (Fig. 2h) . These findings lend further support to my previous observations, suggesting that high levels of said cytokines in the lung establish a favorable milieu for cytotoxic lymphocytes, which correlates with low ACE2 levels.Next, the direct consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed. In vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells invariably leads to upregulation of all eight above-mentioned CD8 ϩ T cell-and NK cell-attracting cytokines, with six of these increases showing statistical significance (Fig. 2i) . Similarly, compared to control lung tissues, all eight cytokines are upregulated in lung tissues from COVID-19 patients, with five showing statistical significance (Fig. 2j) . Moreover, the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells are higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from mildly affected COVID-19 patients than from severe cases, with CD8 ϩ T cells and a subset of NK cells, inflammatory NK cells, showing a statistically significant higher level (Fig. 2k) . These findings are corroborated in a different cohort of patients, additionally showing a highly significant increase in a tissue-resident signature score for CD8 ϩ T cells (Fig. 2k) . Thus, together, these observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells stimulates CD8 ϩ T cell-and NK cell-attracting cytokines and that these cytotoxic lymphocytes are important for preventing severe symptoms of COVID-19.Finally, whether the levels of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell protease TMPRSS2 shows similar correlations with the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells in the lung was tested. In univariate analyses, baseline TMPRSS2 levels in the lung show significant negative correlations with these lymphocyte levels, although in multivariate analyses, these correlations are statistically significant only for CD8 ϩ T cells and activated NK cells (Fig. 3a to c) . The corresponding R and P values are typically also significantly lower than expected by chance ( Fig. 3d and e) . Furthermore, TMPRSS2 mRNA and protein levels strongly correlate (R ϭ 0.8048, P Ͻ 2.2 ϫ 10 Ϫ16 , Fig. 3f ), and TMPRSS2 is in the top 2.5 percentile of genes that show the strongest mRNA-protein correlation (P Ͻ 2.2 ϫ 10 Ϫ16 , Fig. 3g ). Additionally, TMPRSS2 expression tends to correlate negatively with CD8 ϩ T cell-and NK cell-attracting cytokines (Fig. 3h) . Therefore, albeit typically to a lesser extent, baseline TMPRSS2 expression levels in the lung negatively correlate with the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells in a manner similar to ACE2.Taken together, these observations suggest that a subgroup of individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to developing severe COVID-19 due to concomitant high preexisting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and low baseline levels of CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells in the lung (Fig. 3i) .I investigated the baseline expression levels of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2 and the host cell entry protease TMPRSS2 and the baseline levels of all (46, 47) . The second study also determined a tissue resident (TR) score for CD8 ϩ T cells. Numbers in the mild/moderate column on the left show fold increase compared to the respective severe cases on the right. Asterisks in the severe column on the right represent statistical significance levels, as determined by Mann-Whitney U tests (top panel), or t tests (middle and bottom panels) comparing mild/moderate to severe cases. P value symbols: *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001; ****, P Ͻ 0.0001; †, P Ͻ 2.2 ϫ 10 Ϫ16 . Duijf seven types of antiviral leukocytes in 1,927 human lung tissue samples. Although SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism is broad (16) (17) (18) , I focused on lung tissue. In addition to epithelial cells elsewhere in the respiratory tract, alveolar epithelial cells are thought to be a primary SARS-CoV-2 entry point (16, 28) . Consistently, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is expressed in these cells at the mRNA and protein levels (28, (38) (39) (40) . Moreover, in severely affected COVID-19 patients, the lungs are among the few organs that present with the most life-threatening symptoms. ""Cytokine storm""-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), widespread alveolar damage, pneumonia, and progressive respiratory failure have been observed (41, 42) . These indications frequently require admission to intensive care units (ICUs), and mechanical ventilation and may ultimately be fatal.Early after infection, rapid activation of the innate immune system is of para- Low Cytotoxic Lymphocyte Levels, a COVID-19 Risk Factor mount importance for the clearance of virus infections. Infected cells typically do so through release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in particular type I and III interferons (19, 20) . Notably, however, several studies have highlighted multiple complexities related specifically to SARS-CoV2 and innate immune system activation at early stages. First, unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissue initially fails to induce a range of immune cell-recruiting molecules, including several interferons (17, 27) , suggesting that leukocytes are ineffectively recruited to the infected lung shortly after infection. Second, the host cell entry receptor ACE2 has been identified as an interferon target gene (28) . Thus, even when interferons are upregulated in order to recruit immune cells, concomitant upregulation of ACE2 expression may in fact exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection (28) . These findings suggest that the levels of immune cells that already reside in the lung prior to infection may be more critical for dampening SARS-CoV-2 infection at early stages than they are for fighting infections of other viruses. Cytotoxic lymphocytes, including CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells, are key early responders to virus infections, and these are the cells whose baseline levels were identified here as significantly reduced in lung tissue with elevated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. That these immune cells are important in preventing severe COVID-19 is supported by the fact that their levels are significantly higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients with mild cases than from patients with severe cases. Therefore, our results suggest that individuals with increased baseline susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs may also be less well equipped from the outset to mount a rapid antiviral cellular immune response (Fig. 3i) .Several observations indicate that these cytotoxic lymphocytes are critically important for effective control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent studies showed that CD8 ϩ T cells in peripheral blood are considerably reduced and functionally exhausted in COVID-19 patients, in particular in elderly patients and in severely affected patients that require ICU admission (43) (44) (45) . Reduced CD8 ϩ T cell counts also predict poor COVID-19 patient survival (43) . Additionally, CD8 ϩ T cell-and NK cell-attracting cytokines are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung cells and in lung tissues from COVID-19 patients, and the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells are higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from mildly affected COVID-19 patients than in patients with severe disease (46, 47) .The five phenotypic parameters, sex, age, BMI, race, and smoking history, did not statistically significantly contribute to variation in ACE2 expression in human lung tissue, either in univariate or in multivariate analyses. This is consistent with some studies but inconsistent with others (42, (48) (49) (50) . These paradoxical observations may be partially explained by differing gender, age, and race distributions within each study cohort.Further research will be required to elucidate the precise mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of the innate immune system early after infection. However, the link identified here between high baseline ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and reduced cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in human lung tissue prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is striking. It suggests that increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs may be accompanied by a poorer ability to mount a rapid innate immune response at early stages. This may predict long-term outcome of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, given that the levels of CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells are significantly higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from mild cases compared to severe patients (46, 47) . Finally, it may contribute to the substantial variation in COVID-19 clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory and other symptoms.Discovery data set and processing. Gene expression data and corresponding phenotype data from human lung tissues (n ϭ 578) were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Portal (https:// gtexportal.org), managed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Gene expression data were publicly available. Access to phenotype data required authorization. The GTEx protocol was previously described (29, 30) . Briefly, total RNA was extracted from tissue. Following mRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and library preparation, samples were subjected to HiSeq2000 or HiSeq2500 Illumina TrueSeq RNA sequencing. Gene expression levels were obtained using RNA-SeQC v1.1.9 (51) and expressed in transcripts per million (TPM). Reported gene-level expression levels were log 2 transformed, unless indicated otherwise.Validation data set and processing. For validation purposes, the Laval University, University of British-Columbia, Groningen University (LUG) lung tissue data set (n ϭ 1,349) was used. This data set was accessed via Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), accession number GSE23546, and was previously described (52) . Briefly, total RNA from human lung tissue samples was isolated, quantified, quality checked, and used to generate cDNA, which was amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Arrays were scanned, and probe-level gene expression values were normalized using robust multichip average (RMA). These normalized values were obtained from GEO. To collapse probe-level expression data to single expression levels per gene, for each gene the probe with the highest median absolute deviation (MAD) was used. The MAD for each probe p was calculated using equation 1where M is the median, p i denotes probe p's expression level in sample i, and M (p) represents the median signal of probe p.

The levels of seven types of leukocytes involved in antiviral cellular immune response, specifically CD8 ϩ T cells, resting NK cells, activated NK cells, M1 macrophages, CD4 ϩ T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, were estimated in the discovery and validation lung tissue samples using a previously described approach (31) . Specifically, the following workflow was used. First, only non-logtransformed expression values were used. Thus, where required, expression values for all samples in the discovery and validation data sets were reverse log 2 transformed using equation 2 c ϭ 2 c l Ϫ 1 (2) where c denotes the calculated non-log 2 -transformed expression counts and c l denotes the previously reported log 2 -transformed expression counts. Next, to compensate for potential technical differences between signatures and bulk sample gene expression values due to interplatform variation, bulk mode batch correction was applied. To ensure robustness, deconvolution was statistically analyzed using 100 permutations. Pearson correlation coefficients R, root mean squared errors (RMSA), and P values are reported on a per-sample level in Fig. S1a to c and Table S1 in the supplemental material. Univariate statistical analyses. Log 2 -transformed expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in lung tissue samples were compared to the estimated levels of seven leukocyte types or states. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to determine Pearson correlation coefficients R and P values. P values were adjusted at a false discovery rate of 0.05 to yield q values, as previously described (53) . Straight lines represent the minimized sum of squares of deviations of the data points with 95% confidence intervals shown. Continuous phenotypic covariates were analyzed in the same way and, additionally, as discrete ordinal categories after binning. Discrete and binned phenotype data were statistically evaluated using Mann-Whitney U tests. All analyses were performed in the R computing environment (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Multivariate regression analyses. Multivariate analyses were performed using standard ordinary least-squares regression, summarized in equation 3.where ␤ 0 denotes the intercept, while ␤ k represents the slope of each variable X k in a model with n variables and denotes the random error component. These analyses were performed using R. mRNA and protein levels in human cells. Available ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and corresponding protein levels in 52 and 124 human cell lines, respectively, were obtained from references 54 and 55. The correlations between mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by linear regression analysis using Pearson correlations. Pearson coefficients R for mRNA-protein level correlations were also determined for 12,015 other genes. To test whether the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coefficients and P values were statistically significantly lower than for other genes, one-sample t tests were used. mRNA and protein levels in human tissues. Two types of analyses were performed to compare mRNA and protein levels in human tissues. First, mRNA expression levels from 40 human tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org). These levels represented the consensus normalized mRNA expression levels from three sources, specifically, Human Protein Atlas in-house RNAseq data, RNAseq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and CAGE data from FANTOM5 project. Corresponding ordinal human tissue protein expression levels (""not detected,"" ""low,"" and ""'high"") were also obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. These levels were based on immunohistochemical staining of the tissues using DAB (3,3=-diaminobenzidine)-labeled antibodies (HPA000288 and CAB026174), followed by knowledge-based annotation, as described on the website. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to assess whether mRNA and protein levels significantly correlated.Second, a meta-analysis was performed. For this, mRNA and protein expression levels were obtained from nine different sources. Tissue mRNA levels were obtained from six sources, as determined by Northern blotting (56) , quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (57), microarray hybridization (58), RNA sequencing (59) , and cap analysis of gene expression (60) . Tissue protein levels were obtained from three sources, as determined by mass spectrometry (61) and immunohistochemistry (39, 62) . For each source and tissue, mRNA and protein expression levels were scored as ""not detected,"" ""low,"" ""interme-Low Cytotoxic Lymphocyte Levels, a COVID-19 Risk Factor September/October 2020 Volume 5 Issue 5 e00741-20 msystems.asm.org 9 diate,"" or ""high"" and these received scores of 0 to 3, respectively. For each tissue, the final mRNA and protein scores were calculated by averaging the scores from the respective six and three sources (Table S3) . Strength and significance level of the correlation between the final scores were determined by linear regression analysis using Pearson correlation. Cytokine levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells. SARS-CoV-2-induced fold increases in the expression levels of eight cytotoxic lymphocyte-attracting cytokines, CCL2-5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL16, and IL-18, were determined from reference 27. These increases represent the fold increase in expression in Calu-3 lung cells, 24 h after infection with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection of 2, compared to uninfected Calu-3 cells.Cytokine levels in control and COVID-19 lung tissues. Baseline levels of the above eight cytokines in lung tissues were obtained from the GTEx project, as described above, and compared to the baseline levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD8 ϩ T cells, resting and activated NK cells in these tissues, estimated as described above. Their levels were compared using Spearman's rank correlations (R and P values). For comparison of cytokine levels in postmortem COVID-19 lung tissues (n ϭ 2) to those in healthy, uninfected lung tissues (n ϭ 2), fold increases were determined following RNAseq analyses and previously reported (27) .Lymphocyte levels in COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. The levels of CD8 ϩ T cells, NK cells, and inflammatory NK cells in bronchoalveolar lavages from mild (n ϭ 2) and severe (n ϭ 22) COVID-19 patients were reported elsewhere and determined using single-cell RNAseq (46) . Statistical significance levels were assessed using Mann-Whitney U tests. The levels of T cells and NK cells, as well as a CD8 ϩ T cell tissue-resident signature score, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from moderate (n ϭ 3) and severe/critical (n ϭ 5) COVID-19 patients were reported in another study (47) .Data availability. The data sets used for the analyses described in this study were obtained from dbGaP at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap through dbGaP accession number phs000424.v8.p2.Supplemental material is available online only.

The first evidence of community transmission in New Zealand was reported on 23 March 2020, the country went into an intense 'Alert Level 4' lockdown (the highest level of a 4-level response system) three days later and remained at this Alert Level for the following five weeks (Baker, Kvalsvig & Verrall, 2020) . During this time there was notable increase in national nucleic acid testing capacity and this remains the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. However, there is also a need for reliable serological assays that measure antibody responses to the virus. While serological assays are not suited to the diagnosis of acute infections due to the days required to generate an antibody response, they are critical for determining past exposure and investigating immune responses (Abbasi, 2020; Sethuraman, Jeremiah & Ryo, 2020; .Numerous laboratory-based serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed worldwide including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and bead-based immunoassays for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Petherick, 2020; Garcia-Basteiro et al., 2020; , as well as virus neutralisation assays for quantification of neutralising antibodies Anderson et al., 2020) . The spike protein (S protein) expressed by SARS-CoV-2 contains a receptor binding domain (RBD), which interacts with host cells via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (Diamond & Pierson, 2020) . The S protein is highly immunogenic and, given the integral role of the S protein and RBD in facilitating viral entry, these antigens form the basis of many immunoassays described to date (Duan et al., 2020; Garcia-Basteiro et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; Amanat et al., 2020) . Recent data from immunoassays based on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein also show high sensitivity (Sethuraman, Jeremiah & Ryo, 2020; Bryan et al., 2020) . However, the higher sequence conservation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with other coronaviruses, compared to the S protein, increases the possibility of antibody crossreactivity against the nucleoprotein in those infected with related viruses Anderson et al., 2020) .As New Zealand entered Alert Level 4 Lockdown, and the supply chain of diagnostic reagents for managing COVID-19 testing was a widely held domestic concern, we sought to establish a serologic ELISA assay based on locally-produced SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We adapted the two-step ELISA protocols developed at The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York City) based on the S protein and RBD, which has FDA Emergency Use Authorization Stadlbauer et al., 2020) . A panel of sera/plasma from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients was compared with prepandemic sera to determine assay parameters. The relationship between antibody binding to the S protein and RBD, and neutralising ability was explored using the surrogate viral neutralisation test (sVNT) recently developed at Duke-NUS (Singapore) . Finally, the utility of both the ELISA and sVNT to identify prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated in a cohort of PCR-negative patients that presented to hospital with respiratory symptoms during the lockdown period.Human plasma and sera were obtained from several different sources, all of which were granted ethical approval by the University of Auckland Human Ethics Committee or the Health and Disability Ethics Committee in New Zealand. A total of 113 samples collected before 2020 were used as negative controls and all participants (or their parents or legal 109 guardians) provided written informed consent. These included healthy adult volunteers (n = 31) (ethics UOA021200), hospitalised adults with bacteraemia or bacterial pneumonia (n = 25) (ethics HDEC 17/STH/233), together with children infected with various respiratory viruses (n = 57) (ethics HDEC 17/NTA/262) (Bennett et al., 2019) . The patients with bacterial pneumonia had signs, symptoms and radiological imaging diagnostic of pneumonia and Streptococcus pneumoniae identified. The COVID-19 panel comprised serum and plasma (n = 21) obtained from 17 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and those with respiratory symptoms fitting the case definition for COVID-19 testing that were subsequently found negative by PCR (n = 82). The PCR-confirmed and PCR-negative patients were admitted to Middlemore or Auckland City hospitals in Auckland, New Zealand between March and May 2020 with residual sera/plasma stored following completion of all routine testing for validation of antibody diagnostics (ethics HDEC 20NTB76) ( Table 1 ). All serum and plasma samples were heated at 56 C for 30 min before use to inactivate any residual virus, as published . Pooled human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were produced before 2020 from >1,500 donors in New Zealand (Intragram P) and Europe and North America (Privigen) (CSL Behring).The S protein and RBD antigens were expressed and purified from pCAGGS-RBD and pCAGGS-solSpike vectors respectively, kindly provided by Florian Krammer (The Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai, New York City, NY, USA) using Expi293F or Freestyle293 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and published protocols , but with a modified transient transfection protocol using polyethyleneimine (PEI). Plasmid DNA was added at 3.5 mg/mL with PEI 7.0 at mg/mL for 24 h, after which culture volumes were doubled and supplemented with 2.2 mM valproic acid. Cultures were incubated with shaking for a further 72 h before protein purification was performed.The two-step ELISA protocol that includes a single point screen against the RBD, followed by a confirmatory titration against the S protein , was utilised with minor modifications. In step one immunoplates were coated with RBD (5 mg/ml) overnight at 4 C and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 3% skim milk powder at 20 C for 1 h. Serum or plasma diluted 1:100 in diluent buffer (PBST + 1% skim milk powder) was added for 1 h at 20 C. Following washing (3× PBST), peroxidase-labelled anti-human IgG (97221; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) diluted 1:10,000 was added for 1 h at 20 C. The reaction was developed with 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and stopped with 1M HCl. The optical density (OD) at 450-570 nm was measured using an EnSight absorbance reader. In step two, immunoplates were coated with S protein (5 mg/ml) overnight at 4 C and the ELISA was performed using the same protocol as in step one, except that 3-fold serial dilutions of samples starting at 1:100, were prepared. Samples were classified as seropositive if they had an OD above the calculated cutoff (>0.2) in the single point RBD ELISA and in at least two consecutive wells in the S protein titration ELISA. Positive and negative quality controls were included on each plate, with the assay meeting acceptance criteria if the OD was >0.75 and <0.03 for the positive and negative control, respectively. To assess healthy control IgG reactivity to human coronaviruses (HCoV) ELISA were performed as described above with S1 antigens from HKU1, NL63, 229E and SARS-CoV-2 (Sino Biological, Beijing, China) coated at 5 mg/ml and a 1:300 sera dilution. Samples from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were also subject to isotype-specific titration ELISA using peroxidase-labelled anti-human IgG (97221; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), anti-human IgM (97205; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and anti-human IgA (97215; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at 1:10,000 dilution. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare isotype-specific antibody titres and was calculated by subtracting background AUC of pooled negative control sera for each isotype in Prism 8 (GraphPad).Surrogate neutralisation assays were carried out using a SARS-CoV-2 sVNT Kit supplied pre-launch by GenScript as described . Briefly, serum or plasma was diluted 1:20 before incubation with an equivalent volume of peroxidase-conjugated RBD for 30 min at 37 C. This was added to wells pre-coated with human ACE-2 receptor protein and incubated for a further 15 min at 37 C. Following washing and TMB development the OD 450 nm was measured using an EnSight absorbance reader. Inhibition was calculated as (1-OD sample/OD of negative control) × 100. Samples with a percentage inhibition ≥20% were deemed to have neutralising antibodies.The two-step ELISA and sVNT analysis utilised a Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison between three groups with Dunn's multiple comparisons test. AUC data were log10 transformed to achieve a Gaussian distribution and analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Correlations were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Data were analysed using Prism 8 (GraphPad) or R (version 3.6.3) within R Studio (version 1.2.5033) and a P value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.The RBD and S proteins used as antigens in the ELISA were shown to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE following expression and purification from mammalian (HEK derived) cells. In line with previous reports the yield of RBD was approximately 10-fold higher per litre of culture than the S protein . To establish ELISA cut-off values a panel of 113 sera collected prior to 2020 were tested, with the cut-off defined as mean plus three-standard deviations. Importantly, this panel included samples from participants with bacterial pneumonia and common respiratory viruses that have symptom overlap with SARS-CoV-2 infections ( Table 1 ). The healthy control sera (n = 31) within the panel showed broad reactivity with S protein antigens from HCoV (HKU1, NL63, 229E), but not for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S1 ). As shown in Fig. 1A , all serum samples from PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients collected ≥7 days from symptom onset had IgG above the determined cut-off in the RBD screening ELISA (P < 0.0001), while the pooled IVIG preparations (representing >1,500 donors each) were negative.To illustrate the utility of the second confirmatory ELISA, samples with absorbance close to the cut-off in the RBD screen were titrated against the S protein. As shown in Fig. 1B , the anti-S protein IgG titration clearly separated the true positives from the false positives, as only the PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples met the seropositive criteria (OD > cut-off in at least two consecutive dilutions). Indeed, this second ELISA resulted in all pre-pandemic samples being classified as negative and a calculated specificity of 100%, albeit in a moderately sized sample panel. The use of IgM and IgA in the two-step ELISA protocol were also explored, however IgM was found to have lower sensitivity with only 4/18 of the 7+ day COVID-19 samples being seropositive, compared with 18/18 (100%) for IgG. IgA was deemed unsuitable as the assay window was inferior to that of IgG (OD range 0.01-0.82 compared with 0.01-1.42), and recent reports highlighted reduced sensitivity and specificity for IgA based SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (Meyer et al., 2020; Beavis et al., 2020) .Isotyping ELISA performed with the PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples showed significantly higher titres for IgG compared with IgM and IgA for both the RBD and S protein (Figs. 1C and 1D, P < 0.01). Of note, only one sample had IgM levels higher than IgG, with the remaining 20 samples having higher IgG than IgM, despite~40% of the samples being collected within 2-weeks of symptom onset.The presence of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) capable of blocking the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the hACE-2 receptor was assessed using sVNT ( Fig. 2A ) . To validate performance, the pre-pandemic panel (n = 113) was compared with the PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. Using the cut-off value of 20% inhibition recommended by the manufacturer, all control samples tested were negative, resulting in a 100% specificity. Similarly, all sera from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected ≥7 days from symptom onset were positive for a sensitivity of 100%. An experimentally calculated cutoff of 19.59% (mean + 3SD of controls) also gave 100% sensitivity and there was a significant increase in the level of NAbs (% inhibition) in the 7+ day COVID-19 samples compared with controls (P < 0.001).A correlation analysis of the sVNT with ELISA titre data for IgG, IgM and IgA against the RBD and S protein found the highest correlation between the sVNT and anti-RBD IgG (r = 0.91, P < 0.0001), suggesting anti-RBD IgG is the best predictor of neutralisation (Fig. 2B) . Temporal samples were available for three of the PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, with increasing NAbs detected in patient one between days 6 and 9, and higher levels of NAbs in patients two and three between days 11 and 31 and days 15 and 31, respectively (Fig. 2C ). In keeping, there was a significant, positive correlation between days from symptom onset and the level of NAbs (% inhibition) in the PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patient group up to 40 days ( Fig. 2D ; r = 0.54, P < 0.05).To assess the utility of the two-step ELISA protocol and the sVNT in detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 82 patients who presented to hospital during the lockdown period with respiratory symptoms fitting the case definition for COVID-19 testing, but negative for PCR, were analysed. A single patient was classified as seropositive in the two-step ELISA (RBD screen, OD 0.87; S protein titration OD > 0.2 in four consecutive dilution wells, Supplemental Data). Similarly, only one patient was classified as positive in the sVNT with 65.5% inhibition ( Fig. 2A) . This was the same patient identified using the two-step ELISA, indicating a prior undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the patient was PCR negative at presentation, they had notable travel history as a risk factor.At the time of writing, New Zealand has eliminated community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This is a very different scenario to that during Alert Level 4 Lockdown, when human activity was severely restricted, and the perceived need for rapid establishment of serological assays was significant. Through the generous sharing of reagents and technical expertise by the international scientific community, and highly collaborative efforts of scientists and clinicians across the country we were able to establish and assess the described serological assays in a matter of weeks. These assays detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the presence of neutralising antibodies, in persons who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least seven days after symptom onset, with repeat sampling recommended in those where samples are obtained <7 days from symptom onset. While the lack of community transmission in New Zealand has limited the scale of serological investigations thus far, maintaining our current state requires near-perfect management of returning travellers, as new cases are imported. Serological assays could have a key role in our border setting, identifying persons who have previously had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the application of serological assays that enable accurate measurement and further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses are crucial to any 'exit strategy' reliant on effective vaccines and/or therapeutics (Baker, Kvalsvig & Verrall, 2020) .The two-step ELISA protocol is based on published protocols , with the seropositive cut-off established using a panel of pre-pandemic sera that showed bacterial pneumonia and other common respiratory infections such as rhinovirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus did not cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S proteins. Although the pre-pandemic panel does not include samples from known human coronavirus infections, the healthy control sera in the panel had broad reactivity with HCoV antigens. This is consistent with other studies, which have reported that the majority of banked pre-pandemic sera react with human coronavirus antigens given the ubiquitous nature of these infections Juno et al., 2020) . Furthermore, neither of the pooled IVIG preparations derived from >1,500 donors tested in this study reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD or S proteins, consistent with the negligible crossreactivity of human coronavirus sera reported by the assay developers Tan et al., 2020) .All PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients showed strong seroconversion a week after symptom onset, with mean ELISA AUC titre for anti-RBD IgG of 1:1,500. Although our sample size was limited, the antibody responses follow trends observed in larger COVID-19 cohorts in settings with higher case numbers. This includes a concurrent rise in IgM and IgG , and robust antibody responses to the full-length S protein, as well as RBD Amanat et al., 2020; Juno et al., 2020) . The level of NAbs, which block the interaction of the RBD with the hACE-2 receptor was highly correlated with anti-RBD IgG in this study. This is in keeping with observations that most SARS-CoV-2 neutralising epitopes are localised in the RBD (Ju et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) and that neutralisation measured by conventional, viral neutralisation assays is reported to correlate with the sVNT . While more extensive comparison of the sVNT with gold standard viral neutralisation assays is required, the ability of the assay to measure total NAbs in less than 2 h, without the need to handle live SARS-CoV-2 virus, provides strong rationale to consider these types of assays in pandemic management, particularly in settings where BSL3 laboratory infrastructure is limited.Serological tests are traditionally used to support clinical diagnosis by determining recent or prior infection when swab results are negative (Bryant et al., 2020) . In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections, serology could confirm diagnosis in individuals who are PCR negative due to late presentation or technical limitations of swab-based tests. Proof of principle was demonstrated in this study by the identification of a seropositive individual in the two-step ELISA and the sVNT from a cohort of 82 patients with respiratory symptoms that presented to hospital during the Alert level 4 lockdown period. The positive serology results, combined with travel history, suggest a prior undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the value of accurate serology in clinical diagnosis. Extending the application of serology to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission within clusters was recently demonstrated in Singapore, where detection of seropositive individuals enabled three small clusters to be connected (Yong et al., 2020) . Beyond transmission studies, serological testing in managed isolation facilities could provide a more complete picture of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections in returning citizens in settings like New Zealand where strict border restrictions remain.Large scale serosurveys require careful consideration of assay sensitivity and specificity. While the serological assays described in this study show very high sensitivity and specificity, markedly larger cohorts would need to be tested before robust assessments of accuracy can be performed. Indeed, the need for rigorously validated assays is arguably greater in low prevalence settings like New Zealand before wide-spread serosurveys are considered. Even an assay with near perfect specificity of 99.9% would identify 100 false positives in every 100,000 individuals, and with <0.1% of the New Zealand population having been infected, positive predictive value is extremely limited. In contrast, targeted studies of high-risk individuals such as health care workers, those linked with clusters and in managed isolation would provide an opportunity to assess serological assay performance, and generate critical local data on levels of antibodies in those with symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection Bryant et al., 2020) . Studies that incorporate RBD-based assays such as those described here, as well as the nucleoprotein as per the high-throughput systems recently launched by Roche and Abbott (Bryan et al., 2020) , would provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 exposure together with antibody neutralisation, and lay the foundation for future studies aimed at understanding long-term antibody persistence and vaccine efficacy.In summary, the collective support of international colleagues combined with a collaborative domestic network of scientists and clinicians enabled serological assays for COVID-19 to be established during a nationwide lockdown. The success of the open approach we have taken may offer considerable advantages in other settings where access to reagents and resources is currently constrained. Importantly, these assays showed that hospitalised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop high levels of neutralising antibodies. While the low prevalence of COVID-19 infections in New Zealand currently limits the use of serological assays in population level serosurveys, they have immediate utility in clinical diagnostics, studies to understand transmission in high-risk cohorts and underpinning longer-term 'exit' strategies based on effective vaccines and/or therapeutics.","New Zealand","abstract","2020-09-03",9

Yet, the quantity and complexity of 50 SARS-CoV-2 genomic data (and metadata) make it challenging and costly for the majority of 51 scientists to stay abreast of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in a way that is meaningful to their specific 52 research goals. Currently, each group or organization has to independently expend labor, 53 computing costs, and, most importantly, time to curate and analyze the genomic data from 54 GISAID before they can generate specific hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 lineages and 55 mutations in their population(s) of interest. 56To address this challenge, we built COVID-19 CoV Genetics (COVID-19 CG, covidcg.org), a 59 found in only 1.05% of the Australian SARS-CoV-2 sequences before June, now constitutes 84 more than 90% of the sequenced June through August isolates ( Figure 2C ). This geographical 85 and temporal variation is important to incorporate into the design and testing of therapeutic 86 antibodies (such as those under development as therapeutics by Regeneron that specifically 87 target the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD), as well as mRNA or recombinant protein-based vaccines. 88This will help to assure developers of the efficacy of their therapeutics and vaccines against the 89 SARS-CoV-2 variants that are present in the intended location of implementation. 90 91 In addition, COVID-19 CG can be harnessed to track changes in SARS-CoV-2 evolution post-92 implementation of therapeutics and vaccines. It will be crucial to watch for rare escape variants 93 that could resist drug-or immune-based interventions to eventually become the dominant 94 SARS-CoV-2 variant in the community. This need was particularly emphasized by a Regeneron 95 study that demonstrated that single amino acid variants could evolve rapidly in the SARS-CoV-2 96 Spike to ablate binding to antibodies that had been previously selected for their ability to 97 neutralize all known RBD variants; these amino acid variations were found either inside or 98 outside of the targeted RBD region, and some are already present at low frequency among 99 human isolates globally (Baum et al., 2020). The authors, Baum et al., suggested that these 100 rare escape variants could be selected under the pressure of single antibody treatment, and, 101 therefore, advocated for the application of cocktails of antibodies that bind to different epitopes 102 to minimize SARS-CoV-2 mutational escape. A recent study by Greaney et al. generated high-103 resolution 'escape maps' delineating RBD mutations that could potentially result in virus escape 104 from neutralization by ten different human antibodies (Greaney et al., 2020) . Based on lessons 105 learnt from the rise of multidrug resistant bacteria and cancer cells, it will be of the utmost 106 importance to continue tracking SARS-CoV-2 evolution even when multiple vaccines and 107 therapeutics are implemented in a given human population. 108Diagnostics developers can evaluate their probe, primer, or point-of-care diagnostic according 110 to user-defined regional and temporal SARS-CoV-2 genomic variation. More than 665 111 established primers/probes are built into COVID-19 CG, and new diagnostics will be continually 112 incorporated into the browser. Users can also input custom coordinates or sequences to 113 evaluate their own target sequences and design new diagnostics. 114Case study of SNVs that could impact the sensitivity of diagnostic primers: A recent 116 preprint alerted us to the finding that a common G29140T SNV, found in 22.3% of the study's 117 samples from Madera County, California, was adversely affecting SARS-CoV-2 detection by the 118 NIID_2019-nCoV_N_F2 diagnostic primer used at their sequencing center; the single SNV 119 caused a ~30-fold drop in the quantity of amplicon produced by the NIID_2019-nCov_N_F2/R2 120 primer pair (Vanaerschot et al., 2020) . We used COVID-19 CG to detect other SNVs that could 121 impact the use of this primer pair, discovering that there are SARS-CoV-2 variants in several 122 countries with a different C29144T mutation at the very 3' end of the same NIID_2019-123 nCoV_N_F2 primer ( Figure 3A) . As the authors of the preprint, Vanaerschot et al., noted, SNVs 124 could impact assay accuracy if diagnostic primers and probes are also being used to quantify 125 viral loads in patients. We found that at least ten other primer pairs could potentially be at risk in 126 different geographical regions due to SNVs that appear proximal to the 3' ends of primers 127 N_Sarbarco_R1; and Institut Pasteur, Paris 12759Rv. We advocate that labs and clinics use 132 COVID-19 CG (https://covidcg.org) to check their most commonly used primers and probes 133 against the SARS-CoV-2 sequences that are prevalent in their geographic regions. 134how the virus is evolving in a given population over time (e.g., in which genes are mutations 137 occurring, and do these lead to structural or phenotypic changes?). For example, users can 138 track D614G distributions across any region of interest over time. goal that affects all of humanity, we advocate for the increased sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 209 isolates from patients (and infected animals) around the world, and for these data to be shared 210 in as timely a manner as possible.Our data processing pipeline is written with the Snakemake scalable bioinformatics workflow 214 engine (Koster and Rahmann, 2012) The web application is written in Javascript, and primarily uses the libraries React.js, MobX, and 265Vega.

Contact tracing has been crucial in controlling several disease outbreaks, notably SARS, MERS and Ebola (WHO & CDC, 2015; Kang et al., 2015) . While contact tracing alone is unlikely to contain the spread of COVID-19 Kucharski et al., 2020) , in countries like New Zealand where cases have been reduced to very low numbers (Cousins, 2020; Binny et al., 2020) , it may allow population-wide social distancing measures to be relaxed. In countries with more widespread epidemics, it can allow safe reopening.Manual contact tracing typically involves interviewing confirmed cases about their recent contacts, getting in touch with those contacts and asking them to take measures to prevent onward transmission of the disease in case they are infected. Such measures may include limiting their interactions with others, formal quarantine, getting tested, or remaining vigilant for symptoms. Manual contact tracing is intensive work and requires highly trained public health professionals to be implemented effectively (Verrall, 2020) . It is also difficult to scale manual contact tracing up to deal with very large outbreaks.In response, many countries have attempted to develop digital contact tracing systems using smartphone apps. There are multiple different approaches to this problem, for example QR code-based systems, Bluetooth-proximity based apps, automated exposure notification features, and systems that do not rely on smartphones such as card-based proximity detection. These systems can offer, to varying extents, three main benefits to controlling COVID-19: (i) an increase in the proportion of contacts who are traced (e.g. contacts that would not be traced by case recall but are recorded by the digital system); (ii) a reduction in the time taken to identify and notify traced contacts (e.g. via an exposure notification feature); (iii) improved scalability over manual contact tracing.The effectiveness of digital contact tracing is still unproven, with limited real-world data (Anglemyer et al., 2020) . Here, we use a model of COVID-19 transmission and contact tracing to evaluate the potential of digital contact tracing systems to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We evaluate the benefits of digital contact tracing both alone and in combination with manual tracing, over a range of uptake rates, tracing probabilities, and the effectiveness of quarantine.Transmission and contact tracing model.We use an age-structured branching process model for COVID-19 transmission and contact tracing that is an extension of the age-structured model of James et al. (2020) to include different contact types (see below). We assume that the outbreak is sufficiently small that the effect of infection-induced population immunity can be ignored. The time from infection to symptom onset is gamma distributed with mean 5.5 days and standard deviation 2.3 days (Lauer et al., 2020) . Infectiousness is a Weibull function, timeshifted such that 35% of transmission occurs prior to symptom onset (Ferretti et al., 2020; Ganyani et al., 2020) . Infections have an age-dependent probability of being subclinical (Davies et al., 2020 ) that decreases linearly from 40% in the 0-10 year age group to 5% in the over 70 years age group. Subclinical infections are assumed to be 50% as infectious as clinical cases.Contacts are categorised into one of four different types: home, work, school and casual. Each contact has a probability, called the secondary attack rate (SAR), of resulting in transmission. The SAR is assumed to be 20% for home contacts and 6% for work, school and casual contacts . Age-specific contact rates in each of these four settings are based on the contact rates estimated by Prem at al. (2017) for the New Zealand population. The average number of age-specific home contacts was taken directly from the results of Prem et al. (2017) and assumes that household contacts do not vary from day to day. The average number of work, school and casual contacts made during the infectious period was chosen to be a fixed multiple of the number of daily work, school and casual contacts in Prem et al. (2017) , chosen to give a basic reproduction number (in the absence of any control measures, case isolation, or contact tracing) of 0 = 2.6 . We model heterogeneity in number of contacts via gamma distributed individual multipliers for each of the four settings (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) . Heterogeneity is assumed to be higher in work, school and casual contacts than in home contacts, reflecting a greater occurrence of superspreading events in these settings. We model homophily by assuming that the number of contacts of a secondary case is correlated to the number of contacts of the index case in the setting in which transmission occurred. We assume that each transmission via a non-home contact results in infection of a new household, which is assigned a household size according to the age-specific distribution of home contacts. Each household is assumed to consist of a fixed group of individuals, so that subsequent infections within the same household deplete the pool of susceptible home contacts (see Appendix for details).In the absence of any contact tracing, clinical cases are assumed to be eventually tested with probability = 1 (i.e. all clinical cases are eventually detected). The delay from onset of symptoms to testing is assumed to be gamma distributed with mean 6.8 days and standard deviation 5.9 days (estimated from New Zealand data for the March-April outbreak). Cases are isolated at the same time as getting tested and this prevents any further transmission. There is a further delay between getting tested and the test result being returned that is a minimum of 0.5 days, plus an exponentially distributed random variable with a mean of 0.5 days. Subclinical cases do not get tested are do not isolate. The contact tracing model is illustrated in Figure 1 . When a new positive test result is returned and contact tracing for that case begins, we refer to the individual testing positive as the index case and to contacts of the index case as secondary cases. Contacts who do not end up getting infected are not modelled explicitly (but see Discussion about effects of quarantining false positives). Tracing of the index case's contacts begins when the index case returns a positive test result. Under manual tracing, each contact has a probability of being traced, and a time taken to trace, both of which may differ across the four settings. Traced contacts who are not currently symptomatic (i.e. either subclinical or presymptomatic) go into quarantine, which is assumed to reduce onward transmission to a level < 1 relative to no quarantine. Traced contacts who are symptomatic go into isolation immediately on symptom onset, which is assumed to completely prevent any further onward transmission. Untraced contacts do not go into quarantine, and experience a delay between symptom onset and isolation and testing (see above). Effective contact tracing therefore reduces transmission in two ways: (i) quarantining of contacts who are not currently symptomatic; and (ii) prompt isolation of contacts immediately on symptom onset.Home contacts are always assumed to be traced instantly (i.e. immediately after the index case returns a positive test result) with probability 1, and this happens independently of any digital contact tracing system. Under manual contact tracing, work contacts are traced with probability 0.5, school contacts with probability 0.8, and casual contacts with probability 0.25. Work and casual contacts are assumed to have a tracing time that is gamma distributed with mean 3 days and standard deviation 1.7 days. School contacts are assumed to be traced more rapidly but not instantly (0.5 days after the index case returns a positive test result).We model alternative digital contact tracing systems by varying key parameters of the contact tracing model. Home contacts are assumed to be always traced rapidly by the manual system, so digital contact tracing applies to school, work and casual contacts. For each scenario, we assume there is an uptake rate and that each individual in the population is a user of the digital tracing system (e.g. has installed the app) with probability , independently of all other individuals. This ignores any correlation in the usage probabilities of close contacts.Rather than making estimates of tracing probabilities for alternative digital systems, we investigate how the performance of the contact tracing system varies with the uptake rate and the probability of digital tracing (see Table 1 ). We assume that isolation of symptomatic traced contacts is 100% effective in preventing onward transmission, but quarantine of pre-symptomatic and subclinical traced contacts is only partially effective. We investigate two scenarios: (1) quarantine reduces transmission by 50% ( = 0.5);(2) quarantine reduces transmission by 80% ( = 0.2). We assume the effectiveness of quarantine/isolation is the same for contacts that are traced digitally and contacts that are traced manually. This is likely to require effective manual follow up of digitally traced contacts as opposed to relying solely on automatic exposure notifications.We also investigate the additional benefit from including recursive tracing of second-order contacts (i.e. quarantining the contacts of contacts of a confirmed case) in the model. Recursive tracing and effective quarantine of second-order contacts is more difficult to achieve in practice because of the much larger number of second-order contacts and the lower risk of them being infected. In the case on an ongoing outbreak with a large number of cases, the number of uninfected individuals being quarantined under recursive tracing is likely to be prohibitively large (Firth et al., 2020) . However, recursive tracing could potentially be useful in suppressing a small outbreak in its very early stages. We assume that tracing of second-order contacts begins 2 days after tracing of the first-order contact and can occur digitally or manually following the same rules described above ( Figure 2 ). This means that second-order contacts who are traced digitally are quarantined 2 days after quarantining the first-order contact; second-order contacts traced manually are quarantined later. Any second-order contacts made subsequent to quarantine of the first-order contact cannot be traced recursively (but may still be traced on or after the positive test result of the first-order contact). Third-order contacts were not traced recursively.We measured the reduction in spread of COVID-19 by looking at three model outputs: (a) the effective reproduction number (average number of secondary infections per case); (b) the mean outbreak size (total number of cases per seed case) after 30 days; (c) the probability of extinction of an outbreak starting from a single seed case. Together these outputs measure the relative effectiveness of the contact tracing system in containing the virus. These results are robust to the initial number of seed cases: if there are multiple initial seed cases, the reproduction number is not affected; the mean outbreak size is simply multiplied by the initial number of cases, and the probability of elimination is raised to the power of the initial number of cases.For each combination of contact tracing parameters, we ran multiple simulations each of which was initialised with a single infected seed case. Results are shown for uptake rates ranging from 0 to 90% and were calculated by averaging over a sufficient number of simulations to provide an aggregate total of at least 100,000 cases.With case isolation in the absence of any contact tracing, the effective reproduction number was = 2.4, the mean outbreak size after 30 days was 78, and the probability of extinction was approximately 47%. Manual-only contact tracing (which corresponds to a digital uptake rate of = 0 in Fig. 3 ) with moderately (50%) effective quarantine of pre-symptomatic or subclinical individuals reduced to 1.55, the mean outbreak size to approximately 34 and increased the probability of extinction to 67%.When quarantine is moderately effective (reduces transmission by 50%, blue curves in Fig. 3 ), the addition of digital tracing with high uptake rate (>75%) and high probability of logging contacts ( = 90%) reduced to around 1.22, mean outbreak size to 20, and increased the probability of extinction to 80%. If quarantine is more effective (reduces transmission by 80%, red curves in Fig. 3) , digital tracing can reduce to approximately 1.12 and increase probability of elimination to 90%. Adding recursive tracing of second-order contacts (orange curves in Fig. 3) provides a relatively small reduction in to 1.05, although this does increase the probability of elimination from 90% to 95%.Lower uptake rates (<75%) result in poorer performance although there is still some noticeable benefit of digital tracing at an uptake rate of around 40%, provided the probability of a close contact being logged is high ( = 90% in Fig. 2 ). If is much lower than this, performance will deteriorate. However, the results are not as sensitive to as they are to uptake rate , because the requirement for both the index and the secondary case to be users of the system means there is a quadratic dependence on uptake rate. This means that a 20% reduction in is approximately equivalent to a 10% reduction in uptake rate.Successful control of COVID-19 is likely to require a range of intervention strategies, including some or all of: moderate population-wide social distancing; widespread use of face coverings; restrictions on large gatherings or other interventions targeting superspreading events; case isolation and household quarantine; manual and digital contact tracing (Ferreti et al. 2020; Hellewell et al., 2020; . Establishing trusted relationships with cases and contacts is crucial both to increasing contact tracing coverage and to supporting effective quarantine and isolation. There is still limited evidence on the effectiveness of digital tracing systems (Anglemyer et al., 2020) and reliance on digital tracing alone is unlikely to be sufficient. However, there is potential for digital tracing to enhance the coverage and/or speed of contact tracing systems run by trained public health professionals . Digital systems should therefore be seen as an opportunity to improve coverage and/or speed by acting in a complementary role to manual contact tracing. Emphasis should be on how these systems can provide additional useful information to contact tracers in a timely way or fill potential gaps in the manual system. This implies that thorough consultation with public health agencies undertaking contact tracing should be a pre-requisite for an effective digital support system.In this paper, we modelled the effect of manual contact tracing supported by a digital tracing system with varying levels of uptake and effectiveness. Our results show that manual contact tracing can significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19, but on its own is not sufficient to make the effective reproduction number less than 1. Manual contact tracing supported by a digital tracing system can further reduce spread, depending on the effectiveness of quarantine of unconfirmed (pre-symptomatic and subclinical) cases. If quarantine is moderately effective (reduces transmission by 50%), a manual plus digital tracing system with very high uptake (>75%) could reduce to around 1.2. If quarantine is highly effective (reduces transmission by 80%), can be reduced to approximately 1.1, which could be sufficient to contain the majority of small outbreaks. However, if the uptake rate is less than around 75%, the reduction in is not sufficient to contain an outbreak without additional measures.Our results suggest that the additional benefit from recursive tracing of second-order contacts is relatively small. In the case of a small outbreak, this may be worthwhile as it could increase the probability of elimination from 90% to 95% provided uptake is high and quarantine is effective. However, given that it is likely more difficult to effectively quarantine second-order contacts, and the number of uninfected people being quarantined would be much higher, it may be more beneficial to focus on effective quarantine of first-order contacts than attempting to locate second-order contacts.In our model, untraced clinical cases take 6.8 days on average to get tested after onset of symptoms. This assumption was based on the onset to reporting times in data from the March-April outbreak in New Zealand. The aim of contact tracing is to find close contacts of confirmed cases and therefore enable early quarantine or isolation. However, it is important to recognise that reducing the time between symptom onset and isolation can bring significant benefits, even in the absence of contact tracing. This implies that enhancing public awareness of COVID-19 symptoms and the need to get tested quickly, ensuring equitable access to healthcare, and maintaining rapid testing capacity are equally important as investment in contract tracing.We have not considered the consequences of false positives from digital contact tracing systems, i.e. people who are recorded as potential contacts by the digital system but have not in fact been at risk of exposure to COVID-19. For countries such as New Zealand that have reduced cases to very low numbers and where the primary goal is to achieve or maintain elimination of community transmission, we assume that the number of false positives is not a primary consideration.Our model allowed for age-specific mixing patterns in home, work, school, and casual contacts, and for heterogeneity and homophily in individual contact rates. However, the model ignores other sources of heterogeneity, for example in types of workplace. Some workplaces will be much more amenable to rapid contact tracing than others, for example where employees tend to work in a consistent physical location each day. This could be modelled via individual heterogeneity and homophily in contact tracing probabilities as well as contact rates, however the mean tracing probability is likely to remain the most important parameter.We have taken a technology-agnostic approach to modelling digital contact tracing. Among the most important parameters for any digital tracing system are the uptake rate (number of people using the system) and the probability of close contacts being logged. Our results show that to contain an outbreak, a well-functioning manual contact tracing system needs to be combined with a digital tracing system that should ideally have at least 75% uptake and record and record 90% of close contacts. Different systems may have different uptake rates, for example due to usability and privacy issues, so a careful study of expected uptake rates is critical to choosing the best system. The proportion of contacts logged will be affected by the usability of the system and by individual behaviour. For example, contacts will be missed in situations where a user forgets or loses their phone or card, has the phone switched off or a flat battery, or has Bluetooth deactivated. Systems that rely solely on QR code scanning for exposure notification are likely to perform less well than systems with proximity-based detection at the same level of uptake. This is because successful tracing requires the location to have a compatible QR code displayed, both individuals to have the app installed and to take the additional step of scanning the code. There may be benefits to a QR code app in keeping a record of movements or digital diary, but we did not explicitly consider these here. Prem K, Cook AR, Jit M (2017) . Projecting social contact matrices in 152 countries using contact surveys and demographic data. PLOS Computational Biology. 13(9): e1005697.Each new secondary case needs to be assigned individual multipliers ( ) for each of the setting types.The multiplier for the setting ( = * ) in which case was infected is correlated with the multiplier for the index case . This models assortative mixing, meaning people with high contact rates in setting tend to be linked to other people with high contact rates and vice versa). Multipliers for different settings ( ≠ * ) are assumed to be uncorrelated with the multipliers for the index case. For simplicity, we assume that for work, school and casual transmission, the secondary case's multiplier for that setting is equal to the index case's multiplier for that setting with probability , and is independent from the index case's multiplier with probability 1 − : ).When a secondary case occurs via household transmission it shares the same household ID as the index case . The expected number of home contacts decreases by one with each new case in that household. This means that, eventually, transmission chains within a given household will always go extinct as the pool of susceptible household members is depleted. For simplicity, network effects and infection-induced immunity for work, school and casual contacts are ignored, i.e. all non-household contacts of the secondary case are assumed to be mutually exclusive of the non-household contacts of the primary case.","New Zealand","first author","2020-09-01",9

Discovered in 1975, ivermectin was marketed successfully from 1981 for parasitic infection indications in animals, and then approved for human use for activity against onchocerciasis (river blindness) in 1987. It has since been used successfully to treat a number of human parasitic worm infestations causing river blindness/filariasis, strongyloidiasis/ascariasis, ectoparasites causing scabies, pediculosis and rosacea [1, 3] . More recent applications include to control insect mediators of infection, such as malaria [1, [3] [4] [5] . Ivermectin is on the World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines [6] .From 2012 onwards, there have multiple reports that ivermectin has antiviral properties [4, 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] towards a growing number of RNA viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza, flaviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) and, most notably, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) [17] . Evidence for activity against DNA viruses is more limited, but encompasses Pseudorabies, polyoma and adenoviruses [18] [19] [20] . The basis of ivermectin's broadspectrum antiviral activity appears to relate to the fact that ivermectin binds to, and inhibits, the nuclear transport role of the host importin α (IMPα) protein [11, 18, 20] , which is known to mediate nuclear import of various viral proteins and key host factors, but other possible antiviral actions of ivermectin have been proposed (e.g., [12] ), including in the case of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., [21, 22] ). This mini-review will summarise the weight of evidence for ivermectin's broad-spectrum antiviral activity and the basis of its IMPα-directed activity in light of the possibility that ivermectin could be a critically useful antiviral in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis [6, 17] .It is difficult to overestimate the impact of ivermectin as a therapeutic agent to control various parasitic diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . It is administered as a single oral yearly dose (e.g., 150 or 200 µg/kg, respectively) to treat onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis. Lymphatic filariasis is similarly treated in endemic areas with a once-yearly dose (300-400 µg/kg), or alternatively bi-yearly dosing (150-200 µg/kg) [23] . Ivermectin's documented antiparasitic mode of action is through potentiating GABA-mediated neurotransmission, and by binding to invertebrate glutamate-gated Cl − channels to effect parasite paralysis and death [24] . Selectivity comes from the fact that ivermectin does not readily penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) of mammals, where GABA functions as a neurotransmitter [24] .Doses up to 2000 µg/kg are well tolerated in patients with parasitic infections [23, 25] , with analysis of the first 11 years of mass global ivermectin (Mectizan) administration indicating a cumulative incidence of one serious adverse side effect case per million [4, 26] . Similarly, although drug resistance can occur in animals, no resistance in humans has yet been confirmed in over 25 years. Based on this weight of evidence, ivermectin is unquestionably a safe, potent antiparasitic agent likely to be used as such long into the future [1, 4] .Transport into and out of the nucleus is central to eukaryotic cell and tissue function, with a key role to play in viral infection, where a common strategy used by viruses is to antagonize the cellular antiviral response [14, 27] . The targeting signal-dependent mediators of this transport are the members of the IMP superfamily of proteins, of which there are multiple α and β forms [14, 27] . The pathway mediated by the IMPα/β1 heterodimer is the best characterized pathway by which host proteins, including members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcription factor families, enter the nucleus through nuclear envelope-embedded nuclear pores. A large number of viral proteins (e.g., [27, 28] ) also use this pathway (see Figure 1 ), where IMPα within the IMPα/β1 heterodimer performs the adaptor role of specific targeting signal recognition, while IMPβ1 performs the main nuclear roles of binding to/translocation through the nuclear pores, and release of the nuclear import cargo within the nucleus ( Figure 1 ) [27] . Schematic showing IMPα's role in nuclear transport of host and viral proteins, and mechanism of inhibition by ivermectin. (a) Host proteins, such as members of the STAT or NF-κB transcription factor families, localize in the nucleus through the action of the IMPα/β1 heterodimer, where the ""IBB"" (IMPβ-binding) region of IMPα (green curved line) is bound by IMPβ1 to enable cargo recognition by IMPα within the heterodimer; IMPβ1 subsequently mediates transport of the trimeric complex through the nuclear pore (NPC, nuclear pore complex) embedded within the nuclear envelope (NE) into the nucleus. This is followed by release within the nucleus to enable the transcription factors to carry out normal function in transcriptional regulation, including in the antiviral response. IMPα can only mediate nuclear import within the heterodimer with IMPβ1. (b) In viral infection, specific viral proteins (e.g., NS5 in the case of DENV, ZIKV, WNV) able to interact with IMPα utilize the IMPα/β1 heterodimer to access the nucleus and antagonize the antiviral response [14, 27, 28] . This is critical to enable optimal virus production as shown by mutagenic and inhibitor studies. Which SARS-CoV-2 proteins may access the nucleus in infected cells has not been examined (see Section 3). (c) The IMPα targeting compound ivermectin binds to IMPα (binding site shown as red lozenge) both within the IMPα/β heterodimer to dissociate it, and to free IMPα to Schematic showing IMPα's role in nuclear transport of host and viral proteins, and mechanism of inhibition by ivermectin. (a) Host proteins, such as members of the STAT or NF-κB transcription factor families, localize in the nucleus through the action of the IMPα/β1 heterodimer, where the ""IBB"" (IMPβ-binding) region of IMPα (green curved line) is bound by IMPβ1 to enable cargo recognition by IMPα within the heterodimer; IMPβ1 subsequently mediates transport of the trimeric complex through the nuclear pore (NPC, nuclear pore complex) embedded within the nuclear envelope (NE) into the nucleus. This is followed by release within the nucleus to enable the transcription factors to carry out normal function in transcriptional regulation, including in the antiviral response. IMPα can only mediate nuclear import within the heterodimer with IMPβ1. (b) In viral infection, specific viral proteins (e.g., NS5 in the case of DENV, ZIKV, WNV) able to interact with IMPα utilize the IMPα/β1 heterodimer to access the nucleus and antagonize the antiviral response [14, 27, 28] . This is critical to enable optimal virus production as shown by mutagenic and inhibitor studies. Which SARS-CoV-2 proteins may access the nucleus in infected cells has not been examined (see Section 3). (c) The IMPα targeting compound ivermectin binds to IMPα (binding site shown as red lozenge) both within the IMPα/β heterodimer to dissociate it, and to free IMPα to prevent it binding to IMPβ1, thereby blocking NS5 nuclear import [11] . GW5074 (see Table 1 ) has been shown to exhibit a similar mechanism [29] .The importance of nuclear targeting of viral proteins to the nucleus in the infectious cycle has been demonstrated for a number of viruses. Mutagenic analyses, for example, show that specific recognition by IMPα is critical to nuclear localization of various viral proteins, such as DENV non-structural protein (NS) 5 [30] ; significantly, DENV, which shows the same reduced interaction of NS5 with IMPα is severely attenuated, underlining the importance of the NS5-IMPα interaction for dengue infection. As has since been shown using a range of different small molecules, the critical importance of this interaction to dengue infection is the basis for the fact that multiple distinct small molecules that disrupt IMPα recognition of dengue NS5 are able to limit dengue infection [7, 8, 11, 29, 31] . In the case of ivermectin, this activity extends to a large number of different viruses (see below) [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , including SARS-CoV-2 [18] . Which SARS-CoV-2 proteins may access the nucleus in infected cells has not been examined in detail but, in terms of related coronaviruses, ORF6 (Open Reading Frame 6) protein from SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to bind IMPα [32] , and ORF4b from MERS-CoV (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) is known to access the nucleus in NLS-dependent fashion [33] . Ongoing research will establish which of the SARS-CoV-2 ORFs may play comparable roles, and be potential targets of the impact of ivermectin on IMPα.We identified ivermectin in 2011 in a proof-of-principle, high-throughput screen using recombinantly-expressed proteins and a 1200 compound library for inhibitors of HIV-1 Integrase (IN) recognition by IMPα/β1 [34] ; specific inhibitors targeting IMPα/β1 directly (such as ivermectin) and not IN (such as budenoside) were identified using a nested counterscreen strategy [34, 35] . Of several compounds subsequently confirmed to be active against IMPα/β1 and possess antiviral activity as a consequence [7, 14, 29, 36] , ivermectin has been the best characterized in this regard, and shown to have broad-spectrum activities, a number of which are summarized in Table 1 . It was initially shown to inhibit nuclear import not only of IN, but also of simian virus SV40 large tumour antigen (T-ag) and other IMPα/β1-dependent (but not IMPβ1-dependent) cargoes, consistent with the idea that IMPα (not IN) is the direct target [34, 35] . Subsequent work has confirmed this, with ivermectin's ability to inhibit the nuclear accumulation of various different host, including NF-kB p65 [37] and viral proteins demonstrated in transfected and infected cell systems (see Table 1 ) [14, 34] . Ivermectin's ability to inhibit binding of IMPα to the viral proteins NS5 and T-ag has also been confirmed in a cellular context using the biomolecular fluorescence complementation technique [11] . [29] Although targeting of IMPα by ivermectin was clearly supported by many years of research (see also below), direct binding to IMPα was only recently formally demonstrated using a set of biophysical techniques, including thermostability, analytical ultracentrifugation, and circular dichroism (CD) [11] . Importantly, the CD/thermostability studies indicate that binding of ivermectin by IMPα induces a structural change, which is likely the basis of IMPα's inability to bind viral nuclear import cargoes. Strikingly, the structural change also appears to impair heterodimerisation of IMPα with IMPβ1 [11] ; IMPα alone cannot mediate nuclear import, only within the heterodimer with IMPβ1. Thus, ivermectin inhibits nuclear import not only by preventing signal recognition by IMPα, but also by ensuring that the IMPα/β1 complex essential to mediate subsequent transport through the nuclear pore is prevented from forming. Interestingly, GW5074 (see Table 1 ) appears to have a close to identical mechanism to that for ivermectin in binding to IMPα to induce structural changes that prevent both cargo recognition and specific interaction with IMPβ1 [29] ; there is no such data for GSP (see Table 1 ), which is believed to impact the NLS-binding site of IMPα and prevent cargo recognition more directly (manuscript in preparation).Consistent with the fact that many viruses are known to rely on IMPα/β1-dependent nuclear import of specific viral proteins for robust infection [14, 27, 28] , ivermectin has been confirmed in a body of in vitro studies to be active in limiting infection by a range of different RNA viruses [10, 14] , including HIV-1 [7] , DENV (all four serotypes) and related flaviviruses [8, 11, 12] , influenza, and alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and chikungunya [9, 15, 16] (see Table 1 ); it is also active against DNA viruses [18] [19] [20] . Recent studies indicate it is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 [17] .A striking aspect of this antiviral activity is that, where determined, the EC 50 for viral inhibition as assessed by a range of different techniques is in the low µM range (see right column, Table 1 ), interestingly aligning perfectly with its activity in inhibiting recognition of viral nuclear import cargoes by IMPα (see top of left column, Table 1 ). The clear implication is that the mechanism of inhibition of infectious virus production in the case of all of the viruses listed in Table 1 is largely through targeting IMPα to prevent its role in nuclear import, and of viral proteins in particular (see Figure 1 ). Significantly, two other small molecules (GW5074 and gossypol) that appear to target IMPα in a very similar way to prevent its nuclear import function [29] have comparable antiviral properties [13, 29, 36] , consistent with the idea that the host protein IMPα is a key contributor to infection by a number of medically important viruses.One of the greatest challenges in antiviral research, as in many other disciplines, is to transition from laboratory experiments to preclinical/clinical studies, with the question of dosing challenging [6] . However, it is important to stress the obvious in this context: that the antiviral activities of ivermectin documented in Table 1 have been derived from laboratory experiments that largely involve high, generally non-physiological, multiplicities of infection, and cell monolayer cultures, often of cell lines such as Vero cells (African green monkey kidney, impaired in interferon α/β production) that are not clinically relevant. Clearly, the results in Table 1 for low µM EC 50 values should not be interpreted beyond the fact that they reveal robust, dose-dependent antiviral activity in the cell model system used, and it would be naïve to strive for µM concentrations of ivermectin in the clinic based on them.A key consideration in any clinical intervention using ivermectin is its host-directed (IMPα-directed) mechanism of action. Host-directed agents that impact cellular activities that are essential to healthy function must be tested with caution; although ivermectin has an established safety profile in humans [23, 25] , and is US Food and Drug Administration-approved for a number of parasitic infections [1, 3, 5] , it targets a host function that is unquestionably important in the antiviral response, and titration of a large proportion of the IMPα repertoire of a cell/tissue/organ likely to lead to toxicity. With this in mind, where a host-directed agent can be a ""game-changer"" in treating viral infection may well be in the initial stages of infection or even prophylactically (see Section 6) to keep the viral load low so that the body's immune system has an opportunity to mount a full antiviral response [11, 17] .Ivermectin's real potential as an antiviral to treat infection can, of course, only be demonstrated in preclinical/clinical studies. Preclinical studies include a lethal Pseudorabies (PRV) mouse challenge model which showed that dosing (0.2 mg/kg) 12 h post-infection protected 50% of mice, which could be increased to 60% by administering ivermectin at the time of infection [18] . Apart from the many clinical trials currently running for SARS-CoV-2 (see below), the only other study thus far reported relates to a phase III trial for DENV infection [40] . Almost 70% of the world's population in over 120 countries is currently threatened by mosquito-borne flaviviral infections, with an estimated 100 million symptomatic DENV infections and up to 25,000 deaths each year from dengue haemorrhagic fever [41, 42] , despite sophisticated large-scale vector control programs. As for the closely related ZIKV (cause of large outbreaks in the Americas in 2015/2016), the dearth of antiviral treatments and challenges in developing efficacious vaccines hamper disease control. Clinical data published in preliminary form for the phase III trial in Thailand [40] indicate antiviral activity; daily dosing (0.4 mg/kg) was concluded to be safe, and have virological efficacy, but clear clinical benefit was not reported, potentially due to the timing of the intervention. The authors concluded that dosing regimen modification was required to ensure clinical benefit [40] . This study both underlines ivermectin's potential to reduce viral load in a clinical context, and highlights the complexities of timely intervention and effective dosing regimens to achieve real clinical benefit in the field.Despite efforts in multiple domains, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has now eclipsed the porcine flu epidemic in terms of numbers of infections (rapidly nearing 30 million) and deaths (>930,000) worldwide. The search for antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 through repurposing existing drugs has proved challenging (e.g., see [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] ), one important aspect of repurposing being the perceived need to achieve therapeutic levels in the lung. Published pharmacokinetic modelling based on both the levels of ivermectin achievable in human serum from standard parasitic treatment dosing and robust large animal experiments where lung levels of ivermectin can be measured, indicates that concentrations of ivermectin 10 times higher than the c. 2.5 µM EC 50 indicated by in vitro experiments (Table 1) are likely achievable in the lung in the case of SARS-CoV-2 [48] ; modelling based on different assumptions predicts lower values, but stresses the long-term stability of ivermectin in the lung (for over 30 days) based on data from animals [49] . It should also be noted that liquid formulations for intravenous administration of long-acting ivermectin have been described, with aerosol administration also in development, to enable ivermectin administration to achieve even higher concentrations to tackle SARS-CoV-2, whilst the use of ivermectin in combination with other agents may enhance efficacy at lower doses.There are currently more than 50 trials worldwide testing the clinical benefit of ivermectin to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 (see Table 2 ). These include variations on combination therapies (see [51, 52] ), dosing regimens, and prophylactic protocols. With respect to the latter, preliminary results from recently completed study NCT04422561 (Table 2 , no. 22), that examines asymptomatic family close contacts of confirmed COVID patients, show that two doses of ivermectin 72 h apart result in only 7.4% of 203 subjects reporting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in stark contrast to control untreated subjects, of whom 58.4% reported symptoms, underlining ivermectin's potential as a prophylactic. It is to be hoped that the results from the rigorous randomised clinical trials listed in Table 2 will emerge in the next few months to document ivermectin's credentials as ""the real deal"" for COVID-19 infection or otherwise. In this context, it is noteworthy that ivermectin has already been approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in humans by the Republic of Peru [53] and in the Northeastern Beni region of Bolivia [54] .An instinctive response in developing antiviral agents is to strive for high specificity, making the idea of virus-targeted agents specific to a particular viral component or function attractive, since, ideally, they circumvent the possibility of impacting host function. However, the high propensity of viral genomes, and particularly those of RNA viruses, to mutate and evolve means that selection for resistance can be all too prevalent (e.g., for HIV). Importantly, the high specificity of an agent to a particular virus also inevitably means that its utility against a distinct virus may be limited or non-existent. Thus, it is not surprising that repurposed antivirals active against influenza or HIV, for example, may prove in efficacious against distantly related flaviviruses or coronaviruses.In contrast, antivirals that are host-directed can be repurposed more easily, as long as the viruses in question rely on the same host pathway/functions for robust infection, simply because the host pathway/function targeted is the same [14, 28] . Although potential complication here is the viral tissue tropism (e.g., blood or lung in the case of systemic or respiratory viral infections) and accompanying pharmacokinetic considerations, selection for viral resistance is largely circumvented in this scenario. As long as toxicity is not an issue, host-directed agents thus have the potential to be genuinely broad-spectrum agents against various different viruses that rely on a common host pathway. The fact that so many viruses rely on IMPα/β1-dependent nuclear import for robust infection ( [14, 27, 28] and see above) means that agents targeting this pathway have true potential to be broad-spectrum antivirals. After decades of use in the field, ivermectin clearly ""fits the bill"" here in terms of human safety, but whether it turns out to be the molecule that proves this principle will only begin to be established unequivocally, one way or another, in the ensuing months with respect to SARS-CoV-2. We confirm that there are no conflict of interest associated with this publication, with no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus; VLP, virus like particle; PSV, Pseudorabies virus; T-ag, SV40 large T-antigen; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein; YFV (yellow fever virus); WNV, West Nile virus; DENV, dengue virus; ZIKV, Zika virus; VEEV, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction (viral genomes); CPE, cytopathogenic effect (host cell); pfu, plaque forming units (infectious virus); CFI, cell fluorescence assay (immunostaining for virus); TCID, tissue culture infectious dose (estimation of viral load based on CPE).","Australia","first author","2020-09-15",9

Whilst the focus of the Roadmap to Recovery was on pandemic control, the inclusion of ECRs and social scientists ensured that contending analyses and divergent thinking were assessed on their merit, not on the position, seniority or disciplinary orientation of the contributor. The month-long collaboration process was facilitated by the Hunt Laboratory for Intelligence Research using their Smartly-assembled Wiki-style Argument Marshalling (SWARM) project cloud platform. The SWARM platform was initially funded by a US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) scheme, in order to pursue advances in collaborative reasoning. The platform enables ""contending analyses"" through a process of sharing resources and draft reports, feedback and rating, and group selection of high-quality contributions ( van Gelder & Rozario 2018) . Important elements of the SWARM process include an initial period of anonymity to manage social dominance effects and recognising the need to create ""social warmth"" (Sinnott et al. 2019, p. 412) . The SWARM platform relies on mutual encouragement and shared credit for collaboration, which functions to support interaction between users and the refinement of contending ideas.Researchers could contribute to any question or issue across the project, but the in-built mechanisms of rating and feedback functioned to ensure that contributions made based on expertise and familiarity with the research were most highly valued. Those contributions were critiqued by other users, voted on, and incorporated into draft reports, until the third week of the project. At this point, subgroups coalesced around specific questions, anonymity was lifted, and draft reports were circulated offline. The expertise of Indigenous researchers was prioritised and supported by non-Indigenous colleagues engaged in the question:What are the special considerations with regard to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their communities through the recovery process?In preparing our report, we firstly recognised the global challenges posed by pandemics for citizens around the world but noted that Indigenous peoples are particularly vulnerable from the historical and ongoing experience of colonisation. Indigenous people in Australia and worldwide experience disproportionate impacts of pandemics (Walsh & Rademaker 2020) and ill-effects long after the response phase (La Ruche et al. 2009; Flint et al. 2010; Rudge & Massey 2010; Trauer et al. 2011) . During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Indigenous communities in Australia experienced reduced and delayed access to care, and cultural differences in approaches to healthcare, resulting in excessive morbidity and mortality.In the context of COVID-19, we suggest that the effects of the inevitable associated economic recession already under way will exacerbate inequality across the social determinants of health including housing, water and energy security, nutrition and employment (Markham et al. 2020, p. 1) . This pandemic has highlighted and reinforced preexisting racial inequity and long-standing shortfalls in health policy (Bond & Whop 2020). There is a real concern that COVID-19 will compound existing health issues in Indigenous communities partly due to the restrictions on community mobility and interaction with health services and others, including kinship clans and communities (UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2020). Less contact with health services also has the potential to heighten risks as a result of underlying health conditions not properly being managed or assessed (Garg et al. 2020) . Additionally, we focused on the ways Indigenous organisations have shown exemplary leadership in their response to COVID-19. To support their work and the continued recovery effort, we made four key recommendations regarding (1) self-determination, (2) housing, (3) data sovereignty and (4) workforce. Adequately addressing these issues relies on enabling Indigenous governance through needsbased funding and Indigenous-led initiatives.At present, approximately 800,000 people in Australia identify as Indigenous, and most (approximately 80 percent) live in cities and non-remote areas (ABS 2018). The median age of Indigenous people is 15 years lower than non-Indigenous Australians, with higher mortality rates making early middle age and older Indigenous people especially vulnerable (ABS 2018). Indigenous Australians have higher rates of health problems, such as high blood pressure, respiratory and circulatory disease, obesity and diabetes (AIHW 2018; ABS 2019), as well as higher rates of psychological distress compared with other Australians (McNamara et al. 2018, p. 145) . Indigenous peoples also experience significant barriers to accessing healthcare services (Peiris et al. 2008, p. 985) . Preventable hospital admissions and deaths are three times higher for Indigenous people, due in part to the failure of the ""close the gap"" policies (DHA 2013).In the 2020 Closing the Gap report (DPMC 2020, p. 6), the government outlined the need to accelerate improvements in Indigenous peoples' outcomes by engaging in partnerships through community-led, strengths-based approaches. During the COVID-19 pandemic, self-determined measures have been put in place by, and to mitigate risks for, Indigenous communities (Milroy 2020) . These measures have resulted in overwhelmingly positive outcomes, including, at the time of writing, 69 cases of infection amongst Indigenous people representing 0.8 per cent of all cases in Australia; notably, for ""all Australian cases, completeness of the Indigenous status field was approximately 91 percent"" (Department of Health 2020a, p. 10).A key attribute of the success of the COVID-19 Indigenous response has been the extent of selfdetermination by Indigenous organisations; their strategic leadership has mitigated risk and promoted protective measures during the early phases of the outbreak. In practical terms, these acts of self-determination include, for example, Land Councils assisting communities by prohibiting access permits for non-essential travellers and developing key distancing health messages in local languages, and Aboriginal community-controlled health services developing local preparedness and response plans. Communities themselves have imposed restricted travel to and from communities and have implemented considerable efforts to protect elders, and found solutions to secure isolation and quarantine facilities where housing stock is limited (including facilitating decentralisation to homelands to reduce overcrowding in large townships).At the federal level, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO), state, territory and regional peak organisations, as well as member organisations from across the country, have participated in a national Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander COVID-19 Advisory Group directly reporting to the Chief Medical Officer and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee which feeds directly into the National Cabinet. Co-chaired by NACCHO and the Commonwealth Department of Health, this group developed the National Management Plan, clinical guidelines and specific initiatives to prepare remote communities for COVID-19, early in the pandemic phase (Department of Health 2020b). Recognising that there is some time to go before the COVID-19 pandemic is hopefully addressed; we made four recommendations based on the self-determination that has been at the forefront of Indigenous crisis and recovery efforts. These recommendations were based on the consideration of current government responses, the importance of equitable needs-based funding and the profound risks of policy failure for Indigenous lives and livelihoods.The core requirement in both the acute and recovery phases is evidence-based policy, relying on quality research that prioritises local experience. Such policy must be developed and led by Indigenous peoples, based on Indigenous values, funded on a needs basis, with clear accountabilities and systematic evaluation. We noted that Canada has acted decisively in prioritising Indigenous peoples' health by supporting pre-established First Nations governance structures. The $302 million COVID-19 Economic Response Plan gave Indigenous leadership the flexibility needed to design and implement community-based solutions to the pandemic (Government of Canada 2020). Canada's health response to COVID-19 equates to $270 per Indigenous person, whereas Australia's current responsewith around $15 million of new spendingequates to less than $20 per Indigenous person (Wilson 2020) .The COVID-19 response has involved an unprecedented level of cooperation and collaboration between governments and the Indigenous community health sector, which augurs well for future partnerships and deserves both recognition and funding. The research is clear on the need for governments to effectively engage and partner with Indigenous communities particularly during pandemic responses (Massey et al. 2011) . To support and consolidate these extraordinary partnerships, there is a pressing need for sustainable funding to Indigenous organisations. The Australian government has allocated $74 million to mental health (IAHA 2020), $57.8 million to remote communities (Hunt 2020) and $123 million to Indigenous businesses (Wyatt 2020) . We also suggest that the increase in social security payments during COVID-19 is a critical step in alleviating poverty (Altman 2020) . So, whilst we applaud the current level of collaboration and community control (Department of Health 2020b, p. 6), we stress that existing inequalities must not be exacerbated by this pandemic (Bond & Whop 2020; Markham et al. 2020) .The working group made four recommendations made to the Roadmap to Recovery (Go8 2020) regarding:1. The right to self-determination and to lead coordination 2. An immediate increase in the supply of housing 3. COVID-19 Indigenous data sovereignty 4. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workforce review.Under the international norm of Indigenous self-determination, the United Nations encourages governments to include Indigenous peoples' representatives, leaders and traditional authorities in emergency and health response committees, and indeed any entity dedicated to COVID-19 response and recovery (FAO 2020) . In addition to the national Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander COVID-19 Advisory Group (Department of Health 2020b), we note that community-controlled healthcare has shown commendable innovation through the crisis. The response from Indigenous communities (Archibald-Binge & Geraghty 2020; Gordon et al. 2020; Haskin 2020) and organisations (e.g. Gayaa Dhuwi 2020; Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services 2020; NAC-CHO 2020) has been swift and effective, a possible explanator of outstanding outcomes to date.The report (Go8 2020, p. 150) notes the creation of COVID-19 taskforces led by Indigenous health services to coordinate and implement effective localised pandemic responses. We recommended the continued financial and logistical support of Indigenous COVID-19 response mechanisms in all jurisdictions. This recommendation is based on the right of self-determination for Indigenous people to keep their communities safe, recognition of ongoing local cultural practices and the need for efficiency in pandemic responses. Indigenous health services are most familiar with the social determinants of health in local areas, relevant cultural considerations, and are the better equipped to advise on funding allocation according to local needs. In the light of an expected shortfall between emergency support and high community need, funding allocation is most efficient when conducted in partnership with Indigenous health organisations. Supporting the expansion of Indigenous COVID-19 taskforces to oversee this process during the recovery phase enables efficient and localised engagement with each jurisdiction across the Commonwealth.The ability of families to self-isolate and quarantine effectively has been a significant issue in the crisis phase of COVID-19. Many communities face critical housing shortages and associated overcrowding in urban, regional and remote areas documented over many years (AIHW 2014; 2020a, p. 115) . Inadequate housing has a direct impact on the ability of local health services and communities to ensure social distancing, as well as immediately exacerbating a complex set of interrelated issues including family safety, preexisting overcrowding and ageing infrastructure (Cripps & Habibis 2019, p. 7). During COVID-19, the housing crisis has been exacerbated by people returning from urban centres to ancestral country. Whilst this has led to reconnection with family and country for many people, addressing isolation and growing communities, a lack of basic infrastructure compounds preexisting health concerns. Many communities remain vulnerable to COVID-19 without any ability to isolate and this is particularly the case for Indigenous communities in south-eastern Australia who lost housing and infrastructure in the 2020 bushfires and floods (Williamson et al. 2020, p. 11) .In considering the cultural impacts of the pandemic, we note that social isolation is contrary to Indigenous cultural practices. Enforcing travel bans, movement restrictions and quarantines will disproportionately affect Indigenous populations (Logie & Turan 2020, p. 2) . Isolation policies are also likely to have negative consequences within and beyond Indigenous communities, including stress, hardship, interpersonal issues, family violence, alcohol misuse, and suicide risk (Dudgeon & Hirvonen 2019; Klower 2020). These consequences are felt differently across the lifecourse, gender and place. Housing is the most critical issue exposed by the crisis and must be addressed as the urgent first-order issue, in both the short-term to accommodate isolation and quarantine measures, and in the longer-term to aid in recovery and preparedness for future crises. The most vulnerable Indigenous people include victims of violence, the homeless and incarcerated, those impacted by natural disasters, people with disability and chronic illness, as well as Elders and members of Stolen Generations who have experienced historical and colonial trauma (Menzies 2019 (Menzies , p. 1526 . In remote communities, the early strategy of returning people to Country may have limited Indigenous women's access to support, making them even more vulnerable to family violence and unable to undertake meaningful safety planning (Hocking, 2020) .Our report focused on the vulnerability of Indigenous young people as a particular concern. Not all Indigenous households have ready access to quality education, technology or reliable Internet to support children's learning. However, because Indigenous young people are removed from their families and placed in out-of-home care and juvenile detention at historically disproportionate rates (AIHW 2020b, p. 15; 2020c, p. 11), they are exceptionally vulnerable in this pandemic. In their endeavours to minimise the risk of transmission, jurisdictions have stopped or limited face-to-face contact between young people in care or custody and their families. Whilst some jurisdictions have offered alternative communication, not all families have access to these, nor are they always age-appropriate or child-friendly. This exacerbates the distress and anxiety Indigenous families experience (Australian Human Rights Commission 2018). Similarly, the interrelationship between child abuse and neglect with family violence has long been established (Commission for Children & Young People 2016). With concerns already raised about the increase in family violence during the acute phase of COVID-19, it is likely that mandatory reports of children's exposure to violence will increase. We note that children and young people in out-of-home care are also vulnerable to ""crossing-over"" into juvenile justice system (Baidawi & Sheehan 2019, p. 2). Given increased police discretion during the pandemicnoting the history of overpolicing Indigenous communities -Indigenous young people are likely to be even more at risk from police harassment. Overpolicing, fines for breaching social distancing regulations and ""move on"" notices with no alternative housing support all exacerbate risk for an already vulnerable cohort.We recommended that the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander COVID-19 Advisory Group be maintained until the pandemic threat is eliminated and that principles of Indigenous data sovereignty are used to support data sharing and decision making. To support the maintenance of public health and clinical responses, we recommend comprehensive data collection and sharing to all parties in order to support public health messaging and ongoing research. Where possible, community-controlled health organisations should be supported to ensure data collection is undertaken sensitively and in a timely manner, following the principles established by Maiam nayri Wingara.Research into the effects of COVID-19 on community well-being will be required to evaluate how Indigenous peoples have fared through COVID-19. Data on mainstream service uptake, presentation to emergency departments and suicide behaviours during the pandemic must be made available to relevant institutions to support pandemic response and recovery. A comprehensive understanding of indirect and longer-term effects of the pandemic will provide important and necessary learnings for future pandemics and crises. Such research must be Indigenous-led and based on Indigenous philosophies and current best scholarly and culturally ethical practice. In order to conduct this research and support rapid decision making, issues of data quality and sharing must be addressed within Indigenous approaches to data and research quality (Kukutai & Taylor 2016, p. 14) .The COVID-19 recovery will depend on how much damage is inflicted in communities, by both the virus and the measures used to contain it, as well as on the degree of self-determination communities have to manage their own pandemic responses. It is imperative that the virus is contained. This will require careful tracking of virus epidemiology and rapid reporting to properly understand and respond to infection impacts on highly vulnerable Indigenous communities and workforces. Evidence-based strategy and data are key, as is ongoing support for community-led recovery.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities in local workforces that are highly dependent on staff from out of community, interstate and even New Zealand. Long-term initiatives to build local capacity are needed, given the significant issues which have arisen in relation to available workforce (including the need to isolate fly-in-fly-out or drive-in-drive-out locum staff and local Indigenous staff who are unable to work). We strongly recommend that NACCHO, as a lead agency, instigates a health workforce reform process in partnership with all jurisdictions. This will need to encompass:• An analysis of how to increase and retain Indigenous health practitioners across Australia.This will help reduce the reliance on overseas and out-of-community locum staff providing services to remote and regional communities.• Rapid upscaling of Indigenous public health and infectious disease expertise so that each Department of Health in each jurisdiction relies on senior Indigenous advice.• Surge workforce planning in communities to anticipate future outbreaks of COVID-19 and other diseases.There is a need to ensure Indigenous health workers are supported to provide the best care for communities, especially in areas with preexisting staff shortages. Indigenous people in more remote areas must make the final decision about their readiness to open communities to nonessential workers and other visitors. The health of people in these communities is generally poor, elders are highly vulnerable, and communities must be entitled to exercise their right to self-determination in matters of life and death (United Nations 2007). We suggest that workforce planning is both an urgent and practical measure in pandemic response that supports these rights.The scope and number of recommendations to the Go8 Roadmap to Recovery report were necessarily limited by the breadth of the project, which included 11 areas ranging from suppression strategies to travel restrictions to civic engagement and mental health (Go8 2020). In proposing these four recommendations, we aimed to take into account the breadth of the social determinants of health, issues of deeply entrenched poverty, the need for adequate financial support for Indigenous health and other organisations and the need for ongoing, increased, and unconditional social security payments to address deep poverty. We acknowledge the negative impacts of social isolation policies, concerns around family safety and overpolicing, and we stress the importance of equitable, needsbased funding. Although these recommendations apply to the entire Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, the diversity within this population must also be recognised.In making these recommendations, we noted that the research clearly and consistently demonstrates that a strengths-based, community-led approach is the only effective way of working with Indigenous peoples. Self-determination and connection to community, culture and the advice of elders are critically important in times of crises. At the time of writing, it remains to be seen how governments across Australia respond to these recommendations, as Indigenous people continue to be resilient and innovative in response to yet another, potentially catastrophic, health crisis.The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Although limited by a small sample size, they demonstrated that IBD patients were less likely to acquire COVID-19 than the general population, with an odds ratio of 0.74 (95% CI 0.70-0.77; P < 0.001), 1 with no significant observed difference in standardised mortality risk or case mortality rate. 1 They questaioned whether this lower infection rate may be a consequence of improved adherence with shielding recommendations. 1 We speculate that differential serum angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) levels observed in patients with IBD may contribute.Large datasets support the findings of Taxonera's study of comparatively low rates of COVID-19 in patients with IBD. 1,2 Experience from Wuhan reported no cases among 318 IBD patients. 3 Additionally, despite over 18 million COVID-19 cases worldwide, as of 5 August 2020, an international IBD COVID-19 registry reported only 1,925 cases in IBD patients. 4 Although undoubtedly multifactorial, there is biological plausibility to this finding. ACE2 and angiotensin (Ang)II play important roles in the blood pressure and volume regulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (Figure 1 ). 5 ACE2 catalyses the conversion of AngII to Angiotensin 1-7 and negatively regulates the RAS. ACE2 has two isoforms: a membrane-bound glycoprotein expressed widely on mucosal surfaces of healthy people including ileum, colon and lungs, and a distinct soluble circulating form. 5 SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the former, but can be bound in circulation to the latter. 6 In mouse models, ACE2 expression in lungs is significantly decreased following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while Ang II levels increase. 7 These changes are purported as an underlying mechanism of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Supporting this, recombinant human ACE2 protein protects mice from ARDS. 7 Additionally, preliminary evidence suggests that recombinant ACE2 is safe in human ARDS patients, with biomarker-based suggestion of efficacy-surfactant protein D, a determinant of lung injury, and interleukin-6, an important mediator of the cytokine storm, both decrease following ACE2 therapy. 8 Since SARS-CoV-2 has high affinity for ACE2, 6 minor changes in expression of membrane-bound ACE2 on mucosal surfaces are unlikely to significantly alter an individual's susceptibility to COVID-19. However, soluble ACE2 may competitively inhibit circulating SARS-CoV-2. Plasma ACE2 activity is higher in IBD patients when compared to healthy controls, with a trend towards higher levels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC). 5 ACE2 activity is significantly higher in non-inflamed biopsies of IBD patients than unaffected controls, but levels are lower in inflamed segment biopsies. 5 Interestingly, rates of ICU/ventilator requirement/death are higher in UC than CD patients (10% vs 6%) and in those with moderate/severe disease activity compared to mild/no disease activity in the SECURE-IBD registry. 4 This observation is speculatively contributed to by the higher serum ACE2 activity in CD patients. 5 Clinical trials investigating the benefit of recombinant ACE2 have already been proposed and may provide further evidence for the central role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Declaration of personal interests: Doug Johnson has served as speaker for Pfizer.

The speed at which development is unfolding has led to widespread concern among both health professionals and the public that vital steps may be skipped, in particular the assessment of safety.Vaccine development has traditionally been a long process taking an average of 10-15 years. The vaccine with the shortest timeline from antigen discovery to licensure is the mumps vaccine, which took 4 years. It is the high financial cost, particularly high-risk advanced clinical development, coupled with the investment in production facilities that has, in part, hampered nimble vaccine responses to emerging infectious diseases. However, recent developments in technology along with unprecedented collaboration and investment mean we may be able to escape the barriers of the past [1] .As well as the speed at which vaccine candidates were advanced, where possible the clinical development and regulatory phases are occurring alongside each other rather than sequentially [2] . This means that while all steps are adhered to, their timing can be expedited. The desperate need for an Ebola vaccine galvanised us, and in less than 12 months, 12 clinical trials ran the gamut from a ""first in man"" dosing study to a phase III efficacy trial [3] . This was achieved through successful collaborations and running these stages in parallel [4, 5] . However, while the pre-licensure clinical programme was executed in record time, fragile settings are often ill equipped for post-licensure safety surveillance.Potential vaccine candidates need to be assessed in suitable animals for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy under challenge. Translating data from any single animal to humans can be problematic as the disease may not mimic human infection accurately, and therefore fail to predict vaccine effects, positive or negative. The models for assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines include mouse (transgenic for the human ACE2 receptor), hamster, ferret and non-human primates, depending on what question is being asked [6] . Studies of earlier SARS vaccines in animals identified two potential safety issues; antibody-dependent enhancement and cellular immunopathology. These have not been observed in human studies but flag potential responses for close examination and highlight the importance of selecting vaccine approaches and adjuvants that drive desirable responses [7] .Clinical studies in humans generally follow three phases. Phase I with 10's (~ 30 to 50) of healthy volunteers assesses the safety, immunogenicity and dose ranging; phase II progresses to 100's of volunteers and assesses safety and immunogenicity; phase III includes 10,000's of volunteers and assesses safety and efficacy. Phase III is usually placebocontrolled studies and while safety continues to be studied efficacy will be assessed. Normally, these phases progress sequentially after careful assessment of results of each stage before moving to the next. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, as with recent Ebola vaccines, these stages can be expedited without skipping anything thanks to investment and collaboration [2] . Each trial will have an independent drug safety monitoring board and ideally this group will have diverse expertise, including a biostatistician. For COVID-19 vaccines, it is recommended that there be persons with expertise in rare disease epidemiology. A meta-drug safety monitoring board has been established to ensure that highlevel expertise is available to support all drug safety monitoring boards [8, 9] .Established in 1999, this committee of 14 experts from all regions of the world meets twice a year (and when needed) to assess the safety of vaccines. They provide independent, authoritative, scientific advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) on vaccine safety issues of global or regional concern. In May 2020, the Committee focussed on COVID-19 and discussed potential safety issues that may arise with the new vaccines being developed and deployed under the emergency conditions. The Committee also considered the work being undertaken by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation-funded Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC), issues around pharmacovigilance preparedness, and safety communication at a time when vaccine hesitancy and misinformation are growing challenges.The key conclusions from this first meeting on COVID-19 vaccines was that post-licensure surveillance preparedness at both country and regional levels was urgent and that managing the 'infodemic' was critical, supporting the proposed approach and roadmap to COVID-19 vaccine benefit-risk communication [10] .The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts is the principal advisory group to WHO for vaccines and immunisation. This 15-member group advises WHO on global policies and strategies, from vaccines and technology, research and development, to delivery of immunisation and its linkages with other health interventions. For vaccine safety, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts takes the findings of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety and makes recommendations. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts are next meeting in October 2020 where COVID-19 vaccines will be considered and recommendations developed.The Brighton Collaboration is an international collaboration launched in 1999 and tasked with developing definitions and guidelines for potential adverse events following immunisation [11] . Since 2019, the Brighton Collaboration have had a contract with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation to develop tools to guide developers, regulatory agencies and health authorities through safety evaluations of vaccines developed with new technologies. This is within the SPEAC project with the objective of harmonising safety assessments with standardised tools and definitions. Since COVID-19 emerged, they have increased their activities and are developing tools to help us assess COVID-19 vaccines. These tools include templates for the different vaccine platforms, and the development of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) likely to be pertinent to COVID-19 vaccines.The SPEAC working groups have developed templates that can be completed by vaccine developers/sponsors that describe the key considerations for risk benefit assessment. There are templates for viral vector vaccines [12] , protein vaccines [13] , nucleic acid vaccines [14] and AESIs [15] . An AESI is defined by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences as:""An adverse event of special interest (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor's product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor could be appropriate. Such an event might require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by the trial sponsor to other parties (e.g., regulators) might also be warranted."" [16] The SPEAC project has developed a list of AESIs for COVID-19 vaccines based on: proven association with immunisation; proven association with a vaccine platform and/or adjuvant relevant to Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation vaccine development; theoretical concern based on immunopathogenesis; theoretical concern related to viral replication during wild-type disease; and theoretical concern because it has been demonstrated in an animal model with one or more candidate vaccine platforms [16] . These events and the definitions and guidelines on collecting and reporting them will be invaluable to support active safety surveillance and phase IV studies.Regulatory agencies are tasked with having authority over safety to protect consumers. Examples include the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Vaccines must be evaluated and approved by a national regulatory authority before they can be used. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance for industry on the development and licensure of vaccines to prevent COVID-19. It outlines key considerations needed to satisfy the regulators in their assessment of these vaccines. This covers the chemistry, manufacturing, manufacturing facilities, non-clinical data such as toxicology studies and animal models, clinical trials and plans for post-licensure evaluation [17] . The European Medicines Agency has also issued similar guidance [18] . These guidelines will also serve as a useful framework for other nations in their decision making.Most countries have a passive surveillance system for recording and reporting on adverse events following immunisation and in turn report to the WHO pharmacovigilance centre in Uppsala, Sweden. The WHO Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint I considers a minimum reporting rate of 10 per 100,000 population for functional adverse events following an immunisation surveillance system [19] . In 2017, 114 countries met or exceeded this objective [20] . However, while safety capacity has improved in many low-and middle-income countries, others still face challenges with low detection rates and reporting, the investigation of safety signals, lack of epidemiological tools for active surveillance, challenges at the national regulatory authority level, and a lack of information sharing between countries. When optimised, these systems have demonstrated their value in detecting unexpected or rare events but limitations such as the lack of a denominator and reliance on voluntary reports mean they cannot be relied on for detection and they cannot be used for causality assessment. There are also significant deficiencies in global-level reporting with over half of the total reports in 2017 received from the USA, UK, France, China and the Republic of Korea [21] . Many reports are not timely with an average of 2.4 years between event onset and report date. These limitations will clearly limit or prevent the generation of COVID-19 vaccine-related safety signals in most countries.Some countries have systems that can monitor events in at least some of their population in near real time and map to vaccine exposure. A larger number of countries can assess potential safety events retrospectively. Examples of advanced systems include the US Vaccine Safety Datalink [22, 23] and the European ADVANCE [24] . The ADVANCE project has led to a sustainability project called VAC4EU, which will support the European Medicines Agency-funded COVID-19 vaccine monitoring programme called ACCESS. While these systems have demonstrated their ability to undertake robust assessments, they are not globally representative, are restricted to locally used vaccines, and the population sizes under observation lack the power to assess very rare events such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome. These limitations can be overcome through global collaboration [25] . Distributed networks allow individual countries (or sites) to collaborate. These collaborations pull multiple countries together to conduct studies on huge numbers of people using administrative data and can compare the risks for very rare events between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Such collaborations have occurred in the past, pooled data from several countries were used to assess measles-containing vaccines and aseptic meningitis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [26, 27] , rotavirus vaccines and intussusception [28] , and the pandemic influenza vaccine and Guillain-Barre syndrome and narcolepsy [29] . However, all these studies were ad hoc, with no sustainable network in place. The capacity exists globally to assess vaccine safety. The development of this capacity is critical for the ongoing assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety but as yet lacks investment [25] .Too few countries have high functioning pharmacovigilance systems, and far fewer are able to undertake robust signal verification and post-licensure studies on safety. These countries will need to rely on data generated by those who do have the capability, perhaps placing some further ethical obligations on those countries who can, rather than rely on the predominant data contributions from Europe and the USA. Adverse events will coincide temporally with vaccine administration [30] . Prior to the use of COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to understand the background rates of conditions that may be temporally associated with vaccine administration to be able to assess observed rates vs the expected rates [31] . For most events, these rates are unknown and to further complicate matters the rates of many events, such as multiple sclerosis, vary by sex and geography [32, 33] . Developing background rates for COVID-19 vaccine AESIs for as many populations as possible is a matter of urgency.Deploying any new vaccine based on data from expedited clinical trials into a population without a functioning safety monitoring system in place is reckless and irresponsible given the tools that are available. While there are international collaborations aimed at supporting coordinated efforts in COVID-19 vaccine safety assessments, vaccine nationalism and a lack of a globally coordinated vaccine safety effort could limit the potential in this space. Furthermore, deployment of vaccines before the successful completion of robust clinical programmes could threaten not only public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines but also immunisation programmes in general.While the clinical testing of COVID-19 vaccines can be done robustly and assessment by regulatory agencies can be stringent, the vaccines are likely to be used under emergency conditions and the follow-up time from the trials will be minimal. Under such conditions, it is vital that the products are monitored (in near real time) for rare adverse events until risks can be either quantified or excluded (see Box for a case study). Only a few countries have the capability to conduct this monitoring [34] and even fewer are prepared with systems at the ready and baseline rates of AESIs established.There is an urgency to support as many sites as possible to prepare in collaboration with each other to actively monitor COVID-19 vaccines as they are deployed using common protocols so that data may be pooled, and rare events assessed in diverse populations.We have the tools to intensively monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. While billions are being spent on the development and scale manufacturing of vaccines that have yet to demonstrate efficacy, with the exception of the European Union, there is limited investment in the post-licensure phase yet, which is inexpensive in comparison. Failure to assess these vaccines for safety to our full ability is wrong. As we well know from extensive experience, vaccine safety issues can threaten not only the success of any COVID-19 vaccine programme but also routine immunisation programmes. It is vital we get this right and we have the tools and the expertise to do so and to do it well.During the 1990s and into the 2000s, New Zealand had a devastating meningococcal B disease epidemic. There was no suitable existing vaccine available, so a tailor-made outer-membrane vesicle vaccine was developed through a collaboration (New Zealand Government, University of Auckland, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, The Institute of Environmental and Research, and industry). It was tested in New Zealand in phase I, II and IIb trials then rolled out to the highest risk members of the New Zealand population after only a few thousand people had received the vaccines (for meningococcal vaccines, immunogenicity bridging data may be used for licensure as phase III trials are not feasible because of the rarity of the disease outcome). To do this safely, a multi-faceted, intensive, postlicensure safety surveillance strategy was implemented [35] . All people in the age group receiving the vaccine who went to hospital were assessed for their vaccine exposure [35] . Additionally, a proportion of primary care practices provided data on visits so that exposure to the vaccine could be assessed [36] . Weekly screening occurred against background rates (observed vs expected). An electronic national immunisation register made comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated people possible to detect any safety signals. This happened in near real time and provided high-quality data that provided reassurance about the vaccine's safety profile. Since this occurred in 2004-6, information technology has progressed, as have methodologies in pharmacoepidemiology, which make such systems cheaper and more feasible to implement.","New Zealand","first author","2020-09-30",9

As the pandemic and associated restrictions continue, there has been growing concern about the impact on mental health. Studies from around the world have shown that most individuals report increased psychological distress and worsened mental health [2] [3] [4] , an effect which seems to be amplified among those with a history of mental illness 5, 6 . Although worsened mental health has been documented across the lifespan, several studies have found young adults (aged 18-24 years) are experiencing the greatest deterioration in mental health 3, 7 . Very few studies have assessed the impact of the pandemic-related disruption on adolescents 8 , which is concerning because adolescence represents a time of social transformation, marked by an increased need for peer interaction and heightened sensitivity to social stimuli 9 . Adolescents demonstrate increased independence from their families, begin to establish relationships with peers based on shared values and ideas 10 , and become more sensitive to peer acceptance, approval and rejection than either children or adults 11 . Because of this sensitivity, it is likely that social distancing measures, together with school closures, may have a greater negative effect on adolescents. Support for this comes from a recent review of the literature involving more than 50,000 young people that found that social isolation and loneliness significantly increases the risk of mental illness in young people 12 .Beyond these studies, it is unknown how the disruption to daily life has impacted adolescents' behavior and worries as they relate to COVID-19. The impact on their peer relationships, family relationships, feelings of loneliness, learning and education, lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise, sleep, technology use), and how these relate to mental health, requires investigation to understand the support adolescents require. The overall objective of the current study is to address this gap and answer calls from the scientific community to assess how young people's lives and mental health has been impacted by the pandemic 20,21 . The first aim of this study was to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on adolescents. We included measures of psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing, which we expected to have worsened, as informed by the emerging literature 13, 14, 16 . Based on previous studies from the adult literature 5,6 , we expected that those who had a pre-existing history of depression and/or anxiety would show a worse psychological response to the pandemic.While this method may not produce a representative sample of the entire population 22 , it nonetheless allowed timely access to a significant number of young people while containment measures remained in place. The recruitment period (end of June-beginning of August 2020) included the relaxing of lockdown restrictions across Australia (end of June-beginning of July), with the exception of Melbourne and the state of Victoria, which went into a second lockdown on the 8 th of July (Melbourne) and 2 nd of August (Victoria).Participants were recruited via social media and were aged 12-18 years, living in Australia. Data was collected via the Qualtrics platform from 22 June 2020-5 August 2020.The study was approved by the UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee (HC200334). All respondents were required to pass a Gillick Competency Task to ensure the understood the study, and had the capacity to provide informed consent, before providing consent 23 .Information was collected on participants' age, school grade, gender, country of birth, language spoken at home, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, state of residence and who they lived with. Participants indicated if they had a parent or carer whose job had been impacted by the pandemic. Participants rated their self-rated health 24 , and were asked whether they had a chronic illness, had ever been diagnosed with depression or anxiety by a professional, and current mental health treatments.The items below were generated from a previous survey 25 .Physical and mental health. Young people were asked, in two separate questions, whether their physical and mental health had been impacted by the pandemic (a lot better, a little better, stayed the same, a little worse, a lot worse).Respondents indicated whether their school shut down during the pandemic and whether they participated in online learning (both yes/no). Those engaged in online learning reported up to three challenging aspects of completing school work at home, from a forced choice list (not enough family support, parents working and didn't have time to help, access to technology, speed of internet, harder to learn online, too many distractions, not enough support from teachers, not motivated, other). Participants indicated how much they felt the pandemic had impacted their learning overall (positively, not at all, negatively).Peer relationships. Two questions assessed how the pandemic had impacted participants' friendships; first, how socially connected they felt to their friends (more connected, no change, less connected); and second, impact on friendships overall (positively, negatively, not at all).Exercise. Participants indicated the number of days they exercised for at least 30 minutes over the previous week (0, 1-2 days, 2-4 days, 5-6 days, every day, don't know), and to report whether, they exercised more, less, or the same amount as they usually would.Technology use. For the previous week, participants estimated total time spent in front of screens each day, not including time spent on school work (<1 hour, 1-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 6-8 hours, and >8 hours). They also reported how much time was used to connect with friends or family (same response options) and whether their use of technology had changed since the pandemic (less than before, the same, more than before).Sleep. Sleep was measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which is a sevenitem self-report measure of insomnia symptoms over the previous two weeks 26 . Responses are reported on a Likert scale from 0-4 with the following cut-off scores: 0-7 no clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 subthreshold insomnia, 15-21 moderate severity insomnia, 22-28 severe insomnia 26 . The ISI has been widely administered to, and validated in, general adolescent samples 27 .The Kessler-6 (K6) assessed general psychological distress over the past 30 days 29, 30 , and the 7-item Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale -short form SWEMWS; 31 assessed mental wellbeing over the past two weeks. Both scales have been validated for use in young people 32, 33 . The three item Body Preoccupation Scale of the Illness Attitude Scales 34 was administered to assess health anxiety.Participants responded to study advertisements by clicking on a link which took them to the survey landing page. They read the electronic information sheet and consent form, completed the Gillick Competency Task, before accessing the survey. Upon completion, participants were placed in a draw to win one of five $50 vouchers.Demographic and clinical characteristics were reported using descriptive analyses.In total, 1743 young people viewed the study page, and 945 participants provided consent and started the survey. Of those, 185 did not provide enough data (<90% complete) to be included. The final sample comprised 760 participants. Table 1 summarizes participant characteristics. Participants were 14.8 years on average, and ranged in school year from Years 7-12. Most were female (72%), spoke English at home (87.7%) and were born in Australia (88.1%). Participants lived across all states and territories. Almost two-thirds of the sample (63.2%) reported living with two parents, and 50% indicated that their parent or carer's job had been impacted by the pandemic.The mean rating for overall health was 3.44/5 (SD=1.01), with most rating their health as either 'good' (29.8%) or 'very good' (38.5%). Twenty one percent reported a current chronic illness, 34% reported a previous diagnosis of either depression or anxiety, and 27.8%were receiving current mental health treatment (See Table 1 ).Physical and mental health.

After removing those who did not know if they had a diagnosis or chose not to say, 60% percent of the remaining sample reported no history of mental illness, and 40% reported a previous diagnosis of depression or anxiety (3.9% depression only, 12.6% anxiety only, and 23.3% both depression and anxiety). These categories were collapsed for the subsequent analyses into presence or absence of a diagnosed depression and/or anxiety. Participants with a history of depression or anxiety reported worse mental and physical health on all measures (see Table 3 ), and reported lower levels of exercise, great use of technology, poorer sleep, higher levels of loneliness, uncertainty about the future, psychological distress, health anxiety and lower levels of wellbeing (all ps <0.05; see Table 3 for full statistics).See Supplementary materials for results. There was a significant positive correlation between fears about contracting COVID-19, and behaviour change, feelings of uncertainty about the future, poor sleep, psychological distress, and health anxiety (all ps<.01). Greater exercise was associated with lower levels of screen time, better sleep, lower levels of psychological distress and a greater sense of wellbeing (ps<.01). Overall screen time was associated with more psychological distress; however, when screen time was used to connect with friends and family, the relationship with distress was no longer evident, and increased screen time for connection was associated with lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of wellbeing (ps<.01). Finally, as expected, all the mental health variables were significantly associated, with positive correlations between loneliness, health anxiety and psychological distress, and an inverse association between these variables and wellbeing being detected.This survey of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years provides the first insight into the disruption experienced following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although respondents had little direct or indirect experience with COVID-19, more than three quarters were worried about contracting the virus, replicating findings with adults 6 and adolescents 14 .Most young people believed they could reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19 and engaged in behaviors to lower their (e.g., handwashing and social distancing), in contrast to common portrayals by the media suggesting young people are not compliant with restrictions e.g., 35 . Our results showed that worry about contracting COVID-19 was associated with greater levels of overall behaviour change, demonstrating a practical benefit of some degree of worry.This study also sheds light on the disruption and impact of the pandemic on young people's lives. Almost the whole sample (>95%) had engaged in online learning, and most reported a negative impact. At the time our survey was undertaken, schools and families had to adapt to online learning from home with little-to-no preparation time. While meta-analyses have shown that with optimal delivery and support, online formats can be as effective as faceto-face in terms of learning outcomes for adults 36 , there is no evidence to suggest this is the case for young people. Indeed, because school education is primarily face-to-face, data about the effectiveness of online schooling is lacking. Online learning requires a greater level of independence, motivation, and discipline than classroom learning and these are skills which young people may not have fully developed 37 .Participants reported a negative effect of the pandemic on friendships, and feelings of loneliness, which were associated with higher psychological distress and lower wellbeing. perpetuity.Most respondents indicated that the pandemic had increased stress levels within their family and half reported an impact on the job of a parent or carer. Viewed in this context, together with adjusting to online learning and the requirement for parents to manage their own professional responsibilities with caring and supporting their child's learning, it is not surprising this has been a stressful time for families. This aligns with findings from around the world that are beginning to highlight higher levels of stress and mental ill-health experienced by certain sub-groups of the population, including women, who are more likely to be in caring roles, as well as parents and young people 3, 7 . Despite this increased family stress, >50% indicated that their relationships with family members had remained unchanged, and an additional 18.7% reported an improvement. It could be the case that in some families, more time at home with family members has some advantages, and feeling more connected to loved ones is a benefit of COVID-19 that has been documented in the adult literature 41 .Of concern was that about half of the sample reported a worsening in their physical health since the pandemic began, while 75% reported a negative effect on their mental health.The worsening of mental health in our sample was markedly consistent to that of a recent adult Australian survey 6 , which found that 78% of their respondents had reported worsened mental health. Overall, young people reported greater psychological distress and lower levels of wellbeing relative to normative data available from population surveys conducted prior to the pandemic 44, 45 , with rates of psychological distress indicative of probable mental illness increasing almost two fold from 24.3% before the pandemic 45 , to 48.3% in this survey. This finding accords from the studies from China showing elevated mental illness 8 . It is important to note that the K6 is not a diagnostic interview and so without information about the exact duration of the symptoms, degree of interference in daily life and distress to the individual, drawing diagnostic conclusions is not possible. We also cannot rule out the heightened levels of psychological distress as being at least in part attributable to sampling bias, inherent with online surveys. With these limitations in mind, our data nonetheless suggest that there are significantly elevated rates of psychological distress 45 , providing insight into the acute effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health.The findings reported in this study underscore the need for a proactive mental health response to support young people through this tumultuous and disruptive time in their lives.High levels of psychological distress reported in this study are consistent with increased demands on youth mental health services e.g., 18 . Readily accessible interventions are needed for young people that are engaging and effective, with a focus on treatment, and prevention.Digital mental health interventions, and blended modalities with combine digital with clinician support hold this promise 47 .Sincere thanks to all the study participants for taking part in this survey.

WA recorded 620 cases in the first 6 months of 2020 and nine deaths, with early restrictions helping to combat the outbreak with few recurrences. We examined week-by-week change in hospital ED presentations between the start of the COVID-19 outbreak and until the easing of restrictions, and compared the results against the same period in 2019.Mental health attendances to three WA North Metropolitan Health Services EDs were extracted from the Emergency Department Data Collection database. The area population comprises approximately 800,000 residents, 9 with mental and behavioural disorders representing 5% of all ED presentations. 10 Collection dates ranged from 25 January to 1 May for 2 consecutive years (2019 and 2020), corresponding to the first case of COVID-19 in Australia until the easing of restrictions. Incomplete weeks (beginning and end of periods) were excluded from analysis. Variables extracted included patient demographics, ED service usage (admissions, transfers, discharges and length of stay), reasons for presentation (coded symptom descriptors) and most common principal psychiatric diagnoses (ICD-10, comprising 92.4% of cases with a diagnoses), using standardised coding. 11 Frequent attendees were defined as individuals presenting four or more times within the study period.Data were analysed using the statistical package Jamovi. The number and percentages of attendances and individual persons are reported, and groups were compared with independent samples t-test or χ 2 test. Approvals were provided by the North Metropolitan Health Service (NMHS) Quality Assurance and Evaluation with the intent to publish with Human Research Ethics Committee overview.Data included 7140 attendances (5522 persons) over the two study periods (Table 1) . Compared to 2019, ED data from 2020 showed significantly fewer presentations, and individual cases (including frequent attendees) (p < .001). There was no difference in age or gender, but Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were less likely to present to EDs in 2020 (from 4.4% to 2.8%). In addition, the 2020 data showed significantly reduced length of stay (5.6 h vs 6.7 h, p < .001), and a 2.4% reduction in the use of private transport (p = .042) with an equivalent increase in ambulance use (p = .041). There were also (non-significant) reductions in non-and semi-urgent presentations (1.4%), with a corresponding increase in more urgent triage categories, and individuals were less likely to wait to be attended. Figure 1 shows a rapid decline in ED attendances, which is aligned with the rise in COVID-19 cases. The change in presentation closely follows the first COVID-19 death in one of these hospitals, and the beginning of restrictions (on 9 March). In Week 10, there was a 43% reduction in ED presentations compared to 2019.In 2020, the most common psychiatric diagnoses were neurotic and stress-related disorders (41.9%), substance-related disorders (22.2%), followed by schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (11.0%), affective disorders (9.2%) and other organic mental disorders (8.1%). Table 2 lists the most common mental health complaints and reasons for ED presentation. Compared to 2019, presentations due to anxiety/panic symptoms and social/behavioural issues increased by approximately 10%, but there were significant reductions across all other complaint types. Suicidality and self-harm behaviours, usually the most common reasons for ED presentations in previous years, dropped by 26%. In addition, the proportion of drug-related presentations increased from 47% to 56%, while alcohol-related presentation declined from 53% to 44%.The current findings showed significant reductions in mental health-related ED presentations, compared to 2019. This does not support early speculations about a possible surge in mental health service access, although it is aligned with early observations in Europe. [12] [13] [14] In this report, a unique finding is the demonstration of a temporal coincidence in the decline of ED presentations, which coincided with the growth of new COVID-19 cases and which points to a causal epidemiological association. 15 Our analysis of patient characteristics and service access suggested that a number of social and individual factors influenced service access. 8 Reductions in the number of vulnerable groups such as indigenous people as well as reductions in waiting time and in the use of private transport suggest a fear of contagion from hospitals settings. [16] [17] [18] These may be viewed as high-risk locations for contracting the disease, 16 especially given media coverage about hospital systems being overwhelmed.Another factor possibly involved government guidance. Quarantine, travel restrictions and social distancing likely contributed to significant reduction in presentations and the use of private transport. Reduction of alcohol-related presentations also coincides with WA government's limits in the sale of alcohol to curb alcohol-related violence and damage to health.The current finding of reduced ED presentations is unlikely to reflect a lowered prevalence of mental illness in the community given the results of recent population surveys, and therefore raise questions about coping mechanisms of individuals in crisis. It is likely that alternative services were accessed. For example, calls to mental health helplines increased by 30%, 19, 20 suggesting that individuals found other ways to access care without travelling to EDs. Given evidence suggesting that helpline and telephone counselling services have a positive impact on suicide ideation and prevention, 21-23 the recent release of government funding to community organisations is much needed. Nonetheless, service options for people in crisis must be reviewed taking into account the individual and social restrictions imposed by the pandemic.Current limitations included a focus on ED, which is not representative of other mental health support services and all population groups. Second, the results are difficult to extrapolate to other states in Australia, given the relatively privileged position of WA due to the early implementation of strict restriction measures and small population density. Finally, the results point to a temporal association between individual and societal changes due to COVID-19 and reductions in ED presentations, but causal extrapolation cannot be conclusively determined. While temporality is an essential criterion in determining causality, 15 other criteria such as strength of association 24 require independent examination.In conclusion, indicators of community psychological distress in the early months of COVID-19 did not correspond to an increase in ED mental health presentations Note. ED = emergency department, M = mean, NEAT = National Emergency Access Target, Obs = observation, SD = standard deviation. in WA. Future research is required to better understand whether this surge has simply been delayed or rechannelled via other routes. Regarding the surge of anxiety amongst young people and those who are experiencing strong lockdown measures, additional mental health services and/or subsidised psychological counselling should be provided.","Australia","first author","2020-09-22",9

However, little is known regarding the postthaw quality of such allogeneic products or the effect of precryopreservation storage and processing on these characteristics. We investigated the postthaw CD34 1 cell recovery and viability of 305 allogeneic HPC products cryopreserved at 9 laboratories across Australia. Median postthaw CD34 1 cell recovery was 76% and ranged from 6% to 122%. Longer transit time before cryopreservation, white cell count (WCC) during storage, and complex product manipulation before cryopreservation were independently associated with inferior postthaw CD34 1 cell recovery. Longer precryopreservation transit time and WCC were also associated with inferior postthaw CD34 1 cell viability. We conclude that although postthaw CD34 1 cell recovery and viability of cryopreserved allogeneic HPC is generally acceptable, there is a significant risk of poor postthaw product quality, associated with prolonged storage time, higher WCC, and complex product manipulation precryopreservation. Awareness of expected postthaw recovery and practices that influence it will assist collection, processing, and transplant centers in optimizing outcomes for transplant recipients.Cryopreservation of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products is currently recommended by many professional bodies before the allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient commences conditioning, to reduce risks that have developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 1-3 These risks include the possibility of donor or recipient infection and disrupted transport routes. Cryopreservation and infusion of thawed HPC products are well established for autologous HPCs and cord blood. In the setting of limited cell dose with umbilical cord blood transplantation, the postthaw CD34 1 cell dose has been demonstrated to influence recipient engraftment. 4 Furthermore, postthaw graft quality of cord blood units is influenced by factors such as volume of storage, processing technique, and processing facility accreditation. 5 In the adult donor setting, less is known regarding the effect of precryopreservation characteristics on postthaw graft quality of frozen allogeneic HPC products. In particular, the possibility of prolonged liquid storage time related to travel from collection center to cryopreservation laboratory is unique to this setting and does not usually occur before cryopreservation of autologous HPC or cord blood. Although prolonged liquid storage of HPC has not been shown to adversely affect engraftment time for products infused while ""fresh,"" it is not known whether the same is true of cryopreserved products. 6 Therefore, we investigated factors influencing the postthaw quality of cryopreserved allogeneic HPCs, to inform practice for transplantation, collection, and processing centers during the current COVID-19 pandemic.We collected data on allogeneic bone marrow (HPC-M) or G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood (HPC-A) products cryopreserved at participating Australian cell processing laboratories between 2015 and 2019 inclusive. Where the product had been split, data were collected for the cryopreserved portion only. Transit time was defined as the time from completion of collection to commencement of cryopreservation. All products were cryopreserved in controlled rate freezers, and CD34 1 cell quantitation was performed with single-platform assays. However, composition of cryopreservation mixture and postthaw processing of samples before viable CD34 1 cell quantitation were not standardized between laboratories (supplemental Methods). Regression analysis was used as described. Medians were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test, and the effect of categorical variables on binary outcomes was assessed by the x 2 test. Analysis was performed with SPSS, version 24.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL).Nine centers contributed data on 305 products (n 5 17 HPC-Ms and n 5 288 HPC-As). Precryopreservation product characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Transit time was .36 hours for 110 products (36%) and .48 hours for 28 (9%). All HPC-M products underwent volume reduction by buffy coat enrichment before cryopreservation. The majority of HPC-As (n 5 274) underwent no manipulation or only plasma reduction before cryopreservation, whereas the remainder were CD34 selected (n 5 10) or washed (n 5 4).Postthaw product quality as assessed on pilot samples is summarized in Table 1 . The median CD34 1 cell recovery (precryopreservation/ postthaw viable CD34 1 cell count) ranged widely from 6% to 122%. Forty-seven products (15%) had ,50% and 4 products (1%) had ,20% CD34 1 recovery after thawing, but here was no apparent enumeration, transportation, or processing mishap to explain such poor postthaw recovery. On univariate linear regression analysis, a weak correlation was observed between CD34 1 cell recovery and transit time, initial white cell count (WCC), product type, and precryopreservation manipulation, whereas no correlation was observed with initial product volume (Table 2) . On multivariate analysis, however, only transit time, initial WCC, and manipulation status were associated with CD34 1 cell recovery with statistical significance ( Table 2 ).Products that had been collected .36 hours (estimated threshold for overseas products) before cryopreservation had a lower median CD34 1 cell recovery (72% vs 77%; P 5 .061) and a higher likelihood of poor (,50%) CD34 1 cell recovery (21% vs 12%; P 5 .049). Poor (,50%) recovery was even more common for products collected .48 hours before cryopreservation (43% vs 13%; P , .001). Furthermore, of 11 products with travel time .36 hours that then underwent manipulation, 7 (60%) had CD34 1 cell recovery ,50%.Similarly, products with an initial WCC .300 3 10 9 /L, the recommended maximum for transportation of HPC-As, 7 were more likely to have ,50% CD34 1 cell recovery (25% vs 13%; P 5 .021). Conversely, of 75 products with WCC in the lowest quartile (,180 3 10 9 /L), 56% had excellent (.80%) CD34 1 cell recovery, compared with only 34% of samples with WCC $180 3 10 9 /L (P , .001).Postthaw CD34 1 cell viability (percentage of viable events within the CD34 1 cell gate) was available for 139 samples from 6 centers. Both transit time and WCC were associated with postthaw CD34 1 cell viability (Figure 1 ).As of 20 March 2020, 111 products (36%) had been thawed and infused (Table 1) . Of 80 products infused alone as HPCs for transplantation, neutrophil recovery occurred in 75 (94%) at a median of 19 days after infusion (range, 12-33 days). All 5 infused products with ,50% CD34 1 cell recovery achieved neutrophil recovery (median, 16 days; range, 12-33 days). At the time of this writing, only 1 of 9 products with ,20% recovery had been infused, as donor lymphocytes.In this analysis of 305 samples from cryopreserved allogeneic HPC products, we observed a median CD34 1 cell recovery of 74%, with poorer recovery associated with longer duration of liquid storage, higher WCC during storage, and complex cell processing (eg, CD34 1 cell selection) before cryopreservation. Although the magnitude of each of these effects was small in our analysis, they were incremental, such that the likelihood of poor CD34 1 cell recovery in a manipulated product with long liquid storage time was relatively high.Our findings differ from those reported in 2 previous studies, in which allogeneic products cryopreserved at single centers had mean CD34 1 cell recoveries of .90%. 8, 9 The smaller sample sizes in the earlier studies and different HPC processing and CD34 1 cell quantitation practices may account for this discrepancy.CD34 1 cell viability showed a greater correlation with transit time than CD34 1 cell recovery and also was associated with WCC of the product during transit. Further study of the relationship of storage conditions and duration of transport with postthaw CD34 1 cell viability is warranted.Although most products infused as HPCs achieved neutrophil recovery, the number of infused products was too small to allow for meaningful investigation of the effect of pre-or postthaw parameters on clinical efficacy. Registry studies suggest that cryopreservation Transit time (hours) itself may not alter clinical outcomes, with the exception of transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. [10] [11] [12] However, the effect of precryopreservation conditions was not examined in these studies.Our observations support the conclusion that transplant centers should request a higher CD34 1 cell dose from donors whose products are to be cryopreserved and suggest that optimization of precryopreservation factors, such as transit time and WCC, during storage may improve postthaw yield. Arrangements for cryopreservation of HPC products at collection centers or regional hubs before long-distance shipment should result in fewer products with long (eg, .36 hour) liquid storage times before cryopreservation. However, some registries continue to recommend cryopreservation of unrelated donor products at transplant centers, a process that may increase risks of poor postthaw graft quality caused by the increased transit time. 2 Our data also support diluting products to a maximum WCC of 300 3 10 9 /L before transport and cryopreservation. Ultimately, however, these factors accounted for only a small proportion of the overall variability in CD34 1 cell recovery (r 2 5 0.121; Table 2 ). Thus, as recently recommended by the World Marrow Donor Association, 13 transplant centers must be cognizant of the risk of unexpectedly poor postthaw CD34 1 cell recovery and take steps to mitigate it, including examination of thawed pilot vials before the commencement of conditioning therapy.

At September 2 nd 2020, there have been more than 25 million cases of COVID-19 reported to the World Health Organization, with over 800,000 deaths globally (1). In many countries, high rates of community infection have resulted in extreme pressure on health services, with an observed increased risk of COVID-19 infection in front-line healthcare workers (HCWs). (2) To date, factors associated with COVID-19 infection in HCWs overseas have included inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), exposure to large numbers of patients with COVID-19, worker fatigue, and limited access to diagnostic testing leading to potential under-recognition of cases (2) (3) (4) .In Australia, the prevalence of COVID-19 remains comparatively low compared to many other countries. A 'first wave' of COVID-19 occurred in March / April, prompting implementation of nationwide public health interventions, including closing of the Australian international border (5) . During this initial phase of the epidemic, infections in HCWs were largely attributable to transmission events arising from returning international travellers, as evidenced by distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in infected patients (5) . This observation was also made amongst infected HCWs at our own health service (6) .Since mid-June, the state of Victoria has experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases requiring re-implementation of a range of public health interventions. Concurrent with this, there was a significant increase in COVID-19 infection amongst staff. At our institution, the Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) we observed a marked increase in infections amongst hospital staff during July and August 2020. Although considerable planning had been undertaken in preparation for possible outbreaks in our setting, we identified a number of 'real-world' challenges in controlling staff infections, particularly the sheer rapidity of disease spread. To inform future responses to HCW infections in the Australian setting, we present a descriptive epidemiological analysis of HCW infections at our institution and describe the suite of interventions associated with outbreak control.The RMH is a 550-bed University-affiliated tertiary hospital in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. The hospital manages a state-wide trauma service, state-wide allogeneic stem cell transplant service, as well as providing renal transplantation, neurosurgical and cardiac All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The health service provided a rapid access clinic for symptomatic staff to obtain COVID-19 testing throughout the pandemic. In addition all people tested in the public screening clinic were asked to identify themselves as HCW. Concurrently, all positive tests state-wide were reported to the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and infections in HCWs were reported back to their health service (to capture anyone tested at outside laboratories). Every infected HCW had a detailed interview conducted by a trained infection prevention clinical nurse consultant /contact tracer to identify close contacts amongst the staff, patients or visitors. Staff with COVID-19 were required to isolate at home or in a hotel for at least 10 days post symptom onset, according to DHHS guidelines. Staff contacts were furloughed from the workplace for 14 days and quarantined, patient contacts were managed using appropriate infection control precautions, and community contacts were advised to home quarantine. Outbreaks, defined as two or more epidemiologically and / or spatially linked cases in HCWs and/or patients, were managed by a multidisciplinary incident management team. Records of decisions made were collected prospectively in minutes from meetings held daily by the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) which was activated under RMH Emergency plan to provide central command for the health service.Health service-wide asymptomatic staff testing was offered in May 2020 (prior to this study's inclusion period) and from 25th to 31st July 2020. In addition, in the context of focal ward outbreaks, targeted asymptomatic screening occurred at least weekly for staff and patients in affected wards.Deep nasal and throat swabs were used to obtain samples for nucleic acid testing (RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the Coronavirus Typing assay All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.(AusDiagnostics), a 2-step, heminested multiplex tandem PCR, with 7 coronavirus RNA targets plus a proprietary artificial sequence as an internal control (7) . All positive samples were subject to additional confirmatory PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 at a local reference laboratory, using previously published primers (8) .Data regarding HCW infections were entered into data collection project in REDCap (v10), then extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and analysed in Stata (v16).Data reported in this study were collected as part of quality assurance activities of the infection prevention service and fit under the existing quality assurance ethics approval from RMH.Over a nine week period between 1st July 2020 and 31st August 2020, 262 cases of COVID-19 were identified amongst RMH staff ( Figure 1 ). Of cases, 21.7% were in males and 78.3% were in females, with a median age of 32.7 years (interquartile range 26.8 to 44.9 years) (Table 1) . Overall, 28 HCWs (10.6%) with COVID-19 infection needed hospitalization, including 13 who required admission to inpatient wards, while 15 required a hospital-in-thehome admission (inpatient bed-substitution care in a patient's own home). Two staff required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), none required mechanical ventilation and there were no deaths. Of those whose roles were known, nurses were the most affected staff group comprising 68.3% followed by support staff (such as food and cleaning services staff) 14.5% and then doctors 8.0% (see Table 1 ). Of the affected medical staff, 17/21 were doctors-intraining. The majority of staff infections occurred in staff working on geriatric and rehabilitation inpatient wards at RPC, and in acute wards with large numbers of COVID-19 positive patients managed concurrently (""hot wards""). No operating theatre staff and no staff working in the four residential aged care facilities managed by RMH were identified as being COVID-19 positive in the time period described. The ICU had between 0 and 10 (median 7)concurrent patients with COVID-19 infection over the period, and 4 staff in the ICU were identified as having acquired COVID-19 infection. The median turnaround time for HCW All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The highest number of COVID-19 infected inpatients was at RPC; overall, RPC staff constituted approximately 10% of the total staff workforce (the exact number is difficult to ascertain as some staff move between sites), but RPC staff made up 40.8% (n=107) of COVID-19 HCW infections. Between 12 th and 18 th July, RPC received a large number of patient admissions from residential aged care facilities with outbreaks of COVID-19. These admitted residents were positive at admission and were managed in transmission-based precautions throughout their stay. PPE was always readily available, and staff were trained in its use. COVID-19 cases in staff rapidly escalated across all six wards at the campus after 16 th July, and peaked on 27 th July. As new staff infections were recognized, all six wards were progressively moved to being managed with all patients in transmission-based precautions. The peak number of patients with COVID-19 infection being cared for at RPC was 60 patients.At RPC there are a variety of buildings built from the 1970s to early 2000; most have central air conditioning plants but one area has a local split system. An engineering review of the wards at RPC revealed that air exchanges met current requirements, however, more detailed assessment of air movement was carried out which suggested that some wards were not as well ventilated as others. Some patients were in single rooms, but many were in multi-bed spaces where it was difficult to physically distance patients. Staff reported patients often suffering from a delirium with accompanying wandering behaviours and repeated vocalisation. As contact tracing led to large numbers of staff being furloughed, the remaining staff experienced high workloads and care became increasingly difficult. A decision was made by the EOC on 3 rd August 2020 to close 4 wards at RPC, a process that was completed by 8 th August 2020. Fifteen patients were moved to other health services, while the remaining 45 patients were managed in wards with more modern infrastructure where increased physical separation with patients each having their own room was possible. The closure of these wards coincided with a reduction in HCW infections, although multiple interventions had also been implemented concurrently ( Table 2 ). All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.At RMH city campus, the majority of affected staff were working in wards with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infected patients (Table 1) . These staff were highly trained in PPE use, and appropriate PPE was always readily available. On one occasion, staff congregation in a tearoom was identified as a likely opportunity for transmission between staff. On other occasions, staff noted that particular behaviours in infected patients appeared to be linked to transmission events (distressed patients shouting, vigorous coughing). The peak combined prevalence of inpatients at RPC and city campus was 99 inpatients on 5 th August 2020.Action was undertaken to reduce the density of patients on the COVID-19 wards by ensuring that all patients with COVID-19 had single rooms, where possible. Between 21 and25 th July 2020, the use of N95 particulate respirators by all staff at all times on COVID-19 wards at RMH was implemented. In addition, 'spotters' were deployed to observe PPE donning and doffing; ward walk arounds by senior staff were undertaken regularly to identify emerging issues; wards were de-cluttered; and increased cleaning and active cleaning monitoring were also undertaken. Staff working on hot wards were advised to attend for asymptomatic testing at least weekly when cases of HCW infection had occurred on a ward. The incidence of cases in HCWs fell progressively thereafter.On three occasions, cases in HCWs working outside the designated 'hot wards' were identified. In some cases, prior work at RPC was identified as a possible risk factor for infection in the index case. The health service developed a management plan for these wards that included: closing the ward to new admissions; moving patients to single rooms (where possible); managing the whole ward using transmission-based precautions; notifying all discharged patients to quarantine in their homes or in the next facility for 14 days; deep cleaning of wards, and testing all patients and staff on each ward at least weekly until no new cases were identified. In each cluster at least one additional staff and/or patient case was identified through the enhanced testing. In the context of these staff cases on 'cold wards', hospital-wide asymptomatic staff testing occurred from 25th-31st July 2020. This was accompanied by testing of all admitted patients over one week. Over 600 staff and all hospital inpatients were tested with no additional cases identified.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The health service responses were multifactorial and iterative with daily review of emerging information that informed ongoing decisions. Case numbers were reviewed daily and reported to the EOC. A dashboard on the hospital intranet was set up to give real time numbers of infected and furloughed staff. Importantly, a 'hierarchy of controls' was used to manage these outbreaks, with the importance of each of the measures varying depending on the context of each of the clusters ( Table 2) . A proactive approach was used to support the wellbeing of both infected and furloughed staff with dedicated nursing and medical staff to monitor physical health (symptoms assessment, oximetry), mental health (counselling) and provide practical supports (delivery of food parcels, blankets, hotel rooms). This service managed over 680 staff during this period.We describe the largest institutional outbreak of HCW infections with SARS-CoV-2 reported in Australia to date. Management of outbreaks is core business for infection prevention services and is based on an established and effective suite of evidence-based interventions.Our response was necessarily iterative, pragmatic, and often pre-dated formal recommendations from state and federal government. During these outbreaks, a number of key factors emerged that shaped our responses, extending well beyond a focus on PPE alone.First, the concept of a 'critical burden' of infection framed our responses to patient movement and ward closures. Concurrent with large numbers of cases in the hospital and the community, the number of staff who acquired infection rose rapidly. Based on overseas experience (9, 10), we hypothesised that large numbers of patients in a confined space may have created a higher density of droplets or aerosolised particles and environmental contamination that may have been important. This concept triggered a detailed assessment of the physical layout of each ward, including the possible role of patient placement and air circulation. RMH was built in 1944 with progressive additions over time, and thus different ventilation systems exist depending on the age of each ward and building. The intensity of transmission in these wards led to a decision to close four wards, and to move some patients to other health care services. In addition, reports of staff experiences derived from case interviews also informed our response. For example, several staff at RPC noted that COVID-19 patients who had a delirium and vocalising loudly may have contributed to transmission of infection which led to a decision to cease cohorting patients. Further we adopted the use of N95 respirators for staff working in areas with large numbers of COVID-19 patients. While All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Second, the availability of rapid and accessible testing for staff was critical to informing realtime outbreak management. In our health service, testing results were generally available within 12-24 hours of sample collection, with easy access for staff to testing facilities. Recent work from overseas highlights the importance of access to testing for healthcare workers (13, 14). Rapid availability of data informed our daily incident management meetings and enabled decisions to be made using the best possible information. Detailed work, including genomic analysis and a case control study, is underway to understand better and assess the specific risk factors for healthcare acquisition of COVID-19 at our health service.Finally, the importance of staff communication and well-being cannot be understated. Similar to other studies (4, 15), many staff reported physical and mental fatigue and stress during these outbreaks. In addition, workforce shortages meant that staff were taking on extra shifts at short notice and working in unfamiliar roles. Accordingly, access to employee support programmes was an important element of this response.Although we acknowledge the descriptive nature of our study, and the lack of rigorous evidence to support aspects of our response, we believe our real-world experience has several learning points for other institutions across Australia. Further work should include improved state and national coordination regarding organisational responses to HCW infections.Chris Baillie, Vivian Leung and Neha Verma for support in data collection and analysis.

The SARS-CoV-2 envelope proteins trigger antibodies that are neutralising; the most important is thought to be the spike protein (S), which is responsible for attachment, fusion and viral entry into host cells, 2 and is an obvious target for serology test development. Other potential targets include the nucleocapsid protein (N). 3 Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are detected 7-10 days post-illness onset with studies showing the majority of patients seroconverting by weeks 2-3; this can vary depending on factors including the patient's immune status and disease severity. 4 Serology alone is not recommended for acute diagnosis of COVID-19, though is likely to be useful in the confirmation of recent or past COVID-19 infections (for example, in patients presenting seven or more days from symptom onset). Serology has proven useful in detecting convalescent cases to aid establishing epidemiological links between clusters. 5 It is uncertain whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies indicates immunity from further infection, and how long antibodies persist following acute infection.There is widespread interest in the use of point-of-care tests (POCTs). A media release by the Commonwealth Minister for Health in late March stated that the Australian Government had ordered 1.5 million POCTs to expand Australia's testing capacity for COVID-19 disease. 6 Potential benefits include a rapid turnaround time (as short as 15 minutes) and ease of performance, especially advantageous in remote and rural settings. 7 Most commercially available POCTs are based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens or antibodies, and are generally rapid lateral flow assays (LFA) that detect IgM and/or IgG.Twenty-two POCTs have been listed by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use in Australia, and are undergoing an expedited post-marketing evaluation on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. 8 Previous experience with antigen-detecting LFA for influenza have shown reduced sensitivity compared to NAT. [9] [10] [11] Concerns regarding the lack of robust validation of POCTs and the significant consequences of their misapplication has led to several bodies including the World Health Organization, the TGA, the Public Health Laboratory Network and The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia to caution against their use for diagnosis of COVID-19 disease.This study aimed to assess the analytic and clinical performance of POCTs in identifying SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, and so to help determine their role in the Australian setting.We conducted a retrospective study evaluating the clinical sensitivity and specificity of four commercial lateral flow assay devices marketed as POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2specific antibodies. All POCT were performed using serum according to the manufacturer's protocol. Test results were interpreted as negative, equivocal or positive depending on appearance of the band on J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the testing strip. Equivocal results were included as positive tests in our analyses, as the presence of a faint band is likely to be conservatively interpreted as positive by clinicians.The in-house immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and neutralisation antibody assay were used as the benchmark. Compared to NAT-confirmed cases, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting one or more classes of SARS-CoV2 antibodies (IgG, IgM or IgA) by IFA when collected 14 days or more after symptoms onset was 91.3% (95% Cl 84.9-95.6) and 98.9% (98.4-99.8) respectively. 12 The principles of viral neutralisation and the IFA have been previously described. [13] [14] [15] Sixty serum samples were obtained from COVID-19 NAT-confirmed patients (n=17) or COVID-19 suspected patients without positive NAT tests (n=3) who were symptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases. The NAT method used was an in-house nucleic acid test targeting E gene and RdRp: the primers have been described elsewhere. 16 Both initial samples (n=20) and convalescent samples (n=40) were included. All confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients had SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and/or IgA antibodies detected by both IFA and neutralisation on one or more serum samples. Clinical data were available including date of symptom onset, SARS-CoV-2 NAT results and possible exposure history. In SARS-CoV-2 seropositive samples, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and/or IgA were regarded as suggestive of a recent infection. The detection of SARS-CoV-2specific IgG alone could not reliably be used to differentiate a past infection from a recent infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG can often precede IgM or IgA following acute infection, and so the test should be interpreted within the context of the patient's date of symptom onset and potential exposure. This pattern has also been documented in SARS and SARS-CoV-2. [17] [18] [19] There were 18 patients with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and/or IgA detected by IFA, suggestive of a recent infection. A past infection was defined as a resolution of symptoms in addition to being 10 days or more from first positive NAT with the absence of a positive IFA IgM/IgA. Two patients had isolated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG detected, with one patient likely having a past infection, as onset of symptoms predated serology by 50 days. The second patient likely had a recent infection with IgG development prior to appearance of IgM or IgA. Negative control samples (n=72) were collected from stored baseline testing for asymptomatic staff submitted at the start of the pandemic (n=9), symptomatic patients found to be SARS-CoV-2 NAT negative (n=21), serum samples submitted before the pandemic (June to August 2019) for respiratory pathogen testing found to be positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibodies (n=8) or influenza A antibodies (n=19), and samples positive for rheumatoid factor (n=15). These negative control samples were negative (titre <10) for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM and IgA by IFA and for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody.A total of 132 serum samples from 91 patients were tested by the OnSite COVID-19, Sinocare SARS-CoV-2, Standard Q COVID-19 Duo and Combo antibody tests. Only 100 samples from 60 patients (including 60 samples from confirmed or suspected patients and 40 negative control samples) were tested by the Innovita 2019-nCov Antibody Test, due to a limited availability of testing kits.Tang et al. highlighted the importance of distinguishing 'analytic' and 'clinical' sensitivity when assessing methods to detect COVID-19, namely the ability of an assay to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies when present in sera, versus the ability of an assay to identify a patient's overall immune status to the virus. 20 The analytical sensitivity and specificity of each POCT was calculated independently for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM in comparison to IFA. Clinical sensitivity was defined as the assessment of the overall development of antibodies in individual patients, and was measured as the detection of any antibody in any sample from a given patient. In addition, the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the test's ability to ascertain a correct immune status was assessed. Furthermore, we compared the sensitivity rate of specimens collected more than 14 days following onset of symptoms.We also evaluated the median IFA antibody titre of the samples which were positive on each of the POCTs. Binomial 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all proportions.We calculated the window periods from the onset of symptoms until antibody detection in three patients with serial collections who initially had negative serology.Characteristics of all 91 patients including 20 COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients and 71 uninfected patients are summarised in Table 1 .When individually assessing the 60 samples from the 20 confirmed or suspected COVID patients, 55/60 samples had IgG detected and of those, 49 also had SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and/or IgA detected. In 6/60 samples, only IgG was detected. The majority of samples (40%) were collected in week two post-onset of symptoms. Three patients had evidence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody seroconversion on serial testing and four-fold rise of IgG, a further three patients had a four-fold IgG rise (see Table 2 ).Performance characteristics of the commercial POCT IgG and IgM assays compared to IFA are summarised in Table 2 . All had poor sensitivities for IgG and IgM, with relatively high specificities. Our evaluation had significantly lower sensitivity than the stated performances provided by the manufacturer for all POCTs (see Table 3 ). However, the Standard Q Duo and Combo tests had increasing sensitivity with symptom onset >7 and >14 days, which is a trend we observed in our analysis. The only false positive IgG using the OnSite assay was from a patient with known positive Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM. The Sinocare test also demonstrated some cross-reactivity with samples positive on M. pneumoniae and influenza A serology. The Standard Q tests had two false positives: one was a patient with known rheumatoid factor, and the other from a SARS-CoV-2 uninfected patient. Furthermore, there were nine samples that were positive for IgA by IFA, but negative for IgM by IFA, OnSite and Innovita assays. The standard Q IgM assay detected two samples. All nine of these samples also had SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG detectable by IFA, yet none were detected by the Innovita IgG assay, only 3/9 were detected by both the OnSite IgG assay and Standard Q IgG assay and one detected by Sinocare assay.There was a trend to improved detection rates with increasing titres of IgA, IgG and IgM by IFA ( Fig. 1 and 2) , and the window periods from the time of illness onset to detection of antibody were delayed by at least two days in each of the POCTs when compared to IFA in the three patients where serial serology samples were available (Table 4) .When analysing samples collected greater than 14 days from onset of symptoms, there was an increase in sensitivity across all POCT devices in both IgG, IgM and total antibody (see Table 2 ).Twenty patients had antibody detectable by IFA and neutralisation at one or more time points after illness onset. Thirteen of these had any antibody detectable at any time point by the OnSite assay (sensitivity 65%), 12 by the Standard Q assay (sensitivity 60%), nine by the Innovita POCT (sensitivity 45%) and 11 by the Sinocare POCT (sensitivity 55%) ( Table 2) .Sinocare SARS-CoV-2 tests was undertaken to determine their efficacy in an Australian setting during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.The manufacturers of the POCTs have listed high sensitivities of 96.9% (OnSite), 87.3% (Innovita), 96.3% (Sinocare) and 99.1% (Standard Q) in their package information. Our findings contradicted these reports, as despite an increase in sensitivity in specimens collected more than 14 days post-onset of symptoms, all four POCTs had an unacceptably low analytic and clinical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, with a delay in antibody detection.A recent post-market evaluation of two LFA POCTs released by the Doherty Institute also shows poor total antibody sensitivity with 56.9% and specificity 95.6% for the OnSite test and 51.8% sensitivity and 97.8% for VivaDiag COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test. 21 They compared POCTs against both NAT and viral neutralisation. However, benefits of evaluating POCTs against IFA and viral neutralisation are that both tests are detecting and quantifying antibodies, and IFA (along with ELISA-based assays) have historically been the most widely used standard for serological diagnosis. 22 Our study is an independent validation of POCTs for COVID-19 infection in an Australian setting. Currently there are limited data reporting the diagnostic performance and independent validation of POCTs for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. One of the largest studies used a LFA POCT device on 525 cases with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 91%. 23 A small study of 39 randomly selected patients from a high-prevalence area screening centre (German Red Cross), compared an LFA to NAT with a sensitivity of 36.4% and specificity of 88.9%. 24 The slight superiority in sensitivity of the combined IgG-IgM antibody test over individual IgG or IgM antibody test was seen in a previous study. 23 Since the appearance of IgG may pre-date IgA or IgM responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection as seen previously in SARS, [17] [18] [19] it is difficult to classify an individual as having recent or past infection from a serological test at a single time point. We attempted to assess whether a patient had a recent or past infection as part of clinical sensitivity, we determined that this was not possible using POCTs. We recommend serial measurements using a quantitative assay (like IFA or neutralisation) to detect seroconversion or a rising titre as a more reliable method for timing infection than looking for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM. Furthermore, we found SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA was frequently present in the absence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM by IFA, and in cases when they were both present, IgA was present in a higher titre, making it a more reliable serological marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In patients with recent infections when analysed using IFA IgA as a benchmark, IFA IgG had a sensitivity of 87.3%. There was a small increase in sensitivity across all POCTs when assessing the presence of IgG, which tends to predate IgM and IgA (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1, Appendix A) .There has been speculation regarding the application of POCTs to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific-antibody in combination with PCR to produce an 'immunity passport' to guide infection control and as part of strategies to ease lock-down measures. 25 This assumes that past SARS-CoV-2 infection conveys immunity. However, the degree of immunity postinfection, and the seroprevalence in the Australian community are both unknown. The current POCTs are not sufficiently sensitive to be utilised in this capacity and further development of POCTs is required.The main study limitation is the relatively modest number of samples available for testing early in the pandemic in NSW. However, we were able to test these samples against four different devices. The timing of serum collection of initial and convalescent samples were not standardised, and not all patients had convalescent samples collected. Ideally, serial testing from well characterised serum panels would be used to most accurately define window periods.In summary, there is a need for robust serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 to supplement diagnosis by NAT and help guide public health interventions. Despite potential benefits of POCTs, their current poor sensitivity and delayed SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection make them unsuitable to be utilised as a diagnostic tool, as an accurate marker of past infection, or in seroprevalence surveys.

Whereas, much of the mainstream media has focused on the direct health crisis, little attention has been paid to remote coastal communities in regions like the Pacific that have been largely untouched by the virus per se, but impacted by its effects on trade and the movement of people. Vanuatu, like many Pacific Island countries, acted swiftly in face of the pandemic's rapid spread. In January 2020 a national COVID-19 taskforce was established to prepare and prevent an outbreak. By March interventions ramped up and the government declared a state of emergency, instituting a series of sweeping public health measures that saw its international borders closed, travel among islands banned, curfews on business, public transport limited and social distancing measures applied that prevented social gatherings of more than five people. To compound the situation, only weeks later the central islands of the archipelago fell in the path of category-5 Tropical Cyclone Harold (hereafter TC Harold), which passed over Vanuatu on 5th and April 6, 2020. The cyclone left in its trail significant infrastructural damage, leading to a 30-day extension of the national state of emergency as the post-disaster relief efforts were implemented. To address the priority area of access to food a COVID-19 food security response plan was endorsed by the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC). The FASC response plan promoted homestead gardening as well as stimulating access to fish through aquaculture and inshore fisheries.Current and projected impacts of these disruptions on the national economy will be deep and lasting, with an estimated national economy decline of 13.5% [1] . Within the tourism sector, for example, a recent survey by the Vanuatu Tourism Office and the Department of Tourism on COVID-19 and TC Harold impacts, estimated a 70% job or income loss occurred in the first six weeks after borders closed [2] . A significant portion of the tourism sector in Vanuatu is channelled through small-scale homestay or eco-tourism so such impacts are not restricted to Port Vila, Luganville or the larger resort centres.The occurrence of TC Harold is indicative of the living conditions in Vanuatu. Ranked as one of the world's most disaster-prone countries [3] , Vanuatu's coastal communities frequently deal with unforeseen disruptions ranging from volcanic eruptions to extreme weather events. Past studies have highlighted the importance of natural resources in times when disasters strike, and for an archipelagic state like Vanuatu where the majority of its population lives within the coastal zone [4] , near-shore marine resources become of particular importance [5, 6] . Unforeseen external disruptions like, for example, natural disasters or, in this case national COVID-19 public health measures, have been widely noted to potentially overburden rural communities' social institutions that provide coping mechanisms or 'safety nets' for resilience [7] . Without disputing this, the extent that this is equally the case for all coastal communities (e.g. remote vs more central) remains speculative. Arguably the ability of some remote (small island) communities to deal independently with shocks and shifts [8] may suggest COVID-19 measures could be overcome also. Gaining information on the ways various coastal communities were impacted (or not) and how people responded to the changes (or not) in the wake of Vanuatu's national lock down measures, is useful in guiding priorities for relief efforts and to better understand local capabilities for adaptation.We present the results of a rapid appraisal telephone survey. The survey tool used (Annex 1) was adapted from one implemented across collaborative networks of coastal fisheries management research and practice in the Pacific region [9, 10] . The survey was amended to suit Vanuatu-derived objectives for the survey. The dual objective of the survey was to understand, firstly, the immediate impacts of the various COVID-19 measures on village social life, food security and livelihood (in combination with other disruptions people were exposed to), and secondly, how people responded to these changes, with particular interest in how they made use of their marine resources.The survey was completed in the weeks following the first government imposed COVID-19 measures, covering 23 coastal community sites and involving 31 respondents. 1 All sites involved in the survey maintain an ongoing collaboration with the Vanuatu Fisheries Department (VFD) as part of a national community-based fisheries management program. The sampled sites were clustered into three categories, based primarily on their degree of remoteness: seven sites represented conditions on the most remote 'outer islands' (Gaua, Aniwa and Futuna), nine sites were on less remote 'secondary-islands' (Malekula and Maewo), and seven sites represented conditions on islands with administrative centres (Santo and Efate). Restricted by travel capabilities at the time of data collection, the survey was implemented by telephone by a team of fisheries officers (two men, two women). By virtue of village leadership in Vanuatu, and difficulty in reaching women in village leadership roles by telephone, the majority of respondents were male. The results therefore do not offer a well-balanced gendered perspective nor necessarily reflect the multiple perspectives inherent to the social diversity of communities.Although the long-term collaboration between the data collection team and these communities helped contextualise responses, interpretation of survey results was careful to avoid making assumptions or drawing broad brush strokes in what are socially diverse and complex communities. Despite these obvious limitations the survey highlights important considerations that help understand better variation of impacts and how people living on remote small islands and in coastal contexts in Vanuatu responded. Insights from this survey offer new considerations for support efforts, both short-and long-term, as well as contribute a broader understanding of coastal people's ability to deal with shocks in the Pacific region. The results below present firstly the reach of government interventions as experienced by different communities and what other disruptions communities were having to deal with next to the COVID-19 measures. In examining impacts we explore four dimensions of impacts: social life and demographics, food and nutrition security, livelihood and income, and marine resource management. Finally, locally perceived aspects of resilience and vulnerability are presented per site.National agencies in Vanuatu are well practiced in responding to disasters, as was case with the onset of COVID-19. Provincial COVID-19 taskforces were established very quickly. Moreover, in a lot of communities, Community Disaster Committees (CDCs) existed from humanitarian efforts following TC Pam in 2015; some of which were reactivated during the state of emergency declaration. All community representatives spoken with noted having received information on COVID-19 measures, and 13 of the 23 sites reported visits by teams from their respective provincial taskforce who came to provide information about the COVID-19 measures. In those cases the CDCs were tasked to relay up-to-date information and to plan for implementation of measures including social distancing, school and church closures, curfews on community kava nakamals 2 , promoting planting of gardens closer to homesteads, and hygiene practices (see Fig. 1 ). The remaining 10 sites, which included all remote outer island sites, noted receiving information by radio, text message and/or social media, and under that guidance instituted similar measures albeit to varying extents. Several respondents noted that government directives around price fixing of essential foods like rice and tinned fish during the state of emergency were effective in ensuring stability of prices in community stores. Also notable, in two sites in NE Santo, fuel subsidies were provided to fishers to ensure fish supply to surrounding communities at cheaper rates.The survey results demonstrated clearly that communities were dealing not only with the new COVID-19 measures, but also with other disruptions that compounded pressures on food production and income. Most notable were the impacts of TC Harold for the 13 sites located in the path of the cyclone (see Fig. 2 ). Only the most northerly and southerly sites felt little to no impact. Of the impacted sites, three noted extreme damage, with the majority of houses and other buildings damaged or destroyed completely. All impacted sites reported damage to gardens, loss of harvests and compromised water availability.Community respondents noted a series of secondary local disruptions. Sites located on the most southerly outer islands reported challenges to crop production from ongoing drought. On one of these islands this compounded already poor soil conditions and had already intensified dependence on external sources of vegetables and rice before COVID-19 measures were instituted. Inter-island travel restrictions meant food imports from Tanna were stopped. Two sites reported cases 1 Where possible, men and women were interviewed, but where this was not possible, a person in a leadership position who had some form of community oversight was interviewed. The final dataset contained 22 men and 9 women. In 8 communities both a man and a woman were interviewed. 2 Nakamals are traditional gathering places in Vanuatu and form important sites for meetings and ceremonies in most communities (often reserved for men only). Nakamals are often associated with the drinking of kava, a drink derived from the root of a shrub (Piper methysticum) that has mild depressant effects. of ciguatera poisoning in reef fish. 3 Once COVID-19 measures took effect an increase in fishing pressure on reefs by inexperienced fishers was argued to be the reason for several cases of recent ciguatera poisoning in the community. It was noted that this led to a subsequent sharp decline in supply of both reef and pelagic fish, out of fear of further cases, and in turn exacerbated the lack of protein availability at those sites. Impacts of volcanic activity were noted by two sites; one on Tanna and one on Maewo. The former site reported that ash fall compromised recent harvest from gardens, thus restricting their ability to produce food in these times when travel to market was not possible. The latter site noted impacts of a pre-COVID-19 population rise following the mass 3 Ciguatera fish poisoning occurs as a result of consumption of fish contaminated with ciguatoxins; resulting in symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, numbness, itchiness, sensitivity to hot and cold, dizziness, and weakness. Reef fish, particularly grouper species, are thought to be particularly prone to such toxins. displacement of people from neighbouring Ambae island when its volcano erupted. Although this occurred in 2018, sites on Maewo continue to be subject to the volcano recovery plan [11] and still noted to be to dealing with the pressures of increased population on ability to produce enough food and housing.Just under half of the sites sampled (n = 11) noted little or no increases in population size of communities. These sites were remote outer-island or secondary-island sites communities most affected by inter-island travel restrictions. Children from these communities attended schools on other main islands and stayed with kin residing there (mainly on Efate and Santo). Remaining sites all estimated at least a 25% increase in population, with one site on Efate noting an extreme increase of over 75%. All population increases were associated with students returning to villages following school closures. The example of extreme population increase in the Efate site was explained by its close proximity to the national capital Port Vila where many students attend school.Some leaders, and all women respondents, welcomed curfew restrictions on kava nakamals, noting a significant decrease in kava consumption among young men. The majority of responses, however, pointed to difficulties associated the COVID-19 measures of social distancing and restricted gatherings. Community life involves strong bonds and close daily interactions which simply could not be foregone. As a respondent from one of the Maskelyn sites noted, ""The measures against socialising with friends, neighbours and family has affected our dayto-day relationships we value and rely on, […] we find it strange and impossible to cope with."" Another respondent from a Tanna site referred to the physical structure of communities making social distancing difficult, ""We can't keep distance since all our houses are close to each other and we all share the same space in our houses, even between neighbours."" Some community leaders noted how important social institutions were no longer reinforced due to the restriction on social gatherings. They noted people's commitment to faith and religion was weakened since attendance at church was no longer possible. As one Tanna village woman leader noted, ""People are not praying as often as they used to because we are not gathering for church […] we are afraid people are losing spiritual touch with important morals.""In asking what the most important food types (in terms of accessibility) were in times of the COVID-19 disruptions, all sites noted the importance of traditional island food (aelan kakae), composed of root crops and local vegetables. However, in asking the respondents whether there was enough food available only nine sites noted having sufficient food stock from their gardens or markets (all of which were either capital-or secondary-island sites). Seven sites noted sufficient food, but only because they had access to government relief support. All respondents from outer-island sites felt they did not have sufficient food stocks, with no immediate relief to address the shortfall. Sites experiencing food availability issues noted either other disruptions (e.g. TC Harold or drought) or inter-island travel restrictions as compromising otherwise sufficient stocks. Vulnerable households were particularly impacted, including widowed households.Local responses to (pending) food shortages varied. Village leaders in 16 of the sites on capital and secondary-islands put strong emphasis on increasing local garden production since markets no longer provided enough or because travel to markets was no longer possible. In a Maewo site one leader noted, ""Elders have encouraged everyone to plant more aelan kakae."" Measures facilitating this included minimising normal communal responsibilities to free up time to tend gardens, land owners allowing access by others to cultivate crops, and active salvaging of destroyed crops (e.g. fallen banana trees) in the wake of TC Harold. With exception of sites on one southern outer-island where fish was being preserved, food preservation was not used.The rising trend of coastal livelihood dependence on cash economies in Vanuatu [12] was noticeable in the significant mention of direct and indirect impacts of income loss. Respondents from secondary-and outer-islands sites noted that some people (mainly community shop owners) in the communities were facing mounting debts as restricted cargo transport meant purchases made on loan were not being delivered. With no way to sell what they ordered and no guarantee of refund, they were left with no way to pay back the loan. The restricted cargo transport led to various impacts in communities including limited supplies in community shops, limited relief food reaching communities in time, decreased trade of fish (Southern-most outer-island sites) and other primary goods like copra (Santo) and cocoa (NW Malekula). In sites where tourism income was significant (NE Santo, Efate and Tanna), respondents noted direct impacts of the collapse of international tourism. In some of those cases households had shifted to producing kava for local sales on the island.Fish trade is a significant income source for many households in coastal communities. Outer-island sites, for example, noted high dependence on trade in fish to larger neighbouring islands. This income covered their operational costs but also allowed them to buy supplementary food (vegetables, root crops and rice) that is not available on their island. COVID-19 travel restrictions meant access to market was blocked and availability of fuel for motorised fishing was limited, affecting money and food coming into those households. With exception of one site, all sites noted COVID-19 restrictions limiting or stopping trade with the village. The exception noting an increase was a TC Harold impacted site that saw more fishing taking place to sell to inland communities. In terms of trade of fish within the village, 19 of the sampled sites noted less or similar trade of fish while four sites noted an increase. Of the four sites noting increased internal trade, three were capital-and secondary-islands sites where a significant influx of youth into the village saw more small reef fish being caught and sold within the village. The remaining site was a northern outer-island site where women had started cooking and selling locally caught fish as imported shop supplies had run low.Fifteen sites reported a notable increase in fishing activity, particularly on reefs or areas close to the community. Sites that recorded a large influx of people, mainly students, noted that an increase in inshore canoe fishing, diving, gleaning and shore-fishing by children and or inexperienced fishers looking for fish on the nearby reefs. The increase in fishing activity did not translate to larger catches because mostly small fish were caught from already over-fished places. As one village leader from Tanna noted, ""We are seeing more people fishing since we have allowed people to go out fishing around the community […] most of the fishing activity we see is by the students who came back, but overall catch is less than before, […] it's all small fish."" Fishing offshore for larger and commercially-attractive deep bottom species using motorised boats had ceased in sites where this formed an important fishing activity (all outerand secondary-island sites) due to a lack of fuel and loss of market access with restricted travel.The remaining eight sites that did not report an increase in fishing, largely noted this was due to communities' increased focus on repairing, maintaining and/or ramping up production of gardens. As noted before, the Maewo site reported less fishing due to fear of ciguatera poisoning.Increased pressure on marine areas following COVID-19 measures was concentrated on nearshore areas in immediate proximity to the village and less on offshore fishing. Although more costly, such fishing would make a greater contribution to food security. With exception of two sites (one of which was more inland), all surveyed sites had some form of fisheries management in place. Of those 21 sites, four opened their tabu areas temporarily for fishing. These were all outer-island sites that were impacted by cargo/transport services not coming in, compounded by weak agriculture production. Two other sites noted that tabu area rules had been disregarded, with some fishers fishing restricted areas. The remaining sites noted tabu areas had not been opened nor compromised with sufficient accessible fishing grounds to meet the demand.In reflecting on the impacts felt in communities, there were several common locally-perceived enabling factors that allowed people to maintain a level function and normality in the face of the changes (i.e. resilience). Conversely, there were common compromising factors that left people vulnerable and less able to continue life as normal or deal with changes (Fig. 3) .Small holder gardens, and the island food they produced, were noted by all respondents as being vital for food (and income) in COVID-19 times. However, in sites impacted heavily by TC Harold (NW Malekula) as well as sites where growing conditions were poor (Aniwa and Maskelyn), gardens provided little reprieve from hardship.Marine resources were also important, particularly in remote outerisland communities, and fisheries management measures (including rules) were perceived to have been beneficial in dealing with COVID-19 conditions. Other important factors included, in one outer-island site, the insular local economy that maintained not only flow of cash across the community but also barter trading of food. Moreover, solar powered cool storage facilities was also an important factor, allowing villagers to store fish and other food stuff. Finally, social relations amongst kin and neighbouring households, particularly in more remote or disconnected sites, translated to various forms of collective support (e.g. food sharing, and access to land and gardens) to vulnerable households like widowed households.Factors that were locally perceived to exacerbate people's vulnerability included first and foremost connectivity and poor access to information, particularly for the more remote secondary-and outer-island sites. Where much of the government messaging used radio and text messaging, several communities did not have radios or had unreliable phone or radio signal. As an example, in the days preceding TC Harold's landfall, bad weather had cut off tele-communication to some sites in SW Santo. This meant warning updates of TC Harold's approach were missed, with some respondents noting that people had been caught working in the gardens (or staying in upland garden sleep stations) when the storm struck. Outer-island sites in the south relied heavily on radio and telecommunication for information on COVID-19 measures and updates on transport and travel restrictions. In those sites similar challenges to connectivity led to misunderstandings and increased anxiety as misinformation on COVID-19 spread through social media postings, reached these communities. Another common compromising factor noted by respondents was the increased transition to cash-based economies, often noting an over-dependence on tourism or on inter-island trade in commodities like fish and kava. While respondents in sites on the larger capital-and secondary-islands noted that some were able to maintain trade with other communities on the island, outer-island sites had no alternative. Other factors noted by respondents on outer-islands included poor agriculture conditions that over time had resulted in people's increasing dependency on food provision from outside.Proximity to administrative or urban centres (Port Vila on Efate and Luganville on Santo) was noted both as a burden as well as a blessing in these times. Respondents from Efate and Santo sites noted how disproportionate population increases were adding pressure on resources and food stocks, largely due to their proximity to urban areas. However, they also noted their proximity meant access to information and food and aid relief was good.The telephone-based rapid appraisal documented some immediate impacts of COVID-19 public health measures on coastal communities of varying remoteness across Vanuatu (including capital island-, secondary island-and outer island sites). The survey focussed on village life, particularly access to food, livelihoods and coastal resources.Results revealed significant population increases in more connected sites, which had direct repercussions on fishing pressure and related increased demand for food. Produce from home gardens was noted as a primary source of food when COVID-19 measures were in place, notably roots crops and vegetables. Food relief support was in highest demand in cases where home gardens could not meet food demand, e.g. where agriculture conditions were poor or where natural hazards destroyed crops. Outer island sites noted a double burden where agricultural production was already poor and home garden harvests small, and access to markets or food relief was cut off because of restricted interisland travel. Such communities that depend on trade of resources (e. g. fish) to purchase food they do not have, struggle to meet their food demands when mobility is restricted. This result highlights the importance of understanding local food environments and the vulnerabilities inherent in disrupted supply chains and domestic markets more generally.Loss of cash income and growing indebtedness due to the COVID-19 conditions were noted across all sites, indicating peoples' increased dependence on the cash economy regardless of their community's remoteness. This dependency presents another source of vulnerability if trade relies on connectivity to other islands. Sites located on larger islands were able to shift and engage in smaller local economies as a fall back while outer islands could not.COVID-19 conditions caused an increase in fishing pressure on nearby fishing areas, including reefs, intertidal zones and mangroves, mainly catching small fish by inexperienced fishers (e.g. returning school children). Total fish catch in all sites was said to have declined, mainly because pelagic and deep bottom fishing practices stopped due to lack of fuel and market access. As such the lack of large fish being caught further exacerbated fishing on easy-access immediate inshore zones. The importance of community-based fisheries management in majority of sites proved vital in curbing demand-driven exploitation and controlling access. Given shocks like COVID-19 are a recurrent feature of Vanuatu life, and the importance of fish to meet food and nutrition needs in such times, it is imperative that resource management capacity in Vanuatu communities is supported and further developed [see also [13] [14] [15] ]. The form in which (and intensity by which) this support and development is delivered will be dependent on local context. Understanding that the sampled sites were all engaged in some form of fisheries co-management, the results suggest such engagements are largely beneficial during COVID-19 disruptions. This however, does not capture the potential of customary institutions that other communities (where resources are not co-managed with VFD) may be drawing on in their control over access and use of resources in such times. A better understanding of the relative contributions of customary and co-management relationships requires expansion of the sample to villages not receiving support from VFD. There is clearly value in this for other national agencies, to better understand the efficacy of different forms of local resource management.The extent and character of COVID-19 impacts ranged widely depending on context and local conditions. Our rapid assessment highlights differences in connectivity and exposure to external markets and sources of income, both international tourism and domestic value chains for fish and other products. Broad quantitative impact assessments are important in guiding strategic and longer term responses and adaptations, but these are made more useful when complemented with qualitative insights on people and place in the short-term. This rapid appraisal forms an early step in such an assessment of the vulnerabilities and potential adaptation pathways of rural coastal communities in ","Vanuatu","abstract","2020-09-13",9

However, nurses' and midwives' compliance with infection control policies can vary between settings and individual workers [1e3] . Subjective indicators such as visible dirt, personal appearance and whether a patient had been identified as being infectious, can inform nurses' decision-making regarding even basic standard precautions such as handwashing [1,3e6] . This reliance on personal judgement rather than consistent application of clinical standards for infection prevention and control could potentially lead to crosscontamination and subsequently, increase rates of infection. Experience, organisational structure (including staffing ratios and training), individual knowledge, and personal accountability may also impact on compliance with optimal infection control practice and governance [7e11] .Beyond individual factors, the hospital environment has been shown to be a contributing factor in the spread of HCAIs and MDROs [12, 13] . Moreover, pathogens can survive for days or months on surfaces that have not been cleaned, posing an ongoing risk for transmission [14] . Consequently, there is a higher risk of a patient acquiring a pathogen from the previous room occupant [15, 16] . Improved cleaning can reduce the incidence of HCAIs and is cost effective [12, 17] , but relies on healthcare personnel to correctly and consistently apply cleaning measures. Nurses and midwives have the most contact with patients across healthcare settings. Therefore, they have a critical role in infection prevention and control. As an important first step in improving compliance and precursor to further work, this study sought to explore:1. What are enrolled nurses, registered nurses and midwives' knowledge on the role of the environment in the infection prevention control, and 2. What are the barriers and challenges for nurses and midwives to maintaining a clean patient environment?This paper reports findings from a cross-sectional, online survey of nurses and midwives employed in clinical roles.Registered nurses (RN), enrolled nurses (EN) and registered midwives (RM) who are currently employed in clinical settings in Australia.Participants were recruited via advertisements placed in written and electronic materials published by professional associations (such as the Australian College of Nursing and the Australian Nurses and Midwives Association), via workplace emails and newsletters, and through social media (Facebook, twitter) targeting nurses and midwives. The advertisements provided broad information about the survey, and included an online link to the study information, electronic consent form, and non-identifiable survey. Ten $20 gift cards were randomly allocated as a participation incentive. Participants who were not registered nurses, midwives or enrolled nurses were excluded from the study, in addition to those currently unemployed or not working in clinical roles (e.g. hospital, residential aged care facility, medical centre, or clinic).The survey was open for responses between 1st December 2019 and 13th March 2020; at which time the survey was closed due to dwindling response rates. Interested participants accessed the online link as provided in the study invitation. Screening questions were used to exclude individuals who did not meet criteria for eligibility. Eligible participants then completed an online consent form before gaining access to the survey. Descriptive and exploratory analysis of survey results was performed. Qualitative (free-text) responses to open-ended questions were collated and each response read individually. Qualitative analysis (constant comparison, frequency counts/ranking) was used to identify and group responses into common themes.Overview 132 participants accessed the online survey. Of these, 28 were subsequently excluded from the survey (n Z 19 not currently working in a clinical setting; n Z 6 not RN, EN or RM; and n Z 3 did not provide consent). Of the 104 eligible participants, 96 consented to participate and commenced the survey, representing our sample size. 79 participants completed the full survey. The use of IP address cross referenced against demographic information suggested there were no repeat responses from the same individual. Participant demographic data is presented in Table 1 . There was representation across all age groups, with diversity in the highest qualification obtained, the length of time at their current employer and the jurisdiction in which they worked. Most participants worked in a hospital setting.Importance of cleaning Participants were asked to nominate the most important reasons for cleaning the environment in healthcare settings. Seventy-four (94%) participants indicated that the main reason for cleaning was to reduce the risk of infection transmission. Healthcare accreditation was found to be the least important reason for cleaning (n Z 35, 44%).We asked participants to indicate who was responsible for cleaning four items, two frequently touched items (bed rails and nurse call bells) and two items of shared medical equipment (IV pole and IV pump). The majority of participants indicated that nursing/midwifery staff were responsible for cleaning the IV pole (73%, n Z 58) and pump (79%, n Z 62). There was less certainty about who was responsible for cleaning bed rails and nurse call bells. Fortypercent (40%, n Z 32) indicated it was a nursing/midwifery responsibility. Ten percent of participants did not know who was responsible for cleaning shared medical equipment (IV pole and pump). Participants were asked to nominate what method or product they would use to clean in various situations. Results are presented in Table 2 .Using a Likert scale, participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with four statements relating to the use and application of disinfectant products in clinical settings (Fig. 1) . While the effectiveness on patient safety was well understood, there was less certainty about disinfectants and their use. Participants were shown four visual representations of how to clean a surface, using different directional movements such as circular, up and down, one-directional or Sshaped (serpentine). Of those that answered, 61% (n Z 48) correctly identified the best way to clean a surface (i.e., answer Z C, serpentine). Regarding cleaning of shared medical equipment such as a blood pressure cuff, a small number reported 'probably don't clean' (14%, n Z 11) this equipment. The majority (81%, n Z 64) reported using wipes to clean shared medical equipment (supplementary material, Table S1 ).Participants were shown pictures of three patient hospital rooms (Fig. 2) . Room A showed a patient lying present in the bed with various equipment. Room B appeared to be empty, with the bed looking slightly rumpled. Room C showed a patient lying in bed and was less cluttered in appearance than Room A. Participants were then asked to nominate which room presented the lowest risk of infection (A, B, C, or 'don't know'). The majority chose Room A, a cluttered room occupied by a patient.Using a free text option, participants were asked what one item/piece of equipment they thought posed the greatest risk of infection transmission from the environment. The most common responses were hospital furniture The themes from participants around barriers to cleaning effectively were a lack of information and training, resources (cleaning products and equipment), lack of dedicated cleaning staff, and organisational structures. The free-text survey comments (supplementary material, SQ1-2) stressed the need for more readily accessible information including simple wall charts with information about which product to use and where and improved labelling on wipes and cleaning agents. More education was needed about which products were recommended for patients presenting with infections such as C. difficile or multi-drug resistant organism (MDRO). Product useability was important, with single-use disinfectant wipes preferred, especially where staff experienced competing time pressures. A lack of policies and guidelines to inform infection control practices and lack of clear role definitions and staff accountability were also identified. In contrast to most comments, seven participants perceived that 'nothing' impacted their ability to clean equipment between patients, i.e., cleaning always occurred even when staff were pressed for time.Most participants reported having received information about cleaning importance, correct product usage and availability. Twenty-three percent (n Z 18) had received information within last 3 months, 19% (n Z 15) in the previous 3e12 months and 15% (n Z 12) reported having received information in the last 1e3 years. However, 32% (n Z 25) either 'do not recall' or have 'never' received any information about the importance of cleaning, product availability in their organisation, nor how to correctly apply products for infection control purposes. The majority of training received (25%, n Z 20) was provided by an Infection Control Team (Table S2) . Additionally, using a Likert scale, participants were asked to indicate level of agreement with four statements regarding cleaning effectiveness (Table S3) . Despite the majority indicating confidence in their cleaning ability (usually 46%, n Z 36; always 23%, n Z 18), most did not feel comfortable being admitted to a room where the previous patient had a multi-drug resistant organism (never 42%, n Z 33; only sometimes 34%, n Z 18).It is well accepted that the clinical environment plays a role in the transmission of infections such as multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) and healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) [2,7,8,12,14,15,17e20] . Ineffective cleaning practices by nursing and midwifery staff may also contribute to a high pathogen-load being present within hospital settings [15, 19, 21] . As an important first step to improving environmental hygiene, this study found that nurses and midwives broadly stated that they understood the importance of cleaning, albeit, there is variation in cleaning responsibilities. Moreover, cleaning of shared medical equipment may pose current risk in terms of lack of cleaning. In keeping with Aiken et al. [22] , this study found that nursing and midwifery staff play a key role in cleaning duties as part of their working role. However, our findings suggest there was ambiguity about who was responsible for cleaning patient areas or certain items (such as IV pumps). There was also less certainty regarding how or when to use disinfectants and about the effectiveness of disinfectants on different groups of micro-organisms. These findings could be a result of any number of factors, including appropriateness of the product, lack of product information or of education. The implications of inappropriate product use may result in ineffective cleaning, thus increasing the risk of HCAIs. There are also health and safety implications for disinfectant use. In terms of the process of cleaning, 39% (n Z 31) of participants did not identify the correct way to clean (wipe) a surface (i.e. S-shaped or serpentine). Therefore, this finding, coupled with a lack of understanding about product (disinfectant) choice, will result in less effective cleaning and increase transmission risks.As pathogens can survive on uncleaned or inappropriately cleaned surfaces for long periods of time, it is vital that shared medical equipment is consistently and correctly cleaned to reduce the risk of HCAIs. Genomic analyses by Lee et al. [23] of VRE transmission pathways within an intensive care unit identified the key role shared medical equipment has in ICU. Factors for suboptimal cleaning of shared equipment may include insufficient stocks of equipment to allow for cleaning and rotation between patients, lack of product at the point of use and perceived lack of time [1, 7, 19] . Understanding reasons for this are important and we will be following this up in future work. Survey participants called for more easily accessible information about the different types of cleaning products and what they were used for, greater accessibility to products, greater clarity around cleaning roles and who was responsible for maintaining particular items or patient areas, as well as increased accountability on the behalf of staff and hospital management.Factors that may influence a decision for cleaning to take a secondary role include the perception of infection risk from the environment versus other competing patient care requirements, as well as understanding cleaning responsibilities. When we asked participants to identify which room posed the highest infection risk, the majority of participants chose the most cluttered room. This indicates good understanding among respondents that cluttered environments can hamper cleaning. However, the correct answer was 'don't know', i.e., while this room may reflect challenges undertaking cleaning, it does not necessarily relate to risk. Pathogens are invisible to the naked eye and any of the rooms may pose an infection risk [15] . Factors influencing risk would include the type of infection or pathogen from an unknown but colonised patient, as well as the effectiveness of cleaning. None of the provided images illustrated this. The subjectivity of choosing a room which is cluttered is consistent with other work, which found that compliance with even basic infection protocols such as handwashing and wearing gloves was individually and subjectively based [3e5] .Variations in product use and cleaning practices [21, 24, 25] , information transfer and communication pathways [26e28], and organisational culture [20] , can all influence cleaning outcomes. Improving staff knowledge around product use, communication, training, audit and utilising an implementation framework have been shown to improve cleaning outcomes, reduce risks for patients and are costeffective [12, 17, 29] . In our study, most participants (68%, n Z 54) indicated that they had received information about the importance of cleaning, the types of products available in their organisation and product application. However, 11% (n Z 9) had last received that information more than 3 years prior and a further 32% (n Z 25) did not recall or had never received any cleaning information. Another key theme emerging from survey comments was the lack of simple information about particular cleaning products. Participants called for easy instructions to support correct product usage and application. These findings suggest the need for improved and structured education of nurses and midwives around cleaning on a regular basis, as well as improved communication. Education could be provided in any number of ways, including from nurse educators, online platforms or from representatives from industry supplying products and equipment. Of course, nurses are only one professional group in healthcare. Shared medical equipment is also used by medical and allied health. Potentially the same issues exist in these professional groups regarding knowledge of cleaning and responsibilities around who cleans equipment they use.This study is limited by the use of a cross-sectional study design and the accuracy of self-report responses provided. The vast majority of surveys were undertaken prior to the COVID-19 pandemic taking hold in Australia, so biases associated with this are expected to be limited. The sample size, while not large is a further limitation. Nonetheless, this study provides a useful snapshot of nurses' and midwives' knowledge of infection control and cleaning processes, something that to our knowledge has not been undertaken before. We identified gaps in training and knowledge, as well as unclear responsibilities for cleaning certain objects. These findings can be used to inform workforce education and planning and hospital cleaning policies. Similarly, the findings lay the foundation for future research exploring solutions to try and improve the cleaning of shared medical equipment.Greater organisational support, clear policies detailing cleaning responsibility, and improving the applied knowledge and personal efficacy of nurses and midwives regarding infection prevention and control is needed. This includes the correct use of disinfectants, which disinfectant to use for various situations, and how to clean effectively following discharge of a patient with a suspected or known infection. The cleanliness of shared medical equipment may also pose current risk due to lack of cleaning.Ethics approval for this study was granted by [blinded for review].","Australia","abstract","2020-09-30",9

Interventions have included physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, school closures, travel restrictions and border closures; measures not specific to SARS-CoV-2, therefore providing potential to impact transmission of other respiratory viruses. The initiation of COVID-19 restrictions in the Northern hemisphere coincided with the end of winter, with some reports documenting a concurrent early end to local influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasons. (1, 2) In contrast, restrictions in Australia were implemented just prior to the Southern hemisphere winter, the usual period of peak local RSV and influenza infections. (3) Western Australia (WA) covers the western third of Australia, with a population of 2.64 million, of which the majority are concentrated in a single metropolitan area.(4) WA has experienced minimal local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with the majority of cases (562/655) linked to international travel.Community SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been absent since the end of April 2020,(5) allowing a staged relaxation of lockdown measures whilst WA state borders to international and inter-state travellers have remained closed.As yet there are limited data describing the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on influenza and RSV transmission through the Southern hemisphere winter. In addition, the combination of relaxation of internal COVID-19 restrictions in WA and ongoing border closures represent a unique setting to observe the relative impact of these measures on influenza and RSV activity. We aim here to describe the weekly detections of paediatric RSV and influenza through winter 2020 in WA, compared to the previous eight seasons in the context of local COVID-19 restrictions.A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p tLaboratory data were prospectively collected as part of routine regional public health surveillance, collated per week, from January 2012 to 30 th August 2020. Cases were defined as detections of influenza or RSV by validated nucleic acid or antigen detection kits in children (<16 years of age) resident in the metropolitan area. Laboratory results were provided by PathWest Laboratory Medicine, the only public pathology provider to the state servicing all but three hospitals admitting paediatric patients in WA. Samples were drawn from all public hospitals and emergency departments.Average epidemic curves for the period 2012 to 2019 were calculated using a World Health Organisation (WHO) described method.(6)As part of a national response, the international border was closed to non-residents on the 20th March (week 12). On the 6th April (week 15) the WA state border was closed to other Australian states.Borders remain closed at the time of writing. Exemptions are required to enter from interstate, and mandatory quarantine of all arrivals for 14 days is required. (7) State-wide stay-at-home restrictions were in place from 29 th March to 27 th April with a concurrent extended school holiday period (week 14-17 - Figure The total number of samples tested in 2020 was higher than previous seasons, thus the percentage positive of tests for RSV (0.28%) and influenza (0.03%) for the period from week 14 to 35 were substantially lower than previous seasons (2012-2019 range for RSV: 23.3%-30.4%; for influenza:3.6%-16.4%.).The initial public health measures implemented in WA likely facilitated rapid control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The implementation of these measures coincided with the period leading into winter, when RSV and influenza detections peak locally. Early regional reports from Australia indicated an initial decline in respiratory virus detection (8) and related hospital admissions(9) immediately following the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions. We observed a similar initial reduction in RSV and influenza detections amongst Western Australian children followed by a near complete absence over the subsequent four months, confirming that low RSV and influenza activity has been sustained in WA throughout the winter period (week 23-35). It has been hypothesised that changes in health-seeking behaviour in the setting of COVID-19 restrictions may have contributed to observed reductions in influenza and RSV activity. (9) (14) Notably, in our data the percentage positive of tests collected, a frequently used marker for underdetection, remained very low for influenza and RSV throughout the winter period in 2020.Furthermore, a relative return to normal health-seeking behaviour would be anticipated in WA in the absence of local SARS-CoV-2 transmission and relaxation of local restrictions. The persistence of low RSV and influenza activity in this setting is likely consistent with a true lack of local infections.There are wide-ranging potential implications of the observed low RSV and influenza activity. For RSV, with a large cohort of immunologically naïve children and low-level local transmission, a delayed peak may yet be observed. Alternatively, the following RSV season may be larger than previous years, with greater morbidity across age ranges. Considering the year to year variation in influenza peak and rate of infections, and the absence of clear ongoing transmission currently, it is uncertain whether a delayed local influenza season will occur this year. Similar to RSV, a reduction in population immunity related to current reduced influenza transmission may render the population more vulnerable in the following season. Considering the broader reduction in southern hemisphere influenza detections evident in WHO surveillance data, (14) together with the likely persistence of some travel restrictions, the northern hemisphere may experience a similarly attenuated influenza A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t season in the coming winter, although protective local COVID-19 restrictions will likely have lifted in some regions. Conversely, influenza vaccine development may be hampered by a lack of southern hemisphere reference samples limiting the ability to predict potential circulating strains.A relative strength of this study is its utilisation of data collated as part of existing surveillance activities, ongoing prior to the emergence of COVID-19. In addition, the elimination of local SARS-CoV-2 transmission with resultant relaxation of restrictions including the reopening of schools is relatively unique to WA, facilitating the assessment of the relative impact of initial local restrictions and ongoing border closures on viral detections.Our analysis does not include hospital admission data. As our surveillance data is drawn from hospitals and emergency departments, we cannot completely exclude that changes in health-seeking behaviour related to COVID-19 may have impacted viral detections in 2020. We are now planning to assess paediatric emergency department and hospital admission data for overall health service utilisation patterns by diagnosis and age group to examine the broader impact of COVID-19 restrictions.Following implementation of COVID-19 restrictions just prior to winter, RSV and influenza activity has remained low in WA even following relaxation of internal restrictions. This is likely due to the impact of closure of external borders and the resultant prevention of viral introductions. The impact of reduced local RSV and influenza activity on the Northern Hemisphere winter season and future local seasons remains uncertain and warrants ongoing surveillance.","Australia","first author","2020-09-28",9

Since then the virus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread to over 216 countries and is now recognized as a significant global pandemic of COVID-19. As of 4th August 2020, the total number of COVID-19 cases recorded worldwide was 18,456,665 with the number of confirmed deaths at 697,435 [1] .Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 were first reported in Wuhan, China, where 5% of total reported cases also suffered an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) [2] . By comparison, the rate of AIS in association with COVID-19 in New York, USA, was only 0.9% [3] . Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the occurrence of neurological events among patients with COVID-19 with most focusing on COVID-19-induced severe inflammation (and endothelial dysfunction) and activated prothrombotic pathways resulting in microthrombosis the onset of severe neurological symptoms (acute ischemic stroke-like symptoms) during the day 21-26 of the illness.A man hospitalized with COVID-19 developed significant neurological manifestations (acute stroke-like symptoms) between 21-26 days post infection which were later confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), showing changes typical of raised intracranial pressure and significant diffusion restriction suggestive of cytotoxic or excitotoxic, transient oedema secondary to inflammation and severe hypoperfusion state ( Figures 1A and 1B) . The 75-year-old male patient was managed at an Australian metropolitan tertiary care hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in this patient by reverse transcriptase polymerase-chainreaction (RT-PCR) assay on admission to the ED. Currently, this appears to be the first COVID-19 case with severe neurological manifestations (acute ischemic stroke-like symptoms and raised intracranial pressure) in Australia to date.The previously well man reported a past medical history of asymptomatic and stable prostate cancer, as well as treated melanoma five years ago. He presented with a five-day history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, anorexia and sore throat to the ED in late March 2020. The patient had not travelled overseas and had no history of contact with any known case of COVID-19. He was febrile on admission with a temperature at 38.2° C, displaying slight tachypnoea (respiratory rate of 22) and a blood oxygen saturation of 95%. His blood pressure and heart rate remained stable upon arrival at the ED. His initial chest X-ray revealed patchy opacities in the mid to lower lung fields (Figure 2) , indicating a likely diagnosis of COVID-19. He was isolated for suspected COVID-19 infection in a general medical ward. Over the next 24 hours, the patient's blood pressure started to drop in association with increasing hypoxia and worsening respiratory condition. Despite high-flow oxygen support, the laboured breathing persisted, warranting the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation and the patient's subsequent transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). His first 48 hours in the intensive care unit (ICU) were complicated with further blood pressure drop and poor respiratory function. He remained on prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin 40 mg/SC) from the onset of admission to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He remained RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2 until at least the 14th hospital day. Extubation was unsuccessfully attempted on the 19th ICU day but failed, necessitating reintubation within 24 hours. During this time, on the patient's 24th hospital day, progressive right upper limb swelling became apparent and a clinical diagnosis of DVT was confirmed with an ultrasound showing extensive, non-compressible thrombi involving the right cephalic, cubital, basilic, axillary, subclavian and the internal jugular veins. For treatment of DVT, he was started on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (a full therapeutic dose of enoxaparin). He was noted to be significantly drowsy and less responsive over the next 72 hours. A referral to the neurology department was made due to the non-improvement of his altered conscious state despite pausing IV sedation during the 26th day of his admission. Initially the patient was thought to be displaying hypoxic encephalopathy secondary to a blood pressure drop or an acute stroke secondary to hypoperfusion or large vessel disease related to COVID-19.Neurological assessment on day 26 revealed a stuporous patient (Glasgow Coma Scale fluctuating between 3-6) with no physical signs of cranial nerve involvement. In particular, the patient showed no signs of gaze palsy or ptosis. Papilledema was excluded by fundoscopy while light reflex remained intact. There were no meningeal signs such as neck stiffness or a positive Kernig's sign. He underwent tracheostomy on day 27 as he was not improving and pneumonia symptoms were worsening. He underwent a CT scan of the brain on day 28, showing no discernible structural abnormalities ( Figure 3 ).Normal CT scan of the brain showing severe diffusion restriction of the MRI brain. The normal recovery after the prolonged hospital stay confirmed it was unlikely that the severe neurological and stroke-like symptoms were due to a stroke.An EEG was performed on Day 30, demonstrating mild generalized slowing based on theta and intermittent delta wave activity ( Figure 4) . The laboratory profile of this patient suggests that a generalized immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was apparent early, based on the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and CRP, followed by persistent anemia, leukocytosis and hypoalbuminemia during their hospital stay. Urea, ionized calcium and CRP were also persistently elevated, while D-dimer, serum fibrinogen, and creatinine kinase peaked during admission but normalized subsequently.An MRI of the brain was performed on day 32 that showed generalized cortical diffusion restriction, which was also present in the supra-and infratentorial white matter ( Figure 1A) .A few scattered microbleeds in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobe were described along with a small volume subarachnoid haemorrhage in the right frontal lobe (not shown). There was no pachymeningitis noted, and neither were there any signs of venous nor arterial occlusion. The same MRI also revealed the typical features of intracranial hypertension in the appearance of optic nerve sheath distension and tortuosity (Figures 1A-1B) and transverse sinus narrowing and empty sella turcica (not shown in image). No intracranial masses were noted.He was suspected as having an acute ischemic stroke secondary to severe hypoperfusion at this point of time. In terms of useful information, the patient's immune profile included white cell counts, neutrophil counts and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) peaked around this time. It is unlikely he had a stroke given the eventual complete recovery despite the prolonged hospital stay. His stroke-like symptoms and radiological changes were likely related to the COVID-19-related severe inflammatory changes and cytotoxic oedema. Data are illustrated in Figure 5 , which highlights the rapid increase in white blood cell types immediately preceding the diagnosis of major clinical events such the severe neurological involvement (stroke-like symptoms) noted on day 26 and the patient's worsening respiratory function during day 32. The stroke-like symptoms most likely occurred on the 21st day of ICU hospitalization). Figure 5 shows a similar pattern of perturbation of all haematology tests including NLR and falls in lymphocyte to C-reactive protein (LCRPR) and changes in liver and renal function indicative of a severe systemic inflammatory response over the first three weeks before the onset of acute stroke-like symptoms. Levels of urea, ionized calcium and CRP were also persistently elevated, while the levels of D-dimer, serum fibrinogen and creatinine kinase rose during admission but normalized subsequently. The significant delay in the patient's referral to the neurology unit/team and a similar delay in the neuroimaging of the brain both indicate the possibility for underdiagnosis of stroke and other neurological disorders during this pandemic and inadequate specialists being available.Note the rapid rise in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio preceding the onset of stroke-like symptoms.To assess the patient's cognitive functions during rehabilitation and post neurological manifestations, retinal integrity and vision and visuomotor abilities were assessed at the bedside on the 58th-day post-hospital admission. Optic nerve head and retinal blood vessels integrity were found to be normal via fundus photography using an RV100-B RetinaVue™ 100 Imager Non-Mydriatic Retinal Camera (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, New York) ( Figure 6A) . Furthermore, the patient's normal visual acuity and visual fields were tested with an iPadbased visual field perimetry application, Melbourne Rapid Fields -neural (MRF-n) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ( Figure  6B ). However, on visuomotor tasks, the patient took significantly more time than controls of similar age. His visual acuity and visual fields were tested in less than eight minutes in the ward with the help of the MRF-n, and was found to be normal [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] (Figure 2A-2B) . The patient was also asked to perform three short visuomotor tasks borrowed from the Lee Ryan Eye Hand Coordination Test battery (SLURP)] as a rapid (less than five minutes) baseline measure of fine visually driven motor and executive function skills (Figure 7 ).His immune profile including white cell counts, neutrophil counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) sharply increased from preceding major clinical events such the acute stroke noted on day 26 (having most likely occurred on the 21st day) and the patient's worsening respiratory function during day 32. It is further worth noting the pattern of changes in the rest of his haematology tests showing a rise in NLR and fall in lymphocyte to C-reactive protein (LCRPR) and renal impairment, along with the changes in liver function test results indicating a severe systemic inflammatory response over the first three weeks prior to the onset of acute strokelike symptoms, peaking during day 22 and day 34. Rather, despite the predictive ability of blood tests and specifically NLR in the context of infection, inadequate specialists were available to consider the overall pattern of changes in his haematology or biochemistry. The significant delay in the patient's referral to the neurology unit/team and a similar delay in the neuroimaging of the brain both indicate the possibility for underdiagnosis of stroke and other neurological disorders during this pandemic.We report the first case of COVID-19 presenting with acute onset of severe neurological symptoms (acute ischemic stroke-like symptoms) and radiological changes of intracranial hypertension in Australia with no apparent clinical impact on his visual functions but some on his ability to complete a visuomotor task six weeks post initial hospitalization. The laboratory profile of this patient suggests that a generalized severe immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was apparent early, based on the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and CRP, followed by persistent anaemia, leukocytosis and hypoalbuminemia and neurological manifestations during his hospital stay.COVID-19 has been associated with excessive inflammatory activity, hypercoagulability and hypoxia, leading to both venous and arterial thrombosis. Our case illustrates the importance of critical and in-depth analysis of simple blood tests such as total white cell counts, electrolytes, CRP and coagulation parameters with special attention to changes and patterns of changes such as NLR, CRP and lymphocyte-to-platelet ratio (LPR). A recent meta-analysis noted that NLR values were found to increase significantly in severe cases of COVID-19 (SMD: 2.404,95%; CI: 1.275 to -0.5.50), while LPR values were decreased significantly (SMD: 0.912; 95% CI: -1.275 to -0.550). [11] [12] [13] Our results suggest that a COVID-19-induced hyperimmune response led to significant inflammatory injury to the brain and suspected intracranial hypertension secondary to severe inflammation. It is very likely the onset of acute stroke-like symptoms related to COVID-19 occurred with the first peak of inflammatory markers and NLR during day 21. However, the treating team was unable to pick up the clinical features of cerebral involvement until day 26 due to the tracheostomy and sedated state of the patient. This case illustrates the critical clinical value of regular assessment of NLR, LCRPR (Lymphocyte to CRP Ratio) and LPR (lymphocyte to platelet ratio) which are low-cost prognostic tools available in almost all health services across the world in comparison to sophisticated, expensive investigations including brain MRI.The peripheral immune response and the behaviour of this patient's blood biochemistry, particularly their white cell count (neutrophil, lymphocytes, and total white cell count), showed a significant correlation with his recovery process. It is also notable that at several time points, temperature spikes were co-incident with neutrophil spikes, highlighting the need for concurrent analysis and understanding of all types of simultaneously incoming patient data, whether biochemical, immunological, physiological or cognitive parameters (see the attached online supplement spreadsheet for other blood measures including electrolytes).To date, several international clinical researchers have successfully applied a more integrative artificial intelligence (AI) based approach to data management to assist in clinical decision making in COVID-19 cases. Indeed, Jiang et al. used AI research to determine, based on 53 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, that a mildly elevated liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a high red cell count and muscle pain all serve as good predictive factors of risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), common sequelae of COVID-19 [14] .In conclusion, we argue that this COVID-19 case study further highlights the usefulness of incorporating a more comprehensive framework based around continuous and objective patterns and ratios of blood hematology/biochemistry. AI-based decision making could potentially enable rapid online cloud-secured predictive analytics that can concurrently analyze all types of simultaneously incoming patient data, whether biochemical, immunological, physiological or cognitive parameters. Such an approach will provide the timestressed clinician with an up-to-date, systematically summarized set of data points for use to assist in choosing treatment and management options. This case also highlights the clinical value of simple, easy-to-use technology such as the Welch RV100-B RetinaVue™ 100 Imager Non-Mydriatic Retinal Camera, visual field perimetry (MRF-n) app in this context.Human subjects: Consent was obtained by all participants in this study.In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: Payment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.

However, despite low fatality rates and total cases, the focus then shifted to the low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) soon after the outbreak had hit the Indian subcontinent (ISC) and their COVID-19 response dynamics. In the meantime, academic studies started making inferences on the COVID-19 response effectiveness through comparing the disease prevalence and fatality rates between higher and lower income nations in order to investigate the curious case of low COVID-19 infection rates among the LMICs.Conducting research on LMICs with limited data could often lead to erroneous findings and biased interpretations, which is becoming a concern with the avalanche of studies published daily. The reasons behind inadequate data in LMICs or even low fatality/detection rates could be qualitatively discussed. While these would not impede academicians in conducting research, caution should be exercised during interpretation and in proposals of 'evidencebased' policies and the development of operational plans focusing on mitigation and response in respective contexts. For a greater focus and authors' area of expertise, this paper is limited to the countries in the ISC, which is a sample representation of LMICs; however, country-wise discussion of LMICs based on the respective socioeconomic context is required for a reasonable generalisation.India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are among the worst 20 countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of total number of cases; however, they are ranked 138, 139 and 147, respectively, in tests per million population, as of 18 June 2020 [1] . It is worth noting that countries such as Bangladesh reached the threshold of 10 000 tests per day on 20 May, an astonishing 74 days after the detection of the first confirmed case which was still a mere fraction of the number of tests conducted by countries such as the USA, UK and Italy. This lack of testing capabilities during the early days accompanied by the limited protective gears for health personnel and low implementation capacity related to the response of such pandemics could have concealed the true rate of infection and disease spread in the LMICs of the ISC.Due to limited testing facilities and availability of trained personnel, long delays in both sample collection and dissemination of test results are observed in these countries [2, 3] . Furthermore, these inadequate facilities could compromise sample handling and storage as they require strict low temperature preservation for an optimum result [3] , which is a challenge for LMICs including the ISC. Evidently, the official press releases in Bangladesh reflected that all collected samples were not tested daily with long backlogs leading to curbing sample collection [4] and resulting in public distress as many non-COVID medical facilities require certification of a negative test result before admitting new patients.Another issue for maintaining a rigorous score of transmission rates is to adequately define both cases and deaths from COVID-19, which varies across borders resulting in inconsistencies among reports [5] . For example, countries such as China and Bangladesh, have changed the definition of confirmed cases or recoveries during the on-going pandemic [6, 7] .Moreover, leadership and political goodwill during such crisis play a crucial role in data collection, testing quality and country-wide coverage [8] .Testing coverage in the Indian subcontinent has yet to reach the peripheral areas. The government testing facilities are mostly free but are consequently overwhelmed with backlogs, whereas the costs of private tests are well out of the reach of most people [9] . Particularly with countrywide lockdowns and reduced patient transport facilities, it is hard to acquire free-public amenities as an observed 60% increase in extreme poverty in Bangladesh and 90% of people (around 400 million) working in the informal economy in India are at the risk of deeper poverty due to the lack of work during lockdowns [10, 11] . In such scenarios, people living in urban slums or rural areas are likely to prioritise wage-earning activities meeting the heightened unmet basic needs in the midst of low economic flow considering the risks of COVID-19 infection instead of a 14-day post-test quarantine.Furthermore, given that the testing centres are mostly located in metropolitan areas, the coverage is often centralised to a few locations. For example, as of 18 June 2020, 64.1% of all tests in Bangladesh were conducted in Dhaka district compared to 0.01% in Jessore district [12] , and 38.3% tests in Pakistan were conducted in Sindh compared to 0.50% in Gilgit-Baltistan [13]. This decidedly undermines the coverage across these countries and limits the cases to few privileged cohorts challenging identification of the disease at the community level and underrepresenting cluster transmission for an extended period of time. The lack of testing facilities in peripheral areas requires samples to be transported over long distances in a limited timeframe, which could jeopardise the reliability of samples and test results. The presence of centralised laboratories in few locations contributes to inadequate risk assessments across the country and impacts subsequent decision making.The BBC has put forward an interesting idea of calculating the underreported deaths of COVID-19 using fatality data from previous years [14] . While this could be a way forward, the burden of diseases varies yearly. One particular example could be the expected decrease in road fatalities in 2020 and an increase in suicide rate due to the adverse effects on mental health from stress during lockdown. Similarly, as COVID-19 is not identical with regard to seasonal outbreaks such as measles or dengue in Bangladesh or wild polio in Pakistan, we cannot predict COVID-19 fatality rate from the mortality of the previous seasonal outbreaks, which is likely to lead to a dubious understanding of COVID-19 numbers in these countries. Instead the total increase in death count after adjusting for typical seasonal diseases observed in the previous years could provide a better crude estimate of the impact of COVID-19.Another avenue of estimating some of the deaths by COVID-like symptoms is data from graveyards and crematoriums. In West Bengal, India, the number of bodies cremated is nearly seven times more than the typical rate, whereas in Dhaka and Narayanganj districts of Bangladesh have seen twice or three times more burials in May 2020 compared to March or April [15, 16] . Disease misclassifications based on the differentiation in information regarding COVID-19 mortality apart from its comorbidities across multiple sources can adversely impact comparative analyses. This can also undermine subsequent resource mobilisation and evidence-based decision making in generating appropriate COVID-19 management and response worldwide. Moreover, the deceased with COVID-like symptoms are often untested in these countries, which although is understandable considering the resource limitations, but again considerably undermines the overall death tally.Another method of scrutinising the underreporting of cases is to assess the data of frontline workers since they are more likely to be tested alongside the politicians. As of June 2020, 3.28%, 2.88% and 1.45% of COVID-19 fatalities in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan were health workers respectively, whereas they were 0.37%, 0.55% and 0.50% in the USA, UK and Italy, respectively. These indicate that the health workers lacked adequate protective gear and knowledge about infection prevention and control measures in the ISC during the preparation phase as well as the fact that they were likely to be over-represented in the tests conducted, leading to an overall underreporting.As of 19 June 2020, a total of 14 members of the Bangladesh parliament out of 350 had tested positive with two fatalities and over 100 staff of the parliament secretariat, which resulted in a truncated budget discussion in the parliament [17] . Moreover, 8.1% of the COVID-19 infected belongs to the Bangladesh police with 28 fatalities so far [18] . Their testing is expectedly prioritised and the rapid increase in these numbers indicates that community transmission has been severely underreported in the ISC.In the ISC, people over 60 generally do not go out of home much, and often their external visits are limited to their familial circle [19] . Furthermore, a considerable number of women are homemakers [20] . Thus, a large portion of the society is used to staying at home, where able males mostly go out for work. While these scenarios are gradually changing, it could partially explain the slower transmission in ISC compared to the developed nations where all household members are more likely to go out increasing the speed of infection.Social dogma regarding the COVID-19 is also playing a role in these nations. People in Pakistan and India are typically religious. There exist concerns among them that some of the funeral rituals, such as bathing the deceased, cannot be performed if they died of COVID-19 which has created public resentment towards testing [15] . Furthermore, neighbourhood protests were observed in Bangladesh where locals denied the COVID-19 deceased to be buried in their local graveyards [21] . Thus, comparison of case prevalence and fatalities across countries need to consider the cross-cultural and demographic factors.There exists a major cause for concern regarding the data quality in the ISC. The subsequent use of these data in their raw form could lead to biased findings [22] . Davies et al. rightly found that younger age could be a protective factor in LMICs [23] ; however, it is still too early to extrapolate any generalised conclusions. Non-random sampling has been conducted in the ISC, and their limited capacity forces them to test mostly the symptomatic individuals and foreign returnees from the high risked countries in the early days. Thus, statistical or epidemiological modelling might be statistically unprincipled with marginalised results when not taking into account the weaknesses of the data generating mechanism [24] .Some findings are developing on a regular basis. For example, in the early days of the pandemic, a hypothesis was shown to be 'statistically significant' that temperature is associated with the infection rate [25] without adequate information on true R 0 value and its impact over COVID-19 transmission, which gave a misleading hope to politicians who used it to assure the general mass in Bangladesh leading to a sense of nationwide complacency [26] . Another assumption was that they are genetically immune to the coronavirus, or BCG vaccine might work as a protective factor [27] ; however, the large death tolls of Bangladeshi expatriates in Saudi Arabia, Singapore and New York have evidently debunked it [28] . This false optimism has led to relaxation of social distancing policies in public transport and consideration of opening schools across the country [29, 30] .While it is inevitable that modelling with data from LMICs on COVID-19 would continue, a few cautions should be exercised:• An appropriate definition of 'death from COVID-19' is essential before collapsing deaths from the COVID-like symptoms with the COVID-19 fatalities. For example, Bangladesh changed the definition of COVID-19 recovery a month after the detection of the first case [7] . • For validating the COVID-19 fatality scores of a region, specific mortality causes of comorbid conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular complication or communicable diseases representing similar manifestation of symptoms linked to COVID-19 could be coded to calibrate from the total deaths during the pandemic period. However, this also needs to consider the seasonal outbreaks of diseases in specific regions. • Comparison among seemingly random countries based on convenience or data availability might lead to a systematic bias. A comparative assessment on countries with similar testing coverages, analogous socioeconomic context, close geographical borders (e.g. EU or ISC), cultural resemblances and contextspecific priorities with homogeneous health systems might be more insightful. • Contrasting country-wise performances and COVID-19 infection timeline, where the COVID-19 prevalence curve has started to flatten with countries that are yet to reach its peak (Figs 1 and 2) , are unreasonable as true propensity of the pandemic is yet to be observed in LMICs such as ISC. • Instead of modelling COVID-19 incidence rates across borders, cultures and demographics, this could be limited to regions with homogeneous attributes. Comparison between neighbourhoods in the same locality might be better suited for hypothesis testing on mortality and disease prevalence, with the utmost care in avoiding narratives that might mislead the public opinion. • Validating the COVID-19 official data with random sampling, hospital data, disease burden trends and local news outlets could account for some of the underreporting biases.With thousands of PhD dissertations and research articles developing the evidence-base are expected on COVID-19 in years to come, it is imperative that the data validity is constantly Epidemiology and Infection questioned, and cross-border comparisons are routinely scrutinised given the definition of fatalities from COVID-like symptoms and quality of non-random data vary worldwide.","Australia","first author","2020-09-11",9

These recommendations were developed using expert consensus, incorporating the documented clinical signs and metabolic processes associated with COVID-19, the literature from other respiratory illnesses, in particular acute respiratory distress syndrome, and published guidelines for medical management of COVID-19 and general nutrition and intensive care. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are likely to have preexisting comorbidities, and the ensuing inflammatory response may result in increased metabolic demands, protein catabolism, and poor glycaemic control. Common medical interventions, including deep sedation, early mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and management in the prone position, may exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction and affect nutritional intake. Nutrition care should be tailored to pandemic capacity, with early gastric feeding commenced using an algorithm to provide nutrition for the first 5-7 days in lower-nutritional-risk patients and individualised care for high-nutritional-risk patients where capacity allows. Indirect calorimetry should be avoided owing to potential aerosol exposure and therefore infection risk to healthcare providers. Use of a volume-controlled, higher-protein enteral formula and gastric residual volume monitoring should be initiated. Careful monitoring, particularly after intensive care unit stay, is required to ensure appropriate nutrition delivery to prevent muscle deconditioning and aid recovery. The infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the expected high volume of patient admissions will require contingency planning to optimise staffing resources including upskilling, ensure adequate nutrition supplies, facilitate remote consultations, and optimise food service management. These guidelines provide recommendations on how to manage the aforementioned aspects when providing nutrition support to patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Artificial feeding, COVID-19, Critical illness, Nutrition, PandemicThe purpose of this document is to provide evidencebased advice for nutrition management of critically ill and acutely unwell hospitalised patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It provides key adaptations of usual best practice, taking into consideration staff safety, reduced staffing, resource utilisation, and the clinical condition of the patients. Optimal nutrition for these patients will require strong interdisciplinary collaboration, with flexible approaches to care to accommodate organisational changes resulting from this pandemic situation. As this pandemic is evolving rapidly, this document may be updated.We recommend enacting this COVID-19 nutrition guideline when hospitals enter phase 2 management strategies as outlined in the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) COVID-19 Guideline (version 2, 15th April 2020). 1 Phase 2 of the tiered intensive care unit (ICU) pandemic plan refers to a moderate impact on daily operations, with the ICU at or near maximum capacity but still able to meet demand and when up to 25% of beds are occupied by patients with pandemic illness. 1 Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who develop respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan failure, require intensive care management with mechanical ventilation (MV) and other organ supports. COVID-19 pneumonia is characterised by high fevers, which induce a catabolic state, resulting in impaired glucose utilisation and increased protein breakdown and energy utilisation. 2 It has been reported that in addition to critical illness, there may be significant effects on appetite, conscious state, and direct gastrointestinal effects resulting in nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and feeding intolerance. These factors adversely impact nutritional intake and status. Patients with COVID-19 often require prolonged MV and ICU support, resulting in significant immobility, catabolic stress, and muscle wastage. 2 These patients are at high risk of malnutrition during the period of critical care, as well as in the recovery phase of this illness, and may stay in hospital for a significant length of time. There are limited available data to guide the optimal nutritional management of patients with COVID-19, and as such, these guidelines are based on the available evidence from other similar conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. 3,4Although procedures such as nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion are not considered aerosol-generating procedures, there may be a risk to staff through the induction of coughing. The highest risk to staff is thought to relate to procedures involving the respiratory tract. Although studies suggest that RNA viral load is high in stool, the infectivity of faeces is not clear. 5, 6 It should be emphasised that personal protective equipment (PPE) is only one component in the hierarchy of hazard controls.Whether viable virus is present in gastric secretions is unknown. Therefore, it should be considered that procedures such as aspirating gastric contents may pose a risk; although staff members are using PPE for airborne precautions, they should be adequately protected. To minimise any excess risk, we recommend the use of appropriate PPE before any procedure involving gastric aspirate and insertion or change of an enteral tube and consideration of the frequency or avoidance of these procedures if possible. Where staff members are required to individually review patients for nutrition care, this should be done remotely, or using the appropriate PPE, after appropriate training and according to hospital guidelines.Staff should be aware of local guidelines regarding the use of PPE, which are broadly classified into categories for 'airborne' infections (P2/N95 respirator, eye protection, gloves, gown) and 'droplet' infections (surgical mask, eye protection, gloves, gown). Training should include the correct procedure of putting on and taking off PPE and careful attention to hand hygiene. PPE is only one component in the hierarchy of hazard controls. All other patients are considered to be at 'low nutrition risk', and the use of the standard nutrition algorithm should be considered safe unless otherwise indicated.Energy and protein targets 1. We do not recommend the use of indirect calorimetry (IC) in patients with COVID-19.IC requires the disconnection of the ventilator circuit which risks exposing staff to the airborne virus. IC also takes considerable time to perform, which will also increase overall exposure to staff.(EN) support in mechanically ventilated patients using an algorithm with a set rate for up to the first 5 d of ICU admission(see Fig. 1 ) 3. We recommend providing 25 kcal/kg bodyweight/day after the first 5 d of ICU admission (and up to 30 kcal/kg bodyweight/day for severely unwell patients, those with malnutrition, or those who have a prolonged admission, e.g., extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), or length of MV > 7 d) and protein prescription of at least 1.2 g/kg bodyweight/day. • Minimal evidence exists for the optimal nutritional targets in these patients, but in the absence of indirect calorimetry, we recommend calorie prescriptions to be based on 25 kcal/kg bodyweight/day after the first 5 d of ICU admission (and up to 30 kcal/kg bodyweight/day for severely unwell patients, e.g., ECMO, CRRT, or length of MV > 5 d or those with malnutrition) and protein prescription of at least 1.2 g/kg bodyweight/day. 4, 7 Actual bodyweight should be used for patients of normal BMI, and an adjusted bodyweight, for overweight and obese patients as per usual site method (e.g., ideal bodyweight + 25-50% [actual bodyweightideal bodyweight]). • Current case reports state that fever of between 37. 5 and 39.0 C is common. The metabolic impact of increased temperature is said to be 10-13% for every 1 C increase. 8 This should be considered in the overall nutrition prescription. • In obese patients, it is appropriate to commence nutrition according to the algorithm provided, but these patients should be considered at high nutrition risk and prioritised for nutrition review. • Contribution of calories from propofol should be considered in the nutrition provision if more than 10% of daily calories are being provided from this source. EN calories should be reduced and adequate protein delivery, ensured while considering overall fluid provision. • Recommendations for nutrition provision in patients admitted to the ICU and not ventilated within 24 h are provided in recommendation 18.Insertion of a nasogastric tube for enteral feeding 4. We recommend following institutional guidelines regarding appropriate PPE during the insertion of nasogastric tube (NGT), and unnecessary NGT changes should be avoided.• The insertion of an NGT may induce coughing, and nasal and gastric sections may also contain virus. Guidelines for PPE are being constantly reviewed, and clinicians should be aware of, and refer to, national and institutional guidelines. • The decision to insert an NGT should include consideration of the risk to staff, the benefit of providing nutrition support, and alternative modes of feeding including PN.In patients receiving MV who are at low nutrition risk, we recommend commencing EN support within 24 h of ICU admission via the gastric route using an algorithm with a set rate for up to the first 5 d of ICU admission (Fig. 1) .This recommendation takes into consideration the safety of dietitians in the ICU (recognising that reducing exposure is a fundamental method of preventing COVID-19 infection), l preservation of PPE for clinical staff who have no choice but to be in contact with patients, the workload required for clinicians to calculate an individualised rate considering the high volume of patients anticipated, increased prevalence of hyperglycaemia related to the significant inflammatory response, and the likelihood of gastrointestinal dysmotility with early full feeding in this population. There is no critical care nutrition literature to demonstrate negative consequences of early hypocaloric feeding strategies for the first 5-7 d of ICU admission. 3, 9 This recommendation is also in keeping with recent international guidelines that recommend the introduction of hypocaloric nutrition over the first 5-7 d of illness. 7 6 . In high-nutrition-risk patients, the dietitian or treating consultant should be contacted to determine if the standard feeding algorithm is appropriate to instate before commencement of feeding, and a dietetic consultation should be conducted within 24-72 h where possible (pending capacity and hospital COVID-19 phase).This is to ensure the safe provision of appropriate nutrition support, minimise the risk of refeeding, anaphylactic reactions, and the risk of significant overfeeding or underfeeding.For low-nutrition-risk patients, a care plan should be provided between 3 and 5 d (based on dietetic capacity due to case load) if they are likely to require MV for greater than 5 d and are likely to survive. 8. We recommend the use of an energy-dense EN formula (1.25-1.5 kcal/ml).• To reduce the volume of fluid provided to patients (in keeping with the ANZICS COVID-19 Guideline recommendations of avoiding high-volume EN as part of a restrictive fluid management strategy in patients with respiratory failure to reduce the risk of extravascular lung water), 9 we recommend selecting an enteral formula that meets caloric needs, without compromising protein delivery. • We recommend avoiding the prescription of a highly concentrated enteral formula (2 kcal/ml) unless essential for further fluid restriction. Highly concentrated enteral formula has been shown to delay gastric emptying, and therefore, they may exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction; in addition, these products usually have low protein content.Continuing nutrition support 9. We recommend, where possible, keeping enteral tubes in place after extubation owing to the prolonged recovery anticipated for patients who survive COVID-19.• This decision should be made in consultation with the dietitian. This takes into consideration the high metabolic demands and the challenges to achieving adequate oral nutrition (e.g., work of breathing, conscious state, potential eating and swallowing difficulties due to weakness, challenges with food selection and feeding with high workloads for bedside staff) and existing data in other populations informing of poor adequacy of nutrition with oral nutrition alone after critical illness. 10-13 • Where wide-bore NGT are in situ, consider changing to a fine-bore NGT before extubation if ongoing EN for >5 d is deemed likely. This should take into consideration the associated safety risks to staff and should be performed using appropriate precautions based on the infectivity status of the patient and coordinated with other clinical care. • For commencement of postextubation oral nutrition, please refer to the statement on oral intake in the section 'Nutrition for nonventilated patients and those receiving high-flow nasal oxygen'. 10. We recommend the consideration of postpyloric feeding, using the appropriate level of infection prevention precautions, or PN if gastrointestinal intolerance remains an issue over 5-7 d despite the use of appropriate management strategies, and calorie and protein delivery is consistently <50% of prescribed targets. 11. We recommend supplemental PN be considered after other measures to improve EN have been attempted or insertion of a postpyloric enteral feeding tube is deemed unsafe and calorie and protein intake remain significantly less than prescribed targets (i.e., <50% over a 5-to 7-d period). This should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and the long-term impact of nutrition deficit should be considered.12. For patients who are not at high nutrition risk, we recommend that a nutrition assessment be completed by day 3-5 of ICU admission in most circumstances, depending on staff capacity, or earlier if patients are at high nutritional risk (Fig. 1) . 13 . Where dietetic capacity is exhausted, and if a full dietetic review is not possible, we recommend increasing EN targets to meet 25-30 kcal/ kg bodyweight/day after day 5 as a minimum.• Nutritional monitoring should be maintained where possible, including assessment of calorie and protein delivery compared with prescribed targets, feeding intolerance, and other complications, to identify patients who may require an escalation in their nutritional care. • It is anticipated there will be a reduction in dietetic workforce with staff illness and increased patient case load. Therefore, a delay in the conduct of an initial nutrition assessment and less frequent reviews of nutritionally stable patients should be anticipated. Where resources are limited, we recommended dedicating these to the • first week of illness for high-nutrition-risk patients only • first week of illness in low-nutrition-risk patients with feeding complications • second week of illness in patients deemed low nutrition risk on admission • ICU teams should be advised to escalate patients with nutritional concerns quickly to facilitate prioritisation.We recommended continuing to measure gastric residual volumes (GRVs) in COVID-19 (using the appropriate level of infection control precautions but using a threshold of less than 300 ml and measuring every 8 h).GRVs have been less than 300 ml for > 48 h in patients who are not prone.• These recommendations are made as the viral load of gastric contents is unknown; however, the risk of not measuring GRVs is increased vomiting which also places staff at risk, and hence, strategies to avoid vomiting should be taken. • Where applicable, management of feeding intolerance as per ICU protocols should be instated (e.g., use of prokinetics) (Fig. 1 ). • Aspirated GRVs should be discarded rather than returned to reduce the risk of splash injury to staff. 16 . We recommend that the EN is paused and the NGT be aspirated before any position changes. EN should recommence as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary interruption to feeding.We recommend GRV monitoring continue every 8 h while in the prone position, even if intolerance is not an issue.• Patients in the prone position should commence EN as per the previous recommendations, with consideration that the prone position is associated with increased GRVs and risk of vomiting. 14 • Assessing the position of the NGT at the site of entry into the nasal cavity after placing the patient in the prone position is important to assess the potential risk of pressure injury.Nutrition for nonventilated patients and those receiving high-flow nasal oxygen 18. We recommend routine provision of an appropriate oral diet (e.g., high energy, high protein) and oral nutrition supplements (e.g., 1.5 or 2 kcal/ml oral supplement) as soon as oral intake is commenced. 19. We recommend advocating for escalation to EN, with consideration given to the safety risk of NGT placement, for patients not receiving MV and meeting <50% of energy and protein targets orally for ≥5-7 d, despite provision of oral nutritional supplements, or if intubation is expected.• The provision of nutrition in patients receiving high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is difficult owing to fasting for potential intubation, and oral intake is often poor owing to nausea, delirium, fatigue, poor appetite, and difficulty breathing. 15 These symptoms are commonly reported in critically ill patients. 16 Specifically for patients with COVID-19, loss of taste and smell has been reported as a consequence, which may influence oral intake across the spectrum of illness (including recovery). 17 This recommendation also considers the high patient numbers restricting timely individualised assessment.For the purpose of the acute ward guideline, patients at 'high nutrition risk' who are likely to require or benefit from individualised nutrition assessment on admission are defined as those with• Requirements for EN or PN Identifying nutrition risk 20. Where there is capacity, we recommend the use of a validated malnutrition screening tool to identify patients who are at risk of malnutrition (e.g., MUST, MST, Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form [MNA-SF]) although coordination of direct patient care should be considered to minimise staff exposure and PPE use.• Malnutrition screening is the most appropriate way to identify those who are most at risk and would benefit from nutrition interventions. This should be completed as part of standard care by staff members who are required to attend the bedside and are already utilising PPE.Dietetic assessment and reviews 21. For patients transferring to the ward from the ICU, we recommend that the ICU dietitian provides an appropriate handover to the ward dietitian within 24 h of ICU discharge.• This is to ensure the safe and appropriate transition of care from the ICU to the ward; this handover should include the nutritional status of the patients (if malnutrition is present, was it preexisting or hospital-acquired) and the assessed nutritional adequacy over the ICU admission.22. For patients admitted directly to the ward, we recommend the implementation of local pathways to optimise nutrition provision for patients as soon as possible, before full nutritional assessment, where appropriate (Fig. 2) .• This takes into consideration the level of risk and also the availability of staffing and allows dietitians to focus on patients who require complex nutrition support and those at high nutritional risk. We recommend a dietetic consultation for highnutrition-risk patients be conducted within 24 h.• High-risk patients include those requiring EN or PN or who have anaphylactic food allergy, cystic fibrosis, or inborn errors of metabolism. • Other patients at high nutritional risk should be seen within 24-72 h (e.g., patients at high risk of refeeding and/or severe malnutrition or patients with medical conditions in which specific nutrition therapy is required) based on dietetic capacity.24. We recommend that nutritional monitoring is maintained, including the monitoring of intake and weight (where possible), and high-nutritional-risk patients are reviewed at least twice weekly and lower-risk patients at least weekly.Continuing nutrition support 25. We recommend advocating for escalation to EN in patients who are meeting <50% of energy and protein targets orally for ≥5--7 days, or where a patient is assessed as malnourished and has a suboptimal oral intake (<65% of estimated requirements), despite provision of oral nutritional supplements or food fortification.6 | CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND ADDITIONAL WORKFORCE CONSIDERATIONSDietetic workforce considerations 26. We recommend that all dietitians treating patients with COVID-19 or entering a high-risk space have formal instruction on the use of PPE (including training, practice, and supervision). 27. We recommend conducting nutrition consultations remotely, utilising family to obtain nutrition history where possible, limiting the number of staff in the patient space and the utilisation of PPE. 28. We recommend nutrition departments are familiar with the hierarchy of hazard control. 1 29. We recommend the utilisation of nutrition assistants or allied health assistants (AHAs)where possible for non-face-to-face management activities.• Potential nutrition assistant/AHA tasks could include assistance with monitoring of oral intake, quantification of oral nutrition supplement compliance, liaison with bedside staff regarding menu preferences, assisting with food service tasks, assistance with facilitating ICU transfer, obtaining weight history, etc.Food service considerations 30. We recommend developing food service systems to enable electronic or phone meal ordering to minimise contact with the patient at the bedside while enabling patient menu selection and ensuring optimal nutrition provision.In combination with these protocols, we recommend consideration of the following:• Ensuring adequate equipment for EN is available, given the expected increase in bed numbers and patients, including feeding pumps, giving sets, and EN formula (including consideration of strategies for management, where some of the ICUs may be isolated from the rest and planning for potential EN or delivery system shortages with an appropriate contingency plan, such as equipment to facilitate gravity or bolus feeding). • Local instructions should be developed to communicate to staff where all nutritional products (e.g., pumps, giving sets, formulae) are stored and how to access additional stock. • Providing appropriate upskilling to non-ICU dietetic staff in the ICU or nonacute staff in other ward areas, including the necessary IT access. • Ensuring dietitians are able to facilitate nutrition by being competent at pump operation and changing of EN formula and giving sets to reduce the workload expectation on nursing staff. This should include non-COVID-19 patients within the ICU. • Minimising workload and risk of foodborne infection by avoiding the use of decanting of formula unless absolutely necessary. • Reviewing contingency processes with food service, to ensure optimal food choices are available and the maintenance of compliance with hospital food service guidelines and to ensure nutritional adequacy, with considerations for staff shortages. • Adapting workspace and team structure where possible to facilitate COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 areas and staff.• Planning for an occurrence of exposure within the nutrition team and how this will be managed at an operational level. • Consideration of a 7-d service in the ICU and on-call service for out-of-hours support may be of benefit in some centres. • Formalising communication pathways with bedside clinicians and food service to enable remote nutrition assessment and reviews where possible to limit clinician contact at the bedside such as alternatives for attendance at ward rounds. • Considering areas for advanced scope of practice to support medical and nursing staff where appropriate, e.g., postpyloric tube insertion.The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a large number of patients requiring admission to intensive care for management of symptoms relating to COVID-19 infection. The metabolic consequences and symptoms associated with COVID-19, as well as the medical therapy required in intensive care, have potential nutrition implications for consideration. Optimal nutrition therapy, both in the ICU and after ICU stay, should involve careful management of glycaemic control, fluid balance, and gastrointestinal function, prioritising highnutrition-risk patients and ensuring appropriate nutrition support to aid in recovery in long-stay patients and ICU survivors. Planning around safe working practices for infection control, staff resourcing, supply demands, and working remotely are key elements required to ensure nutrition support can be provided to the patients.Ethical approval was not required for this work.ENDORSEMENT This guideline is endorsed by the Australasian Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.","New Zealand","abstract","2020-09-17",9

The first is to mitigate entry of the infection into the country. This requires stopping the incoming movement of people from abroad, or for those who do enter, such as returning residents, imposing strict quarantine until it is established that they are COVID-19 negative. Second, if the infection has been introduced, PHC measures can be activated to reduce the spread. 1 These include traditional public health measures such as handwashing, limiting person-to-person contact through physical distancing, self-isolation measures, and personal protective equipment, as well as testing, contract tracing, and surveillance. Third, where containment is ineffective and there is increasing community spread, reduction in the rate of mortality from the disease requires hospitalisation for severe cases, with provision of supportive measures including oxygenation, intensive care, and ventilation.There are a number of ways PHC can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. A PHC approach includes public health, PC, and community-based social services. 2 The role of public health includes rapid and broad population testing, contact tracing, and surveillance of cases, as well as communicating consistent personal prevention messages such as the promotion of healthy behaviours (for example, hand-washing), and avoiding close contact with potentially infected people.Building on the 1978 Alma-Ata Declaration, 3 the Astana Declaration of 2018 4 asserts that strong PHC is the cornerstone for universal health coverage, and the most inclusive, effective, and efficient approach to enhance people's physical and mental health, and social wellbeing. The Declaration calls for an 'accessible, equitable, safe, of high quality, comprehensive, efficient, acceptable, available and affordable' approach delivering continuous, integrated people-centred services. 4 Further, Barbara Starfield identified that high performing PC provides access to first contact, patient-centred care that is comprehensive, continuous over time while coordinating services. 5 According to Dunlop et al, strong PC systems form the foundation of any emergency response. 6 Community-based practitioners provide the vast majority of health care across the spectrum of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery, and hence should be a vital component of an effective pandemic response. PC can play a role in conducting community-based testing, triaging cases, and providing first-contact care, referring only those cases that exacerbate to a severity requiring hospital care. Flexibility, adaption, and innovation are needed, with possible workforce mobilisation, task-shifting, and provision of electronic consultations where possible for ongoing non-COVID-19 comprehensive PC.The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that countries perceived to have stronger PC systems have lower mortality rates from COVID-19 than those with weaker PC systems.This study is a natural experiment using a convenience sample. An original online anonymous questionnaire was developed to capture the variables of interest, administered via Qualtrics. Participants were international PC experts (clinicians, researchers, and policymakers). All global regions and economic tiers (low-, middle-, and high-income) were included. Invitations to participate were disseminated through a wide range of PC networks, augmented by a snowball technique.The English version was launched 15 April 2020. Responding to considerable interest, the survey was translated into Spanish, which was available from 28 April 2020. Both language versions closed 4 May 2020.Questions addressed the perceived nature of their country's PC system, availability of a national pandemic plan, and various strategies employed in response to the pandemic (see Supplementary Appendix S1 for full survey).This is defined as the maximum mortality rate for a country on a 7-day moving average basis. This measure aims to quantify the severity of the pandemic in a country at its worst point. Country-level data on mortality rates from COVID-19 were extracted from John Hopkins University of Medicine on 24 June 2020. 7 Figure 1 Maximum COVID-19 mortality rate by countryThe survey asked about the availability of accessible, comprehensive care for all or the majority of the population, PC coordination and gatekeeping of specialist care, use of a unique patient identifier within the healthcare system, comprehensive patient records, and e-consultations prior to the pandemic. Affirmative responses were considered likely to be indicative of stronger PC systems.Countries having similar characteristics were grouped, using K-means clustering, into three clusters (strong, moderate, or weak) suggestive of strength of existing healthcare systems (as described above). The relationship between PC system strength and mortality was explored by comparing the maximum mortality rates observed to date for each country. Bivariate analyses were performed to determine the correlation between PC system variables and with mortality. Spearman correlation coefficients ( ρ ) were calculated for pairs of variables.A single PC strength metric was defined as the average response across the seven PC indicators captured (accessible, comprehensive, coordinated care, enrolled population, specialist gatekeeping, referral system, and multi-disciplinary team approach), given the positive correlations observed between the individual PC variables. Subgroup analyses were performed to control for country income classification 8 and age profile: aged ≥65 years population below the median; above the median; or above the 75 th percentile. 9 Individual participant responses were aggregated to country level to perform bivariate analysis with country-level outcomes. For each multiple choice answer, the country-level response was calculated as the proportion of responders from each country who selected each response. For numeric answers, the country-level response was calculated as the mean across all participants within each country. For ranking questions, the country-level response was calculated as the proportion of responders who ranked each choice as most important. Some multiple choice responses were grouped together to remove noise. Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.6.3).A total of 1131 survey responses from 114 countries were collected. Ninety-six uncompleted surveys were excluded, leaving 1035 responses from 111 countries. The number of responses from each country varied from 163 (Australia) to 34 countries with a single responder each (see Supplementary  Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). Thirty-eight countries with ≥5 responses accounted for 87% (n = 897) of all responses. Countries from all world regions and economic tiers were represented. The majority of responders (57%) were female; 51% of total responders were aged between 30-49 years; 41% were aged between 50-69 years; 73% (n = 756) identified as PC clinicians, 17% (n = 175) as academics, 6% (n = 60) as policymakers, with the remainder (4%, n = 44) as 'other'. The English version of the survey was completed by 92% (n = 954) of responders, and the Spanish version by 8% (n = 81).For the 38 countries, the maximum mortality rate (expressed per 100 000 population) ranged from 0.0 (Fiji) to 2.88 (Belgium) (Figure 1 ). The median maximum mortality rate across the 38 countries was 0.09. The countries highlighted in red were above the 75 th percentile in terms of maximum mortality rate for the 38 countries.For the 38 countries, responders' perceptions of the strength of their country's PC systems were categorised as strong, moderate, or weak (see Supplementary Table S2 ). There were positive correlations between all the individual PC variables (see Supplementary Figure S2 ). Particularly strong correlations exist between PC being available to the majority of the population and PC being comprehensive ( ρ = 0.79), and between having a unique identifier across the population and having comprehensive electronic medical records (ρ = 0.79). Overall, there was no evidence that countries with strong PC systems experienced lower COVID-19-related mortality. To the contrary, some countries perceived by responders as having strong PC systems relative to other countries experienced higher mortality rates in general ( Figure 2) .Subgroup analyses to control for older populations or income found no systematic evidence that countries with stronger PC systems were able to mitigate the severity of their COVID-19 pandemics to a better extent than countries with weaker PC systems ( Table 1) . High-income countries appeared to be most negatively impacted by COVID-19 mortalities.A positive correlation was found between the extent to which responders felt a national pandemic strategic plan existed and was executed, and the relevant country's COVID-19 mortality (Figure 3 ). There were few notable outlier countries where responders felt a national pandemic strategic plan existed and was executed, yet experienced high mortality; and those who felt a national pandemic strategic plan existed but was not executed, yet experienced low mortality.The average of the country-level-aggregated responses across the 38 countries indicating the degree of border closure at the time of first COVID-19 mortality were: no border closures at time of first mortality (26%); no entry for individuals from affected countries (19%); entry only for country citizens and residents (43%); entry only for individuals providing essential services (7%); and complete border closure (5%). (Figure 4 ). There was a positive correlation with increased mortality for countries where no border closures were applied ( ρ = 0.47) (see Supplementary Table S3 ).The average of the country-level-aggregated responses on the degree of movement restrictions at the time of first COVID-19 mortality were: physical distancing (54%); event closures (53%); selfisolation (40%); selective isolation based on contact tracing (43%); quarantine of suspected cases (43%); and closure of all but essential services (31%). While all 38 countries indicated various strategies in combination at the time of first mortality, closure of all but essential services was selected less compared to other responses ( Figure 5) .Bivariate analyses showed negative correlations with mortality for countries where responders believed that movement restriction measures were imposed ( ρ = -0.15 to -0.44), and a positive correlation with mortality (Pearson's correlation coefficient [r] = 0.20) where responders indicated no movement restrictions were imposed (see Supplementary Table S3 ).These results show that perceived strength of a country's PC system is not related to early mortality rates from COVID-19. Contrary to the authors' hypothesis, there was a positive correlation between increased mortality and countries where responders indicated strong PC. High-income countries appear to have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19 mortalities. Countries where responders felt a national pandemic strategic plan existed and was executed experienced lower COVID-19 mortality. Perceived stringent border control, movement restrictions, and testing policies were associated with reduced mortality.A strength of this international study is the sample of >1000 PC expert responders from a wide range of countries, who shared their perceptions of their country-level pandemic response. Convenience sampling methods prevent the ability to comment on the representativeness of responders, as well as the ability to report on all nations. The authors attempted to overcome these limitations by eliminating countries from the analysis with <5 responses.The relationship with mortality rates was chosen as the data around these were likely to be more accurate. Infection rates (number of cases identified) are dependent on who and how many of the population are tested. Countries conducting few tests may appear to have considerably less cases than in reality. Mortality rates may also be under-reported (mortalities at home or in rest-homes may not be counted, for example), but mortality from COVID-19 is likely to have less under-reporting than infection rates.The present study captured perceptions of PC experts (clinicians, academics, and policymakers) on the strength of their PC system, and their country's pandemic preparedness and response through survey responses. The authors recognise the limitations of this approach and explored the use of existing objective measures to verify findings. Neither the World Health Organization (WHO) nor the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development PHC expenditure datasets cover all 38 countries in the present study on national PHC spending. Currently available surveys of PC strength, such as the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative Trailblazer countries with Vital Signs Profiles, the Primary Health Care Activity Monitor for Europe, and the Primary Care Assessment Tool, are also limited in their scope of countries.Responders were asked the degree to which they used available data to complete the survey, and how confident they felt about their responses. There was not a strong correlation between these two variables, and it was decided that this analysis added little to the article while increasing its length.Several confounding factors not addressed may impact interpretation of results. These include whether there are land borders with other infected countries, population density, proportion of population with underlying conditions, 10 and a high flow of people across borders by tourists, 11 migrant workers, 12 or refugees. 13, 14 A multivariate approach was initially envisaged, but unfortunately the nature of the data did not support the approach for the following reasons:• Nature of the sample: regression is a form of inferential analysis, but the present sample is very biased. A descriptive analysis of the findings is more appropriate in this context. • Sample size: since the dependent variable is at a country level, survey responses must be aggregated to the country level to perform multivariate analyses. To estimate country-level responses with any degree of reliability, multiple responses per country were required; however, ≥10 ; and Blank = no data. b Border closure metric measures restrictions on international travel as ranked by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker: 0 = no restrictions; 1 = screening arrivals; 2 = quarantine arrivals from some or all regions; 3 = ban arrivals from some regions; 4 = ban on all regions or total border closure; and Blank = no data. c Age of population: young populations = proportion of the population aged ≥65 years is below 50 th percentile; older populations = proportion of the population aged ≥65 years is between 50 th and 75 th percentile; and oldest populations = proportion of the population aged ≥65 years is above the 75 th percentile. d Only subgroups with a minimum of five countries were included, hence low-income countries were excluded from subgroup analyses.responses were received for only 21 countries, and ≥5 for 38 countries. This means that a model with two to four predictors at most was possible. • Multicollinearity: there were high levels of collinearity between PC strength variables and other control variables, such as income, population age, and country income. • High variance: there is a high degree of variance in the dependent variable and within-country variance in the predictors. This is problematic given the small sample size.The above points result in unreliable models, where adding and controlling for additional variables would result in large changes to (previously statistically significant) parameter coefficients. While it was possible to construct an overfitted parsimonious multivariate model with a high R 2 from a limited number of predictors, given the issues described, that would not have been an honest reflection of the data.Finally, the present study took place early in the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic is still evolving with each country on its own trajectory, hence the recorded maximum mortality rate is dynamic. The availability of only English and Spanish surveys creates bias towards responders with fluency in either. Country selection was further biased by the network dissemination and snowball sampling employed, Comparison with the existing literature Growing evidence suggests that country strategy choices were essential if they lacked secondary options. 15 A country's health finances determine their capacity for pandemic response, but hospital beds, intensive care units, and trained staff are the big-ticket items. Rapid and stringent border control measures have demonstrated to be effective measures to reduce the speed of the global spread of COVID-19. 16, 17 Where entry of COVID-19 has been prevented through border control, such as in some small Pacific Island nations, morbidity and mortality remain low despite a paucity of healthcare resources. 18 As relatively high-traffic travel destinations, 11 the European countries of Italy, Spain, and the UK were rapidly overwhelmed by escalating cases. Border closures and lockdown are drastic measures that have significant social and economic repercussions, including widespread unemployment. While most countries opted to flatten the transmission curve and reduce the rate of mortality, some were more willing to let the infection run its course, aiming to develop herd immunity while minimising social disruption. 19 The national PHC response -including instigating comprehensive testing at the time of the first mortality and reducing person-to-person contact through hygiene measures and physical distancing, in addition to event and non-essential service closure, self-isolation, and quarantine -appears to have a significant impact on mortality. 17 Countries with a high mortality rate, such as the UK and US, had a reduced and slower response compared to those with a lower mortality rate, such as Australia and New Zealand. 18 The COVID-19 mortality rate is disproportionately high in the older population 20 and people with underlying health conditions. 21 Countries with high numbers in these groups may have greater mortality rates and need targeted strategies. Reducing physical contact where people live in overcrowded conditions, especially with poor fresh water and sanitation provisions, is additionally challenging.Clear communication plays a crucial part in national PHC response. 22 Risk communication needs to provide accessible, consistent, open, and timely information. Where the public are being asked to make big changes in their lives, if they are going to comply they need to understand exactly what they are being asked to do, trust the authority delivering the strategy, and believe that it will make a positive difference to outcomes. Similarly, healthcare workers need to receive clear, accurate, and regularly updated information about service delivery, resource availability, and other key factors in a rapidly changing environment. Strong coherent leadership is key. Further, responding to the extraordinary demands of a pandemic requires communication and integration across a number of sectors: not only between primary and secondary care, but also between the public and private sectors; between public health and PC; and between PC and other community-based health and social services.A study of the composition of COVID-19 taskforces in 24 countries (including the UK, US, Belgium, Spain, Italy, and Switzerland; all countries in the present study with high mortality rates) found a general absence of PHC, community, and civil society representation in their national government decision making and its response efforts. 23 Australia, which has had a generally good COVID-19 outcome to date, mounted a medical-driven response, which integrated public health, PC, and communitybased services, with clear and consistent communication to both the health workforce and the general population, aimed both at mitigating spread and providing equitable care. 24Countries perceived by the PC expert responders as having a prepared pandemic plan and a strong PC system did not necessarily experience lower COVID-19 mortality rates; what appears to make a difference to containment of the virus is if and when the plan is implemented, and the degree to which PHC is mobilised to respond. Effective PHC responses including hygiene measures, physical distancing, testing, triaging, and contact tracing, as well as isolation strategies, lead to lower mortality from COVID-19. Public health and PC measures need to be integrated in the PHC response to a pandemic. Lack of correlation with measures of self-reported PC strength suggest poor coordination between PC and public health.Population lockdown leads to delayed treatment for non-COVID-19 conditions in many patients, with serious health consequences. 25, 26 The disruption to people's lives leads to increased mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, 27, 28 and dire social consequences for many who have lost their employment. Having strong PC may play an important long-term role in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 mortality. Findings from this study can inform policymakers and planners to guide ongoing response to the waves of pandemic response that remain, and inform future preparedness.No external funding was received.Ethical approval was granted for 3 years on 9 April 2020 by the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee (UAHPEC) (reference number: 024557).Freely submitted; externally peer reviewed","New Zealand","first author","2020-09-09",9

In other countries, the pandemic and associated containment strategies are thought to have affected eating behaviour. In Italy, which experienced a severe outbreak early in the pandemic, one survey found that around 53 % of respondents reported eating more during lockdown and 19·5 % reported weight gain (10) . Another survey of adolescents and adults in Italy found that over half reported appetite changes, with some evidence that this varied by age, gender and work status (11) . In a survey of adults in Poland, more than 40 % reported eating more and 42 % reported weight change (loss or gain) (12) . In China (including sampling in Hubei province, which is thought to be the origin of SARS-CoV-2), dietary diversity was found to be lower in more affected regions (13) . Aside from the society-wide impact of confinement on diet, loss of the sense of taste and smell is a common side effect in those who contract COVID-19 (14) ; this may also affect dietary intake.The objective of this study was to identify self-reports of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in adults in Australia during the COVID-19 lockdown and learn whether this differs by age, gender or personal and living circumstances. The goal was to contribute to more effective targeting of interventions to improve nutrition and health for those at-risk.This paper reports results of a short, anonymously completed, self-report survey of people living in Australia and aged at least 18 years, with data collected from 3 April 2020 to 2 May 2020. The questionnaire included sociodemographic questions, fixed-response-option questions about the experiences of living with the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions, and two widely used standardised psychometric instruments of symptoms of depression and anxiety. The survey methods have been published (2) .Symptoms of anxiety were assessed using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (15) . The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 is a seven-item validated scale assessing frequency of experiencing common symptoms of anxiety in the preceding 2 weeks. Scores of 5-9 represent mild anxiety, 10-14 moderate anxiety and 15-21 severe anxiety. Clinically significant anxiety is defined as a Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 score ≥ 10.Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (16) , a nine-item validated scale assessing frequency of experiencing common symptoms of depression in the preceding 2 weeks. Aggregated responses to the nine items provide an indicative scale of depression symptom severity. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 scores of 5-9 represent mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe and ≥20 severe depressive symptoms. Clinically significant symptoms of depression were defined as Patient Health Questionnaire 9 scores ≥10.Bothersome poor appetite or overeating was determined from item 5 of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (16) , which asks respondents 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?' with response options of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days' and 'nearly every day'.The survey collected information on age, gender, postcode, whether born in Australia, living circumstances (who do you live with?) and occupation. Occupation was collected using ten response items (see Ref. (2)); for the purpose of this analysis, they have been collapsed into four groups: 'Continuing paid work or study from home', 'Work or study has been stopped by COVID-19', 'Leaving the home to go to work' and 'Unpaid caring, welfare benefits, or fixed-income'. This last group included those who reported that they were unpaid carers of children or dependent relatives, retired, had government benefits as their main source of income support or were unemployed before the COVID-19 pandemic. To obtain area-level socio-economic status, the Australian Bureau of Statistics Socio-economic Indices for Areas (17) were derived from a respondent's postcode, from which quintiles were developed.Personal impact of COVID-19 restrictions was assessed by the question 'How badly have the COVID-19 restrictions affected your daily life?' and rated on a scale of 0-10 ('not at all' to 'very badly'). A high adverse impact of restrictions was defined as a score ≥ 8. Anxiety relating to contracting COVID-19 was assessed by the question 'How worried are you that you will catch COVID-19?' and rated on a scale of 0-10 (from 'not at all worried' to 'extremely worried'). Being highly worried about contracting COVID-19 was defined as a score ≥ 8. Personal experience of COVID-19 (being treated or tested for COVID-19, or knowing someone who has contracted COVID-19) was also assessed.Population prevalence and 95 % CI of people bothered by poor appetite or overeating was estimated, adjusting for differences in sociodemographic characteristics between the sample and the Australian population (17) . The adjustment was made using post-stratification weights (2) .Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression modelling of factors associated with being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the previous 2 weeks was undertaken. The factors included in the model were sociodemographic characteristics, living circumstances, mental health status and experiences of COVID-19 and associated restrictions.Data analyses were conducted using STATA version 16 (StataCorp.) with only complete data included.A total of 13 829 adults (mean age 50·4 (SD 14·9) years) contributed complete data. Their demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1 . The weighted prevalence of being bothered at all by poor appetite or overeating in the previous 2 weeks was 53·6 %, with 11·6 % (95 % CI 10·6, 12·6) of respondents bothered by poor appetite or overeating nearly every day ( Table 2) .Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that age, gender, socio-economic status, living circumstances, being born overseas, concern about contracting COVID-19 and being highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were associated with odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating (Table 3) . Above the age of 40 years, after multivariate adjustment, increasing age was incrementally associated with decreasing odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the previous fortnight.Being male was associated with lower odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, as was high socio-economic advantage (Table 3) . Those living alone, with children and without a partner, or in a shared house with non-family members had significantly greater odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating than people living in a household with a partner and no children (Table 3) .Being in unpaid caring roles, unemployed before the COVID pandemic and still unemployed, retired or on government welfare benefits were associated with slightly lowered odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating compared with those who were continuing paid work or study from home.After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, anxiety and depression, respondents who were highly concerned about contracting COVID-19 and those who felt a high level of adverse impact of the pandemic restrictions had significantly increased odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating (Table 3) . There was only a small number of respondents who had contracted COVID-19 (n 56), which limits the ability to compare this group to the wider sample. Clinically significant anxiety and depression scores (≥ 10) were each associated with increased odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating (Table 3) .These findings demonstrate that, in the first month of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, more than half of the sampled adults reported that they were bothered by poorer appetite or eating more than usual. Women, those living alone, those living with children and without a partner, those very worried about contacting COVID-19 and those who felt a greater adverse effect of pandemic restrictions, were particularly likely to report being bothered by poor appetite or overeating. Older age, living with adult family members without children, higher socio-economic status, not being in paid work or study before COVID-19 and living in a regional area appeared to reduce the risk of being bothered by appetite and overeating during the pandemic. Clinically significant depression and anxiety were also associated with substantially increased odds of reporting being bothered by poor appetite or overeating. Emotional eating (eating in response to negative emotions) is a well-described phenomenon (18) and has been implicated in the pathway between depression and obesity (19) . Emotional eating is most commonly reported in response to boredom, loneliness and anxiety (20) . Stress can suppress appetite (21) , and loss of appetite is a common feature of depression and anxiety (22) .Living alone, living with children or living in shared accommodation with non-family members were all associated with increased odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, compared with living with a partner. Eating alone is a known risk factor for malnutrition in older adults (23) , and eating either alone or with non-family members is associated with increased risk of obesity when compared with eating with family (24) . At the time of the survey, schools were shut to all but the children of essential workers, and most households with children, were 'learning from home'. While those with sole responsibility for children were most bothered by poor appetite or overeating, those living with a partner and children were also more likely to be bothered by poor appetite or overeating than those living with a partner only. This suggests the possibilities that having children at home during the lockdown may induce stress which affects appetite or overeating or that catering to the dietary needs of children in the home may present additional eating opportunities. Living outside major metropolitan cities was associated with lower odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating. Possible explanations for this regional resilience may include feeling somewhat removed from the epicentre of the pandemic (which was concentrated at the time in major cities (1) ), or perhaps having working and daily lives that were less disrupted by lockdown.There were important age and gender differences in the reports of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating. Women were more likely to report being bothered by poor appetite or overeating than men. This is consistent with evidence that women tend to report greater weight/body shape concerns, eating concerns and binge eating than men (25) . Increasing age was associated with lower odds of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, despite older age being associated with more worry about contracting COVID-19 (2) . Possible explanations for this agerelated resilience to eating behaviour change may be more habitually stable eating patterns (26) , age-related decline in concern about body shape or weight change (27) , being more financially secure or having greater life experience of difficult situations and thus more capacity to regulate emotions in the face of the life changes imposed by lockdown. In young adult men, higher anxiety has been reported to be associated with uncontrolled eating, but uncontrolled eating also decreased with age (22) . However, a similar pattern of age-related decline in disordered eating was not noted in young women (22) .Environmental factors are known to be associated with food consumption. Overeating is related to the presence of palatable food in the environment (28) ; with a pandemicrelated lockdown, some people may have found themselves working from home in close proximity to the kitchen and its temptations. Those who were not working or studying outside the home before lockdown (and perhaps more accustomed to spending time at home) appeared to fare better in not being bothered by dietary behaviour, even though this group included people on low or fixed incomes (e.g. pensions), a population group generally considered to be at increased dietary risk (29) . In a US study of economically disadvantaged women, resistance to emotional eating and favourable social eating behaviours were associated with better diet quality and lower BMI, with evidence that these factors were key to mediating the relationship between food insecurity and BMI in women living on low incomes (30) . A feature of the early stages of the first pandemic wave lockdown in Australia was panic-buying or stockpiling of long-life foods such as flour, sugar, dried pasta, rice, biscuits, and bottled and canned foods. Baking and home cooking (notably 'iso-baking') were also prominent during this period (31) and may have contributed to an increase in the available food in the home environment.There appeared to be a socio-economic gradient in these findings, with those of greatest advantage least bothered by poor appetite or overeating, although following adjustment for other factors only the two extreme quintiles of socio-economic area status remained significantly different. The ability of economic advantage to buffer against any personal economic stress arising from the pandemic lockdown (e.g. losing or being stood down from employment, business downturn) may be one explanation. Greater access to health and well-being services and preventive healthcare may be another.These findings of adult eating behaviour concerns in Australia during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic do bear some similarities to what has been observed in other countries. The proportion of those who reported being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in this study was similar to self-reported dietary behaviours in Italy (10) and Poland (12) . In the survey of 1932 Italians, 53 % reported that they were eating more during confinement; 42 % of survey respondents attributed their dietary change to stress, anxiety or boredom (10) . Another survey covering Northern, Central and Southern Italy found that 17·8 % of the sample reported reduced appetite, while 34·4 % reported increased appetite during the COVID-19 lockdown (11) .A strength of this study is the large sample, with respondents from every state and territory of Australia, and the COVID-19 and eating behaviour sample weighting to enhance national representativeness. Australia is a high-income country with a universal health and welfare system, and thus the findings of this study may not be directly applicable in other settings, including lowincome countries (32) . Validated measures of symptoms of anxiety and depression were employed, and the survey included a question which captured level of concern about contracting COVID-19 as well as a question about the impact of the pandemic restrictions. It should be noted that the question about eating behaviour asked whether respondents were 'bothered by poor appetite or overeating', and does not enable these two eating behaviour constructs to be considered separately. It was not possible to determine the magnitude of any change in eating behaviour, not to determine whether consequences of this bothersome eating behaviour had manifested. It should also be noted that analysis of the association between depression scores and poor appetite or overeating is limited by the fact that the appetite question is a component of the score; thus, the OR for this should be considered with caution.The findings of this study indicate that bothersome poor appetite or overeating was experienced by over 50 % of adults during the first month of COVID-19 restrictions during the first wave of the pandemic. While short periods of dietary behaviour change may not significantly impact upon weight, with longer periods of lockdown, this may become of greater public health concern. Prolonged overeating increases risk of weight gain and obesity, with obesity being a wellknown risk factor for chronic disease (33) . Weight gain may also cause psychological distress associated with unwanted changes in body shape (25) . During the first wave of the pandemic, research has emerged indicating that obesity is a risk factor for greater severity of COVID-19 (34) . Weight gain might therefore heighten distress among those already concerned about contracting COVID-19. With subsequent waves of the pandemic and variability in responses to these across different countries, longitudinal studies of eating behaviour and other behavioural risk factors are needed to understand both short-term and long-term mental and physical health impacts (35) .There are factors that may limit (older age, regional dwelling, being more accustomed to spending time at home) or increase (female gender, anxiety, depression, being in lockdown with children) risk of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating for adults living in a high-income country during lockdown necessitated to control a pandemic. From a public health perspective, this research can inform universal and targeted public health promotion strategies to assist people to restore healthier eating patterns during periods of societywide confinement and disruptions to routine. It has been suggested that cognitive behavioural therapy may be one option for improving emotional regulation and assisting development of coping strategies associated with lockdown, and e-health delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy may be appropriate for those experiencing severe distress (36) . As more than half of adults in this large sample reported being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, population-wide public health strategies may also be warranted for subsequent pandemic waves and periods of lockdown.","Australia","abstract","2020-09-25",9

Key to control of the pandemic is accurate and timely diagnosis coupled with infection control measures to limit transmission. The gold standard for diagnosis relies on the detection of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid most commonly by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 1 Immunoassays may serve as an adjunct to diagnosis in patients who present late in their illness with only low levels of nucleic acid present in the upper respiratory tract, 2 as well as having a key role in epidemiological serosurveys to determine disease prevalence. 3 In this study, we sought to assess and compare the clinical performance of four commercially available immunoassays using a panel of sera collected from patients who had recovered from their COVID-19 infection.This study was reviewed and approved by the Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/65529/Austin-2020).All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and managed at Austin Health (Melbourne, Australia) between March and April 2020 were prospectively enrolled into a clinical database (database reference number CD20002). All patients had at least one combined naso-and oropharyngeal swab tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a qualitative assay. There were three different assays in use during this period due to reagent shortages: AusDiagnostics Coronavirus Typing (8-well) assay, performed at Austin Pathology; in house E gene assay with primers based on Corman et al. 4 performed at the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory; and in house RdRP primer assay and E gene assay based on Corman et al. 4 performed at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory.Patients were invited to participate in this study following recovery from COVID-19 infection, at least six weeks following onset of symptoms (Recovery cohort). This duration following infection was chosen due to existing institutional infection control policies. Clinical details regarding date of onset of symptoms, date of first nucleic acid detection by PCR, fever and respiratory tract symptoms, requirement for hospital or intensive care unit admission, and patient co-morbidities were obtained from the clinical database. In addition to the Recovery cohort, a small subset of patients who required admission to hospital due to COVID-19 infection had remnant sera saved from routine blood tests collected during their hospitalisation to investigate the timing of antibody detection. All samples were collected in serum separator tubes (Becton Dickinson, USA), sera harvested and stored at -80°C until testing was performed. The same aliquot was used for all four assays. Each aliquot underwent one freeze thaw cycle.These were stored sera collected from patients in April-May 2019. Further information on the presence of other antibodies present in these specimens can be found in Appendix A.Only samples with numerical results within the linear range of each assay were included in the statistical analysis for assay correlation. Residual serum from COVID-19 infected patients was used to create two serum pools, and each pool run in replicates of 10 on each assay.The platforms required for the performance of the assays chosen were previously in use at Austin Health. Specimens were analysed using four immunoassays according to the manufacturer's instructions. Interpretation of results was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The operator was blinded to the SARS-CoV-2 infection status of the specimens being analysed.The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) was performed on the Cobas e801. This is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for the detection of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using a recombinant protein representing the nucleocapsid (N) antigen. Results are reported as numeric values in form of a cut-off index (COI) with COI values <1.0 interpreted as non-reactive or negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and COI ≥1.0 interpreted as reactive or positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.The Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy) was performed on the Liaison XL. This is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay for the detection of IgG anti-S1 and IgG anti-S2 specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Results are reported as antibody concentrations in arbitrary units (AU/mL) with concentrations of <12.0 AU/mL interpreted as negative; concentrations of ≥12.0 to <15.0 AU/mL interpreted as equivocal; and concentrations of ≥15.0 AU/mL interpreted as positive.The Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Beckman Coulter, USA) was performed on DxI800. This is a paramagnetic particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a recombinant protein specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein. Results are reported as signal sample/cut-off (S/CO) with S/CO values <0.8 interpreted as non-reactive; S/CO values ≥0.8 to <1.0 interpreted as equivocal; and S/CO values ≥1.0 interpreted as reactive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. The Vitros Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, France) was performed on Vitros 5600. This is an immunometric assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 antigen. Results are reported as signal sample/cut-off (S/CO) with S/CO values <1.00 interpreted as non-reactive and S/CO values ≥1.00 interpreted as reactive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Samples were analysed in batches, with calibration and quality control performed to each manufacturer's recommendations.Patient characteristics were presented as median (interquartile range; IQR) and frequency (percentage). Clinical sensitivity was determined using the SARS-CoV-2 PCR as the reference standard. For determining clinical specificity and cross-reactivity, specimens collected in April-May 2019 were assumed to be negative, as these were collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019.The relationship between the magnitude of response and clinical characteristics was explored using linear regression. Some outcomes required a transformation using natural logarithm to enable better model fit. Results are expressed as change in the outcome (in original units or % where transformation was required) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Relationship between days from symptom onset and development of immune response was evaluated in a sample of seven participants with serial blood samples and is presented graphically. Analyses were performed using Stata 16.1 (StataCorp, USA). Correlation studies were analysed using Analyse-it for Microsoft Excel 5.30.1, build 7059.19477.Numerical results varied across the four assays. The range of results obtained were: Elecsys 0.07-156 COI; Liaison <3.80-1430 AU/mL; Access 0.01-57.5 S/CO; Vitros 0.01-23.9 S/CO. Passing-Bablok regression graphs and equations were derived for each assay pair (Supplementary Fig. 1A For the analysis of clinical sensitivity and specificity, only specimens that had testing on all four assays were included. There were 80 patients from whom 86 sera specimens were collected in the Recovery cohort. Six patients had two duplicate specimens. The clinical characteristics of this cohort is shown in Table 1 . These specimens were collected 45 to 130 days after symptom onset. The majority of patients had COVID-19 infection that did not require hospitalisation and were managed in the community only. All patients had fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms; none were asymptomatic. Only two patients were immunosuppressed. There were 95 negative control specimens from 95 patients. There was one Recovery specimen that tested non-reactive on all assays, one specimen that only tested reactive on the Elecsys assay and one specimen that tested reactive on the Elecsys and Vitros assays (Supplementary Table 1 , Appendix A).For the Elecsys assay, all Recovery specimens apart from one specimen were reactive (85/86) and all negative control specimens were non-reactive (95/95). The clinical sensitivity was 98.84% (95% CI 93.69-99.97) and specificity was 100% (95% CI 96.19-100.00).For the Liaison assay, there were 83/86 Recovery specimens that were reactive and 93/95 negative control specimens that were non-reactive. One negative control specimen was reactive (this specimen was also reactive for hepatitis B surface antibody) and one specimen was equivocal (this specimen was also reactive for hepatitis A total antibody, measles IgG, VZV IgG, EBV VCA IgG, EBV NA IgG, HSV type 1 IgG, HSV type 2 IgG and ANA 1:160 speckled). The clinical sensitivity was 96.51% (95% CI 90.14-99.27) and specificity was 97.89% (95% CI 92.60-99.74).For the Access assay, there were 73/86 Recovery specimens that were reactive, five specimens that were equivocal and eight specimens that were non-reactive. To calculate clinical sensitivity, when the equivocal results were grouped together with the reactive results, the clinical sensitivity was 90.70% (95% CI 82.49-95.90). If only reactive results were considered, the clinical sensitivity was 84.88% (95% CI 75.54-91.70). There were 94/95 non-reactive negative control specimens; one specimen was reactive (this specimen J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was also reactive for hepatitis A total antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen). The clinical specificity was 98.95% (95% CI 94.27-99.97).For the Vitros assay, 84/86 Recovery specimens were reactive; the clinical sensitivity was 97.67% (95% CI 91.85-99.72). All (95/95) negative control specimens tested non-reactive; the specificity was 100% (95% CI 96.15-100.00).In the six patients in the Recovery cohort who had duplicate specimens collected, there appeared to be a fall in the S/CO index or concentration in most instances, except with the Vitros assay where S/CO values demonstrated little change (Supplementary Table 1 , Appendix A).There were six patients with 79 specimens (median 11 serum specimens; IQR 6, 18) who had serial residual sera opportunistically stored during their inpatient admission and analysed on the four assays being evaluated (Supplementary Fig. 2A-D, Appendix A) . In most patients seroconversion occurred approximately 15 days after the onset of symptoms, however there is considerable variability, especially among Roche results.These results are demonstrated in Supplementary Table 2A ,B (Appendix A).On univariate analysis age, comorbidities, fever and being hospitalised were associated with larger Elecsys response. After adjustment for these variables, only the presence of fever showed significant association; those with fever had for 18.84 COI units larger response (95% CI 0.95, 36.74; p=0.039).After adjustment for age, comorbidities, immunosuppression, time since first PCR positivity, hospitalisation and ICU admission, variables associated with a larger Vitros S/CO result were greater age [1 year increase in age associated with 0.11 S/CO larger response (95% CI 0.00, 0.20), p=0.052] and requiring hospitalisation [5.0 S/CO larger response (95% CI 2.09, 7.93), p=0.001], while a longer duration from first PCR positive test was possibly associated with smaller response (increase in duration of 1 day associated with a decrease of 0.1 S/CO (95% CI -0.21, 0.01), p=0.085).Larger Liaison concentration results (after adjustment for age, comorbidities, immunosuppression, hospitalisation, ICU admission, time since first PCR positivity and time since symptom onset) were associated with hospitalisation [result larger for 149.36% (95% CI 48.20%, 319.57%), p=0.001], while longer duration from first PCR positive test was associated with lower IgG concentration [increase in duration of 1 day associated with a decrease for 4.51% (95% CI -7.88%, -1.02%), p=0.012].After adjustment for age, comorbidities, hospitalisation, time since first PCR positivity and time since symptom onset, larger Access S/CO responses were associated with older age [1 year increase in age associated with 3.15% increase in response (95% CI 0.70%, 5.66%), p=0.012] and hospitalisation [increase in 245.4% (95% CI 74.57%, 583.4%), p=0.001].This head-to-head study examining four commercial high-throughput and widely available assays shows that the Elecsys, Vitros and Liaison assays demonstrate good clinical sensitivity (>96%) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies up to 130 days following onset of symptoms in COVID-19 infection. Of the four assays, the Access assay showed the lowest sensitivity; this assay targets the S1 protein and two other assays evaluated, Vitros and Liaison, also targeted this protein. The sensitivity issues seen with the Access assay may have been due to an issue with the single batch of reagents used. There was only one patient who was non-reactive on all four serological assays consistent with other studies showing that a proportion of patients may fail to seroconvert. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] We did not have access to an earlier specimen and it is unknown whether the patient failed to seroconvert or had a sero-reversion event. No testing on reference immunoassays such as neutralisation tests or immunofluorescence assays were performed in this study.This study differs from other studies 6,7 that have examined the utility of serology assays in that we had few specimens soon after COVID-19 symptom onset but instead had specimens collected distant from symptom onset, with the majority of specimens obtained from patients who did not require hospitalisation for their COVID-19 infection. Hence our assessment of seroconversion kinetics was restricted, however these results demonstrate a measure of serological response durability, although longer follow up is required.We found that clinical patient factors can influence the magnitude of the serological response although this varied depending on the assay used. In three assays (Vitros, Liaison and Access) we found that hospitalisation was associated with a larger IgG response, suggesting that patients with a more severe illness will mount a greater response. This finding has been described by others. [12] [13] [14] Although this association with hospitalisation was not found with the Elecsys assay, the presence of fever was associated with a greater response on this assay, also suggesting that a systemic inflammatory response is associated with a serological response. Because none of the patients in our study were asymptomatic, we were not able to ascertain whether a serological response could be detected in the asymptomatic patient population using the assays being evaluated in this study. 13, 15 Increased age appeared to be associated with greater serological response measured by the Vitros and Access assays and we hypothesise that this may be due to previous infection with other coronaviruses, 16 however this requires further investigation with a larger dataset.Negative correlation with the duration from initial illness and IgG response with the Liaison assay (and possibly the Vitros assay) have implications for the choice of assays in seroprevalence surveys, as extensive data on the durability of serological response is yet to be studied given the recency of pandemic onset. This decay in serological response has also been described by other authors 17 although it is not known whether this indicates loss of immunity. The impact on sensitivity of a longer duration from symptom onset to serological evaluation is unknown and follow up specimens of longer duration are required to assess this further.All assays demonstrated good specificity (>97%), in particular the Elecsys and Vitros assays, although this study assessed a relatively small number of negative specimens and we did not have access to sera from patients infected with other endemic coronaviruses, limiting analysis of cross reactivity. Despite this high specificity, use of serological assays in an area of low prevalence such Australia will be associated with lowered positive predictive value and it is likely that serological diagnosis will remain an adjunct to nucleic acid detection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in specific settings such as retrospective diagnosis where nucleic acid testing is not detected or not performed due to mild or asymptomatic infection. 1, 16 In conclusion, we demonstrate that the assays evaluated demonstrated similar performance, with the exception of the Access assay. The Elecsys assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity.

Specifically, in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence initially recommended that a CFS 5, corresponding to mild frailty, be considered as a threshold above which ICU admission could be potentially initially be declined. This guidance was intended to help ration ICU resources should demand for beds exceeds supply. 5 This advice was subsequently revised to advise caution in applying the CFS in younger patients and in those with stable long-term disabilities, and hence to apply it only in patients aged >65 yr. 7 However, evidence supporting triage recommendations for pneumonia requiring critical care support is lacking. Although the commonest complication of COVID-19 disease resulting in ICU admission is hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, the impact of frailty on outcomes amongst patients with pneumonia admitted to the ICU is unclear, and the relevance of the 65-yr-old cut-off advocated for considering the CFS currently is unknown.Accordingly, we conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with pneumonia to ICUs in Australia and New Zealand to evaluate the association of frailty with in-hospital mortality and other outcomes. In doing so, our aim was to provide data to inform guidelines on the use of the CFS as a triage tool and on the appropriateness of the triage threshold of a CFS 5 recommended in current guidelines both overall and in those aged >65 yr.This was a retrospective cohort study, using previously described methods. 8 Population based data were collected by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation, which manages the ANZICS Adult Patient Database (APD), including data on 80% of all patients admitted to ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. 9 Data are subject to automated validity checks, with data collectors undergoing regular quality assurance review and training. Data dictionary use is mandated. This clinical registry is used for benchmarking amongst contributing ICUs. Ethics approval was provided by the Alfred Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (584/18).All patients with pneumonia aged 16 yr admitted to an ICU between January 1, 2018 and September 31, 2019 were included.We excluded patients who were admitted to the ICU for the sole purpose for organ donation or palliative care. In the event of multiple ICU admissions during a hospital stay, only the first was included.Patient characteristic data were age, sex, diagnosis (defined by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] III-j diagnosis codes), medical treatment limitation order (either patient initiated or because of medical futility), and illness severity scores (APACHE II and III-j 10 and Australian and New Zealand Risk of Death [ANZROD] scores). 11 Patients were defined as having pneumonia using APACHE III-j admission diagnoses of bacterial or viral pneumonia.The Canadian Study of Health and Aging CFS was used for frailty measurement, a 9-point judgement-based categorical scale, which is inclusivedeveryone has a place on it. This scale has demonstrated validity and reliability in frailty assessment in ICU patients and other populations. 2, 6 The modified eightcategory CFS is the most utilised frailty assessment in the critically ill. 12 This scale ranges from a CFS¼1 (very fit), 2 (well), 3 (managing well), 4 (vulnerable), 5 (mildly frail), 6 (moderately frail), 7 (severely frail) to 8 (very severely frail). 6 Frailty scores were both dichotomised as non-frail (CFS 1e4) or frail (CFS 5e8) according to accepted definitions, 2 with the frail cohort further considered in terms of mild/moderate frailty (CFS 5e6) and severe/very severe frailty (CFS 7e8). Frailty is a nonmandatory variable in the ANZICS APD, collected since 2017, and is defined as the patient's level of physical function 2 months before hospital admission.The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.We assessed the following secondary outcomes: discharge to nursing home/chronic care, survival to community discharge, organ support within the ICU (mechanical and noninvasive ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasoactive infusion, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), and ICU bed day occupancy.Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) scores indicating mild frailty have been proposed to guide ICU admission for UK patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pneumonia. However, the impact of frailty on mortality with (non-COVID-19) pneumonia is unknown. The authors examined the relationship between CFS and mortality in patients requiring ICU for (non-COVID-19) pneumonia, using a large Australian and New Zealand database on critical care admissions. Only CFS scores 7 were associated with higher (adjusted) mortality. These data suggest that CFS scores 5 alone are not useful for guiding the allocation of critical care resources.Data were examined for normality and compared between groups using c 2 tests (equal proportion), Student's t-tests (parametric data), or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, reporting results as n (%), means (standard deviation), and medians (interquartile range [IQR]), respectively.The relationship between frailty and outcome was determined fitting hierarchical logistic regression using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure with patients nested within sites and site treated as a random effect with results reported as marginal odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval [CI]). Model covariates include age, gender, pneumonia type (viral or bacterial), mechanical ventilation, and illness severity, with heterogeneity determined by fitting first-order interactions with frailty. Patient illness severity was measured by the ANZROD score, a locally derived highly discriminatory score for mortality in Australian and New Zealand ICU patients. 9, 11, 13 Whilst ANZ-ROD ordinarily includes patient age, to model age separately, the age component within ANZROD was removed. As frailty is an ordinal score with eight categories, it was initially modelled as a categorical variable and then secondly as a continuous variable, where evidence of linearity was observed to exist. After a significant interaction between CFS and age, exploratory analyses were performed on patients dividing age into 10 yr blocks.Predefined subgroup analysis was performed on patients determined by pneumonia type (viral vs bacterial), age (>65 yr), and mechanical ventilation. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and a two-sided P-value of 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.Over the study period, 9353 patients with pneumonia aged 16 yr were admitted to 170 ICUs; 671 were excluded (574 readmissions, 38 palliative care admissions, and 59 missing hospital outcome), of whom 5607/8682 had complete frailty data. In total, 1852/5607 (33%) patients were classified as frail, which increased in frequency with advancing age (Fig. 1 ). Patients classified as frail were older with higher illness severity scores (Table 1) . Patients with frailty also had more chronic comorbidities (particularly chronic respiratory disease) and Table 2 ). After adjustment, only these two highest frailty categories were associated with an increased risk of death over lower categories (Table 2, Fig. 2 ). These mortality differences remained in patients aged >65 yr ( Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Tables 7 and 8; Supplementary Fig. 1) , and in patients who required mechanical ventilation ( Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables 9 and 10; Supplementary Fig. 1 ).Patients with CFS¼7e8 accounted for 7% of all ICU bed days, compared with 24% of all ICU bed days for patients with CFS¼5e6 (Fig. 3 ).Discharge to nursing home/chronic care A total of 6% (111/1852) of patients with frailty vs 1% (49/3755) of patients without frailty were discharged to a nursing home/ chronic care (P<0.001); this was a new discharge location in 3% (59/1852) of patients with frailty vs 1% (33/3755) of patients without frailty, who previously resided at home (P<0.001) ( Patients with frailty were less likely to be mechanically ventilated in the ICU (19% vs 28%; P<0.001), but more likely to undergo noninvasive ventilation (55% vs 43%; P<0.001; Table 3 ). There was no difference in renal replacement therapy, but fewer patients with frailty underwent vasoactive infusions or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Table 3) . In this population-level retrospective cohort study, we found that one-third of patients with pneumonia admitted to Australian and New Zealand ICUs were categorised as frail. Although these patients were twice as likely to die in the ICU and hospital, the adjusted increased risk of death was only observed in those with severe and very severe frailty. When considered as separate categories, lesser degrees of mild/ moderate frailty (CFS¼5e6) were not strongly associated with mortality; four out of five patients in these categories were discharged from hospital alive, with half discharged directly home. Patients categorised as vulnerable had a similar risk of in-hospital mortality as those categorised as mildly frail.Based on the June 19, 2020 UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre COVID-19 report, 90.4% of all COVID-19 patients admitted to UK critical care units were able to live without assistance in daily activities before ICU admission compared with only 73.6% of patients with viral pneumonia (non-COVID-19) admitted to UK critical care units from 2017 to 2019. 14 These data suggest that ICU triage guidelines based on frailty are likely already being used in UK practice (integral to the definition of a CFS 5 is the requirement for assistance with activities of daily living). Although COVID-19 patients with a CFS 5 remain eligible for ICU admission under the guidelines, particularly subsequent to initial ward management and deterioration, these data imply that few of these COVID-19 affected patients with frailty are currently admitted to UK ICUs. Our findings also indicate that the increased mortality risk for ICU patients with pneumonia in the mild frailty category, who would potentially be declined ICU admission based on UK COVID-19 ICU triage recommendations, was essentially identical to the risk in the vulnerable category who would not be declined admission. Our finding that the association between frailty and mortality was less pronounced in patients aged >65 yr further suggests caution in the use of the CFS in ICU triage in older patients with pneumoniadthe target group of this guidance.Our findings are concordant with a previous report suggesting comparatively better outcomes in critical illness for patients with mild frailty than higher categories. 2,12 However, they contrast with a recent European study of 1100 patients undergoing review by a rapid response team, in which 67% (193/287) of patients categorised as CFS 5e6 either died or remained hospitalised at 30 days, similar to outcomes for patients in higher frailty categories. 15 The relevance of this study to patients with pneumonia or with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU is unclear. In our study, relatively few patients were discharged to chronic care facilities both overall and in patients aged >65 yr. Coupled with mortality findings, these data suggest overall acceptable outcomes for patients with pneumonia, particularly at lower levels of frailty. Patients with a CFS 5 accounted for almost a third of ICU bed days, whereas patients with severe and very severe frailty only accounted for 7% of ICU bed days. These findings imply that adjusting the CFS threshold used for triage purposes to exclude only patients with severe or very severe frailty would result in relatively few patients with pneumonia being declined ICU admission on frailty grounds. Moreover, it would only be useful if ICU demand did not substantially exceed the number of available beds. Alternative approaches to ICU triage during the COVID-19 pandemic have been advocated or implemented outside of the UK, incorporating both initial patient assessment and review of ICU progress over time. One widely cited triage protocol is the Ottawa triage protocol, based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score cut-offs, which, in a simulated pandemic model, has been shown to potentially increase ICU bed availability by 53%. 16, 17 A similar protocol utilising progressively more restrictive 'tiers' of criteria for noninitiation and withdrawal of intensive care, depending on resource scarcity, has been developed in Minnesota. 18 More recently, ANZICS has released guidance to support the development of local admission policies, in the event that ICU demand outstrips supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. 19 Other studies have demonstrated overall poorer outcomes with frailty in very old critically ill patients. 8, 20, 21 Taken together, these studies suggest that measurement of frailty is important, but should perhaps be best considered in the context of other variables in making triage decisions.The risk of death in our study for patients with a CFS of 4 was essentially identical to that observed with a CFS 5. Thus, one approach to substantially reduce ICU occupancy might be to reduce the ICU admission threshold to a CFS 4. Our data suggest that this approach would reduce total ICU bed occupancy by half, at the expense of not admitting many more patients with expected favourable outcomes. Alternatively, if triaging patient admissions purely on expected mortality, a threshold of a CFS 7 is more supported by our data. If multiple vulnerable or frail patients were being considered for the same ICU bed, our data suggest that factors other than the CFS (such as dynamic SOFA score assessments) should also be used to determine which patient is admitted to the ICU. Given that outcomes for CFS 4 and 5 patients were similar in our study, this would arguably be more equitable than the current approach being advocated by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. 5 Our study has numerous strengths, including the scale and scope of the registry used, which includes critically ill patients drawn from all states and territories in a bi-national contemporary cohort at a population level. The population studied was not restricted beyond admissions for palliative care, and thus represents a comprehensive overview of the prevalence and impact of frailty in ICU in Australia and New Zealand. A further strength is the frailty measure chosen, with the CFS having become the dominant tool for frailty assessment in critically ill patients. We have previously demonstrated that this scale has acceptable inter-individual variation in the critically ill population, and correlates well with more comprehensive frailty measurement scales. 22, 23 The major limitation of our study is that we studied patients with non-COVID pneumonia. As pulmonary infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presents a novel disease, this presents challenges for extrapolating our findings from critically ill patients in Australia and New Zealand to patients with COVID-19 in the UK. However, reports of COVID-19 patients requiring critical care from Lombardy, Italy 24 and Wuhan, China 25 suggest that the characteristics of patients included in our study are similar to those seen in COVID-19 patients. We cannot preclude the possibility that the relationship between frailty and outcomes is different for patients with COVID-19 compared with other pneumonias. However, our contemporary cohort of patients with a range of bacterial and viral pneumonias found no evidence that the aetiology of pneumonia affected the association between frailty and outcomes. Emerging data have suggested that different phenotypes of COVID-19 might have different ventilator requirements. 26, 27 However, we found no evidence that the relationship between frailty and outcomes was different for patients who were ventilated compared with those who were not. Frailty scores were missing for 35% of patients; extrapolation of our results to the whole population and to overall ICU bed-day occupancy could have hence been biased. Sensitivity analyses, however, revealed no major clinically significant differences between included and nonincluded patients, with no differences in either ICU or hospital length of stay likely to have changed percentages of bedday occupancy within frailty categories. It would have been useful to have data on post-hospitalisation outcomes because it is possible that frailty may have been associated with late mortality as found in other studies. 2, 22 We did not define the diagnostic criteria for bacterial or viral pneumonia beyond that of the APACHE III-j diagnostic codes. It is possible that misclassification thus occurred, although we note that this is a common limitation of registry studies. Data collectors used medical record review to determine the CFS scores, in contrast to prior studies. 2, 6 Our prior work, however, has shown that CFS derivation from retrospective medical ICU chart review is feasible. 23 Moreover, additional prior research has also demonstrated that CFS scores assigned in this manner correlate well with those determined through patient interview. 28 We did not mandate formal training of frailty measurement in participating ICUs. Inaccurate scoring was hence possible; however, all data collection in the APD is conducted with reference to a data dictionary, with explicit instructions and definitions about the CFS measurement.Frailty is common in patients with pneumonia admitted to the ICU and is associated with in-hospital mortality. Mild frailty (CFS¼5) was not more strongly associated with mortality than vulnerability (CFS¼4), suggesting that CFS 5 may not define a suitable triage threshold based purely on expected mortality. Given only patients with severe and very severe frailty (CFS 7) had a higher risk of death over lower categories, with little extra ICU capacity resulting from exclusion of these patients, we advocate that factors other than the CFS (e.g. dynamic illness severity scoring) should also be considered in determining which patient is admitted to the ICU.","Australia","abstract","2020-09-03",9

While COVID-19 can be a mild disease in many individuals, with cough and fever the most commonly reported symptoms, up to 30% of those affected may require hospitalisation, and some will require intensive intervention for acute respiratory distress syndrome. 1, 2 Globally, public health responses have been aimed at limiting new cases by preventing community transmission through mask wearing, social distancing, curtailing non-essential services and broad travel restrictions. The economic and social impacts of these interventions have been devastating, with foundational damage to local economies 3 and unprecedented increases in mental health diagnoses being reported. 4 As the protracted strain of the pandemic increases pressure to re-open economies, there is an urgent need for tests to predict an individual's risk of severe COVID-19. In the community, a risk prediction test could enable workplaces to confidently manage employees who are at increased risk of severe disease and should work from home or avoid client-facing roles. In the healthcare setting, a risk prediction test could inform patient triage when hospital resources are limited and be useful in prioritising pathology tests and vaccination (when one becomes available). On a personal level, knowledge of individual risk can empower individuals to make informed choices about day-to-day activities.The analysis of human genetic variation that may affect response to viral infection has been slower, largely due to the lack of available data. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative has undertaken meta-analyses of the genetic determinants of COVID-19 severity and has made the summary statistics publicly available. 8, 9 In addition, Ellinghaus et al. 10 identified two loci (3p21.31 and 9q34.2) that are strongly associated with severe disease.We used the UK Biobank to develop a comprehensive model to predict risk of severe COVID-19 by integrating demographic information, comorbidity risk factors and a panel of genetic markers.Eligible participants were those who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and for whom SNP genotyping data and linked hospital records were available. Of the 18,221 participants with SARS-CoV-2 test results, 1,713 had tested positive and 1,582 of those had both SNP and hospital data available.We used source of test result as a proxy for severity of disease: outpatient representing nonsevere disease and inpatient representing severe disease. For participants with multiple test results, we considered the disease to be severe if at least one result came from an inpatient setting.While we would normally construct a SNP relative risk score using published data to calculate population-averaged risk values for each SNP and then multiplying the risks for each SNP, 16 the size of the odds ratios for the 64 SNPs meant that this approach could result in relative risks of several orders of magnitude. Therefore, for this study, we calculated the percentage of risk alleles present in the genotyped SNPs for each participant. We used the percentage rather than a count because some of the eligible participants had missing data for some SNPs (9% had all SNPs genotyped, 82% were missing 1-5 SNPs and 9% were missing 6-15 SNPs).Blood type was imputed for genotyped UK Biobank participants using three SNPs (rs505922, rs8176719 and rs8176746) in the ABO gene on chromosome 9q34.2. A rs8176719 deletion (or for those with no result for rs8176719, a T allele at rs505922) indicated haplotype O. At rs8176746, haplotype A was indicated by the presence of the G allele and haplotype B was indicated by the presence of the T allele. 17, 18 Smoking status was defined as current versus past, never or unknown. The other clinical risk factors were extracted from hospital records by selecting records with ICD9 or ICD10 codes for the disease of interest (Table S2 , Supplementary Appendix).We used logistic regression to examine the association of risk factors with severity of COVID-19 disease. We began with a base model that included SNP score, age group and gender. We then included all the candidate variables and used backwards step-wise selection to remove those with P values >0.05. We then refined the final model by considering the addition of the removed candidate variables one at a time. Model selection was informed by examination of the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion, with a decrease of >2 indicating a statistically significant improvement.Model calibration was assessed using the Pearson-Windmeijer goodness-of-fit test and model discrimination was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To compare the effect sizes of the variables in the final model, we used the odds per adjusted standard deviation 20 using dummy variables for age group and ABO blood type.All statistical analyses were conducted by GSD. We used Stata (version 16.1) 21 for analyses; all statistical tests were two-sided and P values <0.05 were considered nominally statistically significant.The UK Biobank has Research Tissue Bank approval (REC #11/NW/0382) that covers analysis of data by approved researchers. All participants provided written informed consent to the UK Biobank before data collection began. We conducted this research using the UK Biobank resource under Application Number 47401.The adjusted odds ratios for the variables included in the final model are shown in Table 2 .One of the main issues of the COVID-19 pandemic is that of susceptibility to severe disease.The strong associations observed in the model consisting of just age and gender (Table S4, Supplementary Appendix) are attenuated by the inclusion of other risk factors. This is due to the comorbidities in the full model being more prevalent in older people and in men, and it is the comorbiditiesnot age and genderthat are associated with severe disease. Relying on age and gender alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.Our study does have some limitations. We used source of test result as a proxy for severity of disease. Therefore, there is considerable opportunity for misclassification of disease severity but this would be likely to attenuate the magnitude of the associations. Townsend deprivation score, BMI and current smoking status were taken from the baseline assessment data and may not represent the participants' current status. This may have contributed to these variables not being statistically significant. Until mid-May, testing for COVID-19 in the UK was limited to those who had recognisable symptoms and were essential workers, contacts of known cases, hospitalised or had returned from overseas. 22 Therefore, many asymptomatic or very mild cases from the first wave of the pandemic will not have been identified in this dataset.","Australia","first author","2020-09-30",9

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has introduced unprecedented challenges and implications for healthcare services worldwide, including pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS). This has been particularly pertinent for medical emergencies such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) that require a time-dependent emergency response.Annually, over 6,500 cases of OHCA are attended by Ambulance Victoria (AV) paramedics in Victoria, Australia 1 . Survival from OHCA is low at just 10-12%, reflecting global figures 1 . For the pre-hospital response to OHCA, a highly co-ordinated system-of-care that optimises survival and functional outcomes is paramount. System elements include time-dependent intervention strategies in the pre-hospital setting (e.g. early defibrillation) and use of appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies at receiving hospitals. Any disruption to this system-of-care could significantly influence patient outcomes.To date, the narrative of OHCA during COVID-19 has been defined by countries devastated by huge case numbers and overwhelmed healthcare services [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Italy experienced a 58% increase in OHCA incidence compared to 2019 and a 15% increase in death, with 77.4% of the increase in cases directly associated with COVID-19 infection 2 . A similar story was seen in New York with an increase in patients deceased on arrival increasing over 6-fold 3 . In Paris, the proportion of patients who had an OHCA and were admitted to hospital alive decreased from 22.8% to 12.8% and COVID-19 infection accounted for a third of the increase in OHCA incidence during the pandemic period 4 .For countries where infection and case-fatality rates have been low, imposed social restrictions and treatment precautions may also have influenced OHCA processes-of-care. Australia is a key example of a country with low infection and case-fatality during the first wave of COVID-19. Despite low cases, time-sensitive OHCA interventions have been interrupted by the need for donning personal protective equipment (PPE) and changes in arrest management have been introduced including altered approaches to airway management in basic and advanced life support algorithms [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In addition, the GoodSAM mobile phone system used to alert bystanders to a nearby arrest was switched off meaning that co-responding members of the community were not able to contribute to resuscitation efforts. The impact of these changes on the OHCA ""Chain of Survival"" is yet to be completely elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on the incidence, arrest characteristics, and survival from OHCA in Victoria, Australia.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult OHCA patients (aged>15 years) attended by paramedics in Victoria, Australia between 16 th March and 12 th May every year over 4 years (2017-2020). EMS witnessed OHCA events and patients for whom a Do-Not-Resuscitate order/Advanced Care Directive was in place were excluded from analyses. The COVID-19 pandemic period was defined as 16 th March 2020 (State of Emergency declared) through to midnight on 12 th May (Stage 3 restrictions eased). Stage 3 restrictions involved social distancing and individuals remaining at home except for essential shopping, care and caregiving, daily exercise, work and study (if this could not be done from home). For the prepandemic comparator period, we combined data from the same dates in 2017-2019. This study was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (Project#: 24377).This study was conducted in Victoria, Australia which has a population of 6.4 million people spread over almost 227,500km 2 . Over 4.9 million people live in the state's capital city of Melbourne. AV is the sole provider of EMS in the state. AV comprises ambulance paramedics who have advanced life support skills including supraglottic airway and intravenous epinephrine administration, and Mobile Intensive Care Ambulance paramedics who are authorised to perform endotracheal intubation and administer intravenous amiodarone, atropine and provide transcutaneous pacing. Mechanical CPR is available for prolonged arrests and selected patients requiring CPR to hospital.AV cardiac arrest management guidelines follow recommendations of the Australian Resuscitation Council 1 . First-responders (fire services and community volunteers) are also alerted and dispatched to suspected cardiac arrests at the point of the emergency call 13 .From January 2020, a Health Incident Action Plan (with revisions according to updated Governmental guidelines) and a COVID-19 Clinical Practice Guideline were implemented by AV. For OHCA cases, AV treatment guidelines were based on guidance from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) 8 , Australian Resuscitation Council 9 and American Heart Association 9, 10 and recommended suspension of bag-valvemask ventilation, early use of endotracheal intubation and mechanical CPR, and minimisation of airway suctioning (where possible) to limit aerosol exposure. During this period donning of airborne precaution PPE was required for every confirmed OHCA 11, 12 . Also, the system for alerting community first-responders to nearby arrests was suspended due to concerns over appropriate PPE use.We used data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on OHCA incidence and outcomes. The methodology of the registry has been described previously 13 . Briefly, data for every potential OHCA is uploaded to VACAR from the AV Data Warehouse and patient care records are also used to complete case records. Each potential case is reviewed for registry inclusion.Patients of all ages who suffer a documented cardiac arrest which occurs in the state of Victoria, patients who are pulseless on EMS arrival or patients who become pulseless in the presence of EMS or patients who were successfully defibrillated prior to EMS arrival are included in VACAR 1 . Demographics, vital signs, symptoms, case-related time intervals, inhospital management and outcomes are collected. In-patient data is obtained from treating hospitals and death data is obtained from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages Victoria. Population data (estimated resident population by single year of age in Victoria) was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 14 . EMS emergency caseload data was obtained from the Computer-Aided Dispatch system and AV Clinical Data Warehouse and included all cases where an emergency ambulance attended. Data on COVID-19 positive cases were obtained daily from the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services and linked to AV patient records via probabilistic linkage to identify any COVID-19 positive OHCAs.Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and proportions, and continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) or mean and standard deviation (SD), where appropriate. Differences in continuous data between the two time periods were assessed using the independent t-test for normally distributed data and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-parametric data. Differences in categorical data between the two time periods were determined using the Chi-square (χ 2 ) test. Incidence rates and rates of survivors per million person-years were calculated using population figures from the ABS as at 30 th June in the year prior. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) to assess the effect of the pandemic period on event survival (pulse present at hospital) and survival to hospital discharge, in patients with an attempted resuscitation. Logistic regression was conducted in the overall cohort (all rhythms) and separately for those presenting in a shockable rhythm (VF/VT) both for survival to hospital and survival to discharge. Covariates used for adjustment included factors known to influence survival from OHCA. Demographic factors (age, gender), response time, arrest rhythm, cardiac aetiology, public arrest location, having a bystander witness the arrest, provision of bystander CPR and, for those in a shockable rhythm, who provided the first shock (PAD versus first responder or AV) were included in the model. Call-to-patient time was also included due to the introduction of PPE. Data were analysed using Stata Statistical software 15 (StataCorp, 2017, College Station, TX). A twosided p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Between 16 th March 2020 (State of Emergency declared) and 12 th May 2020 (Stage 3 restrictions lifted), 935 OHCA were attended by EMS in Victoria, Australia. During the same time period, 1,453 cases of COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed with an incidence of 159 per 100,000 person-years 15 . Eighteen of these cases were fatal, providing a case fatality rate of 1.24% 15, 16 . For the same time period in 2017-2019, 2,599 OHCA were attended. Of all attendances to cardiac arrest, 380 and 1,218 arrests received EMS attempted resuscitation in the pandemic and comparator periods, respectively. The incidence rate of attended adult arrests during the pandemic period was not significantly different from the comparator period (127 per 100,000 person-years versus 123 per 100,000 person-years, respectively). However, the proportion of EMS attended OHCA that received any attempt at resuscitation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f significantly decreased during the pandemic period (46.9% in the comparator period versus 40.6% in the pandemic period, p=0.001). Table 1 summarises the patient, arrest and management characteristics of patients in the pandemic and comparator periods who received EMS attempted resuscitation. Patient age and gender distribution did not differ between the two periods. Arrests occurring in public locations significantly decreased by more than 50% in the pandemic period (20.8% in the comparator period versus 10.0% during the pandemic; p<0.001) and initial shocks by public access defibrillation (PAD)/first-responders also decreased (6.9% versus 3.9% during the pandemic period, p=0.037). Bystander CPR significantly increased by more than 5% during the pandemic period; it was bystander CPR provided in private residences and not in public locations that significantly increased.Resuscitation duration during the pandemic period was shortened by a median 2.5 minutes; median duration was significantly longer for patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and significantly shorter for those where ROSC was not achieved ( Table 1) . No confirmed COVID-19 positive patient was in cardiac arrest on EMS arrival during the study period.Overall EMS emergency caseload decreased significantly during the pandemic period (Figure 1) . However, delays to key life-saving interventions in the OHCA system-of-care increased (Figure 2) . Time-to-first defibrillation and time-to-first epinephrine were delayed by a further 2 minutes, resulting in a median 4-minute total delay during resuscitation efforts. The proportion of OHCA patients discharged alive during the pandemic period decreased by almost 50% (11.7% in the comparator period versus 6.1% in the pandemic period; p=0.002) as it did for patients presenting in a shockable rhythm (36.7% during the comparator period versus 20.0% in the pandemic period, p=0.004). Survivors per million person-years dropped to 24 in the pandemic period in 2020 from 59 per million person-years for the same timeframe in 2019 and 54 per million person-years in 2018, resulting in an estimated 35 excess deaths per million person-years (Figure 3) . Extrapolated over 12 months, this would result in 186 excess deaths from OHCA in Victoria.Despite adjustment for delays to arriving at-patient and changes in arrest characteristics, the risk-adjusted odds of survival to hospital discharge for all attempted resuscitations reduced by 54% during the pandemic period (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.86, p=0.015; Table 2 ). The same was demonstrated in patients presenting in a shockable rhythm (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26-0.96, p=0.037; Table 3 ). In comparison, the impact of the pandemic period on event survival (pulse present at hospital arrival) was not significant after adjustment for the same factors (for the overall cohort: OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.49-1.11, p=0.140; for patients presenting in a shockable rhythm: OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39-1.06, p=0.085) (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).In contrast to other locations devastated by high incidence of COVID-19 and overwhelmed healthcare systems 2-7 , the nature of the impact of COVID-19 was unique in Victoria, Australia during the first wave of infections between 16 th March 2020 and 12 th May 2020. Strictly imposed social restrictions involving a stay-at-home directive and social distancing resulted in a low burden of COVID-19 disease and a decrease in pre-hospital emergency caseload. Incidence of OHCA did not increase during the pandemic period unlike other countries around the world. In addition, concern regarding increased incidence in OHCA due to a reduction in patients seeking care for urgent cardiac conditions such as acute coronary syndrome was not seen.We found that rates of attempted resuscitation were significantly decreased during the pandemic period, indicating that paramedics encountered more patients who were deceased on arrival, or paramedics were less aggressive in their resuscitation attempts. Fear of COVID-19 infection may also have influenced paramedic decision-making. Fewer arrests occurred in public locations and fewer patients received early defibrillation. However, rates of bystander CPR significantly increased and, although counterintuitive, it is understandable as people remained at home, often with others, during the pandemic period. We have also shown previously that the most likely person to perform CPR is a family member 17 . Resuscitation duration in non-survivors was significantly shorter in the pandemic period than in the non-pandemic comparator period. It has been previously reported in patients experiencing in-hospital cardiac arrest that hospitals that were faster at terminating resuscitation on non-survivors had lower survival rates compared to hospitals that continued resuscitation for longer 18 . It is, therefore, possible that early withdrawal of care may have contributed to the observed reduction in survival. For patients presenting in a shockable rhythm, median resuscitation duration was significantly longer in the pandemic period. Although this suggests that paramedics were not systematically terminating resuscitation earlier, longer resuscitation duration has also been shown to be associated with poorer neurological outcome and decreased survival 19 .Survival from OHCA was significantly adversely impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic period (March -May 2020) in Victoria. Our data suggests that survival was impacted by increased delays to care, fewer public arrests, and fewer shocks by PAD/first responders. Despite adjusting for these factors and other known influencing factors, however, the riskadjusted odds of survival remained 50% lower during the pandemic period, suggesting that additional factors in pre-hospital arrest management and in post-arrest care provided by receiving hospitals may have also influenced patient outcomes. Other changes to processes-of-care, for example, earlier introduction of mechanical CPR and intubation, and de-emphasising the use of aerosol-generating procedures (e.g. airway suctioning) may have influenced patient outcomes by reducing hands-on-chest time and CPR quality. In addition, it is possible that changes to in-hospital practices also contributed to these reductions in survival. This could be due to changes in the patterns of care and approach to postresuscitation interventions (e.g. targeted temperature management and percutaneous coronary intervention). Also unknown is the possibility of patients delaying seeking medical attention for treatable cardiac symptoms in the time prior to OHCA due to reduced primary and tertiary care in the COVID era 20 .Fewer countries have experienced lower incidence and lower case-fatality rates from COVID-19 than Australia during the first wave of the pandemic. Other reports providing insights into OHCA during COVID-19 have come from France, Italy, UK, and the USA where COVID-19 incidence has been over 2.5 to 11-fold higher than in Victoria during the pandemic period defined in this study 16 . Case-fatality rates have been between 4.5 and 15fold higher 16 . Seattle/King County (USA) and Padua (Italy) similarly reported no increase in OHCA incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic 5, 6 but in Victoria, we demonstrated no increase in OHCA incidence, low COVID-19 incidence, and low COVID-19 case-fatality. Findings out of Padua also reported delays in key response time intervals (call-to-dispatch and dispatch-to-departure) 7 , however, the major delays we identified occurred after arrival at scene. These differences in COVID-19 incidence, case-fatality and time delays make the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f experience in Australia unlike that of others. The indirect influence of the pandemic on the OHCA system-of-care is potentially almost exclusively the result of social restrictions and personal protective practices. This highlights that efforts should be focused on maintaining the chain-of-survival in the pre-hospital setting. Given that a significant increase in the mortality rate of OHCA was identified during the pandemic period in Victoria, EMS pandemic preparedness not only requires planning and control of the disease itself, but optimisation of the response to OHCA.There are some limitations of this work that require comment. The observational study design has inherent risks of bias that cannot be controlled for and causality cannot be inferred. We were unable to account for migration out of Melbourne during the pandemic which may have influenced OHCA incidence. Multiple comparisons for patient and arrest characteristics were not performed due to study size and the exploratory nature of this work. Differences in comorbidities between patients in the pandemic period and comparator period are not known and may have influenced patient outcomes. Given the size of the pandemic period in our study, we were unable to adjust for clustering effects and temporal factors. We also did not examine CPR performance data during the pandemic period. The distinction between mediating and confounding factors and the impact of these on outcomes also requires investigation.While other international studies have seen high incidence of COVID-19 and attributed decreased survival from OHCA to high COVID-19 infection rates, we demonstrated no such impact to OHCA patient outcomes in a context of low COVID-19 incidence, low case-fatality rate and no COVID-19 positive OHCA patients. Instead, we demonstrated that COVID-19 initiated collateral damage to the OHCA system-of-care in Victoria, resulting in significantly longer delays to key time-sensitive interventions. However, this did not completely explain reductions in survival. Further research is required to understand additional management factors and potential in-hospital factors that may have influenced patient survival.All authors have made substantial contributions to this Report including in all the following: (1) the conception and design of the study, analysis and interpretation of data.

We included each jurisdiction's GCI index, as well as their scores for 'policy stability', 'responsiveness to change', and 'government long-term vision'.National pandemic response was measured in terms of early stringency and approach to testing.Index. [1, 5] Until April 29, 2020 the Stringency Index was developed from seven policy decisions relating to 'containment and closure', such as the closing of schools and workplaces, cancellation of public events, and restrictions on internal and international movement. Latvia and Lithuania were not included in OxCGRT-SI so we applied the same methods to estimate their stringency scores. We used the OxCGRT-SI at three time points (at the time of the 1 st , 5 th and 10 th recorded COVID-19 attributed to deaths in each country).Approach to COVID-19 testing was assessed in terms of the adoption of broad or narrow testing criteria, as measured by the index number of tests per case identified from April 13, 2020. Broader testing was indicated by a larger index number, meaning many tests were performed before identifying a COVID-19 case. The April 13 date was when testing data were available from all the states in the sample.The consequences of each national response were measured by COVID-19 deaths per million population; COVID-19 new daily deaths per million population; COVID-19 total cases per million population; and COVID-19 new daily cases per million population.Analysis: Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25, [8] multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, and k-means clustering were conducted using functions from R version 3.5.2. [9, 10] To characterise and group the 40 states based on their national CTR and their actual response to the pandemic, eight variables (four GCI measures, three OxCGRT-SI scores and the tests per COVID-19 case identified) were included in an MDS model. MDS was used to examine the underlying latent dimensions from multivariate data and to visualise the level of similarity or dissimilarity of the nations to each other based on these dimensions. Since the eight variables are not exact metrics, all variables were first standardised by transforming them to z-scores. As MDS examines similarity indices, the variables were converted into a Euclidean distance matrix and the MDS model was visualised on a 3-dimensional plot. Cluster analysis was then conducted on the MDS result using k-means, to determine the clustering structure. Nations within the same cluster are more similar to each other than those in other clusters.Statistical comparisons between cluster groups in terms of government CTR and response variables were conducted using one-way multivariate analysis of variances (MANOVA). Univariate tests were conducted with one-way ANOVAs. For outcome measures consisting of COVID-19 total deaths, new daily deaths, total cases and new daily cases, data were non-parametric. Thus, to test for differences between the clusters and outcome measures, Kruskal-Wallis H tests were conducted for the average of the last five days in March (day 27-day 31) and the last five days in April (day 57-day 61). For all tests, a significance level of .05 was used. Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics for each of the five national clusters for the measures investigated. *p-values are from one-way ANOVAs to examine differences between the 5 cluster groups.Using goodness-of-fit statistics, the number of dimensions with best fit for the MDS model was found at three dimensions, with 91% variance explained. From the MDS plots, we identified each of the dimensions as: (1) government CTR; (2) the level of early stringency response; and (3) approach to testing. Cluster analysis identified five national clusters from the MDS plots as shown in Figure 1 .Figures 1a to 1c each illustrate cluster performance on the three dimensions. Figure 1d is the threedimensional representation of the national health systems in the MDS model. Figure 1a shows three clusters (above the horizonal zero axis) with a higher government CTR compared to two clusters performing with lower government CTR (below the horizontal zero axis). The two clusters (orange and red) on the right of the vertical zero axis applied early stringency measures relative to those on the left. Figure 1b shows the middle green cluster from Figure 1a adopted a much broader testing strategy than all the remaining clusters. There was little relationship between government CTR, adoption of early stringency measures or testing approach (Figures 1a and 1c) . Figure 1a shows that clusters with high CTR and clusters with low CTR both demonstrated early high and low stringency adoption. Figure 1b shows similar testing approaches for 4 of the 5 clusters despite differences in stringency response and Figure 1c shows similar testing approach despite differences in government CTR. There were no clear linear relationships between these factors. Figure 1d b. c. d.A one-way MANOVA found an overall significant difference in the five cluster groups with CTR and response measures, (F(32, 104.9)= 9.4, p<0.001; Wilk's λ= 0.007, partial η 2 = 0.71). The univariateANOVAs showed that the differences were in all the eight variables (p<0.001) between the five clusters. and Cluster 5 (blue) were both characterised as low early stringency adopters with narrow scope of testing. However, Cluster 1 had low whereas Cluster 5 had high government CTR scores.Cluster 2 (red), like Cluster 1, was below the horizontal zero axis (in Figure 1a ) with low government CTR scores, but it adopted early stringency measures and had medium testing levels. Cluster 3 (green)and Cluster 4 (orange) were similar in their government CTR scores, but Cluster 3 had broader testing, and Cluster 4 had adopted early high stringency measures. For cumulative COVID-19 deaths and daily new COVID-19 deaths, applying Kruskal-Wallis H tests, we found significant differences in daily new deaths between the five clusters (χ 2 =12.0, p=0.02) but not for cumulative deaths (χ 2 = 8.8, p= 0.06) for the last five days in March. By the end of April, there were significant differences between the five clusters for both cumulative COVID-19 deaths (χ 2 =12.0, p=0.02) and daily new COVID-19 deaths (χ 2 =12.0, p=0.02). Figure 4b shows cluster 3 (green) and cluster 4 (orange) substantially lower on new COVID-19 death rates compared to the other clusters. ","Australia","abstract","2020-09-30",9

Globally there was an estimated 14% reduction in working hours during the first half of 2020 compared to the last quarter of 2019, equivalent to a loss of 400 million full-time jobs (1) . In Australia, an estimated 870,000 workers (6.7% of the total employed) lost their jobs between February and May 2020 after widespread public health measures to contain COVID-19 were introduced, while in May a further 1.55 million remained employed but were working less or were stood down (2). A coronavirus-induced recession with widespread job losses has potential to lead to an epidemic of mental illness, chronic disease and mortality (3) . Australian data demonstrates a higher than normal prevalence of stress, anxiety and hopelessness among the general community during the COVID-19 pandemic (4) , and elevations in the community prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms (5).Work and health are closely interconnected. There is substantial evidence globally of the health benefits of good work (6). The harmful health impacts of losing work are also well described (7), including in people whose work is impacted by viral epidemics (8, 9) . Work loss both disrupts social connections and reduces material financial resources, which are important determinants of health (10, 11).The response to the employment crisis by the Australian Government has been temporary wage subsidies (12) , and increases in social security payments (13) , to ensure workers maintain employer connections and a source of income. The ability of Australian workers to maintain social interaction has been challenged by physical distancing, isolation, movement restriction and working from home requirements. The health of those that have maintained higher levels of social interaction, and who have greater financial resources, may be less impacted by work loss. This study aimed to determine whether losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with poorer mental and physical health, and to determine if financial resources and social interactions moderate the relationship between work loss and health. We hypothesised that a gradient in work loss would be reflected in a health gradient, with the most affected group (the newly unemployed) reporting the worst health status.We report findings from a baseline survey of a prospective longitudinal cohort study of people living in Australia, aged at least 18 years, and who were employed in a paid job or self-employed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.Participants completed a 20-minute baseline survey upon enrolment (either online or via a telephone survey) between 27 th March and 12 th June 2020, which included both standardised health metrics and a range of study-specific questions. The online survey was promoted via social and general media, through personal networks, and via newsletters distributed by community sector and industry groups.Participants were enrolled into the telephone survey via random digit dialling conducted by a thirdparty market research company.Four study groups were defined on the basis of changes in work and job loss at the time of the baseline survey: (i) Lost Job -those who had lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic and were not working, (ii) Off-Work -those still employed but not currently working (e.g. stood down, furloughed, taking leave), (iii) Reduced Work -those still employed and working fewer hours than before the pandemic (e.g. reduced fraction, fewer days working), and (iv) Work Unaffected -those employed and working the same or more hours as before the pandemic.Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 6 scale (14) , distinguishing levels of serious mental illness (15) . Mental and physical health were assessed using the Mental Component Score and the Physical Component Score of the Short Form 12 (SF-12) scale (16) . Outcome measures were derived using standardised approaches and included whether the respondent recorded:-A SF-12 physical health component score of less than 45 indicating poor physical health.Financial resources were assessed with the question: 'If all of a sudden you had to get $2000 for something important, could the money be obtained within a week?' (17) . Responses of 'yes' were categorised as having more financial resources and responses of 'no' and 'don't know' as having less financial resource. Social interactions were measured using the Social Interaction sub-scale of the Duke Social Support Index (18) . Scores were dichotomised with reference to the cohort median as (1) less social interaction for scores less than 8, or (2) high levels of social interaction for scores greater than or equal to 8.Other survey items included a range of sociodemographic, work history and health characteristics including age, gender, household circumstances, personal income, pre-COVID-19 occupation and working hours, and the presence of pre-existing medical conditions.A total of 1128 (43.4%) respondents reported having at least one pre-existing medical condition, including 463 (17.8%) with anxiety and 492 (18.9%) with depression (Table 1) . Respondents who reported anxiety or depression had greater odds of high psychological distress and poor mental health.For physical health, each additional medical condition reported increased the odds of poor physical health by 1.44. Female respondents had greater odds of poor mental health than male respondents.This study demonstrates that in a cohort of people employed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, those experiencing work loss are more likely to report psychological distress, and poor mental and physical health compared to those whose work was unaffected. These negative health effects are exacerbated in people reporting fewer financial resources and those reporting lower levels of social interaction.These findings demonstrate that financial hardship and social connections moderate the relationship between work and health in the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic (7).Strategies that promote social interactions and increase financial security in those experiencing job or work loss may help to minimise negative health impacts.The odds of high psychological distress were greatest in people reporting lower financial resources.Among these respondents, the greatest odds of distress were reported by people who had lost their job, followed by those who were off work, those with reduced working hours and finally by those whose work was unaffected. The odds of poor mental and physical health were also greater in people reporting lower financial resources. The links between financial resources and health, particularly mental health, are well established (19). Our data additionally show that lower access to financial resources exacerbates the negative health consequences of work loss. People with lower financial reserves and more likely to report increases in financial stress (20). Potential interventions to ameliorate these impacts include increasing the financial support available to those who have lost work during the pandemic, and supporting people to manage their existing financial resources.We also observed that social interactions moderated the work-health relationship. Social support is an important determinant of health. Loneliness and social isolation have been associated with increased mortality, as well as adverse physical and mental health outcomes (21). During the COVID-19 pandemic social interactions have been transformed by the public health measures introduced to reduce viral transmission. The ability to participate in activities that support health such as working or volunteering, meeting in groups, participating in clubs and sporting groups (22) have all been reduced.Importantly, we observe that the moderating impact of lower social isolations on mental health and psychological distress was limited to people in the Lost Job, Off Work and Reduced Work groups.Those whose work was unaffected and who reported low social interactions did not report elevated distress or poorer mental health than their counterparts with more social interactions, suggesting a protective effect of continued engagement in work.Our data also provide some evidence for a gradient in health that can be related to the extent of work loss. Those in the job loss group had the greatest odds of reporting high psychological distress, poor mental and physical health than those in the other study groups. Those in the unaffected work group had the lowest odds of reporting these adverse health outcomes, while the reduced work and off work groups were intermediate.Economic recovery from the pandemic is likely to be a long-term process, and is unlikely to be evenly spread across society. A second wave in community transmission in Victoria (23) has led to further job and work losses, more stringent movement restrictions, and business closures. Some industries and occupations are at greater risk of pandemic-linked work loss than others (24), due to the inability to work remotely or enforce physical distancing, the rate of insecure and casual work arrangements, the risk of workplace transmission to employees or members of the public, or being considered 'nonessential' and thus more susceptible to business closure during outbreaks. Health-promoting programs should be targeted to people working in these high-risk industries and occupations, and to those whose working arrangements mean they are ineligible for alternative forms of financial assistance.Longitudinal data from this cohort will track changes in work and employment amongst the study groups, and examine longer-term impacts of mental and physical health as the pandemic unfolds in Australia.We acknowledge the Social Research Centre (SRC) for undertaking telephone interviews.Funding was provided by Monash University and the icare Foundation.

The World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on the 11 March 2020 (4) . In Australia, the Commonwealth Government's coronavirus J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f emergency response plan was triggered in late February and a suite of approaches, including travel restrictions, quarantine measures and physical distancing were announced to both suppress the spread of the virus and allow health systems to prepare (5). Maternity services in all countries have been impacted by the COVID-19 response including the implementation of telehealth, social distancing, use of personal protective equipment for clinical care and reduced visitors and support people (6) . In the middle of the focus on COVID-19, women and families are still having babies and having to navigate a complex health system (7) .The most common reason for hospital admission in Australia is pregnancy and childbirth.More than 300,000 babies are born in Australia each year and women attend more than two million pregnancy care visits annually (8) . Maternity services underwent rapid transformation in the delivery of pregnancy care to reduce the risk of transmission in both women and maternity care workers in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. On both social and mainstream media, women expressed increasing anxiety about these changes including concerns around their risk of contracting COVID-19, changes to intrapartum care, not having support people around them and potential separation from their baby (9, 10) . In response to this, there seems to have been an increase in women interested in homebirth across the country, mirroring international observations (7, 11, 12) . The Australian College of Midwives reported many additional calls relating to home births since March and private midwives in Australia have reported increased numbers of women requesting homebirth (10, 13) . In Victoria, one publicly funded homebirth model has tripled the number of homebirths provided between March and May 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 to meet the increasing demand (14) .While the majority of women in Australia give birth in hospital, 0.3% of Australian babies are born at home (8) . The majority of these homebirths are provided by privately practising midwives (PPMs). PPMs are registered as midwives with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia with Endorsement for Scheduled Medicines and are all self-employed. They provide care predominantly in the home and some also have visiting rights to admit women to hospital if needed. PPMs provide primary health care much like other private providers including general practitioners (GP) outside of the hospital system. Consequently, PPMs are often not seen as a mainstream service and so are potentially missed in planning when J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic occur. In a similar way, GPs have also expressed concerns about patient access to care, their personal safety and individual wellbeing (15) .It is not known how COVID-19 has impacted PPMs in Australia, a small but important group in terms of demand for services, ability to provide such services, access to personal protective equipment (PPE), training in PPE and infection control, as well as ongoing practical and psychological support from the health system. The specific changes PPMs have made to their practice in response to the pandemic are also unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the experience of PPMs in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will provide critical insights to guide maternity service preparedness for future pandemics or emergency situations and shine a unique light on a specific cadre of maternity staff.A cross-sectional national online survey was conducted in the early days of the COVID-19 response in Australia. Prior to commencement, the study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Alfred Health in Melbourne (Project 198/20).Midwives currently providing any type of private midwifery services for antenatal, labour and birth and/or postnatal services in Australia were eligible to participate. The number of PPMs providing services, especially during labour and birth, is largely unknown. The most recent data is from 2015, which showed that there were 241 midwives who attended homebirths as a primary midwife, a decline from 287 the year before but several of these would be midwives working in the public sector (16). We estimated that at least 100 PPMs would participate in the study based on interest and concerns in relation to COVID-19 expressed on social media. The study was advertised on social media (Facebook, Twitter, homebirth, midwifery sites) and through personal networks in early April 2020. One reminder post was distributed -on 19 April 2020. The advertisement provided a link to the online surveys. When the person clicked on the link they were taken to the opening page of the online survey. There were a series of questions to answer to confirm their consent before they could start the survey.The survey took 10-15 minutes to complete.Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Content analysis was used to explore the open-ended questions and comments. All aspects of the survey were optional.Not all respondents answered every question, which means the amount of missing data varies.In total, 103 PPMs responded to the survey, each question had between 61 and 81 responses. The location and type of practice of each of the PPMs is summarised in Table 1 .PPMs practised in New South Wales (32%), Queensland (31%), Victoria and Western Australia (13% respectively), South Australia (6%) and the Australian Capital Territory (5%).There were no respondents from the Northern Territory or Tasmania.All PPMs were in private practice and practised in varying capacities across the pregnancy, labour and birth and postpartum continuum (see Table 1 ). The highest proportion of midwives practised the full spectrum of care including antenatal, birth and postpartum care at home and in the hospital (40%), and the lowest proportion of respondents provided antenatal and/or postnatal care (4%).Ninety-three percent of PPMs reported an increase in the number of enquiries relating to homebirth which ranged from 17% receiving an extra 1-4 calls to 28% receiving over 20 extra calls over the past month. The PPMS reported that women gave reasons such as concerns about the hospitals limiting support people during labour, other restrictive practices in hospitals and increased exposure to COVID-19. Many of these enquiries were made close to the women's due date even as late as 39 weeks of pregnancy. PPMs This information would have been welcomed from the ACM, RANZCOG and governing bodies (state and territory health departments, Medicare), whom some PPMs felt were ""slow"" to give advice relevant to their practice.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ""I think ACM and RANZCOG were slow to give advice regarding pregnancy, however I know that the knowledge base has been rapidly expanding and local context is important to acknowledge"" PPMs acknowledged that, given the rapid evolution of the situation, the information and advice changed daily making it challenging to ensure their practice was safe and up to date.""As the situation is changing regularly it is hard to keep up with what is going on."" ""Information that is not changing every day. But that's how a pandemic is I'm realising""When it came to being prepared with personal protective equipment (PPE), one third of PPMs (21/61; 34%) felt they were prepared. PPMs were required to purchase PPE themselves and many reported that they were affected by the common lack of PPE including masks, gowns and gloves as well as hand sanitiser and disinfectant. Some PPMs (9/30; 30%) had a stock of PPE which they were now able to use. PPMs also commented that it would have been helpful to have had access to PPE, for example from their affiliated hospital, however this was not possible despite them making requests as explained here:""Have requested small supply from local hospital for new home birth bookingsdenied.""""Access to gowns from local hospitals would be very helpful.""""Easier access to PPE. Assistance from local hospital had been denied.""Two thirds of PPMs (39/61; 64%) were able to acquire some form of PPE through social media community sharing sites, online orders and Homebirth Australia which have been supplying masks. Around 65% (27/48) of PPMs reported making adaptations to PPE as part of their preparation. They reported sourcing PPE from non-hospital suppliers (hardware stores, for example) and are also wearing homemade cloth masks which can be washed between uses. Homemade hand sanitiser was also being made or sourced.The majority of PPMs (75%) felt they were well informed about breastfeeding and COVID-19, however they were concerned about in-person contact as they had limited access to PPE. One PPM wrote that she was doing:""Mainly online/phone to answer questions, history etc then in person as needed on a case by case basis… Face to face only 15-30 mins max as needed""Many comments related to the importance of continuing to breastfeed and PPMs stated they were following the guidelines as they emerged: ""I'm comfortable with the guidelines that if the woman practices hand hygiene and wears a mask while feeding if she is unwell. If other guidelines are developed, I will follow them, but the information seems to be quite consistent.""Very few PPMs (15%) reported being involved in simulations or drills in the event a woman in their care required admission to their local health service. There were conflicting answers regarding waterbirth with some PPMs reporting that the recommendation was not to provide waterbirth at home, while others stated they were not directed to cease practices such as waterbirth at home (86%). Included in these changes in practice, some PPMs were limiting the number of people during face-to-face consultations but not during birth, and self-isolating to minimise the risk of contracting COVID-19:""Less people present for appointments, but not limiting supports at birth."" ""Other than the visits to clients I am self isolating.""There were many comments relating to advising women that, should they need transfer to hospital, it is unlikely that PPM will be able to accompany them. PPMs explained that they were:""Using more telehealth. Cancelling face to face childbirth classes. Writing a plan and making available for clients""""Informing all women that if the need for transfer arises during labour, I will not be able to come with them to the birth unit of the local hospital as I will be seen as a support person, not a health professional.""Tele or video conferencing was also mentioned in regard to the provision of postnatal support for women at home.Sixty-eight percent of PPMs who have a collaborative arrangement with local hospitals reported a lack of support from that service. They reported to have been ""shut out of births"" of women who have needed transfer from home to hospital and others have requested assistance from the local hospital and been declined. One PPM wrote:Two (2%) PPMs stated that their local health service decided to exempt them from the ""one-person rule"" and allow them to stay with a woman who had transferred from home.The aim of this study was to explore the experience of PPMs in Australia in relation to preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred and three PPMs from all of the States and Territories in Australia with known PPMs responded. Issues relating to clinical guidance specific to the home setting, access to PPE and infection control advice and support from health services were identified. These findings provide critical insights to guide maternity service preparedness for future pandemics or emergency situations and shine a unique light on a specific cadre of maternity staff that is often forgotten by mainstream health services.In this survey, Australian PPMs reported an increase in enquiries for homebirth services in the early months of 2020 with some receiving more than 20 extra calls over the prior month. This was also reported in the media (10, 12, 14) . The Australian College of Midwives has also recently surveyed women about the experience being pregnant and giving birth in the early period of the COVID-19 response in Australia and found that 26% of women reconsidered their planned place of birth (7) . The main reasons were a fear of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital; they were told that they could not take support people to appointments, their option of homebirth in a publically-funded model was not available, they were worried their birth choices will be impacted and they were concerned about access to water immersion or Entonox for pain relief in labour. More than 2700 women responded to the online survey and 6% were either transferring or looking for a PPM to transfer care to and 3% were planning a freebirth, (that is, to give birth at home without midwifery and/or medical assistance). Planning to freebirth due to the COVID-19 restrictions is of significant concern and highlights the importance of options for women including access to PPMs.Privately practising midwives need tailored, timely information to inform their care but the resources available were not specific to private practice or were confusing. Anecdotally, many midwives across Australia were finding access to tailored, non-overwhelming J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f information a challenge. Guidance from RANZCOG was quick to be produced (17) which respondents in this study found useful. It is important that information is developed that is more specifically tailored to meet the needs of midwives caring for women at home. This would occur if health facilities engaged pro-actively with community health workers (including PPMs) in their pandemic response planning.In Australia, PPMs are mostly based in the community and attend the majority of homebirths. Some also provide care in one specified area such as antenatal and/or postnatal care, as was demonstrated in the survey. There are around 600 midwives recorded by the NMBA in 2020 as having Endorsement, which is essential before they can work as a PPM. However, it is unclear how many of these are practising privately (18) and the anecdotal estimates are that this is less than 200. Privately practising midwives are often forgotten in maternity service plans and guidance although collaborative arrangements were meant to address this. It appears this was also the case during the current the COVID-19 pandemic with nearly half of the PPMs responding that they would feel more informed if the information was specifically tailored to the unique practice of caring for women planning a homebirth, including telehealth. Delays in the dissemination of advice was also recognized. This experience mirrors that of other primary care providers including GPs who also experienced challenges during the planning phase (15) .It is evident that PPMs who responded were resourceful and sought out information from a range of sources to inform their care. It is clear that the plethora of policies and guidelines in the early weeks of the COVID-19 response was confusing and complex to navigate.Considerations around infection control, including attendance at labour and birth, analgesia such as inhalation analgesia, mode of birth and ability to support breastfeeding, particularly for women who test positive for COVID-19, have been the subject of much debate. In particular there were conflicting answers given regarding waterbirth, with some PPMs reporting that there were recommendations that suggested not to provide waterbirth at home. The confusion over waterbirth has been reported in other countries. In the United Kingdom (UK) more and more hospitals were banning waterbirth completely for all women, leading the Royal College of Midwives to issue a Clinical Briefing on waterbirth and COVID-19 (19) . In the UK, around 26% of maternity services had stopped all waterbirths, and not just for those with suspected or proven COVID-19. The Royal College of Midwives J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f recommended that ""the current evidence does not suggest that there should be a blanket cessation on the use of water in labour or waterbirth for all women "" (19) although it is unclear what impact this recommendation has had in the UK. Clear, consistent evidencebased advice is clearly needed for waterbirth and other issues related to infection prevention and control. The challenges and uncertainties regarding practice changes highlight the importance of engaging primary health services, such as those PPMs provide early, and with up to date and relevant information to guide practice.Privately practising midwives raised the lack of access to PPE and resources such as hand sanitizer and disinfectants. Some midwives who had clinical privileging rights with hospitals requested supplies but were denied. This led many PPMs (64%) to going online and accessing supplies through social media, online orders, hardware stores and organisations such as Homebirth Australia, who sourced supplies. Previous clients of PPMs and local community suppliers also donated, sewed cloth masks and supported some of the PPMs.Some midwives even made their own hand sanitizer. These experiences are similar to many health care providers across the world who have been calling for better access to PPE (20) including in community-based maternity settings (6) .Effective PPE must be available for midwives based in the community for antenatal appointments and for assisting births (6) . Studies of infection control and personal protective equipment (PPE) in home healthcare have focused on hospital-in-the-home, where healthcare workers are caring for unwell people and often doing regular invasive procedures (21, 22) rather than in the context of pregnancy care. Maintaining infection control in the home environments can be more difficult and this is even more so during a pandemic when PPE is a heightened issue (23) . For midwives this may be weighing scales and bags for example that will be taken from house to house (22, 24) .It is hard to enforce social distancing in someone else's house and there may be less recommendations about how many people are allowed in someone's home when the midwife is present. However, PPMs did report limiting the number of people present during antenatal consultations and screening of clients prior to visiting to rule out potential exposure. The healthcare workers clothing may also become a source of contamination (25) . Unfortunately, PPMs did not always receive adequate support from the hospital sector and this needs attention in future planning. Sixty-eight percent of PPMs who have a collaborative arrangement with a local hospital reported a lack of support from that service.In this survey very few reported being able to access simulation training run by the services and they reported being ""shut out of births"" of women who have needed transfer from home to hospital. These registered health professionals were seen as 'support people'.Others requested assistance from the local hospital and this was declined. It is concerning that these PPMs were denied support and respect and this points to ongoing issues with acceptance of midwives practising autonomously in Australia. This may be because hospitals themselves were coping with enormous change and disruption in their own services and were unable to consider community-based providers such as PPMs.This study has a number of limitations. We had 103 responses to the online survey but it is difficult to know the total number of PPMs at the current time point to calculate a response rate. In 2015 (the most recent data available) there were 241 midwives who attended homebirths as a primary midwife (16), though this includes both PPMs and midwives employed in publicly funded homebirth programs. In the past five years, there have been considerable reductions in the number of PPMs due to challenges with insurance and meeting regulation requirements. We estimate that there are probably less than 200 PPMs in Australia and probably many less providing full spectrum of care services (antenatal, labour and birth and postnatal). Therefore, the response from more than 100 PPMs is encouraging and probably reflective of the broader experience. Additionally, not every question was answered which likely reflects the different areas of practice for the PPMs.With a longer lead in time, we may have been able to refine the survey to reduce these missing data. However, the COVID-19 response was rapid, and it was important to gather timely information in the pandemic.This study shows that PPMs were fully aware of the need to protect themselves and their clients in the COVID-19 response and took the necessary actions in terms of information and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f PPE. It was challenging however and many did not receive adequate support through the public health system. This highlights that some PPMs may not be well integrated into the public health system and this means they are not acknowledged as another group of primary health providers to be supported and engaged with.PPMs are privately and federally funded through Australia's universal health insurance scheme (Medicare) but there are really no mechanisms in place to support them in a time of pandemic preparedness. This is unlikely to be the last pandemic and lessons need to be learned for the future, especially in terms of integration, support, education and inclusion as part of the broader health system. Midwives such as PPMs also need to develop their own preparedness plans including ways to come together to support one another, provide training and advice. There was no external funding.This study was approved by the Office of Ethics & Research Governance at Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria Australia -Project ID number: Project 198/20.The corresponding author, Caroline Homer, is the Editor-in-Chief of Women and Birth. This paper was therefore managed completely by the Deputy Editor, Linda Sweet, to avoid any conflicts of interest. The usual processes of blind peer review were undertaken.One of our co-authors, Hannah Dahlen, is a private practising midwife which may be considered as a conflict of interest.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Australia","abstract","2020-09-23",9

The first is the SIMPLE trial compared the efficacy and safety of treating subjects with severe COVID-19 for 5 or 10 days with remdesivir [1] . The second is Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial (ACTT1) ACTT-1 was a randomized, placebo controlled of remdesivir in hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 [2] .The background to these trials is that emergence of new viruses, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), requires both vaccines for the prevention and medicines for the treatment of the infection. As a vaccine is still at least a year away, medicines for the treatment of the symptoms of COVID-19 are urgently needed. Broadly, there are two approaches to the development of new medicines for COVID-19; firstly, to reposition medicines approved for other conditions for COVID-19 and secondly, to develop new medicines for COVID-19. The first approach may be quicker, but both approaches will require extensive preclinical testing followed by clinical trials. Remdesivir falls between these two approaches, as it is not a new medicine, but an investigational drug, which has not been approved for clinical use [3] . Remdesivir was being developed to treat the Ebola virus disease. In clinical trial for the Ebola, it was shown to have a good safety profile but was less effective than monoclonal antibodies [4] . Due to this lack of efficacy, the clinical development of remdesivir for Ebola was stopped.Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a prodrug of an adenosine analog. It is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, which inhibits viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase [5] . This makes remdesivir effective against a range of coronaviruses [5] including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [6] , and COVID-19 [7] . The first published clinical trial of remdesivir in severe COVID-19 did not show a mortality benefit [8] .The SIMPLE trial [1] compared the efficacy and safety of treating subjects with severe COVID-19 for 5 or 10 days with remdesivir. It was an international trial but was not placebo controlled. The trial was sponsored by Gilead Sciences, the makers of remdesivir, and the company collected the data, monitored the trial, and undertook the statistical analysis.SIMPLE enrolled subjects with COVID-19, radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates, and (i) oxygen saturation of 94% or less while breathing ambient air or (ii) were receiving supplemental oxygen. Subjects were excluded if they were receiving mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The enrolled subjects (397) had a mean age of ~61, and were predominantly white, and half had hypertension, and about a quarter had diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. At the start, ~55% of subjects were at point 4 on the 7-point ordinal scale, and ~27% at point 3:(i) Death (ii) Hospitalized, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO (iii) Hospitalized, receiving noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices (iv) Hospitalized, requiring low-flow supplementary oxygen (v) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen but receiving ongoing medical care (vi) Hospitalized, requiring neither supplemental oxygen not ongoing medical care (vii) Not hospitalized Subjects received 200 mg remdesivir iv on day 1 and then 100 mg iv for 4 or 9 days. More subjects completed the 5-day course of remdesivir (172/200, 86%) than the 10-day course (86/197, 44%) mainly because more subjects were discharged during the 10-(68/197, 35%) than 5-day course (16/200, 8%).The primary outcome was point improvement on the ordinal scale on day 14, and this was at least 2 points for 64% of subjects, who received the 5-day course of remdesivir, and (after adjustment for difference in status at the start) 54% of subjects after the 10-day course. Also, similar between the two courses was duration of hospitalization, proportion that recovered, and time to recovery. Numerically mortality was lower in the 5-day group (8% vs 11%), and more were discharged from hospital in the 5-than 10-day group (60% vs 52%).The secondary outcome was adverse events, and the overall occurrence was similar in both groups. However, acute respiratory failure was more common in the 10-day group (9% vs 5%).In their discussion [1] , the authors emphasize that (i) There was no difference in efficacy between the 5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir. (ii) As the study did not enroll subjects with mechanical ventilation, the results cannot be extrapolated to this group. (iii) As there was no placebo group, the study did not test efficacy. (iv) Data on liver enzymes were inconclusive.The authors mention [1] , without reference, that transient elevations in liver enzymes were observed in phase 1 trials of remdesivir in healthy volunteers. Also unpublished in a refereed journal is that remdesivir, at high concentrations in preclinical testing, had renal toxicity. In the SIMPLE trial in 2.5% and 3.6% of subjects in the 5-day and 10-day group had elevated aminotransferase elevation leading to discontinuation. There were also decreases in creatinine clearance with remdesivir in the SIMPLE trial. However, as COVID-19 itself is associated with liver and kidney injury, it is unknown whether it is remdesivir or the virus that led to the elevated aminotransferases and decreased creatinine clearance.ACTT-1 [2] was a randomized, placebo controlled, international trial of remdesivir in hospital subjects with COVID-19 with the subjects predominantly coming from North America (80%) followed by Europe (15%). To be included subjects with COVID-19 had to have at least one of radiographic infiltrates by imaging, clinical assessment (evidence of rales/crackles) and SpO 2 ≤ 94% or requiring mechanical ventilation and/or supplementary oxygen.The mean age of subjects was 59 years, and most were white (53%). Many of the subjects had preexisting conditions such hypertension (50%), obesity (37%), and type 2 diabetes (30%). Subjects (1063) were randomized to a loading dose of 200 mg iv, followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg iv from day 2-10 or until hospital discharge or death, or placebo.In an interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board reported that as a higher than expected number of recoveries had occurred, the data should be reported. At this time, only 731 subjects had completed the study through day 29 with another 301 were continuing treatment and not recovered when the database closed. The number of subjects that discontinued due to adverse events was similar in both groups (~38).The primary outcome was the time to recovery within 28 days of enrollment to (i) Not hospitalized, no limitation of activities (ii) Not hospitalized, limitation of activities and/or home oxygen requirement (iii) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, and no longer requiring ongoing medical care (used if hospitalization was extended for infection control reasons)and this was shorter with remdesivir (11 days) than with placebo (15 days). After 27 days, 87% had recovered in the remdesivir group, compared to 82% in the placebo group. The secondary outcomes used an ordinal scale (i) Death (ii) Hospitalized, no invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) (iii) Hospitalized, on noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices (iv) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen (v) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen (vi) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities (vii) Not hospitalized, no limitation on activities and the percentage of recoveries was higher with remdesivir (62%) than with placebo (52%). Although the deaths at 14 days were lower with remdesivir (32/7.1%) than with placebo (54/11.9%), this did not reach significance. There was no excess of adverse effects with remdesivir, and this included no excess in liver or kidney toxicity.The authors clarify that the trial is ongoing and will be reported when complete in order to fully understand the efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 [2] . The authors discuss the reasons for the difference in their findings and a previous study showing no benefit with remdesivir in COVID-10 [2] , and this is discussed in section 5.3.The SIMPLE trial suggests that short-term treatment with remdesivir does not increase mortality dramatically or have serious short-term toxicity when used to treat COVID-19. The ACTT1 trial showed that remdesivir may shorten recovery and decrease mortality in COVID-19 without increasing adverse effects.It seems to me that we have learnt very little from the SIMPLE trial [1] , and this would be predicted from a trial that has no control or placebo group. Even in the extraordinary COVID-19 times, I am surprised that an uncontrolled trial was undertaken, and even more surprised that it has been published in a prestigious journal.In the ACTT1 trial, an interim analysis was undertaken, which led to early reporting of the data due to higher than expected recoveries with remdesivir. Interim findings leading to early reporting always have pros and cons. The pro, in this case, is that remdesivir will be more widely used in COVID-19 for its likely benefit. The con is that the early analysis is probably the reason that the trial did not give a significant finding on mortality. Fortunately, the trial is going to be completed [2] , which should give us definitive data on the effect of remdesivir on the mortality in COVID-19.Based on the findings of the ACTT1 trial, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have licensed remdesivir for the emergency use of remdesivir for hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 [9] .The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir in severe COVID-19 was performed in Wuhan, China, and did not find a recovery benefit with remdesivir [8] . This trial was terminated early when the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan was curtailed, and this limited the numbers enrolled and statistical power of the study [8] . At termination, 158 subjects with COVID-19 had been treated with remdesivir, compared to 78 in the placebo group, and the time to clinical improvement was similar in remdesivir group (21 days) and placebo group (23 days) [8] .Due to the lack of statistical power in this Wuhan trial, there seems to have been a tendency to dismiss its finding of no benefit with remdesivir after the positive findings in the ACTT1 trial were released. Another approach is to compare the trials to see if there are other differences than statistical power. The population of subjects enrolled in the two studies was different; in the Wuhan trial, 82% of subjects were requiring supplemental oxygen, whereas only 40% were in this category in the ACTT1 trial. In the ACTT1 trial, remdesivir did show benefit in those requiring supplemental oxygen, but the number of subjects was too low to reach statistical significance. Thus, it could be argued that the findings in this category in both studies were statistically similar.In the Wuhan trial, subjects with severe COVID-19 continued their other treatments including ~39% who were taking a corticosteroid, and this trial did not show any benefits with remdesivir [8] . In the ACTT1 trial, other experimental treatments or off-label use of marketed medications were prohibited, and remdesivir shortened recovery [2] . Thus, it is possible that the different findings between the studies may be related to the use of a corticosteroid in the Wuhan, but not the ACTT1 trial.On autopsy, severe COVID-19 is associated with diffuse alveolar damage, inflammatory infiltrates, and coagulopathy. Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid, reduces mortality and time to discharge in subjects with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone but not among those receiving no respiratory support [10] . Anticoagulants, such as heparin, are used to prevent the coagulopathy with severe COVID-19, and it has been suggested that low molecular weight heparin reduces mortality in subjects with severe COVID-19 and coagulopathy [11] . To test whether the use of dexamethasone and/or anticoagulants affects the findings with remdesivir, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir need to be undertaken in the presence of dexamethasone and/or anticoagulants.In addition to dexamethasone, other medicines may have the potential for the treatment of severe COVID-19. The SOLIDARITY open-label clinical trial was launched by the WHO to compare chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, or interferon beta-1a with local standard of care in subjects hospitalized COVID-19. The chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir arms were stopped when the International Steering Committee recommended this, as interim results showed little or no reduction in mortality in COVID-19 with either of these combinations [12] . The exclusion of lopinavir/ritonavir from SOLIDARITY is supported by the LOTUS China (the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China) trial in hospitalized subjects with COVID-19, which showed no benefits but increased gastrointestinal adverse effects [13] .Remdesivir is included in SOLIDARITY because it 'generated promising results in animal studies for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) … ' [14] . One of the limitations of the SOLIDARITY trial is that it is open label, making it difficult to obtain conclusive results.Tocilizumab is not included in the SOLIDARITY trial. In a preliminary trial tocilizumab, which is monoclonal antibody, directed against the interleukin-6 receptor, was shown to possibly reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [15] . Thus, perhaps, tocilizumab should be added to the SOLIDARITY trial, and needs further testing in severe COVID-19.The ordinal scales used for severe COVID-19 in the SIMPLE trial [1] , the ACTT1 trial [2] , and the Wuhan trial [8] with remdesivir are different, and this makes it difficult to compare the trials. Also, a 2-point improvement may occur more commonly on a 7-point scale [1, 2] than a 6-point scale [8] . It is suggested that a guideline be set for the ordinal scale to be used in severe COVID-19 to allow easier comparisons between trials.The ACTT1 trial is continuing, and the final data is eagerly awaited to determine whether remdesivir is a game-changing remedy or a medicine that has a borderline benefit (a ripple) in the treatment of COVID-19.","Australia","first author","2020-09-20",9

On 15 April 2020, the US CDC recommended the use of cloth face covering, especially in areas of significant community based transmission [4] . This was followed by the World Health Organization recommendation, on the 5 June, that masks can be used in community settings to protect oneself when in contact with an infected individual or for source control (worn by healthy and potentially asymptomatic individuals to prevent onward transmission) [6] . On the 22 July in Australia, the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Victoria led to mandatory wearing of masks in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire, which was enforced by the police through the issuing of fines [7] . This was quickly followed by companies across Australia recommending the use of masks for workers and customers [8] .Modeling studies support the use of masks in the community to prevent the spread of COVID-19 [3, 9] . Eikenberry et al. [3] used a hypothetical mask adoption model to demonstrate that if 80% of the community in New York wore masks in public, and the masks were 50% effective, this could prevent 17-45% of projected number of deaths. The same study found that even masks that are less effective could significantly reduce the number of deaths in areas with low transmission rates. For example, in Washington if 80% of the community wore masks that were only 20% effective this could still reduce the number of deaths by 24-65%.Despite the evidence from modeling studies that support guidelines for mask wearing in the community, this advice has received some backlash [10] . One of the main arguments against the use of face masks in community settings is the limited availability of medical masks and the need to triage supplies and ensure healthcare workers have adequate protection [4, 11] . For example, on Twitter at the beginning of the pandemic, the US Surgeon General urged people against buying masks for use by healthy people [9] . The need to triage the use of medical supplies has led to the emerging support for the use of fabric face masks [4, 6] . However, there is currently limited evidence available regarding the efficacy of fabric face masks to prevent respiratory infections [12] .This study used a standard method to evaluate the efficacy of currently available fabric face masks to filter a model virus compared with surgical and N95 masks. This information will inform best practice for fabric face mask design to protect against respiratory diseases and reduce community-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The viral filtration efficiency (VFE) of the masks tested in this study is presented in Table 1 . All the fabric masks had a VFE of at least 50% against aerosols with an average size of 6.0 µm (VFE (6.0 µm) ) and this improved to 63% against aerosols with an average size of 2.6 µm (VFE (2.6 µm) ), which represents the size of aerosols that can reach the lower respiratory system. The best performing of the fabric masks was the cotton fabric mask with a pocket that allowed a section of vacuum cleaner bag (VFE (6.0 µm) = 99.5%, VFE (2.6 µm) = 98.8%) or a dried baby wipe (VFE (6.0 µm) = 98.5%, VFE (2.6 µm) = 97.6%) to be inserted. Similarly effective, was the mask made from two layers of reusable shopping bag (nonwoven polypropylene) and one layer of cotton (according to Victorian DHHS guidelines) (VFE (6.0 µm) = 98.6%, VFE (2.6 µm) =99.1%), followed by the mask made with an outer layer of 100% hemp, a middle layer of poly membrane, and an organic cheesecloth inner (VFE (6.0 µm) = 93.6%, VFE (2.6 µm) = 89.0%). The VFE of the N95 (VFE (6.0 µm) = 99.9%, VFE (2.6 µm) = 99.3%) and surgical masks (VFE (6.0 µm) = 99.9% and 99.6%, VFE (2.6 µm) = 99.5% and 98.5%) were comparable to the bacterial filtration efficiency reported on their packaging. Made using the Victorian DHHS design [13] . Two layers of reusable shopping bag (nonwoven polypropylene) and one layer of cotton All masks were tested in triplicate except Fabric 1, which was tested in duplicate. The average aerosol size that the masks were tested against was 6.0 µm and the viral filtration efficiency was calculated using this aerosol size and then again with the larger aerosol excluded to give an average aerosol size of 2.6 µm to better represent the size of aerosols that reach the lower respiratory system. 1 Description information was collected from the mask packaging or seller website. 2 Bacterial filtration efficiency.Current recommendations regarding the wearing of fabric masks to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has elicited much debate [10] . Concerns have been raised regarding the lack of evidence on the efficacy of fabric masks and the potential risks, such as a false sense of security which may lead to a disregard of social distancing measures, contamination through adjusting and touching with contaminated hands, and improper fit [10, 14, 15] .This study showed that fabric masks currently available for purchase had a minimum viral filtration efficiency of 50%. This was significantly enhanced through the use of a section of a vacuum cleaner bag or a baby wipe as a substitute for a pocket filter. There were also two designs with three layers of different fabrics (Fabric 6 and Fabric 3) which performed exceptionally well with VFE above 90%. This finding supports the recommendations from The World Health Organization on making your own fabric masks [6] .The results from this study are supported by other studies that have assessed the ability of fabric masks to filter particles. A study on the filtration efficiency of various fabrics found that the removal efficiency when one layer of fabric was used range from 5% to 80% and 5% to 95% for particle sizes of <300 and >300 nm, respectively. However, this was significantly improved when multiple layers of Pathogens 2020, 9, 762 4 of 8 different combinations of fabric were used. For example cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, cotton-flannel fabric combination filtered more than 80% of particles <300 nm and >90% of particles >300 nm [16] . Another study conducted in Taiwan recruited volunteers with confirmed influenza A and B and suspected COVID-19 and asked them to wear a medical mask or a three-layer cotton mask in a bedroom or a car. The authors then measured the particles (with a size range of 20-1000 nm) located within 1 m of the individual for 1 h and found no significant difference in the particles produced from coughing or sneezing between the participants wearing cotton masks and those wearing medical masks.One limitation of this study is that it does not take into consideration the fit of the mask. Future research is needed to examine this issue to inform the design and fit of fabric, as Konda et al. [16] demonstrated that gaps due to improper fit of a fabric mask can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency. Another limitation is that the standard method used in this study challenges masks with the viruses traveling at the flow velocity associated with breathing. Coughing and sneezing result in faster flow velocities which could affect the viral filtration efficiency [17] .There is also the need for education campaigns aimed at informing individuals on how to wear fabric masks. This should include details on the best design and importance of good fit. There should also be advice on proper usage, including how to don and doff face masks, the importance of not touching masks to prevent self-contamination, and the need to wash masks in >60 • C water with soap or laundry detergent [6] . However, given the success of current handwashing and social distancing campaigns, mass education on the face usage of mask is possible [1] .Fabric face masks were purchased from five Etsy retailers (www.etsy.com.au) based in Australia and chosen at random. Five different types of fabric face masks were selected to best represent the most common types of fabric masks currently available for purchase. One of the selected face masks was designed with a pocket for a filter; however, given that there are limited filters available a dried baby wipe and a section of a vacuum cleaner bag were tested instead of a mask filter. A final fabric face mask was also made in accordance with the design provided by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services [13] . For comparison with the fabric face masks, two different types of surgical masks, a disposable face mask and an N95 mask were also purchased in Australia. The masks tested in this study and shown in Figure 1 and descriptions are included in Table 1 . Three of each of the different types of masks were tested.Each mask was conditioned for a minimum of 4 h at a temperature of 21 ± 5 • C and relative humidity of 85% ± 10% prior to testing.was designed with a pocket for a filter; however, given that there are limited filters available a dried baby wipe and a section of a vacuum cleaner bag were tested instead of a mask filter.

The bottom layer (of the tryptone soya agar (TSA) Escherichia coli agar plates) consisted of TSA (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) and the top layer consisted of 4.5 mL of soft TSA mixed with 500 µ L of overnight E. coli (ATCC 700891) culture (which had been incubated overnight at 37 ℃ in typtone soya broth (Oxoid)) and 200 µ L of freeze thawed MS2 bacteriophage solution. The plates were then incubated overnight at 37 ℃. The plaques were harvested in peptone water (Oxoid) and purified by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min to separate the host cell debris and the bacteriophage. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm Millex-GP Syringe Filter Unit (Millipore, catalog number SLGP033RS, Tullagreen, Cork Ireland) and used as a stock solution.

However, the method was modified, and S. aureus was replaced with bacteriophage MS2 as the test specimen. This modification was made as S. aureus has a diameter of ≈1 μm [19] , which is roughly 12 times larger than the SARS-CoV-2 virion (70-90 nm in diameter [20] ).

Positive control runs were performed in triplicate without a mask clamped into the test system to determine the number of viable MS2 aerosols being generated. Negative control runs were performed in triplicate by collecting a 2 min samples of air from the aerosol chamber without the MS2. The average aerosol size was 6.0 µm, which is within the size range of aerosols produced by coughing (0.62-15.9 µm) [23] . Viral filtration efficiency (VFE) was calculated by comparing the average positive hole corrected PFU of MS2 captured after the mask compared with the positive control. The VFE for each mask was also calculated with the larger aerosol removed to provide an average aerosol size of 2.6 µm, which better represents the size of inhaled aerosol that reaches the lower respiratory system and alveolar region (<3 µm) [24] .This study demonstrated that typically available fabric masks have at least a 50% viral filtration efficiency and this can be increased through the use of everyday items (vacuum cleaner bag and baby wipes) as an alternative to a disposable pocket filter or through designing fabric masks to have three layers of different fabrics. This research supports the use of fabric masks in community settings to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Future research is needed to investigate fabric mask designs that allow the best fit, examine the influence of different flow velocities, and determine the availability and costs of materials needed to make efficient masks. Additional substitutes to filters should be tested to ensure there is global access to the supplies needed to produce effective masks and reduce the spread of SAR-CoV-2.

In Hong Kong, the SARS outbreak exposed deficiencies in medical students' PPE skills, which prompted changes in undergraduate IPC education [13] .Practical PPE skills are not always formally assessed at undergraduate level [11] and are often learnt via role modelling during clinical placements. The hidden curriculum therefore plays an important role in the clinical learning environment [14] . In relation to PPE use, interns may be influenced by the PPE practices of their role modelssenior registrars and consultantswhich can be suboptimal [15] . An understanding of the intern's experiences and knowledge of the use of PPE at the beginning of their careers can help to inform undergraduate training and identify opportunities to enhance their skills in the clinical context.Previous studies have used qualitative methods to investigate the influence of informal and hidden curricula in medical education [16, 17] ; others have used selfreported surveys or observation [18, 19] -often focused on hand hygiene -to examine IPC knowledge and behaviours of medical students or junior doctors. In this qualitative study, we drew on discussions from reflexive focus groups to explore interns' experience and behaviours related to the use of PPE. In this paper we report our analysis of these discussions.This study was undertaken in 2018 at a large tertiarycare teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. This paper describes part of a larger study of medical interns' previous experiences of personal protective equipment (PPE) training and use, including an evaluation of the likely efficacy and acceptability of video-reflexive methods for training.Video-reflexive methods are derived from videoreflexive ethnography, a research methodology involving the videoing of everyday clinical work and showing the footage back to those videoed in guided reflexive groups to engender learning and change through collaborative and reflexive discussion [20] . We adapted video-reflexive methods for PPE training, by videoing medical interns during a practical PPE session (putting on and removing a full set of PPE), and showing them their footage during reflexive groups. The primary aim of this study was to compare the learning outcomes of interns who experienced the video-reflexive training, with those of a control group who experienced the same PPE training, but without the video component. Results of this study are in preparation.All participants were engaged in reflexive group discussion following a PPE lecture and practice session. The only difference between the videoed and control groups was that the former were able to watch the footage of their own practical session during reflexive discussions. Consistent with the video-reflexive principle of foregrounding the complexity of everyday practice [20] , both groups were asked open-ended questions about their experiences of PPE use prior to training, to understand their usual practices and contextualise what they had just learnt during training.In this paper, we describe medical interns' selfreported experiences of PPE use at the beginning of their internship, and explore the implications for future PPE training. The study was approved by the human research ethics committee of the relevant Local Health District.Graduates of the 4 year postgraduate Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme at the Sydney Medical School (University of Sydney) are required to undertake an accredited internship to be eligible for registration as a medical practitioner. At our study site, new interns attend a 2-week hospital orientation which includes a 2 h session on IPC. The session involved a lecture and PPE practical session, which was the focus of this study.In January 2018, all graduates commencing their internship at the study site were approached during hospital orientation as a convenience sample for the study. This type of non-probability sampling uses a population that is easily available [21] . Interns were informed about the research in advance and by email, by the Director of Prevocational Education and Training, and provided with a participant information sheet. At the start of the IPC session, the researchers (SH, MW, RB and GLG) described the study, distributed participant information sheets and consent forms and invited questions. After the lecture and immediately before the practical PPE session, researchers invited participants to opt in or out of the research, with reassurances that this would not affect their relationship with the hospital, none of their supervisors would know whether or not they had participated, and that those who did not participate would still receive the practical PPE session.Seventy two of the 90 interns invited to participate accepted (80% response). The fact that 20% of interns felt able to decline suggests that they felt no sense of coercion, although those who participated may have felt some obligation to conform with the majority.The four researchers who conducted the study are experienced in qualitative health research, and video-reflexive methods: they include two nurses with IPC expertise (RB, MW); an infectious diseases physician (GLG); and a social scientist (SH). The researchers were not employed by the hospital at the time of the study.After a lecture from the hospital's IPC department, including standard and transmission-based precautions and demonstration of the correct way to don and doff (put on and remove) PPE safely [22] , consenting interns were allocated (using alternate selection) to either a control or video group. Both groups practiced donning and doffing gloves, gown, mask and goggles, after which they participated in reflexive group discussions, with each discussion led by one or two researchers. The only difference between groups was that those who were videoed were shown footage of themselves donning and doffing PPE during the discussions.There were eight group discussions in total (four video and four control), each comprising 8-10 participants, and lasting 20-30 min per group. Discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed by an independent transcription service.Two researchers (RB and MW) conducted a thematic analysis of the data in two stages, beginning with immersion through repeated readings of the transcripts, identifying themes (patterns of meaning) [23] . NVivo software (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 12.6.0) was used to organise and code the data. The researchers (RB and MW) then matched these themes, independently, using the COM-B model [23] as a framework. The COM-B model is linked with the behaviour change wheel, allowing for analysis of determinants of current and desired PPE behaviour and identification of interventions that could affect behaviour change.Participants' statements about recent and prior PPE training and use were coded into the following behavioural conditions for appropriate PPE use in clinical practice: capability (knowledge and skills), opportunity (structural and environmental factors) and motivation (attitudes, habits, and decision-making). In this context, examples of capability include knowledge of when to use PPE, and skills and self-efficacy in donning and doffing PPE; examples of opportunity include access to PPE and social norms of the clinical unit; and examples of motivation include prompts for PPE use and the personal desire to protect oneself. Reliability of analysis was increased by comparing the coded data between the two researchers. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion. In this first stage of analysis, researchers searched for differences between video and control groups, but found similar themes between both groups. Therefore data were combined in the next stage of analysis.In the second stage of data analysis, the COM-B themes were re-examined to identify overarching themes that impacted on participants' PPE use in routine clinical practice. At this stage, a third, non-clinician researcher (SH), reviewed a sample of the transcripts against the codes and themes, to address any potential bias arising from the nurse researchers' clinical and IPC perspectives.Initial themes categorised using the COM-B framework can be seen in Table 1 .At the second stage of analysis, two overarching themes were developed to describe factors that were likely to impact on interns' safe and correct PPE use in clinical practice. These were: a) adequacy of prior knowledge and skills for practice; and b) using PPE in the real world. Within the COM-B framework, theme A corresponded with capability/motivation, and theme B with opportunity. Below, we describe these themes in more detail.This theme describes participants' comments on their PPE knowledge and education prior to the training received that day. All participants indicated that they had received basic education on the use of PPE at medical school, and some had received additional PPE education or training during clinical placement (e.g. several who had had placements in the operating theatres had been taught how to don sterile gloves and gown). This prior learning had provided some PPE knowledge and skills which, after their brief IPC/PPE orientation training, participants recognised had not necessarily been adequate for safe PPE use. They reported that preparation for medical school practical exams included an emphasis on hand hygiene before patient contact, so they automatically performed hand hygiene prior to donning PPE. However, although they were taught that PPE is important, correct methods of donning and doffing were not always demonstrated or explained. As one participant described it: ""We get told what to put on, but no one's been, like, this is how you put it on...""Until then, many participants had been unaware of the risks of self-contamination during doffing or the rationale for the doffing steps that were taught. For example, most participants had been unaware that a critical step in doffing PPE safely was to perform hand hygiene after the removal of gloves (because of the potential to contaminate their hands [22]), as the following quotes suggest:""I've never washed my hands right after taking off the gloves."" (P2, FG4) ""We didn't wash our hands after we took our gloves off."" (P1, FG6) Some participants had already developed incorrect and unsafe habits of PPE use. For example, some had previously tied their gowns at the frontwhere gown ties could become contaminated -and so risked contaminating their hands when doffing. One participant described their thoughts about the order of donning, during orientation PPE practice:""I was much more conscious of what I was doing, because when you're on the ward, you're just like, yeah, yeah, yeah... You think you're doing it automatically, but now you [need to] think in steps."" (P1, FG2)Participants also recognised that their lack of understanding of correct donning and doffing of protective masks had led to unsafe mask use. For example, some had previously removed their masks upwards, over their face and hair, potentially contaminating themselves:""But yes, I didn't realise that it was much safer to pull [the mask] … downwards."" (P4, FG1)There was also a notable knowledge gap in the use of eye protection, with many participants erroneously having believed that their own spectacles were an acceptable alternative to protective eyewear:""I would have my glasses on as well, so I would be like, I'm good."" (P6, FG3)For several participants, aspects of their PPE behaviour had been learnt in operating theatres, during surgical placements, which subsequently influenced their use of PPE in the wards. At orientation and during this study, PPE removal was taught according to current Australian guidelines [22], namely: remove gloves first, followed by hand hygiene, then remove eye protection, gown and mask (in that order). However, participants noted that, during the study, they had made a habit of removing their masks first, due to their experience in theatre:""I think it's just habitual [to remove the mask first]… when you're going into theatre, you put the mask on then the scrubs…"" (P4, FG5) Also, many participants noted that they instinctively removed gown and gloves together in one motion as they had been taught to do in theatre: Participants frequently referred to the differences between 'real-life' PPE use and how it was demonstrated at orientation. Factors contributing to these differences included the physical environment and resources, the behavioural norms of the clinical area where they worked and the expectations of their roles as junior doctors. As taught in orientation training, the first step in donning PPE is to remove jewellery to allow for effective cleaning of hands and arms below the elbow. Participants described different approaches to this step across different clinical settings:""Obviously in surgery, you don't have [jewellery] in surgical scrubs, but on the ward, everyone wears their watches and rings and stuff."" (P5, FG2)Conversley one participant described their experience working in a hospital where there was a strong emphasis on bare below the elbows:""Because at my hospital, they're very diligent in making sure that below the elbows had to be, like, nothing, literally, … so that's why a lot of us now are used to not wearing watches."" (P4, FG3)A commonly cited reason for non-compliance with removing jewellery on the ward was a requirement to use a watch for patient examination. There was also the practical barrier of finding a suitable, safe place for it when removed:""I actually physically take everything off, you know, and sit it on the sink. And hope that it's still there when I go back."" (P1, FG5) ""[Removing jewellery is] difficult on a ward where you're going to lose your watch, yeah."" (P2, FG5)Another environmental barrier that impacted on PPE behaviour was the variability and availability of some PPE items in clinical areas. Different gowns and masks were available in different clinical settings, so could be unfamiliar. Participants particularly noted that goggles or protective eyewear were difficult to locate in wards and even when eye protection was available, it was not always suitable:""None of these goggles fit over my glasses."" (P1, FG4)One participant had addressed this problem by purchasing their own protective eyewear with prescriptive lenses. As medical students, participants had come to accept, as ""normal"", that certain PPE items were never available on wards and, even if they were, they were rarely used anyway:""I don't … usually find [protective eyewear] on the wards and most times when we do, everyone just wears the mask and gloves and gown, no-one wears goggles."" (P6, FG7)Participants identified that senior doctors are looked to as role models, but may not always model best practice, as described by the following participant:""When you're a student who's a bit less experienced, you're just following what the rest of the team is doing and basing it off that… [but] they're not often the best models to follow."" (P1, FG1)Frequently, as the most junior member of the team, the intern was often required to remain outside of the room during ward rounds, to write in the patient notes, which limited opportunities to practice donning and doffing skills. They also identified time pressure during ward rounds as a challenge to optimal PPE use, describing a lack of time for all team members to correctly don PPE:""I was in a rush doing ward rounds, so I just followed suit."" (P1, FG3)""When you're on wards you're definitely pressured to do it faster because you want to go in. Whereas today [during the training] I was like, oh, I've got all the time in the world to go in and do it correctly."" (P3, FG6)This paper reports on reflexive group discussions conducted as part of a larger study, to investigate interns' knowledge and experiences of the use of routine PPE at the start of their internship. We report on two overarching themes from our data which describe likely influences on interns' safe and correct PPE use, namely a) interns' previous knowledge and skills in PPE use (capability and motivation) and b) how real-life clinical contexts affect their PPE use (opportunity). Participants' comments suggest that different and multiple approaches to learning are needed. Classroom education needs to include more detailed explanation of the logic of PPE use, for standard and transmission-based precautions. In addition, greater emphasis on practical and reflective learning in situ is required during student placements, to ensure that interns can practice IPC safely once qualified.The first theme illustrated discrepancies and gaps between correct PPE use and junior doctors' behaviours, learnt during undergraduate placements. It showed a potential for personal risk to the clinician, if incorrect PPE was used or it was put on or taken off incorrectly. An important finding, not previously described, was that the habit of removing gown and gloves together, in one action, in the theatre environment, impacted on PPE behaviour during routine care. However, in consultation with the IPC team, we reasoned that the risk of selfcontamination was no different between the method used in theatre and doffing gown and gloves separately (as per policy for routine care). Furthermore, this method is endorsed by the US Centers for Disease Control [24] . Another potential occupational risk, identified by participants, was that they rarely used goggles, safety glasses or visors and several mistakenly believed that their own glasses would protect their eyes from splash. This is a common misconception, as reported previously [25] , consistent with previous reports of low rates (27-40%) of compliance with eye protection by medical staff [6] and reflected in the fact that they were often unavailable in the wards. However, eye protection over and above prescription glasses is still needed, when a risk of eye contamination with blood or respiratory secretions is anticipated, to prevent blood-borne [25] or respiratory viral infection [26] .In our study there was also a worrying knowledge deficit related to protective masks, which protect clinical staff from infections transmitted via respiratory droplets, such as influenza, meningococcal disease or via smaller aerosolised particles. For example, not all participants knew that they could be exposed to airborne infection such as pulmonary tuberculosis unless they wore a properly fitted particulate filter respirator (PFR). An understanding of appropriate facial protection has implications during emerging infectious disease outbreaks when transmission routes are unknown and both droplet (including eye protection) and airborne precautions (including PFR) may be required.The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater use of PFRs among healthcare workers than previously, and identified a need for more training in PPE skills [27] . The knowledge deficit identified in this study aligns with that of Peres et al. [28] , in which surveys of advanced medical students and junior doctors found that 59% of respondents had inadequate knowledge about PPE. Potential self-contamination, due to errors in PPE doffing, has been demonstrated in a number of studies which has implications for pathogen transmission not only to clinicians, themselves, but also to the environment and patients [29, 30] . The current COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the importance of correct PPE use to protect frontline workers [31] .Education and training designed for medical interns cannot assume that they arrive with an understanding of appropriate PPE principles and practice. Education and training programs should acknowledge and identify interns' prior misconceptions and inappropriate practice, in order to address and correct them. These findings provide some indication of what those misconceptions and inappropriate practices might include. Ideally, medical school curricula should also include this training, since clinical placements begin early in graduate medical programs.Several teaching methods have been used to bridge the gap between PPE theory and clinical practice, such as simulation and virtual reality [32, 33] . Video-reflexive ethnography has been more commonly used in research (and is necessarily based outside of the classroom), but has a track record in delivering practice change and improvements in IPC at the frontline [34, 35] . This is achieved through clinicians reflexively and collaboratively analysing video footage of their own practices. Our study tests an adaptation of video-reflexive methods, to improve the salience and sustainability of learning from classroom-based PPE training. Further adaptations of video-reflexive methods in classroom situations could be fruitful, particularly in combination with scenario-based simulation. However, as the second theme (discussed below) suggests, it may also be fruitful to incorporate more reflexive learning opportunities around PPE use during everyday clinical practice, with methods such as video-reflexive ethnography.The second theme (b) captured the challenges faced by junior doctors, if they attempt to use PPE appropriately when working in clinical areas. Other team members who use PPE incorrectly, if at all, make it difficult for junior doctors to do so safely. This concurs with Cresswell and Monrouxe's [36] finding that social pressures experienced by medical students and junior doctors are a barrier to optimal IPC practice. It illustrates the tension between what students learn in the classroom and are taught through the hidden curriculum in the clinical setting. Senior medical staff have a major influence on the use of PPE by junior medical staff, but there is a paucity of appropriate peer and/or senior role modelling [37] .However, frontline leadership can have a positive influence. Peponis et al [37] reported that real-time peer feedback significantly increased compliance with eye protection (from 25 to 44%, p = 0.0004) and protective masks (3 to 16%, p < 0.0001) by members of a trauma team. Others have shown leadership can improve hand hygiene compliance and central-line associated bacteraemia rates [38] .Our study also highlighted some of the practical challenges in implementing PPE policy in the clinical space. Participants described their being expected to scribe outside patients' room, on ward rounds, as a constraint on learning PPE skills. Another challenge was time pressure during ward rounds, as previously reported [39, 40] . There were also potential conflicts related to other clinical skills. For example, participants reported that they could not observe a 'no jewellery' rule when they needed to use their watches for clinical assessments. Consistent with findings from other studies [6, 7] , poor access to suitable PPE within clinical areas was an environmental barrier, contributing to lack of opportunity to develop appropriate skills. Unavailability of the correct sizes of gowns or masks increases the risk of self-contamination [25] .Application of the Behaviour Change Wheel [23] that accompanies the COM-B model would suggest that these barriers to ongoing skill maintenance and development would be more appropriately addressed by systemic organisational change, rather than relying on education or training. For instance, ensuring that appropriate PPE stocks are available, providing physical locations for staff to place items for temporary safekeeping, encouraging use of fob (rather than wrist-) watches for use in clinical assessment. Organisations also have a responsibility to ensure that senior medical staff fulfil their accepted professional responsibility to model appropriate clinical practice, including correct PPE use [41] . Nevertheless, we suggest that enabling reflexivityin-practice, using methods such as video-reflexive ethnography, may not only identify these issues, but also allow clinicians to devise creative and sustainable strategies to address them, as they have previously in similar acute care settings [34, 42] .One limitation of this study is that the findings are confined to the experiences and practices of one cohort of interns within one local health district. Another is that participants' comments may have been constrained by the group settingfor instance they may have refrained from describing experiences at odds with those expressed by fellow interns. They may also have refrained from sharing particular experiences or details specific to the medical profession with the non-medical (or non-clinical) researchers. However, the themes we identified were largely consistent with findings of previous studies, and are likely to be valid, if not necessarily complete. Exploring interns' preparedness for optimal PPE use in other institutions and at other times, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic and afterwards, may identify different issues regarding their skills, knowledge and clinical experiences.This study has identified gaps in the knowledge and skills of medical interns related to optimal use of PPE and highlighted missed opportunities in the clinical area to reinforce safe practice. Medical students sometimes learn sub-optimal PPE use by poor role models and leaders which, unless corrected, is likely to become habituated as their careers progress. Junior doctors are more likely to work autonomously and be less exposed to peer support for PPE use than nursing staff; they generally see more patients, as they move between different wards and departments and so are more likely to be unwitting vectors of pathogen transmission within a facility [43] .Education and training in IPC, including appropriate use of PPE, for new doctors is important to minimise transmission of infection and prevent occupationally acquired infectious disease. Although many organisations provide generic IPC education at orientation for all clinical staff, including interns, the content and delivery of this training may not target gaps in prior knowledge and poor habits developed through experiences of PPE use as medical students, and does not routinely recognise the informal and hidden curriculum in medical education. Educators should incorporate these factors into training and education, by promotion of appropriate use of PPE that is situated in the everyday contexts of medically-orientated routine care such as ward rounds, and provides opportunities to reinforce donning and doffing skills. Our findings also indicate that organisations should incorporate interventions to address the contextual opportunity barriers, that go beyond education and training, in order to improve appropriate PPE use by junior doctors, and thereby reduce the risks of healthcare-associated infections for patients as well as staff.Abbreviations PPE: Personal protective equipment; IPC: Infection prevention and control","Australia","abstract","2020-09-23",9
