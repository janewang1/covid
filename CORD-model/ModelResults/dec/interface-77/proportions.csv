To date, at least eight million people are infected by COVID-19 and over 400,000 have died, with most counties in Europe worst hit by the pandemic [2] . COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across Africa, and current data indicates 54 countries are affected [3] , with close to 200,000 people infected and deaths exceeding 4,000 [2] . Uganda, one of the countries in east Africa, reported its first case of COVID-19 on March 21, 2020, from international travels, and since then, the number of new infections has risen to over 700 as of June 18, 2010 , largely driven by truck drivers from her neighboring countries [4] .Coronavirus is transmitted from person-to-person through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes [5] [6] [7] . Infected persons present with mild to moderate symptoms but are able to recover even without treatment [7] . The common symptoms include fever, tiredness, dry cough, shortness of breath, body aches and pains, and sore throat, and very few people present with diarrhoea, nausea, and running nose [7, 8] . Factors like old age and comorbidities, namely, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer, are associated with poor prognosis [7] . Without effective treatment and vaccine [9] , the world is left with a single option thus strict adherence to public health preventive measures: regular handwashing using soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, social distancing (maintaining a distance of at least two meters), not touching the face, covering the nose and mouth with tissue when coughing or sneezing, staying at home if feeling unwell, wearing of face masks, and prompt seeking of medical care when one has suggestive symptoms [7, 9, 10] .These measures have been popularized and supported by the WHO, governments, and Ministries of Health globally. To that effect, guidance and policies and presidential directives have been issued.In Uganda, several communication channels are used to reach the population with preventive messages about COVID-19, including presidential directives. This is aimed at improving people's knowledge about COVID-19, changing their attitudes towards adopting public health preventive measures, and improving their adherence to practicing public health preventive measures. However, data are limited regarding people's knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes towards presidential directives and Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines, and practices of public health preventive measures (KAP). Second, anecdotal observations indicate that males are less adherent to practicing public health preventive measures about COVID-19 compared to females, suggesting possible deficiency in knowledge about COVID-19 and perhaps negative attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines. However, evidence to support this observation is nonexistent. We therefore conducted a national study to primarily assess knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes towards presidential directives and Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines, and adherence to practicing public health preventive measures (KAP) among Ugandans aged ≥ 18 years. Our secondary objective was to determine whether there are differences in KAP between males and females. We hypothesized that there is a difference in KAP according to sex. Our findings will inform the design of effective public health preventive measures so as to halt the spread of COVID-19. [11] . Uganda is made up of 134 districts and 6,937 health facilities, of which 3,133 are government owned.The distribution of health facilities is as follows: five national referral hospitals, 14 regional referral hospitals, 169 general hospitals, 194 health center (HC) IVs (a county level of health facility), and the rest are HC IIIs (subcounty level of health facilities) and HC IIs (parish level health facilities). There are five super specialized hospitals and two specialized institutes, the Uganda Heart Institute and Uganda Cancer Institute [12] .We conducted a crosssectional study and the findings are reported in accordance to the guidelines of Strengthening of the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) [13, 14] . The study population consisted of Ugandans aged ≥ 18 years with access to online platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram among others. Using Yamane's formula, 2.5% sampling error, and the number of people aged ≥ 18 years with access to internet services, we determined that 1,598 people would be needed. We approached 419 participants but 86.4% (n = 362) accepted to participate in the survey. Although online surveys are associated with low response rate, daily payments for over-the-top tax (OTT, a social media tax for online services) in order to access social media platforms and lockdown during the survey period led to restricted access to mobile data, and this was worsened by the closure of internet shops, and difficulties in accessing internet services in remote settings all contributed to the low sample size.Due to approximately three months of lockdown and restricted movements to minimize the spread of COVID-19, community-based national survey was not logistically feasible. Data were therefore collected between April 28 and May 19, 2020, using KoboToolbox, an online software that enabled the uploading of questionnaire online.We utilized WhatsApp groups, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, websites, and official accounts (Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter) of local popular media outlets, which are the available online platforms in the country for data collection and to achieve maximum coverage. We repeatedly provided reminders after every 2 days to improve participant response rate. The questionnaire had questions about KAP and was developed using the Uganda MoH and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on prevention of COVID-19. To arouse participants' interest in taking the survey, we developed one-page recruitment poster with a link to the online questionnaire that contained brief information about the study objectives, importance, and ethical concerns. Once the poster was filled and the individual was eligible, access to the questionnaire was automated.We collected data on participants' age measured in years and later categorized into several age groups, namely, 18-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, and ≥45 years; sex measured as male or female; marital status measured as never married/single or married/staying with partner; level of education measured as none/never received formal education, primary, secondary, and tertiary/university education; current occupation measured as unemployed, self-employed, and formal employment; religion measured as Anglican, Catholic, Muslim, Pentecostal, and others (Seventh day Adventists (SDA), Jehovah Witness, Orthodox, Hindu, Humanist, and Bahai); district of residence that consisted of the 134 districts in Uganda, and participant residence measured as urban/periurban or rural. We categorized the districts of residence into 5 regions: central, eastern, Kampala, northern, and western.We assessed the knowledge scores using 16-item Likert scale questions coded 1-3 to denote true, false, and do not know. The 16 questions were about the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, transmission, mode of spread, prevention, and treatment. For attitude scores, we used five questions, each scored on a scale of 1-5, with the lowest score being strongly disagree and the highest as strongly agree. The five questions focused on the WHO and Uganda MoH guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19, presidential directives, effectiveness of preventive measures that are in use, an assessment of the success of preventive measures, and adequacy of different communication channels.We used 10 questions with measurements on binary scale (yes or no) to measure practices of public health preventive measures. The questions focused on the frequency of handwashing, staying at home for at least five hours, wearing of gloves and masks whenever leaving home, avoidance of handshaking and crowded places, and promptness in seeking treatment in the event of signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and notification of relevant authorities like the local council system, police, and health authorities.To determine the appropriateness, logical flow, and consistency of questions in the questionnaire, we conducted an online pretest in the neighboring country, Kenya. The respondents provided comments on the logical flow, understanding, and relevance of the questions. We used the comments to revise and to develop the final questionnaire. During data collection, we integrated quality control measures to ensure participation of eligible individuals only. We also used a unique password to protect filled questionnaires and restrict data access to the data analyst. We used VeraCrypt, an open source encryption software, to share data among the research team for the purposes of validation. At data analysis stage, we checked for data consistency, cleaned, and transformed variables.We descriptively summarized categorical data using frequencies and percentages and numerical data using means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). For KAP studies, Bloom recommends the following cutoff points: (1) 80-100% for high knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice; (2) 60-79% for moderate knowledge, neutral attitude, and fair practice; and (3) less or equals 59% for low knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practice [15, 16] . In this KAP study, we used a cutoff of 75%, which was a modification of the Bloom's cutoff point.Accordingly, we considered participants with scores ≥ 75 % as knowledgeable about COVID-19, having positive attitude towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and adherent to public health preventive measures. Conversely, participants with scores < 75% were considered nonknowledgeable about COVID-19, having negative attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and nonadherent to public health preventive measures. We tested median differences in KAP scores with respect to sex using the two sample Wilcoxon's test at bivariate analysis. Furthermore, we assessed differences in proportions of KAP using the chi-square test for large cell counts (typically ≥5) and the Fisher's exact test for smaller cell counts (typically <5).Variables with two-sided probability values less than 5% (p < 0:05) at bivariate analysis and those deemed biologically plausible for differences in KAP between males and females, namely, level of education, residence, and employment status were considered significant for multivariable analysis. We did not use binary logistic regression analysis because the outcomes were large and the use of odds ratio (OR) would overestimate the degree of association. Accordingly, prevalence risk ratios (PRs) were computed using a modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors to control for mild violations of the assumptions [17] [18] [19] . We reported each PR with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). This analysis was performed in Stata version 15 [20] .2.6. Ethical Considerations. We obtained informed consent using an informed consent form (ICF) attached to the online questionnaire. We ensured that the questionnaire was inaccessible without filling the ICF that described the potential benefits and risks and rationale for the survey. The ICF mentioned that participation was voluntary, and withdrawal was allowable at any stage. Ethical review and approval was obtained from the AIDS Support Organization Research Ethics Committee (TASO-REC), and reference number is TASOREC/032/2020-UG-REC-009.The mean age of the 362 participants was 33:5 ± 10:4 years, with a median age of 31 years (IQR: 18-75). 212 (58.6%) participants were males, another 212 (58.6%) were married or staying with the partner at the time of the survey, 270 (74.6%) had attained tertiary or university levels of education, 268 (74.0%) were rural residents, and 102 (28.2%) were residents of Kampala district. Furthermore, almost half of the participants (48.9%) had formal employment, and 43.9% were of the Catholic religion (Table 1) .Sources of Information about COVID-19 in Uganda. The predominant source of information was television (77.4%), and the least was the local council (LC) system at 11.0%. More males were reached with information via television than females: 80.7% versus 72.7%, p = 0:073. 265 (73.2%) reported the social media as the commonest source of information, with more males having access (76.9%) compared to females (68.0%), p = 0:060. 280 (68.5%) reported the radio, with many of them being males than females: 70.3% versus 66.0%, p = 0:389. 161 (44.5%) reported short messaging signals (SMS), with 101 (47.6%) being males and 60 (40.0%) females, p = 0:150. The other sources of information are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.Characteristics. We found no differences in proportion of knowledge about COVID-19 with respect to sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, only half of the respondents (51.3%) had positive attitudes towards the presidential directives and MoH guidelines.Most participants with positive attitudes about the presidential directives and MoH guidelines were aged ≥ 45 years (62.5%), female (51.8%), married or staying with the partner (52.3%), had reached at least primary level of education (73.3%), rural (58.4%) and Eastern residents (66.1%), respectively, self-employed (57.4%), and Catholics (56.9%) as shown in Table 2 . We observed statistically significant differences in proportion of positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines with respect to level of education (p = 0:019).Despite the high level of knowledge about COVID-19 among the participants, overall, less than half of the participants (48.3%) were adherent to practicing the MoH COVID-19 public health preventive measures ( Table 2) . Results further indicated that the most adherent participants were mainly aged ≥ 45 years (61.2%), female (56.0%), married or staying together (48.6%), had at least secondary level of education (71.4%), rural residents (50.0%), living in Western region (81.3%), self-employed (57.3%), and Anglicans (53.0%). Statistically significant differences in adherence to presidential directives and MoH guidelines were observed in sex (p = 0:014), level of education (p = 0:03), region (p < 0:001), and employment (p = 0:022). Elsewhere (supplementary tables), specific proportions of scores on knowledge about COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 2 ), attitudes towards directives and guidelines (Supplementary  Table 3 ), and practices of public health preventive measures (Supplementary Table 3 ) are summarized. Table 3 summarizes the median KAP scores. The median knowledge score was 13 (IQR: [12] [13] [14] . Although the average knowledge score was higher among males than females, the observed difference was not statistically significant: 13 (IQR: 12-14) versus 13 (IQR: 12-13), p = 0:258. The median attitude score was 22 (IQR: 19-24). Again, there was no statistically significant difference in attitude scores between males and females: 22 (IQR: 19-24) versus 22 (IQR: 19-24), p = 0:583. The median practice score was 7 (IQR: 7-8), with no statistically significant differences between males and females: 7 (IQR: 7-8) versus 8 (IQR: 7-9), p = 0:095.Females. In the unadjusted analysis (Table 4 ), compared to males, females were more likely to have positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines (PR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82-1.25) and more adherent to practicing recommended public health preventive measures (PR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.06-1.61). In the adjusted analysis, results showed that This is the first national cross-sectional survey to assess knowledge of Ugandans about COVID-19, their attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and adherence to practicing public health preventive measures. Our data shows that approximately 94% of Ugandans are knowledgeable about COVID-19, and almost 50% had positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and less than one in every two are adherent to practicing the recommended public health preventive measures. Most participants knew the main symptoms of COVID-19, mode of transmission, high-risk groups and that there is no effective treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, the importance of supportive treatment, and public health preventive measures, namely, handwashing, personal respiratory hygiene, wearing of masks in public, and isolation areas. Our findings are in agreement with studies conducted in Iran, Tanzania, Paraguay, Malaysia, and China that all show high knowledge scores regarding COVID-19 [21] [22] [23] . Nonetheless, our findings differ from studies conducted in Bangladesh and Malaysia that show an overall low knowledge score [24, 25] . Although we are not certain about the implementation of public health preventive approaches in those countries with low knowledge scores, in Uganda, the dissemination of public health messages trickles up to the lowest administrative level. This might explain the high knowledge scores observed in the study. We found no difference in knowledge scores by sociodemographic characteristics, namely, sex, age, education, and residence among others, contrary to findings in Bangladesh [25] , Tanzania [21] , and Iran [22] , possibly due to constant presidential directives and widespread dissemination of MoH guidelines.The main sources of information about COVID-19 included televisions, social media, radios, and short text messages signals (SMS), perhaps because most of the participants were urban residents, literate, and had formal employment. COVID-19 information could have easily reached the participants via online media, television, and radio and MoH directed text messages.Our study shows that participants have trust in the presidential directives and MoH guidelines, with most reporting that the directives and guidelines are adequate and necessary to halt the spread of COVID-19. Besides, participants have confidence that the country is on course in winning the battle against COVID-19, which is similar to earlier findings in China [26] . This trust and confidence might have resulted from the numerous immediate steps like ban on international and regional travels, curfews, and lockdown among others that were implemented in the country to combat the spread of COVID-19 following the confirmation of the first case on March 21, 2019. However, the overall attitude towards the presidential directives and MoH guidelines is low, and this might translate to compromised adherence to practicing public health preventive measures, which might pose public health threat of community transmission of COVID-19. Our findings differ from studies conducted in China, Tanzania, Paraguay, and Iran that found high attitude scores [21, 23] . In our study, the attitude scores are different with respect to levels of education, which is similar to findings in Iran [22] .Our data show low adherence to public health preventive measures, which is not surprising because this study found low score on attitude towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines. Although our overall finding is contrary to earlier results in Iran [22] , the findings on specific practices were in agreement with several studies elsewhere [21, 23, 24] . Furthermore, our data show that adherence to recommended public health preventive measures significantly vary with respect to sex, level of education, age, region, and employment status, which is consistent with a study in Iran [22] . In particular, our study shows that females are more adherent to public health preventive measures than males, suggesting sex-specific measures might be useful in promoting adherence to public health preventive measures and consequently in combatting the spread of COVID-19 in the country.Limitations. This is the first study in Uganda to determine knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes Knowledge about COVID- 19 13 (12) (13) (14) 13 (12) (13) (14) 13 (12) (13) (14) 0.258 Attitude towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines 22 (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) 22 (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) 22 (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) 0.583 Practices public health preventive measures 7 (7-8) 7 (7-8) 8 (7-9) 0.095 Despite these strengths, there are numerous limitations that should be considered in the interpretation of the results. Our sample size was relatively small compared to what we had desired despite repeated posting of online survey questionnaires. This was not surprising because during the data collection period, the government of Uganda had instituted curfews, restricted movements to critical workers particularly security personnel and healthcare providers, and all shops that were selling nonfood items where potential participants would buy airtime in order to have mobile data to enable filling of the questionnaire were closed. Second, since payment of OTT is compulsory in the country, this might have been a deterrent factor in accessing social media platforms, our main data collection channel. Moreover, we did not provide financial support to encourage data access to the social media platforms used for data collection. Therefore, our responses are limited to those who were able to pay in order to access these platforms. However, the data on KAP were uniformly distributed suggesting that the present sample size is sufficient for statistical inference. Since this was a cross-sectional study, our findings demonstrate an association and with no temporal relationship. Our study had more residents from urban areas and Kampala region and people with relatively high levels of education. The findings might not therefore reflect KAP scores in rural areas and among the illiterate subgroups of the population. However, we attempted to minimize this limitation through adjusted analysis. Even with adjusted analysis, we acknowledge that residual confounding is possible. Also, since practice of public health preventive measures was a self-reported outcome, social desirability bias remains a possibility.Lastly, we did not study several factors which contribute to differences in KAP between males and females such as sources, access, frequency and intensity of exposure to health information including cultural differences among others. We recommend that prospective studies should consider these factors.Our data show a high proportion of knowledge about COVID-19 and relatively low positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines as well as low adherence to practices of public health preventive measures. We observed sex differences in practicing the recommended public health preventive measures, with females being more dominant than males. We found no sex differences in knowledge about COVID-19 and attitudes towards presidential directives and MOH guidelines. We conclude that the current public health preventive efforts should be directed towards closing the identified gaps in KAP. This will help to halt the spread of COVID-19 in Uganda and the East African region.The data used/analyzed in this study are available on reasonable request from the corresponding author.The authors declare that they do not have any competing interests.","Uganda","abstract","2020-12-04",12

The results of this research were used only in scientific purposes and not in any other aims.Ethical approval wasn't applicable when we started our research in May 2020 due to current situation of coronavirus crisis.This prospective study included 30 patients (21 males, 9 females) with age range from 25 to 65 years (mean age of 34.2 years) confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, referred for MSCT assessment of the chest ( Table 1) . MSCT of the chest was done to all patients as requested. The study was conducted between first of May and July 12, 2020, in Cairo, Egypt.Laboratory proven PCR positive COVID-19 patients with faint ground glass opacities in MSCT chest.Patient's CT showing consolidative patches.Patients who recently experienced clinically defined pulmonary infection attributable to other pathogens.Patients with severe artifacts on CT images.All enrolled patients were subjected to:❖ Through history taking. ❖ Laboratory assessment (patients with positive PCR test).• Computed tomography (CT) of the chest:• CT scan chest was done to all patients using 64 channels MSCT. The detailed parameters for CT acquisition were as follows: -Tube voltage, 120-160 kVp.-tube current, standard (reference mAs, 60-120) -Slice thickness, 1.0 mm. -Reconstruction interval, 1.0-3.0 mm -Using a sharp reconstruction algorithm.-CT images were obtained with the patient in the supine position with suspended full inspiration and without contrast medium (Table 1) -All images were viewed on both lung (width, 1500 HU; level, − 700 HU) and mediastinal (width, 350 HU; level, 40 HU) settings.• VR (3 colors, 3D volume rendering lung images): -The images acquired were sent to a separate workstation and using certain DICOM viewer to be processed, manipulated.-Threshold limits of -500 to -1024 HU were applied to exclude soft tissue surrounding the lung and large vessels within the lung -Selecting lung density analysis preset, the lungs are automatically segmented from chest wall, mediastinum, airways and vessels.-This software and Dicom viewer automatically analyses the density distribution of the lungs into different colors by using color mask tool, by entering the density range, selecting the desired color, which indicates the area that the HU ranges occupy in the image.-Normally aerated (%NAL, − 501, − 900 HU) and the value range of − 750 HU to − 300 HU and − 300 HU to 50 HU was defined as GGO and consolidation, respectively [5] • The chest CT scan was evaluated by two expert radiologist separately searching for the faint ground glass opacities in axial lung window images as well as color coded images. • Semi-quantitative method depends on measuring HU unit of the lesion as well as it relays on the color coded image assessment while the quantitative method is an objective method that depend only upon HU values calculation.Owing to small sample size, findings are presented as medians and interquartile ranges.This cross section study included 30 patients (21 males, 9 females) with age range from 25 to 65 years (mean age of 34.2 years) confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR test. MSCT of the chest was performed to all patients and processed in a separate work station and certain DICOM viewer.All patients had history of direct or indirect contact with COVID-19 infected people. The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 6-8 days. The common first symptoms were fever seen in 23 patients (77.4%), dry cough in 18 patients (60%), while 10 patients (33.3%) presented with dyspnea.The most imminent radiological finding was ground glass opacity seen in 26 patients (86.6%) were detected by both visual and color coded images, while in 4 patients (13.3%) the GGO were very faint and were only visualized by color coded images and confirmed by CT density assessment. The size of the lesions ranged in diameter from 1 to 3 cm. 24 patients showed lower zone predominance ( 80%), 4 patients showed equal distribution between the upper and lower zones ( 13.3%) and two patients showed upper zone predominant changes ( 6.6%) ( Table 2) .The faint ground-glass opacities were peripheral in most patients 28 (93.3%), while 2 patients showed both peripheral & peri-hilar distribution (6.6%) ( Table 2 ).The crisis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently attracted the attention all over the world. (COVID-19) , is a highly infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [6] .Currently, there are no validated anti-viral medications or other specific therapies targeted toward the treatment of COVID-19. Management of this disease is symptomatic and, more importantly, focused on public health measures which slow the spread of disease, an epidemiological concept referred to as ""flattening the curve"" [7] . Therefore, early recognition of patients with COVID-19 (radiologic or otherwise) is critical in order to isolate these cases and prevent additional infection [8] .Computed tomography (CT) is an important and essential method for the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of COVID-19 as well as monitoring disease progression and evaluating the therapeutic efficiency [9] .Quantitative imaging analysis (QIA), which allows for precise identification of lung tissue density by Hounsfield units (HU), can help differentiate otherwise subtle radiographic diagnoses (Fig. 1) [10] .This cross section study included 30 patients (21 males, 9 females) with male predominance 70%. Age range from 25 to 65 years (mean age of 34.2 years). All patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR test.MSCT of the chest was done to all patients as requested & the acquired images were sent to a separate workstation using certain DICOM viewer to be processed & manipulated. The study was conducted between first of May and July 12, 2020, in Cairo, Egypt.The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 6-8 days. The common first symptoms were fever seen in 23 patients ( 77.4%), dry cough in 18 patients ( 60%), while 10 patients ( 33.3%) presented with dyspnea which agrees with study done by Dong Sun, et al. [11] .In our study we noted, ground-glass opacity (GGO) is the main CT findings in patients with mild/early COVID-19 and was seen in 26 patients (86.6%) & it was essentially associated with the course and severity of the disease which agrees with the study done by and Feng Z et al. [12] .The detection and recognition of GGO is based on a subjective assessment of lung attenuation at CT, therefore, CT should be performed within objective parameters that make lesion depiction reliable and reproducible ( Fig. 2) [13] .GGOs may not always be obvious on CT images, and they may be missed. The recognition of GGO is based on a subjective assessment of lung attenuation at CT (Fig. 3) [14] .In the present study, ground glass opacity seen in 26 patients (86.6%) were detected by both visual and color coded images, while in 4 patients (13.3%) the GGO were very faint and were only visualized by color coded images and confirmed by CT density assessment (Fig. 4) .The size of the lesions ranged in diameter from 1 cm-3 cm. and that goes with study of Dong Sun, et al. that showed correlation between size of lesion and severity of symptoms [11] .The early identification of patients and assessment of the severity of COVID-19 may guide clinical treatment options and reduce the mortality rate. In the present study, a using both visual and color coded images helped in confirming diagnosis of mild/early cases of COVID-19 and that was confirmed by study done by Dong Sun, et al. (Fig. 5 ) [11] .In summary, this study revealed that the combined use of visual and color coded images enhance and improve the early detection of faint ground glass opacities seen in early COVID-19 affection which could help in improving the disease prognosis as well as limiting spread of this highly contagious disease. In absence of specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines for (COVID-19), the early identification of COVID-19 is of great value as it may guide clinical treatment options and reduce the mortality rate. GGO diagnosis remains a diagnostic challenge, Although CT represents a fundamental diagnostic tool because of its sensitivity, and it still needs to be integrated with clinical data to achieve the best clinical management.The combined use of visual and color coded images enhance and improve the early detection of faint ground glass opacities seen in early COVID-19 affection which could help in improving the disease prognosis as well as limiting spread of this highly contagious disease.

Egypt is one of the top 40 countries worldwide according to the total number of cases in August 2020 [2] .During the current epidemic in Egypt, computed tomography (CT) is used as the main diagnostic tool for early detection and management of COVID-19 pneumonia. Laboratory tests were the standard for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. However, sometimes, they are unavailable in an emergency, and the results are unavailable immediately [3, 4] .Chest CT has a 97% sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia after a mean interval of 5 days [3] . The typical chest CT findings in COVID-19 pneumonia are bilateral, peripheral, and basal predominant ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with or without consolidation and bronchovascular thickening [5] . In addition, atypical chest CT findings include central upper lobe predominance, masses, nodules, cavitations, tree-in-bud sign, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion [6] .Quantitative and semiquantitative indicators that evaluate the chest CT severity score (CT-SS) of lung inflammation in COVID-19 assess COVID-19 burden and provide an objective approach in rapidly identifying patients in need of hospital admission. The CT-SS is an adjustment of a method previously used in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to describe the extent of the disease in the lungs, which was correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters [7] .This study highlights the commonly encountered CT findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Egypt and the mean CT-SS and its correlation with the imaging findings.In this cross-sectional prospective study, 200 patients including 111 males (55.5%) and 89 females (44.5%) were enrolled in the period from June 30, 2020, to August 30, 2020. The male-to-female distribution was 1.2:1.All patients clinically diagnosed or suspected with COVID-19 underwent high-resolution CT/non-contrastenhanced multi-slice chest CT. Patients with chest CT findings suspicious of COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study (COVID-19 Reporting and Data System [CO-RADS] 4, 5, and 6). However, normal CT chest and those with any other chronic CT chest disease as of pulmonary edema and interstitial lung disease (CO-RADS 1, 2, or 3) were excluded from the study.All patients were subjected to full clinical data taking including age, sex, exposure history, clinical complaint, and laboratory parameters.PCR laboratory tests were performed for all patients before or after chest CT.All patients underwent non-contrast-enhanced chest CT in the radiology department using a Siemens 16channel scope (CTAWP92544; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). All volumetric chest CT were assessed at lung window of 1500 WW and − 500 WL and mediastinal window of 400 WW and 60 WL using 2D coronal and sagittal planes for better assessment of the extent of the disease.A radiologist with 15 years of experience in thoracic imaging performed the CT image analysis; the following parameters in each CT were assessed.The location and distribution of the disease were unilateral or bilateral; peripheral, central, or both; and upper lobe predominance, lower lobe predominance, or both.The CT chest findings were the presence of groundglass opacification; consolidation; special CT chest signs such as crazy-paving, halo, and reversed halo signs; spiderweb appearance; subpleural sparing; interlobular septal thickening; intralobular septal thickening; parenchymal band; subpleural band; cyst; nodule; vascular thickening; bronchial thickening; pleural thickening; pleural reaction; pleural effusion; and reactive lymph nodes (exceeding 1 cm in short-axis diameter).The level of suspicion of COVID-19 infection is graded: CO-RADS score [8]-CO-RADS 1: COVID-19 is highly unlikely, CT is normal, or there are findings indicating a noninfectious disease; CO-RADS 2: the level of suspicion of COVID-19 infection is low, and CT findings are consistent with other infections; CO-RADS 3: COVID-19 infection is unsure or indeterminate, and CT abnormalities indicate infection but are unsure whether COVID-19 is involved; CO-RADS 4: the level of suspicion is high, and most CT findings are suspicious but not extremely typical as unilateral groundglass, confluent, or multifocal consolidations without a typical location or any other typical findings; and CO-RADS 5: the level of suspicion is high with typical CT findings.A semiquantitative scoring system was used to quantitatively estimate the pulmonary involvement of all these abnormalities based on the area involved. The CT-SS was calculated based on the extent of lobar involvement. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0-5, with 0 indicating no involvement, 1 indicating less than 5% involvement, 2 indicating 5-25% involvement, 3 indicating 26-49% involvement, 4 indicating 50-75% involvement, and 5 indicating more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement) [9, 10] .The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 24; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used in the data manipulation and significance testing. Categorical data were expressed as numbers and percentages, whereas numerical data were summarized as medians. The patients were stratified into two groups according to their CT-SS: those with CT-SS of 1-17 were considered mild, whereas those with CT-SS of 18-25 were considered severe. The chi-square correlation analysis was conducted, and p values of < 0.1 were used to denote statistical significance. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A written informed consent was taken from all patients who participated in the study.This study involved 200 patients, including 111 males (55.5%) and 89 females (44.5%), with their ages ranging from 20 to 87 years (average age, 52.6 years).The mild group (CT-SS of 1-17) consisted of 180 patients, whereas the severe group (CT-SS of 18-25) was composed of 20 patients.The most affected age group was the 51-75-year age group (99 patients; 49.5%) followed by the 26-50-year age group (90 patients; 45%), then the < 25-year age group (six patients; 3%), and the > 75-year age group (five patients; 2.5%). Disease severity is significantly correlated with the 51-75 year age group (p = 0.033).The most presenting symptoms are displayed in Table 1 . Disease severity was significantly correlated with lower respiratory symptoms, in particular, cough, and the presence of chronic diseases.Chest CT findings were assessed and analyzed for all examined patients.Accordingly, the disease distribution was assessed; most of the cases presented with bilateral involvement with peripheral and lower lobe predominance (Table 2 and Fig. 1 ). Both peripheral and central distributions showed significance with disease severity.According to the CT findings, the most prominent features are GGO with vascular pleural thickening and interlobular septations, and parenchymal and subpleural bands were the most constant imaging features (Fig. 2) .A significant correlation was found between disease severity and consolidation, interlobular septation, bronchial thickening/dilatation, pulmonary nodule, and lymphadenopathy.Among several specific CT signs noted with COVID-19 pneumonia, the crazy-paving sign was the most encountered CT sign followed by the subpleural sparing sign. A significant correlation was found between disease severity and crazy-paving, halo, and reversed halo signs (Table 3 and Figs. 3, 4, and 5).Reactive lymphadenopathy exceeding 1 cm in shortaxis diameter affected the paratracheal, retrocaval, and prevascular groups at levels 3A and 6 the most, followed by the level 5 lymph node group. The cortical estimated density ranged from 23 HU to 141 HU, with an average density of 91.8 HU (Fig. 6) .According to the CO-RADS classification, one patient was classified as CO-RADS 6 (known as COVID-19 pneumonia), 45 patients showed CO-RADS 4 findings, and 154 patients were classified as CO-RADS 5.The CT-SS were from 1 to 24, with a mean value of 11.2 and a median value of 13. Among all patients, 40.5% had CT-SS of 11-15 (Table 4 ).COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that has been spreading widely worldwide. Early diagnosis is an essential disease management strategy [11] . However, insufficient laboratory kits caused a challenge and dramatic dissemination of the disease [12] . Therefore, radiology, such as X-ray and CT, had become the principal method for diagnosis during the COVID-19 outbreak.Chest CT could be an important complement for disease diagnosis as it assesses the extent and severity of the disease, which could express the disease burden [7] . Chest CT has a high sensitivity and a low specificity. Due to this low specificity, chest CT could hardly distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other diseases, such as community-acquired pneumonia and other noninfectious causes of acute GGO [3, 13] .The most common clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 are fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue [7] . In this study, fever and lower respiratory symptoms are the most common presenting symptoms in 69.5% and 66% of the patients, respectively.The CT-SS was significantly higher in the > 75-year age group than in the 26-50-year age group (p = 0.0012). Furthermore, the CT-SS was significantly higher in the 51-75-year age group than in the 26-50-year age group (p = 0.0367). No statistical significance was observed in the CT-SS between the 51-75-year age group and the > 75-year age group (p = 0.3605). The CT-SS could help stratify patients' risks and predict the shortterm outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [9] . Moreover, in this study, the 51-75-year age group had the highest CT-SS (p = 0.033).Regarding disease distribution, all studies have indicated that COVID-19 has typical peripheral and subpleural distributions, and in most patients, COVID-19 involves multiple lobes, particularly the lower lobes [3] . In this study, 93.5% of all patients had bilateral involvement, whereas 89.5% had peripheral involvement. Higher severity scores for the lower lobe were observed in 55.5% of the patients. These results conform to those of the study by Salehi et al. [14] who reported bilateral involvement and peripheral distribution in 87.5% and 76.0% of their patients, respectively; however, many studies such as that by Zhou et al. [15] have reported that 77.4% of the patients had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions; the mean CT-SS for the upper zone was significantly lower than that for the middle and lower zones, and no significant difference in the mean CT-SS was observed between the middle and lower zones [9] .In this study, 13 (6.5%) patients were unilateral with 11 cases (84.6%) involving the lower lobes, one involving both the upper and lower lobes, and one involving the middle lobe. Zhou et al. [15] have stated that in the early phase of the disease, the GGO may present as a unifocal lesion, most commonly located in the inferior lobe of the right lung. Regarding CT chest findings, all studies have indicated that the main CT feature of COVID-19 pneumonia is the presence of multifocal bilateral patchy GGOs with or without consolidation and with interlobular septal and vascular thickening [3, 5] . In this study, the major CT abnormalities observed were GGO in 99.5%, vascular dilatation in 92.5%, parenchymal bands in 78.5%, interlobular septal thickening in 72%, subpleural band in 69%, and consolidation in 30% of the patients. These results conform to those of many studies that reported that the frequencies of different CT abnormalities were as follows: GGO was observed in 86-91% of the cases, consolidation in 39-63%, fibrotic streaks in 56.5%, subpleural line in 20-33.9%, and interlobular septal thickening in 59% [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, Zhou et al. [15] have reported that 40.3% of the cases had GGO and 54.8% had microvascular dilation sign.The characteristic sign was the ""crazy-paving sign,"" which was observed in 36.5% of the cases, which is characterized by the reticular interlobular septa thickening within the patchy GGO, which had been reported in SARS. The ""spiderweb sign"" was observed in 11.5% of the patients. The ""spiderweb sign"" is characterized by a triangular or angular GGO under the pleura with the internal interlobular septa thickened like a net. The adjacent pleurae were pulled and formed a spiderweb-like shape in the corner. Wu et al. [16] have reported that the frequency of the ""crazy-paving sign"" was 29% and that of the ""spider web sign"" was 25%. The reverse halo sign (atoll sign) (i.e., areas of GGO with peripheral consolidation) is frequently observed [3] ; in this study, the (a, b) showing the ""crazy-paving sign"" shown as bilateral ground-glass density with prominent interlobular and intralobular septations. c, d The bilateral parenchymal bands (black arrows), inter-and intralobular septations (blue arrows), and subpleural bands (white arrows), forming the spiderweb sign frequency of the reverse halo sign was 12%. Furthermore, the halo sign, which is a consolidative nodule or mass with peripheral GGO, was found in 11% of the patients in this study; it is uncommon in adults and could reach 50% in children [18] . The pleural transparent line or subpleural sparing is another CT sign found in 26.5%, whereas in previous studies, the reported frequency of subpleural sparing was 6-53.2% [15, 16] . In this study, bronchial changes (bronchial thickening and distortion) were observed in 59% of the patients. Zhou et al. [15] have stated that 72.6% of the patients had air bronchogram, and 17.7% had bronchus distortion; however, Wu et al. [16] have reported that 11% of the patients had bronchial wall thickening.In this study, 10% of the patients had air-containing cysts, which could be due to pathological dilatation or due to resorption of consolidation; some authors have described it as a cavity, and others called it cystic changes and cavity or bubble sign; this conforms to Shi et al.'s [12] study that found cysts in 10% of the cases. Nodules are characterized to be small (less than 3 cm) round, oval, or irregularly shaped and well or poorly defined opacity in the lung. It was reported in 3-13% of the COVID-19 CT cases, and most nodules are multifocal and irregular and can have a halo sign [19] . In this study, nodules were encountered in 20% of the patients.In terms of pleural changes, in this study, pleural thickening was observed in 76.5% of the patients; however, pleural reaction and effusion were found in 1.5% and 3.5% of the patients, respectively. Zhou et al. [15] have shown that 48.4% of the patients had pleural thickening. However, pleural effusion was not significantly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia; its frequency ranged from 6 to 9% of the cases [15, 16, 20] .In this study, lymphadenopathy had a significant correlation with disease severity (p = 0.088). Lymphadenopathy Right patchy ground-glass opacity, bronchial dilatation, and thickening (arrow). c The bilateral ground-glass densities and consolidation, with a right lower lobe cyst and a right apical segment LL angulated shape well-defined nodule (d) occurred predominantly in patients with a severe form of the disease [21] . Mediastinal lymph node enlargement was found in 43.51% of the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with hilar, and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold increased risk of COVID-19 pneumonia [20] ; however, Wu et al. [16] have reported that the frequency of mediastinal lymph node enlargement was 4% of the cases. In this study, lymphadenopathy was observed in 33% of the patients. The high density of lymph nodes without obvious calcification is not reported in the literature; therefore, it is suggested to be due to the association of CT evidence of old tuberculosis infection, which was noted in 12.5% of the cases. The CT-SS of COVID-19 pneumonia has great significance in assessing the extent of pneumonia involvement, with differentiation of moderate, severe, and critical types, and in predicting the dynamic changes of chest CT follow-up exams in different severities of COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, assessing the severity of COVID-19 in the early stage helps clinicians early and accurately treat the disease [22] .The CT-SS was proposed for the assessment of the extent of involvement in thin-section CT images. Zhou et al.'s scoring system divided both lungs into 12 zones altogether. The degree of involvement in each lung zone was scored from 0 to 4, with a maximum possible score of 48 [15] . In another scoring system, both lungs were divided into 20 regions, evaluated on chest CT using a system attributing scores of 0, 1, and 2; therefore, the sum of the individual may range from 0 to 40 points [7] . In this study, the lobar involvement scoring system (0-25) was used as it was practical and time-saving with such a high flow of cases [9, 10] .Indicators of severe disease are marked tachypnea, hypoxemia, and infiltration of more than 50% of the lung fields [23] . According to Yang et al. [7] , the optimal CT-SS threshold for identifying severe COVID-19 was 19.5/ 40, with 83.3% sensitivity and 94% specificity. In addition, Francone et al. [9] have stated that CT-SS of ≥ 18 is highly predictive of patient mortality in short-term follow-up. Therefore, in this study, 18/24 was considered the cutoff value among the mild and severe cases. The mean global CT-SS was 11.2 in this study. In Francone et al.'s study [9] , the mean global CT-SS was 12.3 ± 11.1.The main limitations of this study are that the number of severe cases was much lesser than that of mild cases, which might affect the statistical strength, and single doctor assessment and the disease duration were unknown.In Egyptian patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, multislice CT plays a vital role in early identification of the disease with the ground-glass densities, and peripheral adhesions were the most typical findings, Thus, radiologists should be familiar with other possible findings.The assessment of the CT-SS of COVID-19 is essential in determining the extent of pneumonia involvement, to help clinicians early diagnosis and accurately treat COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean CT-SS for Egyptian patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was 11.2 (mild severity). ","Egypt","abstract","2020-12-08",12

Epidemic models explains well the dynamics of both the transmission and the control of an infection. Numerous modeling approaches can be integrated to form a clearer picture of an infection and to establish measures on how to eradicate it. Epidemic models can be greatly improved when combined with real data.The COVID-19 pandemic that reportedly originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [5] has now become a major global health threat, as well as a focus of interest in many researchers and the entire global community [5] - [11] . COVID-19 is found to be easily transmitted via close contact with an infective person, even during the incubation period [8] . The basic reproductive ratio (R 0 ) is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infective person; it is a measure of the infectiousness of a disease. A recent study [9] showed that COVID-19 has an R 0 of 3.28 in average; however, this has to be confirmed in further studies due to the novelty of the virus. Additionally, this pandemic has brought the concepts that community behavior has a primary role in the transmission or containment of the virus, and even the competing organizations have to collaborate among each other to contain the crisis [10, 11] .Developing a COVID-19 vaccine is a very costly and time consuming process, where its effectiveness and safety have to be thoroughly ensured before public use. In some cases, vaccine-induced immunity wanes with time. Also, some viruses learn to mute and evade the immunity induced by vaccines. In the case of containing COVID-19, the most suitable strategy, for now, is to reduce its infectiousness by limiting contact with infective people and polluted surfaces in what is contemporarily popular as ""social distancing (SD)"" including the quarantine of infected individuals. The degree of SD can be regarded as the fraction of the entire population complying with the policies. Another interpretation considers the gradation of SD policies, i.e., closing borders to international travel; partially closing social venues, large malls, schools and universities, and prayer places; or total lockdown. The awareness of the community in applying these policies will have a great impact on the viral transmission control.Adaptive behavior is extensively seen in multiagent biological systems [12] , where the behavior of agents is coupled by their environment interaction. Such a coupling can be modeled by the Sato-Crutchfield formulation [13, 14] which corresponds to memory decay. This formulation can also be equate to personal mistakes or environmental effects based on the community awareness.Different mathematical modeling approaches for COVID-19 have been proposed [15] - [17] . A compartmental model is used in the present study, because of its simplicity and its ability to study many features of the dynamics of disease transmission and control. It should be noted that studying the equilibria of the associated dynamic system and its stability is of crucial importance as it helps in collecting information around the infection dynamics. As immunity to reinfection from COVID-19 lasts in a short time [18] and, the virus can mute and evade the immunity, the SIRS model is suitable to examine the spread of COVID-19.The significant role of the spatial aspect of the dynamics of infection transmission is emphasised by simulating epidemic models on networks [19] . Regular lattices can display the clustering property only, while random graphs can show the long-range interactions. Small-world networks [20] is one of the most important structures that interpolates between regular lattices and random graphs. Thus, both local and non-local interactions are combined. Small-world networks are used for studying many features of epidemics [3, 21] .This study aims to develop simple compartmental models for COVID-19, which will be used to investigate the important roles of SD and community awareness in controlling the infection transmission. In Section 2, a discussion of the SIRS model for the spread of COVID-19, with notes on the equilibria and the corresponding stability of the dynamic system is covered. The roles of SD, community awareness, and vaccination are explained, with provided calculations on the sufficient degree of SD and vaccination ratio to control COVID-19 transmission. Then, the model is simulated on small-world networks. In Section 3, a nonhomogeneous population model is introduced; and the nonlocal interaction is highlighted. Some conclusions are summed up in Section 4.Assume that a homogenously mixed population of constant sufficiently large size can be divided into three compartments: susceptible (S), infective (symptomatic or asymptomatic) (I), and removed (isolated or recovered) (R). Infection is transmitted via direct contact between susceptible and infective individuals at a constant rate β. Infective individuals are removed at a constant rate γ. Meanwhile, removed individuals lose their immunity at a constant rate ν. Given these parameters, the basic reproductive ratio is defined as R 0 = β γ . Herd immunity is considered an important concept for an infection when susceptible individuals have enough immunity to prevent the spread of the infection. Thus, let the condition for herd immunity to occur be R 0 S < 1.The evolution of the fractions of the population S(t), I(t), and R(t) can be described as a dynamical systemwhich has two equilibria, firstly, the disease-free equilibrium (1, 0, 0) that is stable when R 0 < 1 and unstable when R 0 > 1, and secondly, the endemic equilibriumprovided that R 0 > 1. The endemic equilibrium is stable when present.An infection can be contained if the disease-free equilibrium is the only possible stable equilibrium. For the COVID-19, R 0 = 3.28 [9] , which implies that the disease-free equilibrium is found to be unstable. If the endemic equilibrium is reached, it will be stable, the disease will persist, and herd immunity will not be effective. Thus, there is an urgent need to contain the COVID-19 before the endemic equilibrium is reached. The two most important strategies to control the transmission are SD and vaccination.The COVID-19 has been found to spread even during the incubation period [8] . The policies of SD reduce the probability of contact with both infective individuals and polluted objects. SD can be integrated in the SIRS model, by assuming that only (1 − µ) of the susceptible individuals are in contact with the infective individuals, where 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 is the degree of SD. Here, the dynamical system (1) transforms toNote that the reproductive ratio becomes (1 − µ)R 0 , which implies that the infectiousness of COVID-19 can be lessened by increasing the degree of SD. Further, it can be reduced to half for µ = 0.5. Accordingly, two equilibria are present: the disease-free equilibrium that is stable when (1 − µ)R 0 < 1 and the stable endemic equilibriumprovided that (1 − µ)R 0 > 1. Again, herd immunity is not applicable if the endemic equilibrium has already been reached. To avoid falling in the stable endemic equilibrium, SD must be applied with a degreeThe sufficient SD degree to control the infection can be defined asCOVID-19, µ 0 = 0.69. A degree higher than µ 0 should be maintained for a sufficient time to ensure the robustness of the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, and to not reach the endemic equilibrium. An interesting limit is when µ = 1. From system (3), because I exponentially decays asthe spread of the infection is stopped. Figure 1 shows the results of the computations when β = 0.65, γ = 0.02, and ν = 0.05. In the absence of SD policies (µ = 0), the proportion of infective individuals I increases exponentially with time until the peak (I max = 0.333) is reached at time (t Imax = 1218 time steps). In contrast, because of herd immunity, I decreases exponentially with time until the spread of the virus is prevented. I has been determined to respond differently with various degrees of SD applied. For µ = 0.3, I increases at a slower rate than when µ = 0, the peak is reduced by 39%, and the peak time delayed by 53% (I max = 0.204 and t Imax = 1865 time steps). For µ = 0.5, I max = 0.092 and t Imax = 2911 time steps, see Fig.  1 , when µ is increased, the peak is reduced correspondingly (dues to lower herd immunity threshold), and there is more delay in the peak time. These results are important as they offer the opportunity for more studies and more time to develop a vaccine, while simultaneously reducing the patient loads in hospitals and intensive care units.At the beginning of an epidemic, S is approximately the whole population, and can be considered as a constant S(0), then from system (3)which explains the initial exponential growth of I. Both morbidity and mortality are commonly used measures that determine the severity of an infection. The morbidity m(t) is calculated as Figure 2 shows the results of the numerical simulations for m(t), with the same values of the parameters of the model as Fig. 1 . It is clear that increasing µ decreases morbidity, and thus mortality associated with COVID-19.In the presence of a vaccine, if a fraction p of the susceptible individuals is vaccinated, then only 1 − p of them will be exposed to infection; the reproductive ratio becomes (1 − p)(1 − µ)R 0 . The sufficient vaccination ratio for controlling an infection is modeled bywhich depends on the infectiousness of the disease and the SD degree applied. The ratio p 0 decreases rapidly with an increase in µ, and it approaches zero when µ = µ 0 . This is advantageous as vaccination can be applied to only a small fraction of the population, provided that SD policies are applied. References [13] and [14] model mistakes by adding coupling terms to system (3); these coupling terms represent the individuals' interaction with the environment. Here assume that the degree of community awareness is 0 α 1. As a general rule, the least aware community would commit more mistakes. The dynamical system (3) is modified to the(10) Figure 3 presents a numerical investigation for system (10) when µ = 0.3, β = 0.65, γ = 0.02, ν = 0.05, and a varied α. Note the advantages of SD are lost once the degree of community awareness is slightly lowered to 0.9; moreover, the peak increases to 0.236, and herd immunity is destroyed, allowing the infection to preset. Further, the infection is expected to get worse when the community awareness drops to α = 0.5 and then to α = 0.1 (see Fig. 3 ). This implies that the infection will grow through the population, which confirms the important role of community awareness development in reducing COVID-19 transmission.Finally, the spatial aspect is included by simulating the model on small-world networks. In our simulations, a connected one-dimensional lattice of size 10 6 , with periodic boundary conditions is assumed. With probability φ, some randomly chosen vertices are connected by some shortcuts to randomly selected non-nearest neighboring vertices. Every vertex interacts with its nearest neighbors and the distant neighbor, if present. It is clear that SD practices reduces the chance for shortcuts. The numerical simulations are performed using the same values of the model (system (1)) and different values of φ. For φ = 0, the behavior of I is approximately similar to that of Fig. 1 for µ = 0. As φ increases, the infection becomes endemic see Fig. 4 . Of course, applying SD policies reduces φ, therefore do not allow reaching the endemic phase.The nonlocal interaction is widely observed in the epidemic spreading, especially in the recent COVID-19. Here we use the Lajmanovich-Yorke model [4] which combines between both local and nonlocal epidemic spreading. The population is divided into n patches. Let I i be the fraction of infective individuals in the i-th patch, β ji be the infection rate within the i-th patch due to an infection from the j-th patch, and γ i be the recovery rate of the i-th patch individuals. Then the model is given as followsLet I = (I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I n ) T , and A = (a ij ), such that a ij = β ji , i = j; and a ii = β ii − γ i , then the system (11) can be written as followsLet λ max = max 1≤i≤n Re(λ i ), where λ i , i = 1, 2, . . . , n are the eigenvalues of A. According to Ref. [4] , there are two possibilities: either the disease-free equilibrium (I i = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , n) is asymptotically stable if λ max ≤ 0, or there exists an asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium when λ max > 0. When n = 1, the system is reduced to the homogeneous population situation. The case n = 2 is worthy of investigation because it represents the situation when the population is divided into two subpopulations: inside and outside a certain region. For simplicity, we can assume β 11 = β 22 = β, β 12 = β 21 =β, and γ 1 = γ 2 = γ. The system (11) becomesThe conditions for the asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium becomeThen β +β γ ≤ 1.Equation (15) can be written aswhere R 0 andŔ 0 are local and nonlocal reproductive ratios, respectively. By applying a SD program with degrees, µ locally andμ nonlocally, the condition for the asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium becomeThenTherefore, applying an external SD program with an appropriate degree reduces the required degree of the internal SD program to prevent approaching the endemic equilibrium. This is beneficial from a domestic economy point of view. The effect of both internal and external SD policies is investigated in Fig. 5 . The variables are setted as follows: β = 0.6, β = 0.3 and γ = 0.3. It is clear that the proportion of infective individuals in the endemic phase is lowered by increasing the SD degrees µ andμ. Also, the disease-free equilibrium can be obtained at suitable values for µ andμ.In the absence of a vaccine, an appropriate degree of SD and a high level of community awareness can help in controlling the spread of COVID-19. SD policies in particular can reduce the peak of infection and delay the peak time leading to offer ample time for the development of a vaccine, and prevent hospitals from reaching their maximum patient capacity. Moreover, SD policies can reduce the effects of non-local interactions that can turn the infection to be endemic. With a vaccine, SD practices can reduce the vaccination rate required to eradicate infection. Subsequently, vaccine priority can be given to the health-care providers and those in direct contact with infective individuals. Long-term SD practice is crucial to avoid a relapse, as immediately loosening SD rules may provide an avenue of recurrence of the infection. Community awareness is also important in the transmission process; low community awareness destroys the herd immunity, which spreads the infection endemically. Appropriately implementing an external SD program reduces the degree required for the internal SD program to contain the infection, which has a positive impact on the local economy.There are some probable risks. Firstly, COVID-19 can become endemic especially in the poorest regions around the world. Secondly, COVID-19 will return in some regions; this case often refers to the second wave of infection. Thirdly, the possibility of creation of new strains, which can be slowed down as the number of infected individuals decreases. When such risks happen, the virus gets retransmitted to the recovered areas. Thus, it is important that poor countries should be assisted in controlling the transmission of the virus. Appropriate levels of long-term external and internal SD practices are also strongly recommended.Some SD practices can benefit in other issues. For example, COVID-19, though not sexually transmitted, can be passed easily through sexual activities with an infective person. Thus, SD practices only allow spouses living in the same household to perform sexual activities. This will help powerfully in reducing the sexually transmitted infections which have a profound impact on human health. ","Egypt","first author","2020-12-24",12

The same architecture was shown to detect pneumonia due to COVID-19 with an accuracy of 96.7% [7] and to detect COVID-19 from x-ray images with an accuracy of 96.30% [8] .Coughing is one of the predominant symptoms of COVID-19 [9] . However, coughing is also a symptom of more than 100 other diseases, and their effects on the respiratory system vary [10] . For example, lung diseases can cause the airway to be either restricted or obstructed and this can influence the acoustics of the cough [11] . It has also been postulated that the glottis behaves differently under different pathological conditions [12] , [13] and that this makes it possible to distinguish between coughs due to TB [14] , asthma [15] , bronchitis and pertussis (whooping cough) [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] .Respiratory data such as breathing, sneezing, speech, eating behaviour and coughs can be processed by machine learning algorithms to diagnose respiratory illness such as COVID-19 [20] , [21] , [22] . Simple machine learning tools, like a binary classifier, are able to distinguish COVID-19 respiratory sounds from healthy counterparts with an AUC exceeding 0.80 [23] . Detecting COVID-19 by analysing only the cough sounds is also possible. AI4COVID-19 is a mobile app which records 3 seconds of cough audio which is analysed automatically to provide an indication of COVID-19 status within 2 minutes [24] . A medical dataset containing 328 cough sounds have been recorded from 150 patients of four different types: COVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis and Healthy. A deep neural network (DNN) was shown to distinguish between COVID-19 and other coughs with an accuracy of 96.83% [25] . There appear to be unique patterns in COVID-19 coughs that allow a pre-trained Resnet18 classifier to identify COVID-19 coughs with an AUC of 0.72. In this case cough samples were collected over the phone from 3621 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 [26] . COVID-19 coughs were classified with a higher AUC of 0.97 (sensitivity = 98.5% and specificity = 94.2%) by a Resnet50 architecture trained on coughs from 4256 subjects and evaluated on 1064 subjects that included both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative subjects [27] .Data collection from COVID-19 patients is challenging and often not publicly available. A database consisting of coughing sounds recorded during or after the acute phase of COVID-19 from patients via public media interviews has been developed in [28] . The Coswara dataset is publicly available and collected in a more controlled and targeted manner [29] . At the time of writing, this dataset included usable 'deep cough' recordings from 92 COVID-19 positive and from 1079 healthy subjects. We have also begun to compile our own dataset by collecting recordings from subjects who have undergone a SARS-CoV laboratory test in South Africa. This Sarcos (SARS COVID-19 South Africa) dataset is currently still small and includes 21 subjects (8 COVID-19 positive and 13 COVID-19 negative).Both the Coswara and Sarcos dataset are imbalanced since COVID-19 positive subjects are outnumbered by non-COVID-19 subjects. Nevertheless, collectively these two dataset contain recordings from all six continents, as shown in Figure 1 . To improve our machine learning classifier's performance, we have applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance our dataset. Subsequently, classifier hyperparameters were optimised by using a leave-p-out cross validation, followed by training and evaluation of artificial neural networks (ANN), such as LR, SVM, MLP and deep neural networks (DNN) such as CNN, LSTM, Resnet50 classifiers. Resnet50 produced the highest area under the ROC curve value of 0.9759 ≈ 0.98 while trained and evaluated on the Coswara dataset. No classifier has been trained on the Sarcos dataset as it is small, but has been used to evaluate the performance of the best-performed DNN classifiers on the Coswara dataset. It has also been found that highest AUC of 0.9375 ≈ 0.94 has been achieved from best 13 features extracted from the Sarcos dataset after running a greedy search algorithm such as a sequential forward search (SFS). We conclude that diagnosis of COVID-19 is possible from only cough audio recorded via smartphone, as our AI based cough classifier can discriminate COVID-19 positive coughs from both COVID-19 negative and healthy coughs anywhere on the planet. However, additional validation is required to obtain approval from regulatory bodies for use as a diagnostic tool.The Coswara project is aimed at developing a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 based on respiratory, cough and speech sounds [29] . The public can contribute to this web-based data collection effort using their smartphones (https://coswara.iisc.ac.in). The collected audio data includes fast and slow breathing, deep and shallow coughing, phonation of sustained vowels and spoken digits. Age, gender, geographical location, current health status and preexisting medical conditions are also recorded. Health status includes 'healthy', 'exposed', 'cured' or 'infected'. Audio recordings were sampled at 44.1 KHz and subjects were from all continents except Africa, as shown in Figure 2 . The collected data is currently being annotated and will be released in due course. In this study we have made use of the raw audio recordings and applied preprocessing as described in Section 2.2.Like Coswara, this dataset was collected using an online platform: https://coughtest.online. Subjects were prompted to record their cough using their smartphone. Only coughs were collected as audio samples, and only subjects who had recently undergone a SARS-CoV laboratory test were asked to participate. The sampling rate for the audio recordings was 44.1 KHz. In addition to the cough audio recordings, subjects were presented with a voluntary and anonymous questionnaire, providing informed consent. The questionnaire prompted for the following information. • If they are a regular smoker.If they have a current cough and for how many days.There were 13 (62%) subjects who asserted that they are South African residents representing the African continent, as shown in Figure 3 . There were no subject from Africa in the Coswara dataset. Thus, together, the Coswara and Sarcos dataset include subjects from all six continents.The amplitudes of the raw audio data in the Coswara and the Sarcos dataset were normalised, after which periods of silence were removed from the signal to within a 50 ms margin using a simple energy detector. Figure 4 shows an example of the original raw audio, as well as the preprocessed audio.The coughs in both Coswara and Sarcos dataset after preprocessing are shown in Table 1 . The Coswara dataset contains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy subjects and the Sarcos dataset contains 8 COVID-19 positive and 13 COVID-19 negative subjects. Table 1 shows that COVID-19 positive subjects are underrepresented in both dataset. To compensate for this imbalance, which can detrimentally affect machine learning [30] , [31] , we have applied SMOTE data balancing during training [32] , [33] . This technique has previously been successfully applied to cough detection and classification based on audio recording [17] . SMOTE oversamples the minor class by generating synthetic examples, instead of for example random oversampling.In our dataset, for each COVID-19 positive cough, 5 other COVID-19 positive coughs were randomly chosen and the one with the smallest Euclidean distance from the 12 9 No Yes Brazil (1) Prefer not to say (7) South Africa (13) Fig. 3 . Sarcos dataset at the time of experimentation: There are 13 COVID-negative and 8 COVID-positive subjects in the processed dataset. Unlike Coswara dataset, there are more female than male subjects. Most of the subjects had their lab test performed less than two weeks ago. Of the 21 subjects, 12 had been in contact with another COVID-19 positive person. Only 9 of the subjects reported coughing as a symptom, and for these the reported duration of coughing symptoms was variable. There were 13 subjects from Africa (South Africa), 1 from South America (Brazil), and the rest declined to specify their geographic location. original cough x N N is selected. We note the COVID-19 positive class as x. Then, the synthetic samples are created according to Equation 1.The multiplicative factor u is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 [34] .We have also implemented other extensions of SMOTE such as borderline-SMOTE [35] , [36] and adaptive synthetic sampling [37] . However, the best results were obtained by using SMOTE without any extension.The balanced processed coughs from all the subjects are used in the feature extraction process and then used for training and evaluating our classifiers.The feature extraction process is illustrated in Figure 5 .We have considered mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), log energies, zero-crossing rate (ZCR) and kurtosis as features.Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) have been used very successfully as features in audio analysis and especially in automatic speech recognition [38] . They have also been found to be useful for differentiating dry coughs from wet coughs [39] . We have used the traditional MFCC extraction method considering higher resolution MFCCs, while mel-scaled filters are calculated by following Equation 2, along with velocity and acceleration.This feature [40] is well used in improving performance of neural networks. If the input signal is s(t) and N is the total number of samples in the signal, then log energy is L, defined by Equation 3 .The zero-crossing rate (ZCR) [41] is the number of times the signal changes sign within a frame, as indicated in Equation 4 . ZCR indicates the variability present in the signal.where λ = 1 when the sign of s t and s t−1 differ and λ = 0 when the sign of s t and s t−1 is the same.The kurtosis [42] indicates the tailedness of a probability density. For the samples of an audio signal, it indicates the prevalence of higher amplitudes. Kurtosis has been calculated according to Equation 5 .These features have been extracted by using the hyperparameters explained in Table 2 for all cough recordings.In the following we will briefly describe the classifiers which were evaluated in our experimental evaluation.Logistic regression (LR) models have been found to outperform other state-of-the-art classifiers such as classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks such as SVM in some clinical prediction tasks [14] , [43] , [44] . The output P of a LR model is given by Equation 6 , where a and b are the model parameters.Since P varies between 0 and 1, it can be interpreted as a probability and is very useful in binary classification.We have used gradient descent weight regularisation as well as lasso (l1 penalty) and ridge (l2 penalty) estimators during training [45] , [46] . These regularisation hyperparameters are optimised during cross validation, explained in Section 5.2.This LR classifier has been intended primarily as a baseline against which any improvements offered by the more complex architectures can be measured.Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers have performed well in both detecting [47] , [48] and classifying [49] cough events.We have used both linear and non-linear SVM classifiers φ(w) which is computed in the Equation 7 .and where, J(w, b, a) is the term to minimise by the hyperparameter optimization for the parameters mentioned in Table 3 . A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a neural network with multiple layers of neurons separating input and output [50] . These models are capable of learning non-linear relationships and have for example been shown to be effective when discriminating Influenza coughs from other coughs [51] . MLP have also been applied to tuberculosis coughs [48] and to cough detection in general [52] , [53] . The MLP classifier is based on the computation in Equation 8 .where x is the input-vector, w is the weight-vector, b is the bias and φ is the non-linear activation function. The weights and the bias are optimised during supervised training. During training, we have applied stochastic gradient descent with the inclusion of an l2 penalty. This penalty, along with the number of hidden layers have been considered as the hyperparameters which were tuned using the leave-pout cross validation process (Figure 8 and Section 5.2).A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a popular deep neural network architecture which is primarily used in image classification [54] . For example, in the past two decades CNNs have been applied successfully to complex tasks such as face recognition [55] . The core of a CNN can be expressed by Equation 9 , where net(t, f ) is the output of the convolutional layer [56] .where * is the convolution operation, w is the filter or kernel matrix and x is the input image. In the final layer, the softmax activation function is applied [57] .The hyperparameters optimised for the CNN classifier used in this study is mentioned in Table 3 and visually explained in Figure 6 . Fig. 7 . LSTM classifier: Our LSTM classifier has β 1 LSTM units, each with rectified linear activation functions and a dropout rate of α 3 . This is followed by two dense layers with α 4 and 8 units respectively and rectified linear activation functions. The network is terminated by a two-dimensional softmax where one output represents the COVID-19 positive class and the other Healthy or COVID-19 negative class. During training, features are presented to the neural network in batches of size ξ 1 for ξ 2 epochs.A long short term memory (LSTM) model is a type of recurrent neural network whose architecture allows it to remember previously-seen inputs when making its classification decision [58] . It has been successfully used in automatic cough detection [59] , and also in other types of acoustic event detection [60] , [61] .If φ is a constant d-dimensional vector, t ∈ R + and s(t) is the value of the d-dimensional state signal vector, then the LSTM can be described by Equation 10 .where, h( s(t), x(t)) is a vector-valued function of vector-valued arguments [62] .The hyperparameters optimised for the LSTM classifier used in this study is mentioned in Table 3 and illustrated in Figure 7 .The deep residual learning (Resnet) neural network [63] is a very deep architecture that contains skip layers, and has been found to outperform other very deep architectures. It performs particularly well on image classification tasks on the dataset such as ILSVRC, the CIFAR10 dataset and the COCO object detection dataset [64] . Resnet50 has already been used in successfully detecting COVID-19 from CT images [6] , coughs [27] and also other detection tasks such as Alzheimer's [65] . We have used the default Resnet50 structure mentioned in Table 1 of [63] .Both feature extraction and classifier architectures have a number of hyperparameters that must be optimised. These hyperparameters are listed in Tables 2 and 3 .As the sampling rate is 44.1 KHz for all audio; by varying the frame lengths from 2 8 to 2 12 i.e. 256 to 4096, features are extracted from frames whose duration varies from approximately 5 to 100 ms. Different phases in a cough carry important features [39] and thus has been segmented into parts, as shown in Figure 5 , which varies from 50 to 150 with steps of 20 to 30. By varying the number of lower order MFCCs to keep (from 13 to 65, with steps of 13), the spectral resolution of the features was varied. Figure 8 and explained in Section 5.2. For regularisation strength (ν 1 ) and l2 penalty (ζ 1 ), i has the range −7 to 7 with steps of 1.Regularisation LR 10 −7 to 10 7 strength (ν 1 ) in steps of Learning rate (β 2 ) LSTM 10 k where k = −2, −3, −4All our classifiers have been trained and evaluated by using a nested leave-p-out cross validation scheme, as shown in Figure 8 [66] . Since only the Coswara dataset was used for training and parameter optimisation, N = 1171. As the train and test split is 4 : 1; J = 234 and K = 187.The figure shows that, in an outer loop, J patients are removed from the complete set N to be used for later independent testing. Then, a further K patients are removed from the remaining N − J to serve as a development set to optimise the hyperparameters listed in Table 3 . The inner loop considers all such sets of K patients, and the optimal hyperparameters are chosen on the basis of all these partitions. The resulting optimal hyperparameters are used to train a final system on all N − J patients which is evaluated on the test set consisting of J patients. This entire procedure is repeated for all possible non-overlapping test sets in the outer loop. Final performance is calculated by averaging over these outer loops. This cross-validation procedure makes best use of our small dataset by allowing all patients to be used for both training and testing purposes while ensuring unbiased hyperparameter optimisation and a strict per-patient separation between cross-validation folds.Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated within the inner and outer loops in Figure 8 . The area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicates how well the classifier has performed over a range of decision thresholds [67] . From these ROC curves, the decision that achieves an equal error rate (γ EE ) was computed. This is the threshold for which the difference between the classifier's true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) is minimised.Denote the mean per-frame probability that a cough is from a COVID-19 positive patient byP :where κ indicates the number of frames in the cough and P (Y = 1|X, θ) is the output of the classifier for input X and parameters θ. Now define the indicator variable C as:We now define two COVID-19 index scores (COV ID I 1 and COV ID I 2 ) in Equations 13 and 14 respectively.In Equation 13 , N 1 is the number of coughs from the patient in question while in Equation 14 , N 2 indicates the total number of frames of cough audio gathered from the patient. Hence Equation 11 computes a per-cough average probability while and Equation 14 computes a per-frame average probability.The COVID-19 index scored given by Equations 13 and 14 can both be used to make classification decisions. We have found that, for some classifier architectures one will lead to better performance than the other. Therefore, we have made the choice of the scoring function an additional hyperparameter to be optimised during cross validation.We have calculated the specificity and sensitivity from these predicted values and then comparing them with the actual values and finally AUC has been calculated and used as a method of evaluation. These results are shown in Table  4 and 5.Classification performance for the Coswara datset is shown in Table 4 and for the Sarcos dataset in Table 5 . The Coswara results are averages calculated over the outer loop test-sets during cross validation. The Sarcos results, are classifiers trained on the Coswara data and evaluated on the 21 patients in the Sarcos dataset. These tables also show the optimal values of the hyperparameters determined during cross-validation. Table 4 shows that the Resnet50 classifier exhibits best performance, with an AUC of 0.976 when using a 117dimensional feature vector consisting of 39 MFCCs with appended velocity and acceleration extracted from frames that are 1024 samples long and when grouping the coughs into 50 segments. The corresponding accuracy is 95.3% with sensitivity 93% and specificity 98%. This exceeds the minimum requirements for a community-based triage test as determined by the WHO. The CNN and LSTM classifiers also exhibited good performance, with AUCs of 0.953 and 0.942 respectively, thus comfortably outperformed the MLP, which achieved an AUC of 0.897. The optimised LR and SVM classifiers showed substantially weaker performance, with AUCs of 0.736 and 0.815 respectively.We also see from Table 4 that using a larger number of MFCCs consistently leads to improved performance. Since the spectral resolution used to compute the 39-dimensional MFCCs surpasses that of the human auditory system, we conclude that the classifiers are using information not generally perceivable to the human listener in their decisions. We have come to similar conclusions in previous work considering the coughing sounds of tuberculosis patients [14] .The mean ROC curves for the optimised classifier of each architecture are shown in Figure 9 . We see that LSTM, CNN and Resnet50 classifiers achieve better performance that the remaining architectures at most operating points. Furthermore, the figure confirms that the Resnet50 architecture also in most cases achieved better classification performance that the CNN and LSTM. There appears to be a small region of the curve where the CNN outperforms the Resnet50 classifier, but this will need to be verified by future further experimentation with larger dataset.When the CNN, LSTM and Resnet50 classifiers trained on the Coswara dataset (as shown in Table 4 ) were applied to the Sarcos dataset, the performance shown in Table 5 is achieved. We see that performance has in all cases deteriorated relative to the better-matched Coswara dataset. Best performance was achieved by the LSTM classifier, which achieved an AUC of 0.7786. Next, we improve this classifier by applying feature selection.Sequential Forward Search (SFS) is a greedy search for the individual features dimensions that contribute the most towards the classifier performance [68] . The application of SFS to the LSTM classifier allowed performance on the Sarcos dataset to improve from an AUC of 0.779 to 0.938, as shown in Figure 10 . Kurtosis. After performing SFS, a peak AUC of 0.9375 was observed on the Sarcos dataset when using the best 13 features among the 42, as shown in Figure 11 . 11 . Mean ROC curve for the best performing classifier in Figure 9 when evaluated on the Sarcos dataset when using all 42 features and when using the best 13 features.We have developed COVID-19 cough classifiers using smartphone audio recordings and a number of machine learning architectures. To train and evaluate these classifiers, we have used two dataset. The first, larger, dataset is publicly available contains data from 1171 subjects (92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy) coming from all six continents except Africa. The second, smaller, dataset contains 62% of subjects from South Africa and data from 8 COVID-19 positive and 13 COVID-19 negative subjects. Thus, together the two dataset include data from subjects residing on all six continents. After preprocessing and extracting MFCC, frame energy, ZCR and kurtosis features from the cough audio recordings, we have trained and evaluated six classifiers using a leave-p-out cross validation. Our best performing classifier is based on the Resnet50 architecture and is able to discriminate between COVID-19 coughs and healthy coughs with an AUC of 0.98. The LSTM model performed the best in discriminating COVID-19 positive coughs from COVID-19 negative coughs with AUC 0.94 after determining the 13 best features using sequential forward search (SFS). Although these systems require more stringent validation on larger dataset, the results we have presented are very promising and indicate that COVID-19 screening based on automatic classification of coughing sounds is viable. Since the data has been captured on smartphones, and since the classifier can in principle also be implemented on such device, such cough classification is cost-efficient, easy to apply and easy to deploy.

It is a group of enveloped positive-sensed single-stranded RNA viruses. The emerging CoVs have caused recent pandemics of respiratory infectious diseases with high mortality. 1 In 2003, a novel human coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV]) was identified as the etiological agent of the SARS-CoV outbreak. In 2011, the world experienced global pandemic caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 1 The latest CoVs to spill over into the human population emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. This virus was termed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for SARS-CoV-2. The newly identified virus was responsible for the outbreak in Wuhan and patients with confirmed infection had typical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, pneumonia. 2, 3 Worldwide situation spread rapidly, with >34.8 million confirmed cases reported globally and 1 million deaths as of October 4, 2020. 4 Considering the emerging and rapidly evolving situation associated with increased levels of mortality and infectivity risks, the detection and identification of new tests in a fast, safe, and accurate measures would have a high impact regarding prompt clinical and epidemiological management decisions. 5 The standard method of suspected infection diagnosis is real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on viral spike genes, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in sputum, throat swabs, and secretions of the lower respiratory tract samples. 6, 7 Even though real-time PCR has advantages, this technology has several limitations that warrant some attention in the context of COVID-19. [8] [9] [10] [11] First of all, it incurs a huge cost of instrumentations and consumables, and requires certified laboratories and specifically trained personnel. These tests have limited standardized protocols, and are laborious in operation and timeconsuming. Another consideration concerns reported false negatives for real-time PCR of SARS-CoV-2. [12] [13] [14] Increased risk of false negative in pathogen detection, BioResearch Open Access Volume 9.1, 2020 DOI: 10.1089/biores.2020.0026 Accepted October 14, 2020 BioResearch O P E N A C C E S S particularly for new emerging or highly variable pathogens is one of major limitations. Any low abundance target will be more likely to experience the Monte Carlo effect because the probability of primer annealing is lower. 15, 16 Because of this, real-time PCR appears weak for accurate data interpretation and is inadequate for rapid and simple diagnosis. A cautionary warning has already been issued for multiple routes transmission and needed strategy to accurately predict infection status. 17 Current strategy for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is to detect viral RNA in oral swabs, which is not perfect and comes with challenges. The virus can be present in anal swabs or blood of patients, whereas oral swabs testing negative. 17 It has been shown that infected patients can harbor the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease progression. More interestingly, it has been noted that cases with positive blood viremia had negative swabs. Furthermore, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no upper respiratory tract swabs are investigated for the viral RNA detection, which may conclude bias results during the early infection stage and explain high false negatives in nucleic acid PCR test. 3 This strongly implies that these patients would likely be considered as SARS-CoV-2 negative through established routine surveillance practices and discharged only on the basis of negative oral swabs, putting them at a high risk of transmission.For better diagnostic strategy, dissecting the dynamic of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is essential. Using accumulated knowledge learned from the outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, one can anticipate the gap on human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18 The neutralizing antibody-mediated humoral response is very potent in neutralizing viral infectivity and prevents reinfection. Small-scale serological screening of SARS-CoV-2 with limited data was reported. 7 It has been shown that, after the onset of the disease, specific immunoglobulin class M (IgM) reached peak titer in day 9 and immunoglobulin class G (IgG) levels peak within about 2 weeks. Furthermore, patients' serum showed cross-neutralizing activity in vitro eliciting a protective humoral immune response. IgG and IgM viral antibodies were identified in all patients regardless of swabs results. 7 However, it remains to be investigated if kinetic and titer of specific antibody correlates with disease severity. This implied that serological assays can play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 case detection and surveillance. Serology are less likely to miss infected people and can help both indication of immune status and diagnosis of acute infection.Shedding light on immune responses would be valuable for designing diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for COVID-19. The first contributions to mapping the breadth and kinetics of serological response to SARS-CoV-2 comes from Thevarajan et al. 19 Authors highlighted that progressive increases in plasma SARS-CoV-2-binding IgM and IgG antibodies happen before the resolution of symptoms and clinical recovery. This immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was described as similar to what we observe in influenza. Using blood samples for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be the best-case scenario for rapid, simple, and highly sensitive detection method. It is well known that IgM antibodies are usually the first to arrive to an infection scene, before high affinity, and longer-lasting IgG responses generation. The detection of IgM antibodies indicates recent exposure to the virus and hence a possible presence in blood. IgM antibodies are often considered as the most sensitive indicator of acute infection. The presence of IgG antibodies generally indicates past exposure and immunity. 20 Serological screening for both IgM and IgG throughout the time-course of infection could increase diagnostic accuracy, help monitoring course disease during and after treatment, and help identify reservoirs that may amplify outbreaks. 12 The advantages of serological IgG-IgM combined antibody tests are that they are material and time-saving tools, suitable for testing large samples, require no specialized equipment or technique and can be performed by most hospital or clinic laboratories. Compared with real-time PCR, they are relatively inexpensive, simple to perform, and only requires minimal training.Gaining a deeper understanding of humoral and cellular immune parameters in larger cohorts of COVID-19 will help predicting disease courses, identifying new tools for diagnosis and disease severity management, and developing protective vaccines with maximum efficacy. 19 This promising research could also help us identifying earlier patients at risk of severe symptoms and which patients will develop milder cases, based on humoral and cellular immune parameters. It is unclear how the immune system fights SARS-CoV-2 and how it works for recovered patients. Research in this area could provide more insight into how postinfection immunity develops for SARS-CoV-2, and if immunization is temporary or longerlasting to anticipate seasonal outbreaks.As asymptomatic carriers could spread SARS-CoV-2 virus and make the current outbreak control more difficult, another promising application of serological tests is screening asymptomatic carriers, which is vital to curb the epidemic. 9, 11 Serological information may simplify and promote contact tracing and surveillance at the local, regional, national, and international levels. Serological immunity can also accelerate return-towork outcome of frontline health workers, which will be potentially re-exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody testing may be helpful in testing sensitivity of realtime PCR assays for detecting viral infection.In summary, in the face of a rapidly changing and never-before experienced situation, and unfortunately in the absence of any effective therapeutics or vaccines, we have to leverage the power of testing to overcome the pandemic confronting us. One must be aware that we are facing a new virus and uncharted territory, exposing us to new questions and challenges we had yet to be ready to ponder on: what is the most appropriate test, and for whom and when? What to test? How often to test? And, what to do with test results?Today, in the thick of the outbreak, the need for a rapid, simple to use, sensitive, and accurate diagnostic test is critical to quickly identify symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2, reduce virus shedding and transmission, and ensure timely treatment of patients. The combination of real-time PCR and the IgM-IgG antibody serology testing can be a powerful strategy for more accurate SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis with less false results slipping through the cracks.Cite this article as: Ghazi B, Elghanmi A (2020) Why do we need serological tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 diagnosis?

The aetiological virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first isolated from patients with pneumonia of unknown cause. After the virus isolation and characterization using sequencing and transmission electron microscopy, the virus was classified as the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans. 1 Initial investigation of the disease has established an association between severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly people and those with preexisting health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The clinical manifestation of the disease is mainly pneumonia-like signs and symptoms for severe cases, but most patients display fever, cough and myalgia or fatigue. 2 Within 3 weeks of the first recognized case on 10 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, 47 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the area and an outbreak was officially declared. 3 With cases imported into several countries and local transmission and epidemics growing rapidly, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of © The Author(s) 2020.

By 11 February 2020, 44 672 cases were confirmed in the Wuhan area. 6 The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging health systems throughout the world, including well-established ones in wealthy countries, with nearly 27 million cases and >880 000 fatalities worldwide reported by the WHO in the first week of September 2020 from around 200 countries and territories. 5 The majority of these cases and deaths are from countries with relatively developed health systems, including China, Italy, Germany, Spain, the UK and the USA. 5 Health systems in Africa are typically very weak, underresourced, poorly equipped and constantly struggling with epidemics of several other infectious diseases. 7 The health system in Sudan is limited 8 and suffers a heavy burden of infectious diseases, including parasitic diseases like malaria, leishmaniasis 9 and onchocerciasis, 10 and arboviral diseases like Chikungunya virus, 11 dengue and rift valley fever, 12, 13 and their frequent epidemics. 14, 15 However, with emergency support from the WHO, the capacity of several African countries, including Sudan, to identify, test and isolate COVID-19 cases was somewhat improved. 7 In this report we document the first imported cases of COVID-19 in Sudan and describe the epidemiology, epidemic preparedness and public health response in the country.This is a cross-sectional descriptive study implemented in Sudan to investigate the importation of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the establishment of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country through international travellers and their contacts between 16 January and 15 April 2020.In response to the rapidly growing pandemic of COVID-19, governments worldwide, including Sudan, are struggling to utilize their resources effectively to detect and contain its spread. In Sudan, a federal task force has been assembled to investigate, identify and isolate suspected cases and to provide healthcare to confirmed cases (suspected cases with a positive laboratory test).Suspected cases were identified according to their clinical presentations and/or epidemiological history (recently visiting epidemic countries and/or having recent contact with suspected or confirmed cases).Following the identification of suspected cases, nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples were collected, preserved in virus transport medium (VTM) and transported to a laboratory according to the WHO guidelines.Total RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Laboratory tests were carried out by a team from the National Influenza Centre (NIC), National Public Health Laboratory. Two consecutive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used; samples were initially screened with LightMix Sar-becoV E-gene plus Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV) (TIB MOL-BIOL, Berlin, Germany) that detects sarbecovirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-Cov-2). Positive samples were then confirmed by the Light-Mix Modular COVID-19 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene that detects SARS-Cov-2 only. The samples were also assayed using a detection kit for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA (PCR-fluorescence probing), targeting the N and ORF1b genes.On 27 January 2020, the first suspected cases were initially identified and samples were taken. Symptomatic suspected cases were isolated and quarantined in Gabra Hospital, one of the three health facilities designated as the Khartoum Isolation Centre. Demographics of the suspected cases showed that the majority (60%) were young adults 17-37 y of age and only 17% were ≥59 y of age. Males comprised 75% of the suspected cases (Table 1) .By 30 March, 150 suspected cases were identified and isolated; symptomatic cases were isolated in the governmental isolation centre, while asymptomatic cases were advised to self-isolate in their residences with frequent follow-up calls from the Ministry of Health response team. Based on the travel history to a country with a developing epidemic of COVID-19, contact with suspected cases and presenting symptoms, 150 suspected cases were identified and laboratory tested ( Table 2 ) and NPS samples were taken ( Fig. 1) .Most of the suspected cases (65%) presented with cough and 60% displayed fever. Difficulty breathing, pharyngitis and headache were experienced by 25%, 24% and 20%, respectively. However, 26% of the suspected cases were asymptomatic but were selected because of their epidemiological risk (Fig. 2) .The majority of the suspected cases (59%) were international travellers; most came from Egypt (37%), the United Arab Emirates (UAE; 18%), Saudi Arabia (14%) and China (12%) (Fig. 3) . Regardless of their country of travel origination or port of entry into Sudan, the majority (90%) were staying in Khartoum. However, some may have visited more than a single state. An additional 39 asymptomatic but suspected cases were identified from the contacts and companions of the original suspected and confirmed cases and they were advised to self-isolate at home and were closely monitored for clinical signs and symptoms even though they tested negative for COVID-19. In total, we traced and tested 60 individuals who have been in contact with the seven confirmed cases. Only seven of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and all recovered and were released from isolation after the WHO-recommended quarantine period of 14 d. Limited information was available about these contacts.All of the laboratory-confirmed imported cases of COVID-19 in Sudan so far have been males. The first case was a 50-year-old who arrived in the country on 2 March, coming from the UAE. He experienced cough, fever, headache and difficulty breathing. In <2 weeks, the second case, a 47-year-old, arrived from Spain displaying fever, cough, headache, pharyngitis and difficulty breathing. Soon thereafter, the third and fourth cases, ages 39 and 29 y, arrived from the UAE and presented with cough and fever. Additionally, the third case had headache, muscle pain and diarrhoea. The fifth and sixth cases were 67 and 59 y old, coming from France and the UAE, respectively, and both presented with cough, fever and difficulty breathing. The seventh case was a 65-year-old who arrived from South Africa and was suffering from fever only (Table 3) . Unfortunately, the first and sixth cases died due to COVID-19 complications, representing the first two deaths from this disease in Sudan and highlighting the high mortality rate (29%). The other five patients recovered (Table 3) . Here we report the first 7 laboratory-confirmed imported cases of COVID-19 in Sudan, including 2 deaths among 150 suspected and tested international travellers who arrived in country between 16 January and 30 March. Epidemiological investigations have shown that the first seven locally acquired infections were in recent contact with one or more of the confirmed imported cases of COVID-19. Some of the first locally acquired infections were reported among local healthcare providers without a history of travel but working in facilities that treated one or more of these imported cases. Because of the limited health system in Sudan, 8 the country is at high risk of a devastating epidemic. This risk is predicted to be intensified by the lack of data and information sharing in a timely manner, particularly during health emergencies. 16, 17 Additionally, the Sudanese population was desen-sitized about the risk of COVID-19 by the statement of the former Minister of Health, 'We managed to get rid of Omar al-Bashir. How come we cannot get hold of this tiny coronavirus?', which might have given the wrong impression that the COVID-19 pandemic could be easily managed in Sudan. 18 However, the NIC is working in coordination with the WHO country office to routinely update the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Interestingly, Sudan was free from the disease up to 2 March and even afterwards experienced a remarkably small number of imported COVID-19 cases. However, this could reflect the limited surveillance system, with additional cases being unidentified. 19 The severe clinical presentation of the cases we confirmed Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene suggests that late diagnoses occur because patients ignore their early, mild symptoms. 20 Although few patients in our study complained about diarrhoea, this sign should not be eliminated from consideration during the initial case screening at health facilities. 21 Sudan's national lockdown (international travel restriction) decision to limit the importation of cases was taken relatively late on 16 March. However, the majority of cases (57%) arrived during the period when the Khartoum International Airport was reopened between the 19 and 21 March to allow Sudanese citizens traveling abroad to return. Unfortunately this was done without adequate preparation and resources to screen all arrivals for signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to test them to confirm a lack of infection before allowing them into the general, susceptible population. The risk of more imported cases has been reduced by the government's emergency declaration and restrictions on all international travel involving the closure of all air, ground and sea entry points. Changes in control strategies and delays in decision making in other countries such as the USA has led to explosive epidemics including large numbers of cases and deaths. 22 The COVID-19 outbreak has grown exponentially from a single case on 19 January to >27 million cases and >880 000 fatalities worldwide by the first week of September 2020. 5, 20 Unfortunately, several travellers bypassed clinical screening at the Khartoum International Airport when it was reopened to allow Sudanese travellers to return. Those travellers may have ignored the health screening process at ports of entry because they had no health complaints. Nevertheless, they risked their own health, as well as the establishment of local transmission. 23 Regrettably, the Sudan health system is very limited, with poor capacity to provide intensive healthcare. Ministry of Health COVID-19 preparedness and response reports show that the country has only 296 ICU beds throughout the country. Therefore, with the establishment of local transmission, the consequences of caring for severely ill COVID-19 patients could be dire. 24 This was highlighted by a WHO report that Sudan is currently ranked the 14th country in Africa based on the number of confirmed cases (13 189), but 7th based on COVID-19 deaths (823). 5 In addition, diagnostic capacity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections in the country is very limited and is offered only by the NIC, which has extremely limited resources and qualified personnel. However, with support from the WHO, other regional diagnostic centres were established in the Red Sea, Gazira and South Darfur States following intensive training in the NIC. The Ministry of Health is advising people to stay home and is working to raise awareness about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and personal protective measures, including social distancing. Apparently these preventive guidelines are being challenged by some local societal traditions and norms, which resulted from years of neglect regarding health education. In addition, most of Sudanese society cannot adhere to the preventive measures, particularly to stay home, because of their limited financial resources. 10 Additional risk is resulting from the abundance of locally displaced persons, refugees and poor people in general. 12, 14, 15 These people rely heavily on daily work to secure their needs of food and other essentials. 10 Furthermore, they have poor sanitation and personal hygiene, further increasing their risk of COVID-19. 8, 17 Nonetheless, the Sudanese government advised residents of Khartoum State to secure their essential needs before the implementation of a 24-h lockdown order issued starting on 18 April. This has now been changed to a 12-h curfew between 06:00 and 18:00 h daily. 25 Our study was limited by the lack of sequencing services in Sudan and the restriction of international flights in and out of the country. Therefore we could not fully characterize SARS-CoV-2 samples. The Ministry of Health needs to establish critical diagnostic capabilities locally to generate more robust data for healthcare and research. 13The risk of COVID-19 in Sudan was limited following the initial lockdown of the Khartoum International Airport. However, this risk was significantly increased by the decision to reopen the airport without preparing and applying strict preventive measures and without resources to identify and test all the suspected cases arriving from high-risk areas. Because the country has inadequate resources to contain a local epidemic and a fragile health system, the risk of a major epidemic remains high despite the small number of COVID-19 cases (seven) and deaths (two) initially reported. The high initial mortality rate (29%) suggests a delay or lack of identification of cases, potentially reducing the effectiveness of available healthcare. The limited resources of the country, weak health system and lack of community adherence to personal protection guidelines provided by Ministry of Health suggest that a health disaster due to COVID-19 is inevitable. Enforcement of strict preventive measures, identification and testing of all suspected cases and their contacts, isolation of infected persons and proper care of all COVID-19 patients is urgently needed to avoid this outcome. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health needs to develop well-tailored risk communication messages to raise the awareness of local communities and promote personal protection measures and increase the adherence of the public to the announced health guidelines.Authors' contributions: ERA, ME, IM, RME, AE, AIA, SCW and AA conceived and designed the study.

The first COVID-19 case in Sudan was reported on March 13, 2020. The Government of Sudan immediately declared a national emergency [2] and enforced schools and universities closures [3] . Bans of mass gatherings [4] and border closures [5] followed shortly after. However, a reprieve in late March to let in stranded Sudanese travellers [6] may have resulted in the importation of more COVID-19 cases [7] . Following increasingly restrictive dusk-to-dawn curfews in Khartoum, the capital, a lockdown was started on April 18 2020 [8] , and, soon after, movement restrictions were extended to other parts of the country [7] .From the beginning, Sudan adopted a test, track and quarantine strategy for containment of the epidemic [9] . Like other African countries, Sudan acted early, instituting a lockdown when the country had recorded 66 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10 deaths [10] .COVID-19 comes to Sudan at a time of heightened political and economic fragility, after emerging from decades of authoritarian rule. The response in Sudan has been challenged by a pre-pandemic fragile health system, weak social protection systems and difficulties in accessing global emergency funding for COVID-19 [11] . Likely, the true magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic in Sudan is significantly underestimated by official statistics, as testing capacity is limited and fraught with operational and logistical difficulties [12] . Moreover, among 28 African countries, Sudan has the lowest levels of adherence to crucial prevention measures, such as mask-wearing, physical distancing and compliance with movement restrictions [13] , which may partially be due to severe economic hardship faced by the population during the epidemic.The shielding approach is premised on sound epidemiological principles that aim to reduce the number and duration of effective contacts among high-risk groups and therefore, their risk of infection [16] . However, the practical application of shielding in resource-poor settings may be challenging, and effective shielding strategies will need to be developed and adapted locally, in a manner that is acceptable and feasible to the different contexts [17] [18] [19] . In this study, we explored the acceptability and feasibility of shielding strategies in six illustrative communities in Sudan, to provide information to government and non-government COVID-19 responders in Sudan seeking to protect high-risk groups during the epidemic.This qualitative study was conducted in participation with Sudan's Youth Peer Education Network (Y-PEER Sudan), a nationwide network of trained youth volunteers active in promoting health and youth participation. At the time of the study, Y-PEER Sudan was conducting awareness-raising campaigns on COVID-19 prevention in communities across Sudan. We selected six communities in five Sudanese states, illustrative of different contextual settings. In Khartoum state, we selected Umbadda district, a high-density poor urban population, and Tuti Island, a close-knit agricultural community in the heart of the capital. We also selected two other urban communities, El-Obeid, a high-density city in North Kordofan State, and Damazin North, a peri-urban setting on the shared country border with South Sudan. Finally, we selected one rural village in the south of Gezira state, and one internally displaced person's (IDP) camp in South Darfur (Dereij IDP camp). At the time of planning in early April 2020, only Khartoum state had reported confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths.The study was conducted remotely, complying with safety precautions and movement restrictions due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Youth peers were trained remotely, through pre-recorded video and audio training sessions on qualitative research, shielding strategies, informed consent and study procedures, developed and delivered by the first author (NA). Training materials were shared via social media platforms, and this was followed by a live question and answer social media session with three co-authors (NA, NN and MD).Youth peers purposively identified eligible participants through their existing community contacts. We identified eleven participants in the second group through snowball sampling. In each study site, we aimed to interview 15 community members: 10 participants in the first phase, and 5 in the follow-up phase. We aimed to achieve a balanced sample of age and gender among household participants. We considered this sample size to be a manageable workload for volunteers working during an epidemic and the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in the first phase, and an epidemic and rainy season in the second phase. After a preliminary analysis of data for each site, we revisited the need to increase the sample size to reach data saturation.Semi-structured, in-depth telephone interviews were done by trained youth volunteers at a time convenient for consenting participants between May 10 and June 20, 2020, during the first round of data collection, and July 01 to August 10, 2020, in the second round. After obtaining participants' permission, all interviews were audiorecorded. The interviews lasted between 40 and 70 minutes.Interviewers used a pre-tested interview guide that contained open-ended questions. The interview guide covered the following topics: (1) knowledge of high-risk groups and protective measures for them, (2) the acceptability and feasibility of each of three shielding scenarios: (i) all extra-household activities are delegated to one family member who lives in a separate part of the house from the rest of the family, (ii) the high-risk person voluntarily shields, alone or with a carer, in a separate part of the house, (iii) neighbouring households or members of an extended family voluntarily 'house-swap' and group their high-risk members into dedicated houses, and, finally, (3) preferred and trusted sources and communication channels for information on COVID-19. Finally, participants were asked to suggest alternative or improved shielding strategies that would be suitable for their families or communities, and effective measures for promoting and implementing shielding in their communities.Interviews were conducted in Arabic.These groups discussions were recorded and used by the co-authors to develop a y report of preliminary findings for quick dissemination to Y-PEER Sudan, the Ministry of Health and other COVID-19 responders.The second stage was a thematic analysis using the transcripts. Data for each site was independently analysed for possible themes by the co-authors (NA, SAEA, NN, MD, IZ and AA). Themes were derived from the interview guide (deductive approach), by allowing emergent themes from the data (inductive approach) [20] . The analysis was then collated by the second author (SAEA) in a single spreadsheet. Through discussion amongst co-authors, consensus on themes and subthemes was reached, and categorisation was agreed. The themes were interpreted further and compared to the objectives of the study to generate the conclusions. Illustrative quotations were extracted by SAEA, translated into English by NA, and back-translated to Arabic by MAF. This article adheres to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) reporting guidelines [21] .We interviewed 89 participants: 59 during periods of movement restrictions and 30 participants after movement restrictions were eased ( Table 1 ). The first group consisted of 25 females and 24 males, with an average age of 34 years old (age ranging from 20 to 70 years). The second group of participants consisted of 25 males and 5 females, with an average age of 44 years old (age ranging from 20 years to 83 years).To protect people at high risk, a few participants mentioned that those living with them should wash their hands and change their clothes when returning home to avoid transmitting the infection within the household. However, the majority of participants reported measures for those at high risk themselves, such as maintaining their general health and well-being and reducing social contacts outside the household.""I have a special diet for [my father], and I give him vitamin C from time to time to boost his immunity, these are the things that I managed to do. I manage to keep him at home because he is elderly. For the rest of the family members, I look after them too, but I give him special care because he is the oldest person at home and is elderly, so he can be vulnerable to anything""male, 28 years, ElObeidTo reduce social contacts, participants mentioned advising older people to reduce or abandon social visits and gatherings, wear face masks and abstain from physical greetings outside the home. Other participants mentioned supportive measures to help those at high risk stay at home. For example, in El-Obeid, a participant reported that there was a local community-based initiative called ""Dawak Fi Beitak"" which arranges regular home delivery of medications to those with chronic illnesses.Delegation of extra-household activities to one family member who lives in a separate part of the house from the rest of the family In general, this strategy was acceptable to many participants, either fully or partially.""This is a very good suggestion. I am now using this strategy and applying it at home. I am the only one in the family who leaves the household for shopping -I bring anything that is needed. No one else leaves the house.""male, 28 years, El-Obeid Although many agreed that it is feasible to choose one household member for all extra-household activities, most were not convinced that isolating that person within the household is possible or necessary. Instead, most participants emphasised that the delegated person should adopt infection prevention measures when returning home, such as washing hands, changing clothes or bathing.""This first suggestion is the best one. Each household selects one family member to provide all their needs, but that person should not isolate themselveswhen they come from outside, they can put their clothes in the sun, and wash their hands with water and soap""male, 22 years, Tuti Island ""My husband always goes out to bring our household needs. He is very careful not to harm anyone or a child at home if he is feeling unwell or sick, but we have never isolated him, and we never willwe will not leave him alone"" -female, 43 years, UmbaddaOne participant reported concerns about isolation resulting in the stigmatisation of the delegated person:A few participants, particularly in Dereij IDP camp and Umbadda, reported a lack of space within low-income households to facilitate shielding.As with the first strategy, participants suggested the use of prevention and safety measures when dealing with elderly or high-risk persons at home, such as masks and handwashing, as an alternative to isolation.In this strategy, where there is not enough space for shielding within the home, neighbours or extended families voluntarily swap houses to give high-risk individuals and their carers a separate house to shield in, and a house for those at low risk to live in and continue to work. For most participants, this strategy was neither acceptable nor feasible.Several respondents suggested measures to help those at high-risk to stay at home, including the delivery of regular medications and home-based clinical monitoring services. Others emphasised the importance of maintaining access to health services for the elderly and those with chronic illnesses during the COVID-19 epidemic.Many participants mentioned that diverse mass communication channels should be used to broadcast information widely, including television, radio, social media, text messages and displaying visual materials in public places. Different channels reach different population groups. For example, social media is widely used by younger community members, especially in urban areas, whilst radio still plays a significant role in rural areas where internet coverage is low and televisions not widely present. Within their communities, many participants mentioned the use of mobile activities, such as vehicles with megaphones, and edutainment activities such as theatre.To complement mass communication, many participants mentioned the importance of using local, trusted persons to promote shielding. Influential community figures mentioned by participants included members of neighbourhood committees (primarily youth), religious leaders, teachers, local health workers and other community leaders, such as members of the local civil administration. In urban settings, local health workers, neighbourhood committees, religious leaders and family members were the most trusted persons, whereas in rural areas, family members, especially those working in the medical field, were influential. In the IDP camp, local community and religious leaders were the most credible sources of information. Some participants mentioned that trusted persons could use their existing platforms to share information, for example, imams giving sermons in mosques. Other participants suggested more in-person activities such as household visits with infection prevention precautions to families with high-risk family members.Several participants mentioned the importance of using local dialects and languages to reach all groups within the community, particularly the elderly, as many mentioned that current mass communication activities use formal language that is not widely understood or preferred by their communities. Other participants commented that some activities are inappropriately designed; for example, one participant mentioned that mobile megaphones travel too fast to be fully heard or operate at inappropriate times of the day.""I think awareness activities need to be continuous, especially in rural areas who may not have a television or radio. Awareness-raising activities using simple means can be implemented there, and they can use local dialects.Many [elderly] people now hear the megaphone from the street, and they ask me ""what are they saying?"" and I have to explain to them what is being said about COVID-19"" -female, 32 years, Dereij IDP camp Some participants recommended that positive messaging and language should be used to promote preventive behaviour, and to avoid promoting preventive behaviour by instigating fear in the population, through language such as ""the virus will kill you…"". Other participants recommended that high-risk community members need to be targeted with tailored risk communication to increase their understanding of their risk of severe illness and death, and to empower them to take measures, such as shielding, to protect themselves.Across the different study settings, the majority of participants knew that some individuals were at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, particularly the elderly. This high level of knowledge may be indicative of effective dissemination of information about COVID-19 through multiple channels across the study sites. Similar levels of adequate knowledge of groups at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes were reported in other low-and middle-income settings, including Kenya and Egypt [23, 24] . Despite that, only a few participants knew of measures to reduce intra-household contacts with persons at high risk. Many participants initially confused shielding with quarantine or isolation, and further information was needed to clarify the difference between these measuressimilar misunderstandings were reported by a study in Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [25] . Study participants were, however, positive when presented with concrete options for protecting high-risk family members within the household.Shielding of high-risk individuals was generally acceptable, and many participants' remarks referred to strong Sudanese traditions of protecting the elderly and the vulnerable. Consultations with crisis-affected communities in Yemen also reported acceptance of shielding within the context of strong cultural tendencies to protect the elderly and most vulnerable [25] . Similarly, a shielding intervention in Ethiopia leveraged a culture that values community solidarity and cohesion, where communities traditionally prioritise those most in need of protection [26] .Our findings indicate that there was no outright acceptance or rejection of any of the proposed shielding strategies.We also found that acceptability of shielding is not static, but is influenced by contextual changes, where enthusiasm for shielding had diminished in study communities after severe movement restrictions were eased.The new context was one where a change in government strategy fuelled widely-prevalent beliefs that the epidemic had indeed passed and created increased pressure to comply with social commitments. These findings are corroborated by previous research, which showed that both government response measures and perceived risk of the severity of respiratory infection epidemics had a significant influence on behavioural intentions towards social distancing [29] [30] [31] .In all our study communities, feasibility was a determinant of acceptability. Feasibility was challenged both socially and financially by study participants. Among the elderly, the loss of social capital due to eliminating social contacts outside the home, especially in mosques and social gatherings, was a significant barrier to the feasibility of shielding. Within the household, participants had concerns about the implications of segregation within the household on family well-being, with some suggesting less strict separation combined with infection and prevention measures such as maintaining hand hygiene within the household. Furthermore, a few participants raised doubts about the sustainability of full compliance with segregation within the household, particularly where none of the family members was unwell. These findings indicate that while shielding is widely acceptable, the effectiveness of shielding in these communities may be lower than predicted by mathematical models, which assume drastic reductions in contacts within the household [15] . Furthermore, this may indicate an intentionbehaviour gap amongst participants who accept household-level shielding but question their ability to implement or sustain it. Previous researchers have also shown that low self-efficacy attenuates behavioural intentions and behaviour adoption in the context of epidemics of respiratory infectious disease [29, 31, 32] .Our study has limitations. Firstly, in this study, we used interviews to explore the acceptability and feasibility of shielding. In acceptability research, focus group discussions are preferred over interviews as they have the advantage of allowing group members to collectively brainstorm and debate ideas, opinions, and recommendations [36] . However, given the movement restrictions posed by COVID-19, remote interviews were the appropriate choice for our study, and we are confident that we reached data saturation, as no additional themes emerged in the final interviews at any of the study sites. Secondly, we conducted the interviews remotely by telephone, which is subject to challenges including challenges to establishing rapport, absence of visual cues and contextual data, and the relatively short time of the interview to avoid respondent fatigue [37] [38] [39] . Thirdly, in this study, we inquired about the acceptability of a new concept of which the majority of study participants had no prior knowledge. It is possible that some participants provided their opinion without considering the implications of shielding on all aspects of their lives. However, given that reasons for and against acceptance were recurrent across participants and study sites, we are confident that this limitation had a minimal effect on the findings, probably in the direction of acceptance. Finally, given our study design, findings cannot be generalised to all Sudanese communities.Shielding promotion in the study communities should provide realistic options and practical guidance for minimising social contacts within households, and should be accompanied by financial and social interventions to support feasibility. Financial assistance by the Government of Sudan and other donors should be directed to interventions that support shielding, such as providing home-based treatment for shielded individuals, and direct financial support for families, including where the breadwinner is at high risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Sudan","abstract","2020-12-14",12

By October 10, 2020, the virus has infected more than 37 million people and has claimed more than one million lives. 2 The first case of COVID-19 in Ethiopia was diagnosed on March 13, 2020. As of October 10, 2020, Ethiopia recorded 82,662 cases and 1,271 deaths due to COVID-19. Since mid-January 2020, Ethiopia started to prepare for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Different preventive measures including physical distancing were introduced, starting from the last 2 weeks of March 2020, followed by the declaration of a state of emergency with different community containment measures. In addition, treatment centers were established across different parts of the country. 3 Until now, information about COVID-19 patients is mainly from China, Europa, and North America. There is a dearth of studies regarding COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa. Better understanding of the clinical and sociodemographic profiles, treatment options, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients from different parts of the world is crucial to get a full global picture.Based on pooled reports, the outcomes of COVID-19 seem different in Africa with lower mortality. 4 Late arrival of the disease, early preventive measures, and different sociodemographic conditions may have caused the difference. However, this is not yet supported by systematically designed studies, and the reasons causing this difference are not clear. Therefore, a better understanding of the patient profiles and outcomes in Africa is required. This will help to design better preventive and treatment strategies considering the local context. In this study, we described the clinical profile, treatment used, and outcome of COVID-19 patients in one of the COVID-19 treatment centers of Ethiopia, Boru Meda Hospital. In addition, we looked at factors associated with symptomatic cases as these groups of patients are at risk of developing severe disease.Study setting. Boru Meda Hospital is one of the five leprosy centers in Ethiopia which was founded in 1954. On May 9, 2020, it was changed to a dedicated COVID-19 center, as a referral site of the Eastern Amhara region. It was repurposed to have different compartments, including an intensive care unit (ICU), and male and female wards. The hospital has 100 beds, five mechanical ventilators, and two continuous positive airway pressure therapy machines.COVID-19 patients were identified through random testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic at-risk groups from bus stations, healthcare facilities, hotels, and banks. In addition, people coming from COVID-19 hot spots, contacts of confirmed cases, and clinically suspected cases were targeted in the testing strategy.All RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2-positive cases in the region were admitted to the hospital, regardless of the severity. The initial decision to admit all patients to treatment center was because of the inconvenience of home isolation and management in many Ethiopian settings. Severe and critical cases were admitted to the ICU, whereas the others remained in the general ward. The care of COVID-19 patients is given by a multidisciplinary team composed of nurses, general practitioners, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, internists, anesthetists, and other supporting staff.The management of COVID-19 in the center is in line with the national treatment guideline. Patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract viral infection and nonspecific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, anorexia, malaise, muscle pain, sore throat, dyspnea, nasal congestion, or headache are considered to have a mild infection. Among adults, moderate illness is described as a patient having mild pneumonia using CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, and blood pressure and 65 years of age or older) and in children with nonsevere pneumonia who have cough or difficulty breathing combined with tachypnea (³ 60 breaths/minute for age < 2 months, ³ 50 breaths/minute for age-group 2-11 months, and ³ 40 breaths/minute for age-group 1-5 years), and no signs of severe pneumonia. Severe illness is described as a patient having severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or sepsis responding to noninvasive management. In case patients do not respond to noninvasive management, or when there is respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure, it is considered critical illness. The management of asymptomatic and mild infection is supportive. Those with moderate or severe COVID-19 receive unfractionated heparin (UFH) and dexamethasone. However, no patients were recruited in the clinical trial of experimental drug. Noninvasive and invasive ventilation is recommended for patients desaturating while on intranasal oxygen. 5 Study design and population. All COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Boru Meda Hospital with positive RT-PCR from May 9, 2020 to September 20, 2020 were included in this retrospective observational study.Data collection procedures. For each case, the following data were extracted from the patient medical records: sociodemographic information, symptoms, risk factors, comorbidities, COVID-19 severity classification, treatment provided, duration of hospital stay, and treatment outcomes.Data management and analysis. The data extraction was performed by a trained health officer using a structured data extraction tool and entered using Epi-Data version 3.2 (Epi-Data Association, Odense, Denmark) and exported to SPSS version 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Descriptive analysis entailed the calculation of medians (interquartile range [IQR]), frequencies, and proportions (%) presented in the form of tables, graphs, and texts. To identify factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 disease, a binary logistic regression model was fitted. Variables with a P-value of less than 0.2 in the bivariable analysis were entered into the multivariable analysis to control for possible confounding factors. To assess the strength of the relationship between response and independent variables, adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% CIs were computed. Variables with a P-value of less than 0.05 in the multivariable model were considered significant factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 disease.Ethical considerations. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from Boru Meda Hospital management, Dessie, Ethiopia. Local ethics approval was secured from Ethics Committee of Wollo University, College of Medicine and Health Sciences.Sociodemographic characteristics. A total of 279 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis of the study. The median age of the patients was 28 years (IQR: 23-40), and more than one-third (35.1%) of patients were aged between 25 and 34 years. Most of the patients were male. Three were pregnant women, with a gestational age between 28 and 36 weeks, of which two were asymptomatic and one had mild symptoms (Table 1) .Clinical characteristics. The clinical profile of patients is described in Table 2 . Approximately a quarter (73; 26.2%) of patients were symptomatic, of which cough (n = 49; 67.1%), fever (n = 32; 43.8%), headache (n = 23; 31.5%), shortness of breath (n = 23; 31.5%), and fatigue (n = 20; 27.4%) were the most frequently reported symptoms (Figure 1 ). Thirty percent of symptomatic patients had a single presenting symptom, whereas 69.8% had two or more presenting symptoms; 46 (16.5%) patients had preexisting medical conditions, of which hypertension (n = 16; 34.7%), HIV/AIDS (n = 15; 32.1%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (n = 13; 28.2%), and asthma (n = 7; 15.2%) were the most common comorbidities, of which two patients had both HIV and DM, and four patients had both hypertension and DM. The median duration of illness of symptomatic patients was 5 days (IQR: 3-7). Chest X-ray was performed for only seven patients, of which five had lung infiltrates.Treatment. Investigations and management of patients are described in Table 3 . Unfractionated heparin was given for the majority of severe (n = 10; 83.3%) and all (n = 9; 100%) critical cases. Eighteen (6.5%) patients needed intranasal oxygen, of whom 11 (61.1%) needed a facemask for oxygen delivery; no patient was intubated. Dexamethasone 6 mg daily was given for 17 (6.1%) COVID-19 patients, for a median duration of 7 days (IQR: 5-8). Dexamethasone was given for one moderate, 10 (83.3%) severe, and six (66.7%) critical cases. The median duration of admission in the hospital was 13 days (IQR: [12] [13] [14] . The majority (n = 271; 97.1%) of patients were discharged with improvement, six (2.1%) patients died while on The world is generating evidence regarding COVID-19 rapidly. This has helped to understand the clinical profile and improve management of the disease. The severity and mortality of COVID-19 depends on several sociodemographic and clinical parameters which may differ per area. However, there is a paucity of evidence about African COVID-19. In this study, we described the clinical profile and treatment of all RT-PCRpositive cases in one of the treatment centers of Ethiopia.Most of our SARS-COV-2-infected patients were asymptomatic. This is much higher than that reported in other studies, which mostly identified cases through population-based testing. 6, 7 As most of these studies did not do longitudinal follow- up to assess for symptom development, it is likely that the proportion of patients who remain asymptomatic is even lower than that was reported. In our case, patients were admitted to hospital, and daily symptom assessment was performed by clinicians working in the COVID-19 treatment center, and therefore, we can confidently say they remained asymptomatic. The high percentage of asymptomatic patients may be explained by a large proportion of young patients. The testing strategy, which focused on at-risk populations with a high number of human contacts regardless of complaints, may also have caused this finding. In addition, the possibility of false-positive result cannot be ruled out. The role of asymptomatic individuals in disease transmission needs further studies. More than two-thirds of symptomatic patients had cough. This is much higher than that the large cohort CDC reported in the United States. 8 Whereas the percentage of symptomatic patients having fever, dyspnea, and headache was similar to that of other studies carried out in China and the United States, diarrhea, taste disturbances, and muscle pain were less common in this study. [8] [9] [10] Using fever as entry point for diagnosis of COVID-19 may be misleading as only less than half of symptomatic patients were febrile from this cohort. We stress here the importance of considering COVID-19 even in the absence of recorded fever and other compatible symptoms.Among symptomatic patients, nearly two-thirds had mild disease, which is less than the 80% recorded in the CDC report from China and comparable with results from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). 11, 12 Although the proportion of severe and critical illness was higher in our population, the overall case fatality rate was comparable to the China CDC report but much lower than that reported in the DRC study. This can be explained by difference in the admission criteria. However, unlike other reports, we had one death from a noncritical group with unidentified cause of death. 11 Diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and HIV/AIDS were common comorbidities. As age increased older than 25 years, the odds of being symptomatic also increased, with patients older than 45 years having the highest risk. Likewise, arterial hypertension and HIV/AIDS infection increased the odds of symptomatic disease. A study from South Africa also showed an association of HIV/AIDS infection with COVID-19 mortality, although results showed confounding bias may be an issue. 13 Further studies are needed to assess the effect of HIV/AIDS on the severity and mortality of COVID-19.Most of the moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 cases received intravenous antibiotics prophylactically, because diagnosing superimposed bacterial infections in this setting is difficult. Similarly, dexamethasone was given for most of the severe and critical cases, with one moderate patient also receiving dexamethasone. This is of particular concern as extrapolating evidence from Western settings may not work for our population where HIV/AIDS infection is quite common. In the face of already impaired immunity, this group of patients may be at increased risk of side effects. The use of UFH for severe and critical cases is consistent with recommendations from expert societies. 14 However, it was impossible to determine the baseline and follow-up coagulation profile in the study setting, and therefore, unwanted side effects of heparin including supratherapeutic coagulation profiles and heparininduced thrombocytopenia could not be monitored.This study has several strengths. First, it was possible to look the clinical profile of all patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 unlike other settings where only symptomatic cases are admitted. Second, symptom evaluation and severity assessment were performed in the hospital daily by treating clinicians. The limitations of the study include the lack of thorough investigations including chemistry and the coagulation profile, which made the clinical profile assessment incomplete. In addition, it was not possible to determine factors associated with severe disease and death because these events were rare.In this study, most of the COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, with an overall case fatality ratio of 2.1% and a median age of 28 years. Older age, HIV/AIDS, and arterial hypertension were independently associated with symptomatic COVID-19. The routine use of intravenous antibiotics for COVID-19 patients may impose the risk of unwanted side effects and can fuel antibiotic resistance. We stress the importance of developing clinical and laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial superinfection. Studies are urgently needed to see the effect of HIV/AIDS on the severity and mortality of the disease and the role of dexamethasone in decreasing mortality.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-12-30",12

Currently, most of the systematic evidence about CV19's impact in Africa comes from South Africa, which has documented >750,000 cases of CV19, >20,000 deaths and a case fatality rate of 2.7%. [6] [7] [8] The so-called 'Africa paradox' has been the focus of a number of editorials in prominent journals [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] proposing several explanatory theories. These include: 1) exposure to non-CV19 coronaviruses has induced cross-reactive herd immunity; 14 2) the younger age structure of African populations allows its populations to better tolerate CV19; 15 3) experience gained during the Ebola crisis allowed public health agencies across Africa to better contain CV19; 16 Guerin (BCG) vaccine, the oral polio vaccine and measles vaccines -engendered robust non-specific innate immune responses that also protect against CV19. [17] [18] [19] We postulate a more mundane explanation for the Africa paradox: insufficient data.Africa is the world's poorest continent. Disease surveillance is resource intense and takes time to establish de novo, challenges that are magnified in a global health emergency. CV19 deaths might be challenging to identify among countries with limited resources to establish new disease surveillance systems, particularly in countries with already high background mortality rates.Since 2017, our team has been conducting systematic post-mortem surveillance for respiratory pathogens among deceased infants in Lusaka, Zambia. With the onset of the CV19 pandemic, we were able to quickly amend our study to expand surveillance to include all age groups and to test for CV19. We present results from the first three months of surveillance. Counter to expectations, CV19 deaths proved to be common.According to the World Bank, Zambia is a poor country that ranked 117 th out of 128 countries in terms of economic competitiveness in 2007. 20 Its economy has been stalled since 2015 due to falling copper prices, and with the CV19 pandemic, its economy was predicted to contract in 2021 by 4.5%. 20 Zambia's public debt burden is 60% of its gross domestic product, and over 50% of Zambians live below the poverty line. 21 The capital Lusaka has ~2 million citizens and is Zambia's largest city. 22 In Lusaka, the majority of the urban poor live in densely crowded peri-urban slums where there are few places to avoid crowds, making it difficult to practice social spacing.According to the study staff, masks were difficult to obtain and seldom worn by the general Lusaka population during this time.The Zambia Pertussis RSV Infant Mortality Estimation study (ZPRIME) was launched in August 2017 to measure the post-mortem prevalence of these two diseases among young infants in southern Africa (Lusaka, Zambia). While Lusaka has dozens of health facilities, few can issue the death certificates that are legally required to inter a body.In June 2020, we amended our protocol to expand enrollment to deceased individuals of all ages and to add CV19 PCR testing. Other than these changes of scope, ZPRIME's protocol did not change. Ethical oversight for ZPRIME and the CV19 expansion were provided by the Institutional Review Boards at Boston University and the University of Zambia. Written informed consent was obtained from the deceased's family members or representatives.For the CV19 study expansion, we enrolled deceased individuals who either died in the community or at a facility in Lusaka. We define 'facility deaths' as those that occurred under care at UTH. All other deaths were defined as 'community deaths', which may have included deaths referred to UTH from smaller facilities in Lusaka. From each deceased individual, we tabulated sex, age, location of death (facility vs. community), geographic location of the death within Lusaka, presenting symptoms, underlying risk factors, and the results of antemortem CV19 PCR testing (if any).Enrollment occurred as next of kin came to claim the bodies of their loved ones at the UTH morgue. Our only exclusion criterion was enrollment > 48 hours after death to reduce the risk of false negative PCR results from degradation of viral RNA. An abbreviated grief counselling session was offered unconditionally to the family members. Due to the high volume of deaths, and our team's finite capacity, we only enrolled Monday through Friday, 9AM to 5PM. During these times, we enrolled every fifth death during July and every third death in August, with a daily cap of ~5 deaths per day in both cases. In September, after the ZPRIME infant study ended allowing our full team to focus on the CV19 project, we enrolled at a 1:1 ratio without a daily cap. Since the enrollments were done prior to assessing clinical data, such as symptoms at presentation, and prior to CV19 testing, this approach should not have introduced any selection bias.Nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were taken using flocked-tipped nylon swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta CA), sized for infants or adults as required. 24 25 Swabs were inserted into both nares, advanced until they reached the posterior nasopharynx and then rotated 180 degrees in both directions. Samples were immediately placed in universal transport media on ice or in cool boxes at 4-8C, and transported to our on-site PCR lab for accession, aliquoting and storage at -80C. Our lab is located ~50 yards from the morgue, allowing samples to be transported within minutes of collection.In addition to running positive and negative controls on each assay plate, both assays included qPCR against the constitutively expressed human RNAseP gene for each sample as a quality control measure demonstrating adequacy of sample collection and nucleic acid extraction, and the absence of PCR inhibition.We calculated a simple prevalence of CV19 by dividing the number of deaths where CV19 was detected by all deaths in the enrolled sample. We conducted no modeling and did not use imputation. We stratified deaths by sex, age, geography, and location (facility vs. community deaths). A key distinction is that individuals who died at UTH could have been tested for CV19 antemortem, whereas there was far more limited capacity for CV19 testing in the community.To examine the distribution of age at death, we cataloged age -tratified death statistics from the Zambian government's official burial registry during the surveillance period.This allowed us to construct a contemporaneous death-by-age distribution to infer whether our enrolled sample was representative of all deaths during this period and whether the subset of CV19+ deaths followed a similar distribution.We used ArcGIS (Esri Inc, Redlands, CA) software to map the locations of the deaths within Lusaka. We pulled population size data from the Zambia Data Hub: https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/, which is managed by the Government of Zambia through the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, and the Zambia Statistics Agency. We downloaded these ArcGIS layers to the level of Lusaka's city wards.1) Probable CV19, which included those with any combination of witnessed or reported cough, fever, upper respiratory symptoms, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.2) Possible CV19, which included individuals presenting with symptoms that may reflect common sequellae of CV19, such as apparent or confirmed stroke, myocardial infarction, sudden onsent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea;3) Probably not CV19, which included patients for whom medical data indicated a non-CV19 cause of death; and 4) Uncertain, for individuals lacking sufficient data to allow for adjudication.Between June 15 and Oct 01, 2020, our team enrolled 372 deceased individuals, ranging in age from <1 year to 105 years. Consent rates were 99.5%, and the main reason for non-consent was among Muslim families who cited conflicts with their cultural burial practices. Ten samples could not be matched to enrollments, leaving 362/372 (97.3%) with samples for testing. In addition, we included two individuals who had been tested positive for CV19 antemortem outside of the study, for a total of 364 deaths in our analytic sample. For the 362 tested in our lab, all had RNAseP results with CT<35 indicating adequacy of the sampling collection and DNA extraction processes. We did not have RNaseP results for the two individuals tested antemortem at a different lab.Using the stricter PCR threshold of a CT<40, 58/364 (15.9%) were CV19 positive.When expanding that to individuals with any detectable level of the virus (i.e., CT values from 40 to 45), we identified a further twelve CV19+ deaths, bringing the total to a presumptive prevalence of CV19 in 70/364 cases (19.2%).Among the 70 CV19+ deaths, antemortem testing for CV19 had rarely been performed.Among the facility deaths, only 6/19 (31.6%) had been tested antemortem. Among the majority of 51/70 that were community deaths, none had been tested for CV19 antemortem.CV19+ deaths were detected throughout the entire period of observation, with notable week to week variation over time (Figure 1) . As a proportion of deaths, CV19 deaths were most common in late July to early August 2020.Overall, 70% of the CV19+ deceased were male, with a similar male to female ratio among the facility and community deaths (Figure 2 ). By comparison, in the burial registry, 60% of deaths were male and 40% were female. Thus men appeared to be over-represented among CV19+ deaths.The median age among the CV19 deaths was 48 years (IQR 36-72 years). The median age among community deaths was 47 years (IQR 34-72 years), and was somewhat older among facility deaths at 55 years (IQR 38-73 years). Figure 3a provides the numbers of deaths across the age distribution, while Figure 3b presents these as a proportion of deaths that were CV19+ within each stratum. There were several deaths in children < 19 years, within which we observed 5 (or 7) CV19+ deaths, depending on the CT threshold.Overall, the age distribution for the enrolled cohort closely matched the age distribution from the complete set of deaths from the burial registry, suggesting that our sample was representative of the overall distribution of deaths by age. By contrast, the CV19+ deaths were somewhat underrepresented among those aged 0-39 years, and somewhat overrepresented among those aged 60 and above. While CV19 deaths in children were less common than other age groups, using the stricter CT threshold <40, we documented CV19 among five deaths in children <19 years. Two more children had detectable PCR signals with a CT Table 2 . In contrast with the adult population, who mainly presented with respiratory symptoms, among the children, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pains) were most common, and only one had respiratory symptoms. While the pediatric deaths account for only 10% of all CV19 deaths detected during this time, this ratio is nonetheless uncharacteristically high.One or more potential underlying risk factors were identified in nearly all of the CV19 associated deaths in adults ( Table 3) . The most common conditions occurring in at least 10% of the cohort were, in declining order of prevalence: tuberculosis (31.4%), hypertension (27.1%), HIV/AIDS (22.9%), alcohol use (17.1%), and diabetes (12.9%). A recent diagnosis of malaria was mentioned several times. However, absent laboratory confirmation of this diagnosis, we interpreted this skeptically: malaria has effectively been eliminated from Lusaka yet still is often diagnosed on the basis of unexplained fever or malaise without laboratory confirmation, symptoms that could easily have been due to CV19 itself. Other than one child with epillepsy and developmental delay, none of the children had identified co-morbidities.Several points merit further discussion.First, most deaths occurred in the community and outside of medical care. Among the majority that were community deaths, none had been tested for CV19 antemortem. This is undoubtedly a significant factor in underestimating the impact of CV19 in Lusaka.Second, testing was rarely conducted among the minority that were facility deaths, though nearly all had presented with a constellation of symptoms typical of CV19. We conclude that testing was neither widespread nor systematic.Third, CV19 deaths occurred quite evenly across the age spectrum, not just among the elderly. In fact, most deaths were among indivduals aged 20-59 years. This pattern is distinct from that described in the US, the EU and China, [28] [29] [30] and more typical of the death by age distributions and population age structures common in African countries.While there was a relative under-representation of CV19 in the younger population and a relative over representation in the older population, overall, the distribution of CV19+ deaths was similar to that seen in the burial registry cohort, therefore supporting the theory that the presentation of CV19 by age in this cohort is at least partially due to the expected distribution of deaths in Lusaka.Fourth, ten percent (7/70) of the CV19+ deaths were in children, including three infants.Among the younger children, gastrointestinal rather than respiratory complaints predominated, which may be a factor explaining why only one had been tested for CV19 antemortem. In its November 19, 2020 update, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported that children accounted for between 0.00%-0.23% of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States, with 17 states reporting no child deaths. 31 Given the extreme rarity of pediatric CV19 deaths in high income countries, we were surprised to observe any pediatric deaths in a group of seventy, let alone seven CV19+ deaths. This suggests another distinct feature of CV19's presentation in Africa.If our data are generalizable to other settings in Africa, the answer to the question, 'Why did CV19 skip Africa?' is that it didn't.To date, most of the systematically collected data about CV19 in Africa comes from South Africa, and those data suggest a substantial impact of CV19. [6] [7] [8] But South Africa is a comparatively wealthy nation with significant resources and expertise in surveillance. This makes it unrepresentative of most other African nations, including Zambia. Elsewhere it is difficult to find evidence of widespread systematic testing in Africa. From sampling of blood donors, Kenya has reported seroprevalence rates among blood donors between 5-9%, even as PCR positivity was reportedly low. 34 However, blood donors are probably not representative of the general population. As of November 24, 2020, the Nigerian CDC reported that only 0.3% of its population had been tested for CV19. 35 Neither Nigeria nor Kenya reported the impact of CV19 in terms of hospitalizations or deaths. Across the continent, as of October 30, 2020, the Africa Centers for Disease Control reported a cumulative total of 21 million CV19 tests of which ~60% came from only five of Africa's 54 countries: South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Kenya and Ethiopia. 36 By contrast, the US, a country with less than one third the population of Africa, has conducted over 192 million CV19 tests, for a per capita rate nearly 30 times higher. 37 Given these realities, an 'absence of evidence' documenting CV19's impact in Africa could easily be misconstrued as 'evidence of absence'.The consequences of the misconception in both cases would be measured in lives.Our analysis had several limitations. First, our data were collected over a short span of several months. Within this period, we saw dynamic shifts in the bi-weekly prevalence of CV19+ deaths. There is no way to predict how CV19's patterns of transmission might shift in the future, which justifies our ongoing surveillance work. Second, our study could only infer links between deaths and CV19 when a PCR signal was detectable.This would fail to identify deaths indirectly due to CV19, such as heart attacks or strokes, that were separated in time from the CV19 infection. In an attempt to quantify the degree of excess mortality indirectly attributable to CV19, we are currently collecting age-and season-specific burial records from Lusaka from the past several years. Third, our assessment of underlying risk factors was limited by the completeness and accuracy of medical chart data and the possibly faulty recall of the next of kin. Hence, there was no way to verify these conditions, nor to assess their duration and severity.An analysis of the association between potential risk factors and CV19 deaths is currently underway in our group. Fourth, because the consequences of CV19 infection are age-specific, our data cannot be used to infer the incidence of CV19 in the larger population, but can only tell us about the prevalence of CV19 deaths across age groups. Lastly, our results came from one city, in one African country, over a short three-month span.In conclusion, contradicting the prevailing narrative that CV19 has spared Africa, CV19 has had a severe impact in Zambia. How this was missed is largely explained by low testing rates, not by a low prevalence of CV19. Yet to avoid casting blame on Zambia, we note that the wealthiest countries on earth have struggled to test for and contain CV19. Can we be surprised that a resource poor country would also struggle to respond effectively to the greatest global public health emergency since HIV/AIDS? Establishing systematic disease surveillance requires time and significant resources.We wish to dedicate this paper to the memory of our beloved team member Dr. RoyChavuma. Roy was one of countless many who were lost to CV19 this year. He was an outstanding surgeon, a devoted public heatlh professional, and an inspired mentor to dozens of young clinicians and future scientists over many decades of service. But he was primarily our dear friend. His laughter and optimism kept our spirits high in the darkest of times. He will be missed but not forgotten.The ZPRIME study and the CV19 expansion were made possible through the generous support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP 1163027).(which was not certified by peer review).","Zambia","abstract","2020-12-24",12

Just after two years the country took its independence from Sudan, civil conflicts sparked and continue to overburden and undermine the fragile healthcare system. The conflicts have caused disruption of health services, destruction of health facilities, death and migration of health workers, displacements of a huge number of people. This scenario continues while the country is grappling with the pandemic. Other concerning issues include: insufficient COVID-19 testing capacity, limited medical and personal protective equipment and an inadequate number of health workers which leave the country ill-equipped in the battle against the pandemic. Non-compliance of COVID-19 prevention protocols by the general public due to high rate of poverty and social stigma contribute to the spread of the virus. The current situation in South Sudan make evident that there is a need for an immediate ceasefire by the warring sides so the available health services including COVID-19 efforts, are not disrupted to ensure the safety of all. The government needs to further build the capacity of its health sector with the cooperation of its international health allies to be able to provide its citizens with the health services they need.Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health threat of international concern [1], afflicting many countries across the world including African countries. South Sudan confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on 5 th April 2020. It was a 29 years old female returnee from the Netherlands, making it the 44 th African country infected with the virus. Following the confirmation of the first few cases, the concerns of South Sudan´s National Ministry of Health and its health partners including the World Health Organization (WHO) were raised, thus, some preventive measures were devised to curb the spread of the virus. These precautionary measures included the ban on public gatherings, closure of all academic institutions, suspension of local and international flights and borders [2], imposition of nationwide curfew, closure of religious institutions and decongestion of some prisons [3] . These preventive measures were timely and similar to those implemented by some developed countries, but not the sole determinants of the course of the pandemic. Thus, in this article, we aim to provide a critical commentary on a series of challenges that couple to form the underlying factors in undermining the country´s healthcare system and, thus, deterring the containment efforts.Conflict severely disrupts health interventions, deprive people of health services and cripple health systems [4] . Just two years after South Sudan took her independence from Sudan, the conflicts sparked and since then continues to be a formidable threat for the country´s healthcare system and damages it on a large scale. A huge number of health facilities have been targeted and destructed to ashes by various warring sides [5] . Many professionals and trained health staff left the country due to the violence as they do not opt to work in insecure areas [5] . Conflicts affect health systems by hampering disease management strategies and efforts and ultimately result in forced displacement and migration. It also creates the burden of infectious diseases and disrupts public health responses. International and national Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) with the cooperation of humanitarian agencies have tried for years to provide health services for underprivileged communities, however, their efforts have been threatened by insecurity and the lives of some of their workers have also been claimed. A spate of conflicts has invariably resulted in geographical displacement of affected populations, loss of lives, and properties [2]. The internally displaced people are more vulnerable to the infective diseases including COVID-19. Amidst the pandemic, around one and half million people have limited access to basic health services and inhabit in conditions in which social distancing is not possible [3] . The geographical displacements may make social distancing very difficult to adhere to as populations may ignore social distancing protocols while moving in clusters and congested public transport systems in quest for better living conditions and comfortable settlements. People have been longing for peace and stability so, among other benefits associated with it, they would also receive the essential health services without any disturbance. However, most peace negotiations and accords were merely on the papers and hence a failure.The preparedness of the youngest country of the world in responding efficiently to the pandemic is waned due to its weak healthcare system. Most of the health facilities are ill-equipped [6, 7] and cannot meet the demands of the people, exemplified by the presence of only one permanent hospital ward with less than 100 beds, to treat infectious diseases of the 11 million population [3] . Over half of the government´s healthcare facilities are malfunctioned and understaffed. The country is facing shortages of intensive care units (ICU) and mechanical ventilators [8] and a handful of oxygen concentrators exist for the management of severe cases. WHO´s Global Health Workforce Alliance states that 22.8 skilled health workers per 10,000 population are needed to perform all the essential health interventions. However, there are less than 10 disproportionately distributed health workers per 10,000 people in the country [9] . High level of illiteracy and unawareness are other barriers against the containment efforts.As it was envisaged that the pandemic in South Sudan would reach its peak in July and August [8] , the disease transmission reached significantly high proportions. As of 7 th December 2020, the country reported 3,166 confirmed cases and 61 deaths [10] , most of which have been reported after relaxation of the restrictions on 7 th May 2020 [3] . The current indicators show that the virus has been spreading in the country particularly in vulnerable places like six crowded United Nations´ camps for displaced people in South Sudan, three of which lack screening at their gates [3] . The pandemic has crippled the young nation´s health system, economy, and overall livelihood [2]. Poverty and hunger have become the order of the day and the people are merely struggling to survive and many found themselves forced to violate the restrictions in quest for food and survival [8] due to lack of the government´s assistance [3] . Insufficient testing capacity coupled with social stigma [3, 7] and noncompliance of COVID-19 prevention protocols such as self-isolation by the people has made the accurate documentation and containment of the disease prevalence difficult.The present situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Sudan validates the prediction made by the United Nations that the pandemic will lead to an overwhelming increase in deaths [8] due to multiple factors tied to a lack of vaccination services of preventable diseases, decrease in maternal health services, and disruption of routine management of common diseases such as malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea [7, 8] and malnutrition [2]. People die from preventable diseases such as measles, cholera, and malaria at the hospitals due to lack of health services. Another concerning issue of public health worth highlighting is the condition of healthcare providers in South Sudan in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), 86 health workers in the country were infected as of 23 rd June 2020 [7] . Also, the salaries of health workers have been left unpaid ever since the inception of their services in the battle against the pandemic [7] . A possible implication is that this will have a corresponding impact on the quality of healthcare delivery due to a generally low level of motivation and compromised safety.The current situation in South Sudan requires the warring sides to reach an agreement on an immediate ceasefire so the available health services including COVID-19 efforts are not disrupted to ensure the safety of all. The country is ill-equipped in providing its citizens with health services. Thus, the government needs to further build the capacity of its health sector with the cooperation of its international health allies.","South Sudan","abstract","2020-12-17",12

As of November 18, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread to more than 213 countries and territories with approximately 55.9 million confirmed cases and~2.4% mortality [1, 2] . Humans have experienced several novel viral outbreaks, such as Ebola virus disease (EBOV) a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 and H1N1, in 2009 and 2013-2016, respectively. The main reservoir for EBOV is considered to be bats where the magnitude of its outbreak was unprecedented, with > 28 500 reported cases and > 11 000 deaths in West Africa [3] . On the other hand, swine H1N1 spread rapidly throughout the world, leading the WHO to declare it a pandemic on June 11, 2009 [4] . A typical biological response to different viral infections could be identified, where some particular genes are dysregulated during an infection by specific viruses. Such responses may have a major impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response. For instance, both MERS and SARS-CoV induce a similar pattern of activation of recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway [5] .We compared the transcriptomic data of SAR-CoV-2 to that of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, H1N1, and EBOV. We focused our analysis on viral infections that are evolutionarily related to SAR-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), have the same aggressiveness (EBOV), or attack the same human organs (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, H1N1, EBOV). We identified common and specific differentially expressed genes in the response to SARS-CoV-2 that are shared with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H1N1, and EBOV. We performed chromosomal location, gene ontology and protein-protein interactions analyses for these genes in order to understand SARS-CoV-2's unusually high infection and mortality rates.The gene expression data of SARS-CoV-2, EBOV, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV were retrieved from the NCBI-GEO archive [6] , with ID GSE147507, GSE86539, GSE21802, GSE100504, and GSE17400, respectively. These data are based on Affymetrix human genome gene chip sets and Illumina NextSeq 500, revealing the gene expression profiles of in vitro and in vivo infections (S1 Table) .Due to the difficulty of finding different data that are produced using a common cell line infected by the five viruses studied, we have adopted a specific procedure to focus on DEGs, which reflects a variation in the response of the host to the type of virus rather than the experimental conditions. Data analysis for all viral infections used was conducted on a stand-alone basis, where control/reference samples were used as a baseline for each experiment. This step should decrease background gene expression and illuminate those related to host response to infection. Additionally, we focused on the analysis of induced genes that are common between SARS-CoV-2 and the other four viral infections, discarding genes that are not expressed in SARS-CoV-2, which adds additional filter layer. Using control samples, and focusing on these common genes were used to encounter the possible gene expression differences specific to each cell type (Fig 1) .The identification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the transcription profile was performed with the GEO2R tool [7] and differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and DEApp (fold change � 1.5 and FDR adjusted p-value �0.01) [8] using default parameters. All transcriptomic profiles consist of control cell and infected cells, where the control cells were used as the baseline for DEGs analysis, using the default setting of all programs mentioned in the Methods section. To avoid expression profiles linked to cell types or infection conditions and to shed more light on gene expression that reveals a unique SARS-CoV-2 signature of the host response, we excluded all genes that were not expressed in response to SARS-CoV-2, focusing on genes that were shared between the gene profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and the other viruses. The DEGs were characterized for each sample (p-value � 0.01) and were used as queries to search for enriched biological processes. The Gplot package in R was used to construct the gene expression heatmaps. The evaluation of the protein interactions and gene ontology (GO) enrichment was conducted with the STRING database [9] . Cytoscape software was used to visualize the structures of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks [10] . Circos software and GeneSyno [11, 12] was used to represent gene expression and gene ontology analysis of the host response to viral infections based on human genome data (GRCh38). The online tool Draw Venn Diagram (http:/bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) was used to sketch a Venn diagram demonstrating some analysis information. PERL Python and R programming language scripts used to perform these analyzes are freely available at https://github. com/AlsammanAlsamman/Alsamman-and-Zayed-SARS-CoV-2.We investigated the unique transcriptomic gene expression signature that was induced by the infection of SARS-CoV-2 (GSE147507) compared to EBOV (GSE86539), H1N1 (GSE21802), MERS-CoV (GSE100504), and SARS-CoV (GSE17400). DEGs were investigated in each profile. The chromosome locations of these DEG sets are categorized according to the viral infection in We identified 358 DEGs with a significant associated p-value < 0.01 to SARS-CoV-2. Of these, SAA2, CCL20, and IL8 were highly significant (Fig 2B and S2 Table) . The analysis of gene enrichment of DEGs associated with the host response to SARS-CoV-2 highlighted several GO terms (Fig 3) , including leukocyte activation, humoral immunity, myeloid cell activation, neutrophil activation, tuberculosis response, and miRNA involvement in the immune response. Additionally, GO terms that are correlated with cell death were highly and consistently regulated in all viral infections (Fig 3C and 3E) . GO cytokine response terms, IL-17 signaling pathway, NF-kB signaling, TNF signaling pathway, and NF-kappa B signaling were among the most significant pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 3B) .We particularly focused on the analysis of DEGs induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection and its overlap with the other four viral infections. We found 173 DEGs were unique to The transcriptomic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS, MERS, EBOV, and H1N1 SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4 and S3 Table) . Of these genes, SAA2 was the most significant (-10logp-value of 81) (S2 Table) ; the distinctive genes in the SARS-CoV-2's infection response were CSF3, CSF2, IL1B, and PTGS2 (S2 Table) . GO analysis demonstrated that these genes were linked to the IL-17 signaling pathway and were induced as a response to Rhinovirus infection (S1 Fig). Overall, the biologic process terms, such as keratinocyte/ epithelial cell differentiation, organ development, cell component movement and cell death, were very significant among these genes (S4 Table) , and molecular functions such as RAGE receptor binding, cytokine activity, and metal ion binding were also highly recognized (S4 Table) . The transcriptomic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS, MERS, EBOV, and H1N1Comparative gene expression analysis of the five viral infections (SARS-CoV-2, EBOV, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) yielded SERPINB1 as the common response gene among the five infections. SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV shared 58 DEGs, including TNIP1, ICAM1, and CFB that were highly significant (-10logp-value > 40), while genes such as TLR2, FOXO1, and MYC were highly associated with cytokine response and cell death (S2 Fig and S2 Table) . The GO molecular terms of these genes highlighted the biological functions of phospholipase inhibitor activity (including phospholipase A2) and heparin binding (including glycosaminoglycan). While biological processes such as cell surface receptor signaling pathways and cell death were The transcriptomic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS, MERS, EBOV, and H1N1 significantly represented by a large number of genes (S4 Table) . The MERS-CoV-shared genes KRT6B and TNFAIP3 had a high p-value associated with SARS-CoV-2, whereas genes such as OAS1-3, IRF9, IRF7, STAT1, PML and IFIH1 were highly associated with host responses to viral infections and type I interferon (S3 Fig). Biological processes related to virus response, Type I interferon signaling and the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway were highly redundant, while the biological functions of 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase activity, double-stranded RNA binding, adenyltransferase activity, metal ion binding and related to growth activity, such as epidermal growth, were quite significant (S4 Table) .SARS-CoV-2, EBOV, and MERS-CoV share uniquely 31 genes, of which BIRC3, MX1, and IL8 are strongly linked to SARS-CoV-2 (-logp-value 23, 37, and 105, respectively) (Fig 4 and  S2 and S3 Tables). Among these genes, DDX58 and IFIT1 are highly associated with cytokine response, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and immune responses to virus infection (S4 Fig). On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV shared 30 genes (S3 Table) , of which 11 genes were unique to both viruses (Fig 4) . These genes are involved in immune system regulation, some of which are associated with the host response to rheumatoid arthritis (CCL20, IL1A, and MMP1). CCL20 and INHBA were significantly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection (10logp-value of > 40). Interestingly, genes related to vitamin D regulation (CYP27B1), inflammation (IRAK3) and pulmonary fibrosis (MMP1) were significantly induced by both viruses. The GO analysis showed that four GO terms were uniquely shared between SARS--CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (S3 Table) and also with legionellosis and amoebiasis infection. The intersection of DEGs between SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 showed 15 genes were uniquely shared (S3 Table) . Some of these genes were associated with neutrophil degranulation (B4GALT1, VNN1, LCN2, CSTB, and CTSC). SAA1 was highly associated with SARS-CoV-2 (10logpvalue = 55) (S2 Table) , and it has been reported to be involved in the host response to amyloidosis and rheumatoid arthritis [13] . In addition, 3 GO terms were uniquely shared between the two virus infections (GO:0031983, GO:0034774, and GO:0060205), which were mainly linked to the lumen vesicles. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, and SARS-CoV shared overexpression of MAF compared with EBOV and MERS-CoV. The MAF transcription factor is a key component in the immune response to several diseases, regulating disease-specific gene networks [14] .The gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlighted genes such as MX1, BIRC3, IRAK2, CXCL5, NRCAM, FGF1, MMP9, SAA1, LCN2, IFI27, TNFAIP3, OAS1, IL6, XAF1, IL8, and CXCL3 compared to EBOV, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The host gene expression of these genes changed exponentially relative to other viral infections (Figs 2 and S5 and S3 Table) . These genes are mostly related to the IL-17 signaling pathway, the TNF signaling pathway, and the host response against viral infection (S6 Fig) .Analysis of gene enrichment showed that only three GO terms were shared between SARS--CoV-2 and the other viral infections (Fig 5 and S3 Table) , including cellular component, protein binding and cytoplasm. SARS-CoV-2 was uniquely characterized by 535 GO terms, The transcriptomic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS, MERS, EBOV, and H1N1including stimulus response, cell communication, and defense response to bacterial infection (S6 Table) . SARS-CoV-2 shared 96 GO terms with EBOV, where GO terms related to the regulation of cell death were substantially shared. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV uniquely shared 32 GO terms, most of which were linked to the cell defense against viral infection and immunity, and metal ion response (Fig 5 and S3 and S6 Tables) .We used the PPI association network analysis to identify the shared DEGs between SARS--CoV-2 and the other four viral infections. Genes have been clustered into groups according to their interaction activity, where genes with an equal number of interactions are clustered into one group, where genes have been classified according to the type of infection they are involved in (Fig 6) . The PPI network clustering highlighted genes such as IL6, TNF, IL8, VEGFA, IL1B, MMP9, STAT1, TLR1, CXCL1, ICAM1, TLR2, and IRF7 with high interaction activity. Some genes were associated with both SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV, and a few were shared with MERS-CoV (Fig 6) . The PPI analysis and gene enrichment analysis of these hyper-interactive genes showed significant biological functions connected to the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and the host response to rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, hepatitis B, and influenza A (Fig 7) .This study mainly aimed to determine the unique host gene expression signature response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, EBOV, and H1N1, which will help us to understand the differences and similarities in host responses to various respiratory viruses. Although the cell lines were different in each viral infection, we studied only the DEGs associated with SARS-CoV-2 that were similar to other viral infection responses. To our The transcriptomic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS, MERS, EBOV, and H1N1 knowledge, this is the first study to perform such a transcriptomic comparison among these five viral infections.The analysis of DEGs to SARS-CoV-2 infection identified the SAA2, CCL20, and IL8 genes as being significantly induced (Fig 2B and S2 Table) . Recently, a link between the serum amyloid A 2 (SAA2) gene and SARS-CoV-2 infection has been proposed as a biomarker to differentiate the severity and prognosis of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection [15] . In addition, we observed the uniqueness of the SAA2 gene expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, EBOV, and H1N1 viral infections (Fig 4 and S3 Table) . Multiple genes belonging to the interleukin gene family, such as IL6, CXCL1, 3 and 5, and IL-17, demonstrated significant responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig 2 and S2 Table) . In addition, the IL8 gene, which has been related to immune stimulus and is a recognized locus of susceptibility to a specific respiratory virus, was also induced [16] . Such genes serve as key factors for controlling the growth of endothelial cells, which is a major player in SARS-CoV-2 infection [17, 18] .GO-based gene enrichment analysis demonstrated that many involved biological processes were closely related to the immune response (Fig 3A) , including myeloid cell activation and neutrophil activation (Fig 3C and 3E) . Interestingly, the miRNAs-related gene pathways were overexpressed as a response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they are known to play an important role against viral infection [19] . Activation of miRNAs as a defense mechanism during lung infection could be related to their important roles in physiological and pathological processes in the lung [20] . Studying such processes could open a new avenue for treatment of COVID-19. We identified a strong association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GO related to the Nuclear Factor Kappa-B (NF-kB) signaling and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) signalingEach node represents a protein and each edge stands for an interaction, color-coded by the type of the interaction evidence.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243270.g007The transcriptomic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS, MERS, EBOV, and H1N1 pathways (Fig 3B) . The NF-kB pathway is closely related to pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant responses, and responses in acute lung injuries, where its activation has been proposed as a potential adjuvant treatment for SARS-CoV-2 [21] . Similarly, TNF receptors are mainly involved in the inflammatory response and may have a role to play in viral pathogenesis [22] .Among the genes that are unique in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 are CSF2/3 and PTGS2, which known to be involved in the immune responses against Rhinovirus infection (S1 Fig). The relationship between the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2/COX-2) gene and the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection could be due to its role in down regulating NF-κB mediated transcription, which is a critical element in the replication of some viruses, such as HIV-1 [23] . Colony-stimulating granulocyte factor (G-CSF) can alter the function of T-cells and induces the Th2 immune response [24] . There is also some evidence of a link between an elevated G-CSF expression level and the induction of the cellular immune response in H1N1 infected individuals [25] .The GO-associated molecular function in the SARS-CoV-2 host response yielded terms such as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and metal ion binding (Fig 3B  and S4 Table) . RAGE is highly expressed only in the lung and is rapidly induced at inflammatory sites, primarily in inflammatory and epithelial cells. The triggering and upregulation of RAGE by its ligands correlate with increased survival rates [26] . Additionally, RAGE has a secretory isoform that can have an independent causative effect on community-acquired pneumonia, such as pandemic influenza (H1N1) [27] . Although there is no evidence to link this to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is worth further investigation.Among the five viral infections, we found that GO terms were mostly enriched between SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV (Fig 5 and S3 Table) . Such an overlap suggested the common involvement of certain genes and gene families, which could explain the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Within these GO enriched pathways, TNIP1, ICAM1, and CFB were most significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 (logp-value > 40) (Fig 2 and S2 Table) . TNIP1 reduction sensitizes keratinocytes to post-receptor signaling after interaction with TLR agonists and it has the ability to activate immune cells and induce inflammation [28] . The correlation between TNP1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 2 and S2 Table) could be due to its role in suppressing the NF-kB pathway and therefore regulating the overexpression of viral proteins [29, 30] . The ICAM-1 protein plays a key role in controlling viral infection in lung epithelial cells during the early stages of infection, influencing the migration of immune effector cells into the airways [31]. Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) is a transcription factor that negatively regulates the cellular antiviral response by promoting the degradation of interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) [32] . In addition, it has an intrinsic role in the post-effector memory program, which is important for the formation of long-lived memory cells capable of immune reactivation [33] .GO analysis of genes uniquely shared between SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV highlighted the activity of the inhibitors of phospholipases, in particular, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (Fig 5 and  S4 Table) . Interestingly, synthetic and natural PLA2 inhibitors have been a viable treatment for oxidative stress and neuroinflammation associated with neuropathogenic disorders [34] . Some reports have suggested a potential link between PLA2-generated lipid mediators and viral infection, where these infections alter the lipid mediators of this pathway to initiate infection and pathogenesis [35] . Given the important association between heparin-binding GO and activation of T cells against virus infections such as influenza [36] , their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been documented. In comparison, glycosaminoglycan-binding molecules are essential for the action of certain in vivo chemokines. Some glycosaminoglycans are required for respiratory syncytial viral infection and are important for the entry of a bacterial pathogen into a biological system [37] . Some oncofetal antigens that target such proteins are used to control malaria parasites [38] . This might support some of the recent suggestions of using pharmaceuticals derived from glycosaminoglycan to control infection with SARS--CoV-2 [39] .MERS-CoV uniquely shared 51 DEGs with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4 and S3 Table) . Among the most significant shared genes that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 are KRT6B and TNFAIP3. Keratin 6B (KRT6B) is a type II cytokeratin, which is an important biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma [40] . These genes are known as virus-induced host factors that control the recruitment of T-cells and correlate with chronic virus infections [41] . In addition, the tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), is a central regulator of immunopathology and is associated with the maintenance of immune homeostasis and severe viral infections [42, 43] . We identified many DEGs that are classified as ""antiviral genes"" that were shared between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4) . Most of these DEGs were associated with the host response to virus infection and type I interferons (S3 Fig), while others such as IRF9, PML, IRF7, STAT1 and IFIH1 were related to interferon signaling [44] .The low number of uniquely shared DEGs between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 compared to SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV could be explained by the unique signature of SARS-CoV-2 and the high pathogenicity and aggressiveness that both SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV share, where the similarity of the genome and the common descent cannot be emphasized by a common biological host response. On the other hand, the uniquely shared DEGs and gene GO terms between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 have highlighted the role of vitamin D regulation (CYP27B1) and transcription factors (MAF) in immune functionality against SARS-CoV-2 [45] . Such information could explain the recent reported links between vitamin D and the response of immunity to SARS--CoV-2 infection [46] . It also highlighted the similarity of the host response to viral and bacterial infections.The host response to the five viruses shared the plasminogen activator (SERPINB1) as a common gene signature (Fig 4 and S3 Table) . This gene is highly correlated with lung chronic airway inflammation such as in asthma [47] . SERPINB1 acts in host-pathogenic interactions and possesses some antiviral activity across infections of rhabdovirus, hepatitis C, and influenza A [48, 49] .The SARS-CoV-2 gene expression profile demonstrated multiple genes in conjunction with EBOV, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV (Figs 4 and S6 and S5 Table) . Most of these genes were linked to the viral infection immune response of the host, except for genes such as FGF1 and NRCAM. The Neuronal Cell Adhesion Molecule (NRCAM) is related to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer [50] . Significant NRCAM gene expression has been observed under specific circumstances, such as neuroinflammation triggered by influenza A long-term viral infection [51] . FGF1, also known as acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), is a cellular growth factor and signaling protein encoded by the FGF1 gene. FGF1 is a strong angiogenic factor that controls the development of new blood vessels [52] and has been detected while studying endothelial cells infected with influenza virus [53] .SARS-CoV-2, EBOV, and MERS-CoV shared 31 unique genes, among which BIRC3 and MX1 were highly linked to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4 and S3 Table) . The Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 3 (BIRC3) is associated with marginal zone B-cell lymphoma and was suggested as a novel NK cell immune checkpoint in cancer [54, 55] . While MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1 (MX1) is an interferon-inducible protein that is associated with viral infections by influenza and viral encephalitis [56, 57] . A link between the gene expression of BIRC3 and MX1 has been hypothesized as part of a small group of genes controlling the host response against viral infections, including human herpes virus type 6Α (HHV-6Α) infection [58] . Additionally, the Mx1 protein contributes to the novel antiviral activity against classical swine fever virus [59] . Among the genes that were uniquely shared among SARS-CoV-2, EBOV, and MERS-CoV, Interferon Induced Protein With Tetratricopeptide Repeats 1 (IFIT1) and DExD/ H-Box Helicase 58 (DDX58) had high significant potentiality (S4 Fig). Recently, the uniqueness of DDX58 gene expression under SARS-CoV-2 viral infection has been reported [60] . IFIT1 plays a crucial role in some viral infections, where hepatitis E virus polymerase binds to IFIT1 to shield the viral RNA from translation inhibition mediated by IFIT1 and enhances the interferon response in murine macrophage-like cells [61, 62] .The PPI analysis highlighted the genes SARS-CoV-2 shared with other viral infections that have high interaction activity (Fig 6) . By selecting high interactive genes, we used an analysis of gene enrichment and PPI to identify more information about the function of these genes. It was clear from the results that the genetic pathways associated with rheumatoid arthritis, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, malaria, hepatitis B, and influenza A were of high significance (Fig 7) . The correlation among the host response to rheumatoid arthritis, malaria and SARS--CoV-2 has been mysterious despite the fact that several rheumatoid arthritis and malaria drugs are available, with some efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection [63, 64] . Our results suggest that the link between these diseases and infection with SARS-CoV-2 is more related to PPI interactions. In addition, the PPI network showed that these genes are highly significant across other infectious diseases such as EBOV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.We compared five transcriptomic profiles for cell host infection with SARS-CoV-2, EBOV, H1N1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our analysis identified several key aspects of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection where essential immunity genes and biological pathways could be used for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Common and specific genetic factors and pathways have been identified that characterize the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our research outlined the relationship between EBOV's cellular host response and SARS-CoV-2, where many genes and GO terms are enriched. Genes related to immune regulation, including FGF1 and FOXO1, and those associated with extreme inflammation, such as NRCAM and SAA2, have been closely associated with the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, common interleukin family members, in particular IL-8 and IL-6, demonstrated a special relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating their key importance. The GO evaluation highlighted pathways for RAGE, miRNA and PLA2 inhibitors, which were first identified in this study as possible pathways highly associated with the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some of these pathways, such as PLA2 inhibitors, may hold the key for potential drugs to manage SARS-CoV-2 infections. The PPI analysis sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other viral infections, where the findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with rheumatoid arthritis, the AGE-RAGE signaling system, malaria, hepatitis B, and influenza A were of high significance. Our work also shows that a combination of different types of experimental methods and parameters have been effective in studying the response of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other viral infections.Supporting information S1 Table.

COVID-19 causes both pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other COVID-19 complications may include acute liver, cardiac and kidney injury, as well as secondary infection and inflammatory response. It was revealed that there is no protective immunity against the virus and this later is capable of escaping innate immune responses. 2 The mechanism of innate immune sensing serves as the first line of antiviral defence, which constitutes an essential aspect of immunity to viruses. 3 The pathway is initiated through the engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which upon activation triggers cytokine secretion (most importantly being type I/III IFNs). However, SARS-CoVs have developed several mechanisms to inhibit IFN-I induction and signalling. SARS-CoV-2 has also been suggested to lack robust IFN-I/III signatures from infected cell lines, primary bronchial cells and a ferret model. 4 Therefore, primary infected tissues are characterized by virus proliferation resulting in cell death and virus release followed by the recruitment of immune cells, the immune complex generation and associated organ damage. 2 Both innate and adaptive immunity can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was revealed that infection of mononuclear cells in addition to the immune cells recruitment can result in massive inflammatory responses in the later phase of the disease. 2 These uncontrolled inflammatory immune responses may lead to local and systemic tissue damage. In patients with severe COVID-19, eosinopenia and lymphopenia with a severe reduction in the frequency of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells are a common feature. 5, 6 Several mechanisms may likely contribute to the lymphopenia observed in COVID-19 patients, including effects from the cytokine milieu. Diao et al and Wan et al showed a correlation between lymphopenia and IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α, while restored bulk T cells frequencies paired with overall lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were observed in convalescent patients. 7, 8 T cell recirculation in the blood may be inhibited by cytokines such as IFN-I and TNF-α through the promotion of retention in lymphoid organs and attachment to the endothelium. 9,10 Additionally, a robust humoral immune response (B cell response) is also triggered as evidenced by the near-universal detection of virus-specific IgM, IgG and IgA, and neutralizing IgG-antibody (nAbs) in the days following infection. Several studies [11] [12] [13] have demonstrated seroconversion occurring in COVID-19 patients between 7 and 14 days after the onset of symptoms with persistent antibody titres in the weeks following viral clearance. However, long-term memory response has not yet been established as a result of the timing of the outbreak, but a study by Thevaranjan et al 14 has demonstrated the induction of CD38 Hi and CD27 Hi antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) concomitant with an increase with circulating follicular T helper cells (Tfh). Another study by Guo et al 15 using the scRNA-seq study of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) from critically ill and recently recovered patients demonstrated an increase in the plasma cell population. In addition, RBD-specific memory cells (IgG) have been identified in COVID-19 patients. 16 Neutrophilia and an increase in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio usually are accompanied by advanced severity and poor clinical outcome. 17 Most severe patients show 'cytokine storm' (CS) characterized by higher pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum. 5, 18 Moreover, IgG-, IgM-and IgA-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most patients. Elucidating these immunopathological changes could provide possible targets for immunotherapy and are imperative for choosing the best clinical management by consultants. 19 In this review, we will provide an overview of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system and the consequences as a result of dysfunctional immune responses to organ damages. Finally, we will briefly state the implications of these approaches for COVID-19 serological diagnosis and potential immunotherapy that target viral replication as well as boosting or suppression of immune response wherever necessary.The effective response of the human innate and adaptive immunity against viruses includes the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of several subsets of T cells which are vital for controlling the viral replication, restraining the spread of the virus, restricting inflammation and 'cleaning' the infected cells. [20] [21] [22] T cell response in the healthy state is a finely balanced set of events composed of the principal populations of reactive T cells. 23 Persistent viral antigen stimulation results in CD8+ T cell exhaustion, which reflects a decline in effector functions and also the proliferative capacity; these exhausted cells are denoted-T ex . 24 T ex manifest over-expression of inhibitory receptors, including CD279 (PD-1), a lymphoid cell surface protein of the Ig superfamily, and a member of the extended CD28/CTLA-4 family of T cell regulators, which acts as a mature T cell checkpoint for the modulation of apoptosis. PD-1 interaction with either of its ligands (PD-1L1 or PD-1L2-both members of the B7 family of T cell co-receptors that includes CD28) constitutes significant negative immune checkpoints in the pathway responsible for blunting cell-mediated immune responses, specifically CD8+ responses and for upregulating resulting pathologies. 25, 26 In addition, exhaustion markers, such as NKG2A, are upregulated in NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19. 27 The tissue injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads to the excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of other pro-inflammatory cells such as granulocytes and macrophages (Figure 1 ). 28 This results in a snowballing of cytokine secretion and leucocytes recruitment causing a systemic inflammatory response termed as a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) popularly called cytokine storm (CS). 28 Published data obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have indicated that severe cases are usually depicted by a CS usually progressing to ARDS. 5, 18 Various aspects of COVID-19, such as the immune profile, serological markers and clinical features, have been reported to be similar to those of other viral infections. 29 Interestingly, it was shown that the severity of COVID-19 is related to the level of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular immune profile ( Figure 2 ). 30 In COVID-19 patients, several cytokines and chemokines have been shown to have different levels from the mild to severe stage of the disease. 29 A study analysed several cytokines and found the following to be increased in the plasma of patients infected with SARS-COV-2: IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-ɣ, MCP-1, MIP-1α, G-CSF and TNF-α. 18 Moreover, these elevated levels correlate with disease severity in another study, higher levels of IL-2 and IL-6 in plasma, in addition to the aforementioned was observed in severe infection. 5 Both studies have reported the correlation between these increased cytokine levels and worsening lung injury. An elevated level of IL-6, a significant contributor to CS, has been observed both in mild and severe SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with a substantial increase of this cytokine level in patients with severe disease progression than those with mild or non-severe SARS-CoV-2. 5,31The role of CS in ARDS development highlights the similarity of COVID-19 to other human coronavirus infections including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 32 Experiments using respiratory epithelial cells demonstrate that the release of immune modulators such as cytokines and chemokines is delayed which hinders F I G U R E 1 COVID-19 Immunopathology. Cytokines produced by infected cells recruit alveolar macrophages, which in turn increase vascular permeability, recruit other components of the immune system and mount the acute phase response. Tissue damage caused by death of infected cells and killed cells through immune cells causes' alveolar oedema, leading to hypoxia. Hyperactivation of both innate and adaptive immune responses induces cytokine storm. These factors converge into the progressive development of ARDS DCs and macrophage recruitment during the initial stages of SARS-CoV infection. 33 Subsequently, it was observed that the cells discharge low levels of the antiviral IFNs and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines primarily IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF, and chemokines CCL-2, CCL-3 and CCL-5. 33 Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects human airway epithelial cells and possibly other ACE-2 expressing tissues. THP-1 cells, macrophages and DCs sustain delayed but elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 34 Studies in MERS-CoV infection showed that the major producers of interferons are pDCs and not mononuclear macrophages or other dendritic cells. 35 In MERS patients, the elevated number of neutrophils and monocytes in the alveolar tissues and peripheral blood of patients correlated with the elevated cytokine and chemokine levels implying that these cells may contribute to lung pathology. 36 Similar observations were seen in patients with SARS-CoV infection. 37 The production of the IFN-I or IFNα/β is the crucial natural immunity against most viral infections, and IFN-I is vital in the early stages of viral infection. 38 In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, delayed release of IFNs hampers the body's antiviral response in the initial phases of infection. 39 The rapid and sustained rise in cytokines and chemokines invites many other inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, leading to a disproportionate infiltration of the inflammatory cells into the alveolar tissue and thus causes lung injury. It seems from these reports that either a dysregulated or exaggerated cytokine and chemokine responses or both by virus-infected cells could play an important role in the progression and pathological features of SARS or MERS. Thus, the same can be inferred to SARS-CoV-2. 32, 40 The amassed mononuclear macrophages are activated via the IFN-α/β receptors present on their surface and secrete more monocyte chemo-attractants (such as CCL2, CCL7 and CCL12), resulting in the further attraction and aggregation of mononuclear macrophages. These cells yield significantly high levels of TNF, IL-6, IL1-β and reactive free radicals such as iNOS, thus, increasing the disease severity. Also, the IFN-α/β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by mononuclear macrophages encourage T cells apoptosis, which further impedes viral clearance. 41 Another end result of rapid viral replication and a robust pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response is the initiation of apoptosis in respiratory epithelial and endothelial cells. The mechanism of this apoptosis is Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) or TRAIL-death receptor 5 as a result of IFN-αβ and IFN-γ -induced inflammatory cell infiltration. 42, 43 Apoptosis of respiratory endothelial cells leads to vascular leakage and alveolar oedema. On the other hand, the wearing-out of epithelial cells causes injuries to the pulmonary microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barriers and eventually leads to hypoxia. 32, 40 F I G U R E 2 Therapeutic approaches in COVID-19. Treatments involve either interference with the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle (left) or suppression of the hyperactive inflammatory immune response during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection using immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agents (right) | 5 of 12 ANKA et Al.Upon exposure to a virus or viral antigen, both innate and adaptive immune cells participate synergistically in the antiviral response. 2 Early studies have shown the implication of various immune cell populations in COVID-19. A study involving 41 individuals linked severe disease culminating in the intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality, with neutrophilia and lymphopenia. 44 Another study reported significant frequencies of lymphopenia (77.6%) and thrombopenia (41.2%) in a cohort of 85 patients who died from the disease. 45 A feature of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is lymphopenia with severely reduced CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells counts. It was also reported that reduced percentage of monocytes, eosinophils and basophils were observed. 45 Another feature seen in severe cases is increased neutrophil count and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Patients with these features correlated with higher severity of disease and a poorer clinical outcome. 19 The significant increase in the number of neutrophils and of the neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) unsurprisingly was not seen in mild cases. The prominent lymphopenia, indicates an impairment of the immune system, is observed to develop in most severe cases of COVID-19. 5,46 Therefore, it can be said that in COVID-19, neutrophils and leucocytes as well as lymphocytes contribute and strengthen the CS. Several studies reported eosinopenia among hospitalized COVID-19 patients 47, 48 with about 82% of fatal cases showing marked eosinopenia. However, early-stage disease and mild cases did not show eosinopenia. 49 In addition, a study by Lucas et al 50 demonstrated an increase in monocytes, low-density neutrophils and eosinophils correlating with disease severity. It also demonstrated a similar report among COVID-19 patients establishing a relation between increased basophils and eosinophils to the severity of COVID-19, and both cells were among the most dynamic cell population during severe disease, suggestive of an important contribution to antiviral defence and immunopathology. 51scRNA-seq analysis of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collected from COVID-19 patients showed that mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) account for about 80% of the total number of BALF cells in patients with severe SARS-COV-2, 60% in mild disease and 40% in healthy controls. The composition was further characterized by the increased availability of inflammatory-derived macrophages and relatively fewer tissue-resident alveolar macrophages in patients with increased severity of the disease. 52 In addition, macrophages seen in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection possess genes that are upregulated and as a result, linking it with tissue repair and with genes that promote fibrosis generation such as in hepatic cirrhosis. 53 This might provide further explanation of the fibrotic complications seen in patients placed under mechanical ventilation and also that the damaging effect of infiltrating macrophages could spread beyond the progression of acute inflammation. 54 Post-mortem examination on patients who had died from SARS-CoV-2 complications revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor-ACE2 is expressed by a subset of macrophages-CD169+ lymph node subcapsular and splenic marginal zone macrophages, as well as the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. 52, 55 These macrophages express IL-6, and their presence was connected to severe depletion of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes. 56 All these data go to show that type I interferon continuous activation of infiltrating monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, 41 oxidative stress, 57 anti-spike protein IgG immune complexes 58 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation 58,59 could explain the pathophysiology of COVID-19 as it does for SARS and MERS.Thrombocytopenia, increased levels of D-dimers 60 and defective coagulation functions are more and more linked to poor prognosis and might contribute to several organ failures and death in COVID-19 patients. 61 Thrombi and microthrombi of the lungs, extremities-lower limbs and hands, the brain, 62 heart, liver and kidneys 62 have been observed in patients with COVID-19. Coagulation abnormalities and disseminated intravascular coagulation are hallmarks of organ injury in conditions like sepsis, where it is mainly facilitated by proinflammatory cytokines. 63 In experimental acute lung injury, oxidized phospholipids elicit macrophage activation through the TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6-NF-κB pathway which might be a similar mechanism in this disease. 64 The SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor (ACE2) is constitutively expressed on arterial and venous endothelial cells 65 ; however, it is important to note that it plays an anti-inflammatory/ protective effect. 66 From the available data, children are particularly less susceptible to COVID-19. 67 However, an emerging concern is a novel severe Kawasaki-like disease seen in children with about a 30-fold increase in incidence. 68, 69 It is an acute and usually self-limiting vasculitis of the medium calibre vessels, which almost exclusively affects children, with coronary artery aneurysms as its main complication. 70 It is characterized by a persistent fever, exanthema, lymphadenopathy, conjunctival injection and changes to the mucosae and extremities. 71 Some patients progressed to hemodynamic instability; a disorder termed as Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. 72 These patients might fulfil the criteria of MAS, resembling sHLH 73 although the relationship with COVID-19 is yet to be completely unravelled. Despite the challenges associated with COVID-19 therapy, there are still several approaches currently being undertaken which show significant outcomes. Some medications are recommended for exhibiting some clinically positive impacts on COVID-19 patients, though there are also several drugs in clinical trials, some of which are already demonstrating a significant promise in addressing COVID-19. Table 1 shows some examples of these drugs, and their mechanism of actions, which makes them potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.Rather than shielding cells from being infected, a better approach could be to generate an antibody-like molecule that would have the ability to bind to the coronavirus itself. This approach is suggested to use a soluble version of the ACE2 receptor that binds to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and eventually neutralizes the virus. A study conducted by Li et al 74 demonstrated that the soluble ACE2 receptor can block the SARS virus from infecting cells in culture. The affinity of the soluble ACE2 receptor for the SARS S-protein was reported to be 1.70 nM, which is equivalent to the affinities of monoclonal antibodies, 75 suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar affinity for ACE2. It would be desirable to transform soluble ACE2 into an immunoadhesin form fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc) when using it as a therapy to treat patients. By doing so, it will extend the lifespan of the circulating molecule, while employing the effector functions of the immune system against the virus. Furthermore, Imai et al 76 demonstrated that the administration of recombinant ACE2 can recover acute lung injury by reducing angiotensin II levels. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 could be trapped with an evolutionary strategy when confronted with a potential ACE2-Fc therapy, leading towards a more benign clinical course.A number of clinical researches on cell-based therapies have begun for SARS-CoV-2 diseases and complications that target a wide range of patient groups using different approaches. 77 Several cell types are included, most of which are directed at the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), MSC-derived conditioned media (CM) or extracellular vesicles (EVs). A pilot study by Leng et al 78 in Beijing administered MSCs to 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with different grades of severity, including one patient who is critically ill and requiring ICU care. A single dose of MSCs (certified by the National Institute for Food and Drug Control of China) was administered intravenously (1 × 10 6 cells/kg body weight in a total volume of 100 mL saline) at different time points after the early symptomatic presentation. 78 All the patients including severely critical demonstrated clinical improvements within 2-4 days, including resolution of clinical symptoms (cough, fever, elevated respiratory rates) and improvements in oxygen saturation. CRP was also observed to have increased on day 1 after the initial administration of MSC and later decline over the 14-day observational period.While scientists are in search of a vaccine that can educate the human immune system to make their own neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against SARS-CoV-2, the adoptive transfer of nAb is an approach that is gaining much interest. Convalescent plasma (CP) has been suggested and approved for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the experience gathered treating influenza, Ebola and SARS (PMID: 32 113 510; PMID: 20 154 602). WHO interim guidelines developed for the 2014 Ebola outbreak outlined the advantages of CP over other proposed treatments: it can be produced independently of pharmaceutical companies (requires low technology); it is low cost and its production is easily scalable as long as there are sufficient donors. 79 This approach used the fact that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are essentially identical and share the same cleavage junction, 96% sequence similarity in their main protease, 76% similarity in the amino acid sequence of their S-protein, a similar S2´ cleavage site, a similarity in the spectrum of cells they can access, and the similarity of the most residues essential for binding ACE2. 80 The diagnosis of COVID-19 is an important step in tracing the virus and understanding its epidemiology. The key consideration in the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the early detection of symptoms in clinical situations. Currently, molecular techniques are more suitable than syndromic testing and computed tomography (CT) scans for accurate diagnoses because they can target and identify specific pathogens. However, molecular techniques are not applicable in asymptomatic infections and epidemiological studies, while serological tests can be used for diagnosis, population surveillance and vaccine responses. 83 Serological testing has been reported to be significant and applicable for the diagnosis of suspected cases with negative RT-PCR and for the detection of asymptomatic infections. 84 Another serologic test application is serological surveillance at the local, regional, state and national levels, and identification of those who have already had the virus and thus may be immune. The assays are also important for contact tracing and to check humoral protective immunity in recovered patients and recipients of vaccine candidates. 85, 86 Assuming there is protective immunity, serologic information may be used to guide return-towork decisions, including healthcare workers who work in environments where they can potentially be re-exposed to viruses. Screening of individuals who may be a source for prophylactic or therapeutic neutralizing antibodies is another application of serologic testing. In addition, antibody testing can be used in research studies to evaluate the sensitivity of molecular assays for detecting viruses and be employed retrospectively to determine the true scope of the pandemic and epidemiological assessment. Moreover, serologic testing can be used diagnostically to test RNA-negative suspected patients who presented late in their illness. 87 Serologic tests have some limitations. A serologic test may not be able to show if an individual has a current infection, because seroconversion can take 1-3 weeks after viral infection to make antibodies. On the other hand, the development of an antibody response can be host-dependent and take time. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the majority of patients seroconvert between seven (7) and eleven (11) days post-exposure, although some patients may develop antibodies sooner. 87 Numerous serological immunoassays have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and/or antibodies in human serum or plasma. The IgM and IgG antibodies are the most widely used biomarkers for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in commercial immunoassays. Table 2 shows the currently available serologic tests along with their FDA status for the diagnosis of COVID-19.The currently available serologic tests for diagnosis of COVID-19Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins have been reported to be important antigenic sites for the development of ELISA assays.A recent meta-analysis has reported 14 ELISA-based COVID-19 tests, which detected anti-N or anti-S IgG, IgM antibodies or both. The S-based ELISAs performed better than N-based. The different approaches had specificities ranging from 96.1% to 99.5%.Virus Neuralization Test (VNT) Virus Neutralization Test is the current gold standard serological test, which detects neutralizing antibodies in a patient's blood. The assay requires a live virus to handle and thus a biosafety level 3 containment facility.The use of the live virus is avoided in another protocol called the surrogate virus neutralization test, which also detects neutralizing antibodies.Rapid Lateral Flow Immunoassay (LFIA) TestsThese methods are more convenient in resource-limited settings and can be handled by personnel with low technical skills. LFIA detects the IgM and IgG produced by individuals in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.The detection sensitivity is higher in the IgG-IgM combined antibody test than in individual IgG or IgM antibody test. The use of the lanthanide-doped polystyrene nanoparticlesbased LFIA was reported to be better than the colloidal gold-based LFIAs, to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum, in terms of optimal performance.ANKA et Al.The COVID-19 continues to expand in the form of pandemic and will be responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory infections in COVID-19 can cause pathology as a result of a poor immune response leading to virus-induced pathology, or a hyperactive immune response that leads to immunopathology in pulmonary tissues. Cytokine storms associated with the uncontrolled inflammation resulted in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which severely damages pulmonary tissues and even lead to death in severe COVID-19 patients. The progress in COVID-19 immunopathology may lead to the development of vaccines and blocking antibodies for the management of patients.","Nigeria","first author","2020-12-03",12

Pediatric wheezing can sometimes be severe enough to justify hospitalization, admission to intensive care units, and mechanical ventilation [2, 3] . Studies show that children with a history of lower respiratory tract infections, primarily bronchiolitis, have an increased risk of developing transient wheezing up to age 13 [4, 5] . Wheezing may additionally be related to the development of asthma in adulthood [4, 6] .Wheezing is believed to be induced by viral infection [7, 8] . Common viruses associated with wheezing include rhinovirus (RV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), enterovirus (EV), human adenovirus (HAdV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronavirus (HCoV), and influenza virus [9, 10] .Traditional respiratory viral diagnostic methods, such as cell culture and serology, have limitations. For example, RV is difficult to isolate by cell culture [11, 12] , and the large number of RV serotypes poses a major challenge for serological assays [13] . Compared to molecular detection, traditional diagnostic assays have a lower sensitivity for all common respiratory viruses [14, 15] . These traditional diagnostics, however, have commonly been used to document respiratory viral prevalence, particularly in early literature [10] . Consequently, initial studies may have over or understated the role of certain respiratory viruses in pediatric wheezing. Molecular detection has revealed that RV may play a substantive role in the clinical manifestation of respiratory disease than original thought [16, 17] . Additionally, molecular detection helped to identify the presence of new viruses such as HMPV and HBoV in children with respiratory signs [18, 19] .Thus, the prevalence of common respiratory viruses in wheezing still remains unclear. Assessing the impact of the upcoming HRSV vaccination will require reliable data on prevalence [20] . Accurate viral prevalence data could contribute to optimizing and controlling antibiotic use, and providing better guidance for therapeutic decision making. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the prevalence of respiratory viruses in wheezing children, from publications that use molecular tools.was registered in the PROSPERO database (PROSPERO: CRD42018115128;https://www.crd. york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=115128).We included clinical trial, cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies that reported the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children �18 years presenting with wheezing. The definitions of wheezing were adapted as described by the authors of the primary studies. In the case of duplicate studies, where the same population was recruited and examined during the same period, only the most recent or complete study was included.Reviews, letters to the editor, studies with interrupted study periods, and studies of patients with underlying medical conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans were excluded. We also excluded studies that used non-PCR based methods for viral detection such as culture, time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay or immunofluorescence. Included articles with multiple follow up time were used only once for each virus.Relevant studies were identified through research conducted in Pubmed and Global Index Medicus. We used search terms associated with the common respiratory viruses including RV, EV, HRSV, HMPV, HPIV, HCoV, HAdV, HBoV, and influenza and with the clinical signs of wheezing. The search string used in Pubmed and Global Index Medicus is illustrated in S2 Table. The search was carried out without any language restrictions and considered publication dates until 01 July 2019. We used Google Translate for articles written in languages other than English and French. Study reference sections and relevant review articles were used to identify additional articles.Two investigators (SK and AFM) independently selected eligible studies based on the titles and abstracts from the list of references on the Rayyan website, a free web-based application used to assist authors of systematic reviews (https://rayyan.qcri.org/welcome) [22] . The selection process was summarized in a PRISMA flow chart [21] .The complete versions of the selected articles were downloaded and reviewed by two authors (AFM and SK) of the study. The data were extracted using a pre-designed abstraction form, specifically we collected: study design, study country, World Health Organization (WHO) region, sampling method, mean age of study participants, percentage of male patients, total number of patients tested, and total number of positive samples for each virus.Two authors (AFM and SK) independently assessed the quality of each study using the Hoy et al assessment scale [23] . This scale has 10 dichotomous questions that assess the internal and external validity of a study (S3 Table) . According to these questions, articles were classified as low, moderate, or high risk of bias.Disagreements in the selection of studies, data extraction and evaluation of study quality were resolved by discussion and consensus among the authors. Inter rater agreement for study selection was calculated using the kappa statistic Kappa values [- represented an extremely weak, very weak, weak, medium, satisfactory and excellent inter-rater agreement respectively [24] . Data were analyzed using the 'meta' package of the statistical software R (version 3.5.1) [25, 26] . Unadjusted prevalence has been recalculated based on the information of crude numerators and denominators provided by individual studies. Prevalence was reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a 95% prediction interval (PI). The variance of the study specific prevalence was stabilized with the Freeman-Tukey dual arcsine transformation before pooling the data within a random-effects meta-analysis model [27] . Egger's test served to assess the presence of publication bias [28] . A p-value of <0.10 for the Egger test was considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity was evaluated by the χ 2 test on Cochrane's Q statistic [29] , which was quantified by H and I 2 values. The I 2 statistic estimates the percentage of total variation across studies due to true betweenstudy differences rather than chance. In general, I 2 values >70% indicate the presence of substantial heterogeneity [30] . Subgroup analyses were performed for the following subgroups: WHO region, mean age group (0-2 years, 0-5 years, and 0-18 years), and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The effect of variables that could explain the heterogeneity in the included studies was examined by a univariate and multivariate metaregression model. To assess the influence of design and quality of included studies an overall estimated sensitivity analysis was performed using only cross-sectional studies and studies with low risk of bias.Initially, we identified 1426 publication abstracts and removed 28 duplicates (Fig 1) . After screening, we excluded 1247 that we found to be irrelevant, most of which were describing patients with asthma, bronchiolitis, atopy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia or underlying medical conditions; studies on therapy, vaccination, prophylaxis, immune response or animals; and reviews. We assessed the texts of the remaining 151 papers for eligibility, of which 118were excluded most often because respiratory viruses were not investigated in the study (25;21.2%), wheezing patients were not recruited (47;39.8%), or it was an ineligible study type (15;12.7%)(S4 Table) . Study selection inter rater agreement was κ = 0.87, representing excellent interrater agreement. Thirty-three full texts were retained for the review and included in the meta-analysis [31-63].Study participants were recruited between January 1992 and November 2014 (Table 1) . According to the Shapiro-Wilk test, the age distribution did not follow a normal distribution (p <0.001) and therefore we expressed the age as the median and interquartile range. The cumulative number of samples tested from study participants was 18,365; however, the number of participants tested for each virus was variable. The percentage of males in each study ranged from 50-75%. The majority of participants recruited in included studies (20, 60.6%) were aged <5 years. The studies were published between 2002 and 2018. Most included studies were performed by consecutive sampling (25; 75.8%), had a prospective recruitment (29; 87.9%), had a moderate risk of bias (19; 57.6%), and tested specimens from the nasopharynx (29; 87.9%). Individual characteristics of included studies are presented in S5 Table.The prevalence of viruses detected with molecular assays in children with wheezing was: RV 35.6% (95% CI 24.6-47.3,I 2 98.4%), HRSV 31.0% (95% CI 19.9-43.3,I 2 96.4%), HBoV 8.1% (95% CI 5.3-11.3, I 2 84.6%), HAdV 7.7% (95% CI 2.6-15.0, I 2 91.0%),influenza virus 6.5% (95% CI 2.2-12.6,I 2 92.4%),HMPV 5.8% (95% CI 3.4-8.8, I 2 89.0%), EV 4.3% (95% CI 0.1-12.9, I 2 96.2%), HPIV 3.8% (95% CI 1.5-6.9, I 2 79.1%), and HCoV 2.2% (95% CI 0.6-4.4, I 2 79.4%) (Fig 2 and S1-S9 Figs) . When sensitivity analyses were conducted for risk of bias and study design, they did not differ from the overall analysis (Table 2 ). Considerable heterogeneity was present in overall prevalence and sensitivity analysis for all viruses. Publication bias was present for studies that examined HMPV, HPIV, and HCoV (S10-S18 Figs).All subgroup analyses are presented in S6 Table. There were significant differences between age group and respiratory virus prevalence for RV (p = 0.024), HAdV (p< 0.001), influenza (p = 0.001) and EV (p = 0.012). Rhinovirus (> 2 year), HAdV (>2 years) and EV (> 2 years) were associated with older ages while influenza (< 1 year) was associated with younger ages. RV (p< 0.001), influenza (p = 0.016), HMPV (p< 0.001), and EV (p = 0.042) prevalence varied significantly according to WHO region. The prevalence of viruses was significantly different according to the detection assay used for RV (<0.001), HBoV (p = 0.001) and HCoV (p = 0.007). Compared to conventional RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR was associated with higher prevalences for HCoV while conventional RT-PCR was associated with higher prevalences for RV and HBoV. There were no differences for the remaining subgroup analyses. Substantial heterogeneity was present most subgroup analyses. The multivariate metaregression model (S7 Table) indicates that the detection technique contributed to the heterogeneity of the results for the prevalence of RV, HRSV, Influenza and HBoV. The age of the participants contributed to the heterogeneity of the results for the prevalence of HAdV, Influenza and HCoV. In agreement with the Egger test and visual inspection of the funnel plot, there was evidence of publication bias for some age subgroups and WHO region for RV, HRSV, HBoV, HMPV and HCoV (S6 Table and S10-S18 Figs).This study is the first systematic review of respiratory viruses in children with wheezing for nearly 30 years. The findings emphasize the strong association between the detection of RV and HRSV in wheezing children. Deoxyribonucleic acid viruses, HBoV and HAdV, were the second most commonly detected viruses. This study also showed a preponderance of RV, HAdV, and EV in older children and influenza in younger children. Contrary to common knowledge that RV is associated with asymptomatic infection and mild illness, RV could have an important role in the clinical presentation of pediatric wheezing. As previously reported by the narrative reviews on this topic [7, 10, 11, 64] . RV and HRSV were the most common viruses found in patients with wheezing. Although RVs are not sensitive to all cell lines, and earlier research studies lacked the molecular tools available today, the quantitative review analysis done by Pattemore et al in 1996 also recognized the role of RV in developing wheezing [11] . The hypothesis of the importance of RV in respiratory infections is well supported by two recent systematic reviews [65, 66] . One has shown that RV was the predominant virus in asthma which is usually accompanied by wheezing [65] . The second review recently demonstrated that RV infections in the first 3 years of life were significantly associated with a high risk of subsequent wheezing and asthma at pre-school age [66] . In contrast to the Pattemore et al. study, a low prevalence of HPIV has been observed in this review. This could be explained by the inclusion of antibody-detecting studies and the wide range of clinical definitions in the Pattemore et al [11] . The detection of antibodies in the studies represents both acute and past infections and thus reports the highest prevalence [3, 67] . Many studies have shown that HRSV is a major causative agent of wheezing in children under 2 years of age [9, [68] [69] [70] . Although not significant in our study, the prevalence of HRSV was inversely proportional to child age.These findings must be considered within the context of study limitations, including a small number of studies that met inclusion criteria, few studies that described wheezing type, and a limited worldwide geographic representation. Wheezing is considered bronchiolitis in children <1 year of age [71] . Almost all of the studies included in this review have children <1year of age that we cannot exclude and could therefore be the source of additional heterogeneity. The studies included in this systematic review reported the prevalence of EV and RV individually. It is, however, known that EV and RV cross react in real-time PCR assays and this should be taken into account while interpreting the study results [72, 73] . Seasonality and study duration could also drive the variability in the prevalence of respiratory viruses. This study, however, did not take these into account because the prevalence data were not always reported by these parameters. Molecular detection alone cannot implicate the etiology of clinical signs, as asymptomatic carriage of some respiratory viruses is possible. For example, the causal role of HBoV in acute respiratory infections, which has been reported in asymptomatic infections and mostly reported in codetection, has been widely controversial to date [74] . Additionally, combinations of viruses detected, or co-detections were beyond the scope of this work.The present study has multiple strengths, particularly the fact that many respiratory viruses were considered in the analysis and that only studies with molecular viral detection were included, a gold standard and common diagnostic tool for respiratory viruses. In addition, the methodological approach strengthened this analysis, with the inclusion of analyses for explanation of sources of heterogeneity and publication bias. We used a comprehensive search strategy and two independent authors were involved in all stages.RV and HRSV were the predominant viruses most commonly detected in children with wheezing. HRSV was largely present in children � 2 years. This systematic review also highlights the important role played by newly described viral agents, HBoV and HMPV, in wheezing.The completion and marketing of an HRSV vaccine as well as the development of antivirals against respiratory viruses, especially for RV and HRSV, could greatly help to reduce the burden of wheezing in children. Preventive measures for HRSV should be directed to at risk populations, such as children � 2 years. While molecular detection may illuminate which viruses are associated with pediatric wheezing, greater attention is needed to understand if and how these viruses cause wheezing in children.

The virus was identified and reported for the first time in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. 1 It was named COVID-19 disease by the World Health Organization. The disease has affected 213 countries. The number of infected people and death toll are increasing every day. It is a deadlier than 2002-SARS.In January 2020, the WHO announced the 2019 Novel Coronavirus occurrence as a Public Health Emergency and international concern. The WHO also recommended countries should take standard measures and responses to tackle the effects of the viruses.Following the fast transmission and risk of the virus, the Director of WHO announced the virus as a global pandemic on the 11th of March. Henceforth, the number of cases reported increased to above 22 million as of 20 Aug 2020. As the virus is new, many things are not clear. However, Russia started a production of the vaccine. Russia has produced the first batch of its Coronavirus vaccine as of 19 Aug 2020. It follows that many countries are looking to Russia for getting the vaccine.COVID-19, since it has appeared in Wuhan, China, has been spread in different countries (213 countries). Ethiopia is one of the 213 countries that registered COVID-19 cases since 13th of March 2020. In Ethiopia several cases and deaths are identified. Currently, more than 32 thousand cases are reported as of 19 Aug 2020. It is expected to rise since the case is reported from all parts of the country. The knowledge, attitudes and perceptions (KAP's) are not motivating the response to COVID-19. 2 Thus, the objective of the current study is to investigate COVID-19 response status quo in Ethiopia. In this objective different questions were addressed. They are: How Ethiopia has been approaching to tackle COVID-19? What were the Risk Communication and Community Empowerment (RCCE) preparedness and stringent response available to combat COVID- 19 ? What is the current situations of COVID-19 in Ethiopia? What are the major challenges Ethiopia have been facing during the pandemic? How Ethiopia engage the community to tackle COVID-19? In order to address similar questions, I used empirical studies using academic research, COVID-19 guides, protocols, policies, and proclamation documents appeared to preparedness and COVID-19 responses. This paper sheds light on COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Besides, it could contribute to the extent literature review by providing the reasonable arguments and the explanation about investigating all government and stakeholders' effects. The result indicates that Ethiopian government employed multiple and synergistic approaches from public health preparedness to the highest level of offending state of emergency as of 19 Aug 2020. However, given the different public health efforts and clinical cares, the pandemic has never shown static rather increasing alarmingly.A qualitative descriptive approach more specifically qualitative case study was used to examine the Ethiopian local context which allied to the global approaches. Thus, the study employed a qualitative thematic analysis approach used to analyze the data. The study was also dependent on observations and documented knowledge emerged out from the lived experience and practice of the Ethiopian government. In this procedure, I used different terms to mine the data from different web information retrieval systems studies. 3 Author marked that ""empirical methods are positivistic and typically involve systematic collection and analysis of data"". 4 The web-based search terms include ""COVID-19 in Ethiopia""; ""COVID-19 responses and preparedness in Ethiopia""; ""RCCE in Ethiopia""; ""early response to COVID-19 in Ethiopia""; ""COVID-19 public health measures in Ethiopia""; "" COVID-19 response in Ethiopia""; ""COVID-19 epidemiological characteristics""; ""worldometer""; ""Ethiopia during the pandemic""; ""factors affecting COVID-19 response in Ethiopia"" etc. Thus, web information retrieval systems studies were used as a framework for this study.Research conducted in Ethiopian context showed that low levels of risk and impacts perception, the majority of the people have low perception of taking Coronavirus as a threat. The existence of poor knowledge and poor practice were respectively high. 5, 6 According to some research, 7 findings there are low educational status, rural residence, and low monthly income were significantly associated with poor knowledge and poor practice. Increasing age was associated with poor knowledge, and poor knowledge itself was associated with poor practice. (p.1958) The practice of KAP's even among health workers pharmacy showed only half of them had adequate knowledge about the disease. 8 Scholars suggest that understanding of their risk perception could be an effective method to communicate the health policy. 9The Situations Since Reported in Ethiopia The Government has strengthened its preparedness and response efforts to combat COVID-19 and has set up a well-organized national preparedness and response coordination mechanism through an Emergency Operation Center. Besides, the Ethiopian government has set up four different levels of coordination: (a) National Disaster Risk Management Council led by the deputy prime minister's office; (b) Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) incorporated a multi-sectorial national task force led by the Minister of Health; (c) The PHEM technical taskforce that has been managed by the Director-General of Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI); and (d) PHEM Technical Working Group led by the national incident manager. As of 31 st March 2020, a synergistic approach COVID-19 humanitarian actions has been coordinated by the established Emergency Coordination Center and national and regional the task forces were established in all regions [ Table 1 ]. 10 Ethiopia Pass-Through Socio-Economic Impairments: The Impact of COVID-19Ethiopian socio-economic situations have been drastically changed by COVID-19. The Ethiopian economy, after COVID-19 induced mobility and activity restrictions around the globe, has faced significant challenges. 11 COVID-19 impacted by global disruptions have been considerably affected tourism and hotel business, exports and imports, and remittances to the country. Currently, Ethiopia has been passing through remittances declining, household consumption significantly affected, impeded economic growth, increased debt risks, high inflation and high unemployment rate, and lowered business and tourism. Research indicate that the COVID-19 response in Ethiopia is hardly impaired due to contextual factors, 12 such as ""a weak health system, poor nutritional status, lack of access to proper hygiene and sanitation and densely populated urban areas"" (p.4).The case of the COVID-19 occurrence in Ethiopia was reported in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. There are 4.8 million people found in Addis Ababa. The rapid transmission of the diseases in Ethiopia is ascribed to the center of the test and quarantine for its international destinations. Besides, partial lockdown in Addis Ababa also aggravated the situations. It was first appeared in Addis Ababa. This in turn led to an expansion of the outbreak to all parts of the city since Addis Ababa remains the epicenter. The number of cases to the capital city is attributed to over 75% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases within Ethiopia as of August 19, 2020. Following this, efforts such as testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation were not able to effectively to control the DovePress outbreaks across the country. Besides, the risk communication and community engagements are the most important aspects of the country's efforts contributed to minimize the impact and transmission of COVID-19. The specific information is tailored to vulnerable groups (women, children and disabilities) [ Table 2 ]. 13 Despite the efforts of all parts of the stakeholders, the new cases are alarmingly increasing. Still, some measures have been declining due to the hectic nature of the stakeholders day to day activities. Currently, Ethiopia confirmed that COVID-19 cases are reported in all parts of the country.The COVID-19 causes respiratory infections. It has highly contagious characteristics. It could be considered the most complex global challenge. 14 The outbreak has been affected more than 22 million people cases reported around the world as of 18 Aug 2020. 15 Whereas more than 15 million (6.75% recovered) people recovered from the pandemic. The most serious case is that more than 700 thousand (3.51% dead) people death reported. Likewise, in the Ethiopian case a total of 94,820 COVID-19 cases out of which 1451 COVID-19 deaths (1.5% of total cases) and 49,886 COVID-19 recoveries (52.6% of total cases) reported as of 30 Oct 2020.The public health preparedness and response during early outbreak used different risk communication and community engagement activities during early outbreak. 16 Media messages are powerful to reduce the impacts and risks of the pandemic by posing community and personal sanitation and hygiene activities. Thus, there were tailored messages for five core hygiene habits to respond to COVID-19. As part of the rapid responses, all educational systems, except the virtual learning of postgraduate programs, were closed for several months.Public awareness creation and public education have been the public health strategic efforts. Some scholars suggest that the role of uncertainties to make effective communications to contain the pandemic, 17 The current Ethiopian prime minister has making public announcements concerning the impacts and associated risks of COVID-19. Besides, the Ministry of Ethiopian Health has disseminated a regular briefing. In the media campaign to address all citizens, Ethiotelecom has been using cell-phone ring tones to remind and create awareness about the public health hygiene responses including frequent hand washing, maintaining a social distancing, and wearing of facemasks to fight COVID-19.Further, the Ethiopian government has been implementing strict and stringent contact tracing after the case report, isolation as well as care, obligatory quarantine, and treatment. The government mobilized the public universities' dormitories and other buildings to increase the capacity and number of quarantine centers to over 50,000 beds. The government also established additional isolation centers with a total of 15,000 beds. Moreover, the government arranged several treatment centers with a 5000-bed capacity. Further, the government introduced more comprehensive life insurance packages and coverage to protect front-line health workers.Ethiopia has continued to mobilize national resources to make an effort towards its response to COVID-19. This was aimed to motivate voluntary actions to support the public health emergency and response. These actions allied with the government close coordination among concerned at all levels. Even though the government's COVID-19 response has been on progress, its success so far illustrates what Ethiopia could achieve despite tight resource constraints.Since the news of Ethiopia's first case of Coronavirus on March 13, various multi-sectorial measures have been taken to counter its spread, including the declaration of a national state of emergency on April 8. The country has banned public gatherings and other social activities of more than four people until September, and rigorous public health responses would be provided at limiting the dissemination of the pandemic could also be introduced, 18 The author in his COVID-19 research work mentioned that two major activities must be banned as stated here. There were different activities banned, restricted, and closed for five months of the state of emergency. All public gatherings: The ban applied to all religious, governmental, non-governmental, commercial, political, and social gatherings. The gathering is of a group of four people where individuals expected to ensure that they are 2 meters apart at all times; different activities: greetings by handshake, land borders movement, passenger loads for all national and local journeys, reducing workforces, students and teachers meetings, and measures on social distancing, sporting activities, and children's playgrounds were closed.Since the March Ethiopian government developed standards, guides and protocols documents to respond to COVID-19. The documents have been developed by assessing the situations, impacts and risks of COVID-19 pandemic. I consider for showcase purpose to indicate some of the documents developed by the Ministry of Health and Ethiopian Public Health Institute. 13 One of the most important documents is a risk communication and community engagement mechanism in Ethiopia that aimed to have and create a mutual understanding of preparedness and response to minimize the effects of COVID-19. In order to develop such a common understanding is to develop a knowledge base standard guidelines and protocols. Another document is a cleaning and disinfection Protocol for COVID −19 which helps to communicate and inform respected stakeholders in well-designed manner. This is aimed to develop a routine environmental cleaning. The guideline focuses on frequently touched surfaces that consider cleaning and disinfecting of door handles, bedrails, tabletops, light switches, etc. These things should be frequently cleaned. The second category includes minimal touched surfaces such as floors, ceilings, walls, etc. Still some other document on Project Information Document could be developed by the World Bank. The aim of the World Bank Project is to make a holistic approach to the impact posed by COVID-19. Besides, the project expected to strengthen national systems or taskforces for its preparedness in Ethiopia. 19 Still some others like a National Implementation Guide for COVID-19 Home-Based Isolation and Care and its objectives of the guide are to outline the steps and the procedures; describe the roles and responses; and provide detailed technical and administrative guidance. In Ethiopia, the epidemiological situations of COVID-19 brought a significant shift in our COVID-19 management response strategy and the overall pandemic response plan. This strategy is developed due to the current and projected trends of the pandemic. Thus, the guide provides clear guidance, recommendation, procedures and practical considerations to manage the case effectively, and efficiently. Moreover, Quarantine and Border Control Implementation Guide considering the increased risk impact of imported cases to the country was developed. Following that, Ethiopia has been implementing border control and applied thermal and clinical screening at the major point of entries. Starting from March 23, 2020, the country has started mandatory 14 days' quarantine for all incoming passengers. Due to economic and risk impacts, the ongoing strategies are revised by the Ethiopian government. The rest of the documents are summarized as follows [ Table 3 ,]. 20-28Now Ethiopia is using an adopted Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) strategic approach for the pandemic. 13 The overall objective of developing RCCE in Ethiopian context is to empower individuals, families, and communities to adopt preventive and healthseeking behaviors contributing to a reduction in the spread of COVID-19 Outbreak in Ethiopia, 13 It is strongly believed to improve knowledge, perception, selfefficacy, and health-seeking behaviors; increase community engagement and ownership of the national response; improve evidence generation and knowledge management system; improves all levels coordination of RCCE interventions and enhance multilevel engagement on RCCE interventions. Above all, risk communication imparts confidence among the public during public health emergencies. In order to bring such confidences policies of Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress public communication and instruction in proper use of a medical mask to contain the COVID-19 transmission. 13 The strategic objective of the documents emphasized on two interdependent strategic categories in three outbreak phases:Preparedness Phase: Pre-Outbreak Phase a. Risk communication: As part of the national RCCE strategic response a risk communication that focuses on the activities of developing a comprehensive RCCE response plan; mapping capacity building RCCE team response to COVID-19; conducting risk perception assessment and engaging the public and institutions; gathering evidence-based information and developing the content; working on rumor and misinformation monitoring and engaging different media channels.b. Community engagement: the RCCE strategy in the pre-outbreak phase considers community engagement which incorporates the activities of social and community mobilization; training and orientation; psychosocial support and mental health.a. Risk communication: the strategy of RCCE for the outbreak phase uses different activities such as coordination and monitoring; capacity building; spokesperson system; content development; rumor and misinformation monitoring and media engagement.b. Community engagement: the strategy of RCCE for the outbreak phase in the community engagement activities includes social and community mobilization; training and orientation; psychosocial support and mental health. b. Community engagement: the post outbreak phase RCCE strategy performs different community engagement activities engagement of the public; social and community mobilization; training and orientation; psychosocial support and mental health.As a result, the Ethiopian action plan for COVID-19 response developed operation plan. In the operation plan, there are two types of audiences targeted to under risk communication and community engagement. These are the Ministry of Health and Ethiopian Public Health Institute, MoH& EPHI. The primary one is the general public and vulnerable populations.General audience communication and engagement activities (Table 4 ). 13 The vulnerable population in this regard include children, mental health and women [ Table 2 ]. 13The highly communicable nature of the pandemic attributed the COVID-19 response in Ethiopia harsher and dangerous. It has been causing a high fatality and death toll. Besides, a swift transmission of the viruses occurred in 213 world countries, including Ethiopia. The major research outcomes indicate that the COVID-19 situations There could be several ways and strategies the government can use. In recommendation, the government needs to revise and strengthen in policy implementation efforts to mobilize and upbeat the KAP's of the public through different media reporting, films, and edutainment that consolidate the importance of experiential, social, economic, political and cultural factors that drive out the risks and the impacts of COVID-19 among the people. The RCCE efforts should focus on building up to the standard level of knowledge, attitudes and perceptions. In addition, to enhance and promote the implementation of recommended self-care and home-based isolation practices the government should give due attentions to high-risk prone groups and vulnerable parts of the population. There might be ups and downs to end the pandemic. However, it should be supported with strong clinical services and public health research. This could lay a good potential for future research.

Hardly the world learns to cope with one strain of virus when another emerges and poses a threat to the future of humanity. A similar situation has emerged when a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has not been previously known in human history. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are nonsegmented, enveloped, single-strand, positive-sense, ribonucleic acid viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family. CoVs named due to their Sun's corona or crown-like surface projections. CoVs are the largest group of host-specific RNA viruses infecting birds, snakes, bats, and mammals including humans. CoVs grouped into Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses which mostly mammals like bats, civets, rodents, and humans and Gammacoronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses which are mostly found in birds. 1 In the 21st century, three CoVs outbreaks emerged from their reservoirs to cause disease in human. Several members of the Coronaviridae family infect humans. Humans are infected and developed upper respiratory tract diseases with different CoVs strains including 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. OC43 and 229E causes common cold mainly during winter with 4%-15% prevalence. NL63 causes mild respiratory tract disease, especially in children with a prevalence of 10% of all respiratory diseases. HKU1was isolated from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia. 2, 3 The three CoVs that cause serious respiratory diseases are severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-COV) which emerged in late 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), which emerged in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 disease emerged in China as a threat to the human lives and declared as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). 4 The SARS-CoV-2 virus has relatively a large genome structure about 30 (26-32) kb pairs. The virus has several non-structural proteins (NSP) like, NSP12, NSP13, NSP3 and NSP5 that are vital for their life cycle and pathogenesis. Like other CoVs, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has four structural proteins naming the S-spike Protein (outer spiky glycoprotein), envelope protein (E), Membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), that enhance the attachment, transport and interferes with host immune response and other five accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF8, ORF7, and ORF9). These proteins help the corona virus-host cell interactions to create an optimal condition for viral replication, modify host gene induction, and neutralization of the host's antiviral defenses system. These coronavirus-host interactions have a vital role in the viral disease pathogenesis. 6 The S protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein that promotes the entrance of the virus into host cells. S protein is a major target for design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. The S protein has two domains, S1 and S2. The S1 domains contain the receptor binding domain (RBD) that mediates attachment to the host receptor cell, whereas the S2 domain facilitates the fusion of the virus to the host cell. The Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells initiated by binding of the RBD to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 on the host cells surface and CD209L is another receptor with lower affinity. 7 ACE2 receptors expressed in type II alveolar cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and in several immune cells. S2 subunit has a domain that facilitates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. These domains are internal membrane fusion peptide (FP), a membrane proximal external region (MPER), two 7-peptide repeats, and a transmembrane domain (TM). The S glycoprotein has a key role in the induction of immunity during infection with SARS-CoV-2 by eliciting neutralizing-antibodies and T-cell responses. Studies showed that the S protein has several immunodominant parts that do not induce neutralizing antibodies, but the RBD in the S1 region is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Thus, full-length S glycoprotein, the S1 subunit, the RBD domain, NTD, and FP are proposed as the promising candidate to develop an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. 7, 8 The M-membrane protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein that gives a definite shape to the virus structure. It binds to nucleocapsid and organizes the virus assembly. The M protein contains T cell epitope clusters that elicit a neutralizing antibody in SARS patients. The E protein has a key role in the pathogenesis, assembly, and release of the virus. The E protein Inactivation modifies the virulence of CoVs due to changes in morphology and tropism. The N-nucelocapsid protein (which is within the phospholipid bilayer) has a key role in complex formation with viral genome, enhances M protein interaction during assembly, and increases replication of the virus. The E, S, and M proteins form the viral envelope. [8] [9] [10] Currently, no corona virus-specific therapeutic agent, monoclonal antibodies, or vaccine has been approved. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective medication and vaccine for COVID-19 disease to limit the transmission in the community. Most treatment options for COVID-19 taken from previous experiences in treating SARS-CoV, MERS CoV, and other viral diseases. 11 Currently, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and supportive care are the most important management strategy for severe cases. According to WHO guidelines infected patients treated with supportive care like bed rest, oxygen saturation, adequate nutrition, prevention of dehydration, keeping electrolyte and acid-base balance, antibiotics, and isolation of patients suspected or confirmed for COVID-19. 12 Several pre-existing and potential drug candidates, including remdesivir, chloroquine, and others are considered. the Therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for COVID-19 include molecules binding to the virus, inhibiting enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, inhibitors targeting helicase and proteases, host cell protease inhibitors, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, anti-sense RNA and ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mAbs targeting host cell receptor or interfere with S1 RBD, antiviral peptide targeting S2, and natural products. 13Effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are crucial for controlling the CoVs pandemic. Vaccines decrease disease severity, viral shedding, and person to person transmission. Currently, no vaccine has been licensed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. 14 There are different vaccine development platforms against SARS-CoV-2, including live attenuated virus, viral vectors, inactivated virus, subunit vaccines, recombinant DNA, and protein vaccines. Several studies are in progress, but requires months to years to develop the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there may be many promising targets for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 candidate vaccines under development include S protein or RBD subunit vaccines and replicating or nonreplicating vector vaccines expressing mainly S protein or the RBD. Several studies showed that viral S protein subunit vaccines displayed higher neutralizing antibody titers and protection than live-attenuated SARS-CoV, full, and DNA-based S protein vaccines. Collectively, S protein/gene is the preferred target site in SARS vaccine development, and the same strategy can be potentially useful in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. 14,15Live attenuated vaccine (LAV) is the most immunogenic vaccines that do not require adjuvant to gain optimal response due to its effectiveness to provoke immunity mimic to the natural infection. The LAV contain viable but attenuated live virus with low virulence property that does not cause disease in a person with normal immune systems. They reproduce slowly, and thus remain a continuous source of antigen for a long period after Single immunization, reducing the need for booster dose. 16 Several LAVs are found in the market to protect various disease including mumps, rubella, measles and varicella vaccines. LAV produced by passing virus in cell cultures, in animals or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing less virulent strains selection or by mutagenesis, or deletion of the viral genes that give virulence. LAV is not suitable for infants, immune-compromised patients, and elderly people due to the risk of reversion to virulent strain. 17 Currently, several pharmaceutical companies isolated the virus strains of SARS-CoV-2 and started relevant vaccine development. Codagenix Biotec Inc collaboration with the Serum Institute of India Ltd developing a live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in which the sequence of the target gene of interest has been changed by swapping its optimized codons with non-optimized ones. 18Inactivated whole-virus comprises the entire disease-causing virion which is inactivated physically (heat) or chemically. It has several antigenic parts to the host and can induce diverse immunologic responses against the pathogen. Inactivated whole-virus has several advantages, including low production cost, safe, and does not involve genetic manipulation. IWV is conventional vaccines with mature technology and may become the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine put into clinical use. 19 There are three inactivated whole-virus vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 reached phase 1/2 clinical trial. These phase 1/2 clinical trials are done by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products (ChiCTR2000032459), Sinovac (NCT04352608) and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products (ChiCTR2000031809). 20Subunit vaccines contain pathogen-derived proteins (antigens) with immunogenicity that can elicit the host immune system. Subunit vaccine is safe and easily manufactures by recombinant DNA techniques but requires adjuvant to enhance a immune response. So far, many research institutions initiated the SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, and use the spike glycoprotein S, and its fragments, such as S1, S2, RBD, and nucleocapsid protein as a prime target antigens as shown in Table 1 . 21 Novavax, Inc. developed a candidate vaccine based on S protein. So far, Clover Biopharmaceuticals constructed a SARS-CoV-2 S protein trimer vaccine (S-Trimer) by using its patented Trimer-Tag© technology. 22 Since the RBD of S protein directly bind with the ACE2 receptor on host cells, RBD immunization induces specific antibodies that may block this recognition and effectively prevent the invasion of the virus. Most of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines currently under development use RBD as the antigen. In a study in monkeys, recombinant RBD protein was used to successfully reduce viral loads in the lungs and oropharynx and to prevent MERS-CoV pneumonia. 23 Similar to RBD, the N-terminal mRNA Vaccines mRNA carries instruction from the protein-encoding DNA to the proteins translating ribosomes. There are two types of mRNA vaccines platform: non-replicating mRNA and selfamplifying mRNA that encodes not only the required antigen but also the viral replication machinery. mRNA vaccines mimic the natural infection of the virus, but they retain only a short synthetic viral mRNA which encodes only the required antigen. 25 mRNA vaccine is a promising alternative to traditional vaccine approaches due to their safety, potency, quick vaccine-development time, and low-cost production. The procedures to develop the mRNA vaccine include the screening of antigens, the optimization of sequences, modified nucleotides screening, delivery systems optimization, evaluation safety, and immune response. 26 mRNA vaccines strongly induce both cellular and humoral immune responses. It is relatively safe and effective because it is only a transient carrier of message that does not interact with the host genome and it also does not need the whole virus. 27 Currently, no mRNA based vaccine entered the market. So far, a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273, encoding S protein) developed by Moderna/NIAID, launched Phase 1 (NCT04283461) clinical trial as shown in Table 2 . 28 Bluebird Biopharmaceutical Company is developing mRNA vaccine candidates using two different approaches. The first is to use mRNA to express the virus S protein and RBD domain and the second is to express virus-like particles in vivo. Duke-NUS Medical School and Arcturus Therapeutics partnered to develop a self-replicating mRNA vaccine candidate, currently in a preclinical trial. BioNTech and Pfizer are collaborating to co-develop mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162. 28, 29 DNA vaccines (DVs) have a plasmid into which a particular gene incorporated that encodes the antigens that identified from the pathogenic microorganism. The bacterial plasmid carrying the desired gene delivered into the host and translated the antigenic protein that stimulates the immune system normally activated by the pathogenic microorganism. DVs elicit both the cell-mediated and humoral immune system. DVs induce long-lasting immunity that defends the diseases effectively in the future. DVs are very stable, can be produced within weeks because they does not need culture or fermentation; instead used synthetic processes and began clinical trial within monthes. Currently, DNA vaccine not approved for the market. 30 34 Adenovirus and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) are the most common viral vectors used in vaccine developments as shown in Table 3 . There are over 50 subtypes of human Ad, with Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) is a stable, non-replicating virus that used in several vaccine development. This virus allows the insertion of large segments of foreign DNA (∼8 kb) into its genome. But, pre-existing immunity against human Ad5 is widespread, hampering its use as a vector for vaccine development. 35 Chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) represents an alternative to the human Ad vector due to its safety and lack of preexisting immunity in humans. 36 Mice immunized with the Ad5 vector encoding the S protein-induced systemic neutralizing antibodies and mucosal T-cells immunity. Ad5 vectors encoding the S1 domain of the S protein displayed stronger neutralizing antibody responses than that encoding the full length, suggesting the effect of immune focusing. 37 Currently, Can Synthetic Peptide vaccines have chemically produced from fragments of antigens that elicites the immune response. These vaccines are inexpensive, easy for preparation, and quality control. But display low immunogenicity, thus antigen modification and adjuvant required during formulation. Fragments of antigen has B and/or Tepitope activity, which affect the specificity of the immune response. Currently, a set of B and T cell epitopes isolated from S and N proteins of SARS-Cov, these epitopes are highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 and may assist efforts to develop vaccine for covid-19 disease. 39 Several pharmaceutical companies like Generex Biotechnology developing peptide based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 viruses by producing synthetic peptides that mimic crucial antigens from a virus that is chemically bonded to the 4-amino acid Ii-Key to ensure robust immune system activation. 40Virus-like-particles (VLPs) are""hollow-core"" virus particles formed by the viral structural component with self-assembly character into nanostructure. VLP mimic the structure of the whole virus. VLPs can elicit innate immunity response via pathogen recognition receptors. VLPs represent advanced subunit vaccine with increased immunogenicity because they contain the structural protein of the virus. VLPs have a noninfectious and non-replicative property due to lose of genomic component. VLPs help to develop safer and cheaper vaccine candidates. 41 VLPs can be synthesized by encoding the viral structural proteins. In general, the VLPs-based vaccine is similar to the whole inactivated virus vaccine, but it does not require the viral inactivation step which may affect the immunogenicity of a viral protein. Because no live virus is involved in the production process, VLPs can be easily generated in a low-containment production environment. 41 The COVID-19 outreak is rapidly increasing in the number of cases, deaths, and countries affected. Pharmaceutical companies are searching to develop an effective vaccine for controlling the COVID-19. Currently, several countries and Research institutions are developing vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. However, vaccine development could not be done overnight. After vaccine design and preparation, it will undergo safety and efficacy evaluation before entering clinical trials. Generally, three phases of clinical trials undertaken to evaluate the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Phase 1 done for studing safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine, and later, phase 2 and phase 3 studies done for both safety and efficacy. Typically, a novel vaccines development takes 10-20 years and less than 10% success rate even for a vaccine that enters clinical trials.

[2] [3] [4] The most hit of dermatological services have been aesthetic practices. 2 In African countries, assess to dermatology services is poor. This is for several reasons; few dermatologists to serve the population, lack of insurance with patients paying out of pocket, problems of logistics as the few dermatology clinics are in the urban areas and poor assess to drugs. These problems have been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.The closure of outpatient dermatology clinics during the lockdown resulted in most patients being unable to assess dermatology care.Teledermatology which was by text messages, phone and video calls was not readily available. Most of the patients did not have smart phones and so could not conduct video calls. Poor internet access also limited teledermatology. In the few patients where teledermatology was successfully conducted, problems of clear images, poor history, issues with payment modalities bedeviled the process. Furthermore, some of the patients were elderly, unable to read and had to depend on their care givers who may not be committed in order to assess their text messages making consultation difficult. As in other climes, clinical training for dermatology residents and students has temporarily been halted and teachings moved on-line. 5 The down side of this is no access to patients, no clinical assessment of patients, no access to dermatological procedures. This on the long run will affect clinical skills and knowledge.With the easing of lockdown measures in the last 10 weeks, continued closure of outpatient clinics was no longer sustainable. Reopening of the outpatient clinic has necessitated modifications on modalities for safe dermatological consults. As routine screening for COVID-19 is not done, all patients assessing the clinic are regarded as potential COVID-19 positive. Clinic days have reduced from four times to once a week and the number of outpatient appointments reduced in order to ensure physical distancing. In the clinic, appropriate PPEs for the doctors (face masks, gloves, aprons, face shields). 6 Leaving windows in consulting rooms open, hand sanitization and wiping of surfaces with bleach and alcohol-based sanitizers after every consultation and social distancing is the new norm. Temperature checks and wearing of masks by patients all through consultations is ensured. Only one relation is allowed to accompany any patient that needs assistance. Aesthetic procedures have been limited to chemical peels only.When this pandemic will be over is anybody's guess. We anticipate an increased incidence of contact dermatitis in health care workers as a result of increased use of hand sanitization and face masks.Data available on request due to privacy.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-12-13",12

The disease was named COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019). March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization has increased the SARS-CoV-2 of an epidemic in a global pandemic [1] .Based on clinical observations, patient age, male gender and presence of certain underlying pathologies (primarily cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes) have been highlighted as risk factors predisposing to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and higher severity [2] . More recently, epidemiological and molecular studies seemed to report preliminary evidence on a correlation between the risk of contagion by SARS-CoV-2 and the erythrocyte phenotype determined by the ABO-RH system, the exact mechanisms of which are not yet well determined [3] [4] . On the other hand, the association between blood groups and vulnerability or resistance to certain infectious pathologies has been demonstrated by older studies.In this context, we conducted a study on the Association between ABO blood groups and COVID-19 infection in Moroccan population through patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Moulay Ismail Military Hospital in Meknes.This is an analytical cross-sectional study involving male military people sharing the same workplaces, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at the Moulay Ismail Military Hospital, in the province of Meknes, Morocco. The diagnosis was sought after the appearance of pulmonary symptoms in a few individuals.On admission, all individuals underwent a complete physical examination and rapid serological test for the specific detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against the novel coronavirus. Sociodemographic, epidemiological and clinical data have been specified on information sheets. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples was performed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the GeneFinder COVID-19 PLUS Real Amp Kit (OSANG Healthcare Co, Ltd., Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions, on the CFX96 real-time amplification system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Testing for anti-Sars-Cov 2 antibodies was used to detect old infection (Rt-PCR negative), and in conjunction with epidemiological and clinical data for interpretation of questionable results. The ABO-RH blood typing was carried out on a sample taken from an EDTA tube using an agglutination technique using two complementary tests, Beth Vincent and Simonin. Our comparison group (COVID-19 negative) was made up of all individuals with RT-PCR and negative serology.Statistical analysis was performed using Epi-Info (version 7.2 CDC Atlanta, USA). Proportions were compared using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. The means, meanwhile, were compared using Student's test. A difference was statistically significant for P <0.05. An odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval was used as a measure of association.This study involved 1094 individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-19. This is a relatively young male population. The average age was 36.32 years (standard deviation of 7.12 years, extremes ranging from 22 to 55 years). RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was positive for 242 individuals. 856 individuals with RT-PCR negative were used as a control group. The difference between the mean age of patients (35.13 years, SD = 7.189) and that of controls (36.66 years, SD = 1.070) was significant, which showed that the youngest in this community were at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (P = 0.003) ( Table 1 ).Similar to recently reported results, the objective of this work was to research an association between ABO-RH blood groups and risk of Covid19 in Moroccan population. And to our knowledge, our study is the first of its kind, in Morocco, to seek this association.higher likelihood of being infected with SARS-Cov-2 [5-6]. Inconsistently with published data, we found that COVID-19 affects younger people more. This can be explained by the way of life and grouping which follow a hierarchical pattern. Indeed, the youngest are more in contact in workplaces and share guest rooms for four people or more, while the oldest (often older) share individual or two-person work spaces, and individual guest rooms.Comparing the ABO blood groups of our COVID-19 patients with the control group, we found that there was a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with blood groups A and a significantly lower risk for patients with blood group O. This finding was consistent with the literature data [7] [8] [9] [10] . Similar associations have been reported between ABO phenotypes and susceptibility to several bacterial and viral pathogens, where It can be vulnerability or resistance. It has been suggested that certain viruses perform their role by binding to ABO blood antigens. This is the example of Norwalk-like viruses and calciviruses which are spread by interaction with antigens of the ABO blood group system [11] [12] . So for some strains of rotavirus, they find their way back through the cells of the gastrointestinal tract thanks to antigens associated with blood group A [13] .The association between the ABO blood group phenotype and the likelihood of being infected with SARS-CoV, the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has been demonstrated. Yufeng Cheng et al. investigated the prevalence of SARS disease among hospital staff in Hong Kong who were exposed unprotected to infected patients, finding that people with blood group O had a lower likelihood of infection [14] . Jun Chen et al. proposed a mechanism by which the coronavirus spike protein (S), heavily N-glycosylated, bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [15] . As it has been shown that the ACE2 is a obligatory cell receptor, although other receptors may participate in the infection process [15] [16] . Patrice Guillon et al. used in vitro cell binding tests and a mathematical model of cell viral transmission. They claimed that natural or monoclonal anti-A antibodies specifically inhibited the adhesion of the SARS-CoV (S) Spike protein to its ACE2 cell receptor [13] . Given the structural similarity between the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [17] and also using the same receptor, ACE2, to enter target cells [17] [18] , the aforementioned mechanisms could be extended to SARS-CoV-2.Our study did not find a clear association between the ABO blood group and clinical expression of COVID-19. Exception was made for headache where patients with AB blood type were more likely to be (P <0.001). Numerous studies published in this regard indicated that the ABO blood group does not influence the symptoms of COVID-19 [19] [20] [21] .As previous studies on COVID-19 and the present study have shown, the statistically significant association of the ABO blood group and susceptibility to COVID-19 is clear. Blood group A was associated with a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 compared to non-A blood groups, while blood group O was associated with a lower risk of infection compared to non-O blood groups . The distribution of blood groups in the population can be useful to understand the kinetics of the epidemic at the local level and to establish a health policy aimed at reducing the viral spread. Further studies are needed to determine the exact mechanism by which the ABO blood group influences susceptibility to COVID-19, which could be useful in patient management and disease control.Data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.","Morocco","first author","2020-12-04",12

For example, the authorities have closed borders, closed schools, colleges, and universities, ordered the shuttering of nightclubs and entertainment outlets, announced social distancing measures, and called in retired and intraining medical personnel for National Health Service. In addition, all people entering Ethiopia from another country are subject to mandatory 14-day quarantine at designated hotels at the traveler's expense. Moreover, on April 8, the Prime Minister declared a state of emergency under Article 93 of the constitution, which allows it to impose more stringent measures (www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/ 04). Among them, most states have banned inter-regional public transport and public gatherings. Layoffs by private employers have also been forbidden. The international border with Djibouti remains fully open to the transport of commercial goods. In addition to the above decisions by the government, there is public health information campaign advising people to adopt hygiene measures to protect themselves and others, including more frequent handwashing with soap and water, using hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available, and covering mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when coughing or sneezing.Although the government has exerted its effort to control the spread of the disease, it may not have the desired impact if a significant proportion of the population were unable or unwilling to comply with preventive measures recommended by the world health organization and the national government. Evidence indicated that in a situation where non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options, community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase of the pandemic. 15 As per our prior observation of the transmission of the disease, it is highly linked to the perceptions, and adherence of preventive mechanisms among people. The preventive mechanisms need attitudinal and behavioral change among people since most of the preventive strategies have some restrictions on human culture and daily interaction habits among the population. As a result, more people become resistant and fewer implementers in practicing those preventive strategies and victims of COVID-19. Former research findings also supported this where people who have poor knowledge; attitude and practice towards COVID-19 prevention were more affected by This cross-sectional survey is designed to assess the community's level of risk perception of COVID-19, precautionary behavior, and intention to comply with the nonpharmaceutical preventive measures as recommended by the Ethiopian government and WHO at the time of the survey. In addition, the study was designed to capture the community's perception of the effectiveness of precautionary measures recommended, and the effect of media exposure to comply with preventive measures.In the early stage of the pandemic, the effectiveness of recommended preventive measures depends on the community's compliance. The protection motivation theory also postulates that an individual's compliance with preventive measures depends on their level of risk perception towards the current health threat. 19 According to protection motivation theory, people protect themselves based on four factors to the current threat: the perceived severity of a threatening event, the perceived probability of the occurrence, or vulnerability, the efficacy of the recommended preventive behavior, and the perceived self-efficacy. 19 Moreover, the level of risk perception is affected by an individual's exposure to different sources of information. 15 Media was found to facilitate obtaining of up-to-date available information improving knowledge, awareness, and practices of both healthcare workers and the general public. The outbreak of the COVID-19 grabbed the attention of media news, press, and social media pages. Particularly, online health information plays a significant role in creating knowledge and awareness of people about COVID-19. 8, 11 However, there are too many sources and sites through which anyone can obtain information, and many of them are not credible which resulted in misinformation and difficulties to distinguish between rumors and reality.Thus, we believe that understanding the level of risk perception, perceived efficacy of preventive measures, and the role of information exposure on compliance behavior among the general public could help in fighting against the coronavirus pandemic.This study is a cross-sectional online survey using a questionnaire developed on google forms. To have good coverage of reaching more study participants throughout the country, various social media channels submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 including e-mail, Facebook, messenger, telegram, and IMO have been used. Respondents were invited to willingly participate in the survey. To avoid duplication of responses from the same respondent, the survey tool was commanded to accept only one response from the same electronic device at any server. The study was conducted for 1-month period starting from 24 April to 24 May 2020.The questionnaire was adapted from a survey used in a recent two studies conducted in Hong Kong and UK. 2, 15 The questionnaire consisted of components: sociodemographic characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, risk perceptions towards COVID-19, perception of the effectiveness of recommended preventive measures, information exposure, perceived information reliability, and compliance with preventive measures.Socio-demographic characteristics consisted of sex, age, marital status.Socio-economic status is assessed using education level, employment status, and household income.Risk perceptions towards COVID-19 are measured by perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. Susceptibility is measured by asking respondents about the perceived likelihood of being infected with COVID-19 under the Ethiopian Government's current preventive measures as well as the perceived seriousness of COVID-19. For measuring the perceived susceptibility, respondents' were asked the perceived likelihood of being infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) at any point in the future, their families or friends will be infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) at any point in the future or they will contract COVID-19 from families or friends and their level of worry due to COVID-19. To measure the perceived severity of COVID-19, respondents were asked to indicate their perception about the chance of having COVID-19 Cured, the chance of surviving if infected with COVID-19, the chance of having no symptoms and the chance of being in a mild condition (eg can go about daily tasks normally) in a 5-point Likert scale (from very low-very high), and the perceived seriousness of COVID-19 (Very serious -not serious at all).This variable consisted of three categories: (1) hygiene practices and using personal protective equipment (wearing a face mask, washing hands more frequently with soap and water, using hand sanitizer more regularly, disinfecting the home, covering nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing) (2) travel avoidance (travel to COVID-19 affected locations) (3) social distancing (avoiding social events, going to the hospital or other healthcare settings, and crowded places).This variable was measured by asking respondents the different sources of information they use about COVID-19 (TV, individual social networking sites such as Facebook, Government official websites, Government agency social networking sites, magazines, newspaper) about COVID-19 and perceived information reliability was measured by asking respondents the reliability of the information they obtained from different sources (not reliable at all, least reliable, reliable, more reliable and most reliable).The collected data were exported to the Excel sheets and checked for its completeness. The excel data were exported to IBM SPSS software version 24 for further data cleaning and analysis. Data were described using frequencies and percentages. Chi-square was used to analyze the differences between categorical variables. Finally, multiple linear regression was applied to examine the effects of independent variables on compliance behavior.A total of 521 respondents have willingly completed the online survey questionnaire. Of all respondents, nearly nine in 10 (88.5%) were males. As the number of females was small, we checked our data for the presence of skewness and no skewness was observed for age group, residence, and other sociodemographic variables. Our data collection and sampling was online that gave equal chance to educated people who have email and social media addresses. Thus, Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress we gave an equal chance to study participants as of males; unfortunately, the number of female participants became 11.5%. Thus, this sex difference was not due to the presence of confounders as a result of poor sampling and sampling procedure strategies, but it was due to chance.Although the sample size is small to represent the actual sample size of a country-level study, the sampling method was random through an online system invitation to all Ethiopian people who can read and write and have social media account. Hence, it might have an average representation of the general population since the respondents were from different parts of the country and the process was a random selection.Respondents' age ranged between 18 and 63 years with mean age of 34.76 (sd ± 7.97). Seven in 10 respondents (70.1%) are married, nearly half (52%) are living in regional capital cities, and three in 10 (16.9%) are living in the capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. More than five in 10 (55%) respondents had a Master's degree and about two in 10 (22%) respondents had a bachelor's degree. Seventy percent, 11%, and 12% of the respondents are employed in government, private, and non-governmental organizations, respectively. More than eight in 10 respondents (81.2%) had three or more family size (Table 1) .As indicated in Table 2 , about nine in 10 respondents (90.4%) perceived that they are susceptible to COVID-19. A significantly greater proportion of married respondents than single and divorced perceived that they are susceptible to COVID −19 (χ 2 = 26.425, p < 0.001). A greater proportion of residents in regional cities, zonal cities, and in the capital city were more likely to perceive that they are susceptible to COVID −19 than residents in the district and rural settings (χ 2 = 17.682, p < 0.05). Our data also indicated that respondents with a higher level of education, those who get better monthly income, and government and NGO employees were more likely to perceive that they are susceptible to COVID-19 (p < 0.01). Moreover, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 significantly increases with age (χ 2 = 15.461, p < 0.05). Moreover, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 significantly increases with age (χ 2 = 15.461, p < 0.05) and with increasing family size (χ 2 = 12.053, p < 0.05).Of all respondents who participated in the study, nearly 9 in 10 participants (87.5%) perceived that COVID 19 is a serious disease. Respondents' perceptions of the seriousness of COVID-19 were found comparable in all of the background characteristics considered in the study (Table 3) . Source of Information About COVID-19Respondents were asked their source of information about the status of COVID-19 and the means of prevention methods to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. The majority of respondents, 81%, 80%, 64.5%, and 64.3% reported that they got information about COVID-19 from television, social networking sites (Facebook, telegram, etc.), health professionals, and government social media pages, respectively. Of all sources of information assessed, magazines (26%) and newspapers (29%) were the list source of information about COVID-19 reported by respondents (Figure 1 ).The government of Ethiopia and concerned stakeholders are communicating different precaution measures to avoid COVID-19 infection and lessen losses attributed to the pandemic. 14 Thus, respondents were asked about their compliance with these precaution measures as a perceived benefit of the exercises. As indicated in Figure 2 , almost all respondents (97.1%) washed their hands with soap and water. The majority, 87.5%, 81.9%, 80%, and 87% of the respondents avoid social events, visiting healthcare facilities, public transport, and washed their hands, respectively. Similarly, nine in 10 respondents (91%) used hand sanitizers and cover their noses and mouth while coughing or sneezing. Slightly more than half of the respondents (56.5%) wore face masks when going out of home and only 46.9% disinfected their home.One of the objectives of this study was to assess the factors that facilitate or deter compliance with COVID-19 preventive behavior. The multiple linear regression analysis results in Table 4 This study assessed the community's level of risk perception of COVID-19 and their compliance with recommended precautionary measures. The majority of respondents (90.4%) perceived that they are susceptible to COVID-19. Nearly nine in 10 respondents (87.5%) perceived that COVID-19 is a serious disease. Married respondents perceived that they are more susceptible than single respondents. A possible reason for this finding may be that married respondents might have family members within the household who may have differential exposure outside the home; thus, they may feel that to the other embers. Our data also indicated that a greater proportion of residents in regional cities, zonal cities, and in the capital city were more likely to perceive that they are susceptible to COVID 19 than residents in the district and rural settings. This finding is consistent with a report in Myanmar 17 reporting that perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 was higher among people who are living in crowded places. In Ethiopia, urban centers and cities have crowded residents.In the current study, respondents with a higher level of education, better monthly income, and employment were more likely to perceive that they are susceptible to COVID-19. The majority of the respondents more often used television (81%), social networking sites (80%), health professionals (64.5%), and government social media pages (64.3%) to get information about the epidemic. Thus, these groups of people may have better access to information from different sources. In addition, as a means to limit the spread of the disease, there was a lockdown time and state of emergency issued by the government. These initiatives taken by the government and the better access to information may increase the groups' understanding of the causes and consequences of the disease so that they may perceive that they are susceptible to the COVID-19. A study from Iran 9 supported this finding where lower educated people had a low level of knowledge and poorer practices towards COVID-19.Consistent with other studies, 5-7 perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 is significantly associated with increasing age. Particularly the study by 7 reported that perceived risk to COVID-19 increased by 4.9% for every one-year increase in age among the Chinese population. This increased susceptibility to COVID-19 with increasing age may be due to the decreased immunity status with increased age that makes people more susceptible to acquire infections of both communicable and noncommunicable types or because of the information shared by the global community that elders are more susceptible to be victims of COVID-19 than the youth due to other comorbidities. Recent evidence also indicated that people with comorbidities are at the highest risk of getting COVID-19 compared to the rest of the population. 9, 17 Our finding that perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 increased with increasing family size corroborates to a study in China 7 reporting people living with families including children had a higher perceived risk level to COVID-19. A study in Jordan 12 also reported that having children was reported as a perceived risk to acquire COVID-19. This might be related to the family income that challenged them to access the recommended protective equipment, proper nutrition, and cover costs of medical care to the larger family sizes. In addition, as family size increases, they might move to more places including the markets and other crowded places while performing their daily routines to feed the larger family size. This condition might expose them to COVID-19.The Ethiopian government and other stakeholders are engaging in imparting different prevention measures for citizens to lessen the spread of COVID-19 in the country. Our results indicated that respondents are exercising one or more of the prevention measures. Of the different measures assessed in this study, wearing a face mask (56.5%) was the least practice prevention measures by the respondents, even so, wearing face mask practice in our study is better than the findings reported in South West Ethiopia 14 where only 14% of the respondents reported wore a face mask to prevent COVID-19. Moreover, avoiding participation in social events, avoiding visiting health care facilities, avoiding public transport, and washing hands with soap and water frequently as prevention measures are better practiced among our respondents than reported in South West Ethiopia, 14 but consistent with the study conducted in Kenya. 3, 13 These observed differences in practicing prevention measures might be differences in enforcing the implementation of these activities. The differences might be also possible due to the participants of the study. In our study, the majority of study participants are with higher education levels (96.2%) that could practice the prevention measures through the recommended procedures.The analyses of factors predicting compliance with preventive measures identified different individual and socio-economic factors that facilitate or deter the behavior. This study revealed that females were more likely to have better compliance with preventive behavior than their male counterparts. This result is consistent with studies conducted in other parts of the world 16 reporting that females showed more compliance behavior with recommended COVID-19 preventive measures such as more frequent washing their hands, covering their nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, kept social distancing with others, staying at home, avoid using public transportation and frequently disinfecting touched surfaces.Based on our data analysis, compliance with COVID-19 preventive strategies was varied by gender, education level, and residence of study participants. Respondents with a lower level of education were found less likely to be compliant with preventive behaviors. A similar finding was reported by a recent study in Iran where lower education was a factor in low knowledge and preventive practice towards COVID-19. 10 The low education level might limit people's access to information through various means or Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress may limit the information source on COVID-19 to exercise various prevention measures. On the other hand, females, better educated and urban residents had better compliance compared to the counterpart study participants. This implies that males, less educated and rural residences are at a higher risk of getting COVID-19 infection. This is a serious situation to acquire and transmit COVID-19 since most of the Ethiopian populations are non-PhD holders, over 85% of the population is living in rural settings, and males are outdoors and movable than females. Thus, these findings are important for policymakers to reconsider and support the preventive strategies of COVID-19. Participating females in mobilizing the community with the practice of preventive mechanisms might be effective to make awareness creation among the large population since they can demonstrate them through their life experience. Similarly, PhD level educated people are respected and believed to be knowledgeable by most of the community members in Ethiopia. Thus, making them among the COVID-19 prevention, awareness creation, community mobilizers and keynote speakers, and evidence generating team members could benefit the policymakers and COVID-19 programs at large. Moreover, the findings indicated the need to have more prevention, mobilization and accessing preventive equipment towards the rural community. Therefore, policy-makers and COVID019 prevention programs might be benefited from these findings to revise their anti-COVID-19 strategies for evidencebased targeted interventions and wise resource allocations.As the source of COVID-19 information (how the disease spreads and prevention measures) for the majority of the respondents in this study are television and social networking sites, the availability and accessibility of these channels are limited in the remote settings and rural areas. Thus, the lower urban areas and rural residents may be less compliance with preventive measures because of limited access to information about the types of protective measures in these remote settings, the unavailability of protective equipment, or the misconception that COVID-19 is a disease mainly observed in cities and metropolitans where people are overcrowded (World Health Organization, 2020). While increasing age positively associated with increased perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 in the bivariate analyses, increasing age decreased compliance with the practice of preventive measures in the multivariate analyses. The findings indicated that the increased perception of susceptibility did not bring a commensurate behavior of compliance with protective measures. Future research may unveil the reasons for these discordant findings.This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Although the sampling procedure was random through the online system, it might not be representative to study the perception and compliance of people towards COVID-19 prevention practices at a country level due to its small size. Thus, the interpretation of the study findings needs to consider this limitation. There is an overrepresentation of educated health-conscious individuals and those more informed or concerned about the outbreak. Furthermore, with the stay at the home recommendation and emergency state in place, such an educated group of the population confined to their homes has turned to social media and other web-based platforms for social communication. Under this exceptional context, members of the general public who normally would not participate in surveys may be more likely to participate given the media attention, severity, and the outbreak's large impact on many aspects of daily life. Even so, this study provides important information on the extent of peoples' practice of recommended preventive measures and facilitators and barriers to compliance with preventive measures.The finding of our study has several implications for decision-making. It has indicated that the majority of the respondents exercised one or more of the recommended preventive measures to avoid COVID-19 infection. Our findings also indicated that people residing in lower urban centers and rural areas were less likely to practice prevention measures than respondents in regional cities. Most of the respondents got information about COVID-19 from television and social networking sites. The availability and accessibility of these channels are limited in the remote settings and rural areas. Thus, the lower urban areas and rural residents may be less compliance with preventive measures because of limited access to information about the types of protective measures in these remote settings, the unavailability of protective equipment, or the misconception that COVID-19 is a disease mainly observed in cities and metropolitans where people are overcrowded. While increasing age positively associated with increased perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 in the bivariate analyses, increasing age decreased compliance with the practice of preventive measures in the multivariate analyses. The findings indicated that the increased perception of susceptibility did not bring a commensurate behavior of submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 compliance with protective measures. On the other hand, perceived effectiveness of recommended precaution measures is positively associated with compliance behavior.The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and fulfilled the requirements of Ethiopian National Health Research and Ethics Guideline. Moreover, the study received ethical approval from Ethical Review Committee of Bahir Dar University.

The disease has an incubation period of 3-6 days while it needs 5-6 days to be manifested and hospitalization is expected to be within 7-8 days [4, 5, 8] .As per the WHO report on 30 th September 2020, there have been about 33,722,075 cases and 1,009,270 deaths of COVID-19. There are 1,182,927cases and 25,881 deaths in Africa; and 74,584 cases and 1,191deaths in Ethiopia [9] . However, there might be underreporting of the number of cases due to diagnostic insufficiency, low testing capacity, and fragile health care system, especially in developing countries.The American psychological association defines anxiety as an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts, and physical changes like increased heart rate [10] .Healthcare workers are directly involved in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 who might beat high risk of developing anxiety. The ever-increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases, high workload, depletion of personal protection equipment, lack of specific drugs, increased risk of infection for families and colleague, feelings of being inadequately supported, and unable to adhere to prevention strategies may all contribute to this mental burden of the HCWs [11] [12] [13] . Healthcare workers perceive a greater risk of anxiety due to their exposure to the patients who are most poorly which adds further stress. This problem may be compounded in countries with under invested health sectors due to their underline poverty. Ethiopia is largely sharing this burden among other sub-Saharan countries [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .After the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreak prevention and control measure like quarantining, closing and suspension of transportations, avoiding public gatherings, and even refraining from different important public and family events may rescue the general population and healthcare workers from anxiety due to reduced autonomy and issues like income, job, security and safety issues [19, 20] .If anxiety left untreated, it may have long-term health effects on healthcare workers and affect them to properly discharge their responsibilities including combating the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, it may burden the under-resourced and fragile health sector by the cost of treatment and minimizing effective manpower resources [21, 22] . This study might add information for the scientific world and might be baseline data for further researches in Ethiopia.The aim of this research to assess the prevalence of anxiety towards COVID-19 and its associated factors among HCWs in a Hospital of Ethiopia.The study was conducted in Debre Tabor General Hospital from May 15 to June 15, 2020. The ethical clearance was obtained from Ethical Review Committee of Debre Tabor University College of Health Sciences Research and Community Service Coordination Office on May 11/ 2020 with protocol number Ref CHS/1089/2020. Letter of permission to conduct was obtained from, Debre Tabor General Hospital administrative body. Informed written consent was secured from every study participant before the start of the interview after telling them about the objective of the study. Confidentiality and anonymity were ensured. The hospital is found in the South Gondar Zone, which is one of the Zones found in the Amhara regional state. Debre Tabor is found 669km North West of Addis Ababa, the capacity of Ethiopia. The Hospital has about 350 HCWs.Hospital-based; survey-based cross-sectional study design was employed.Source population. All healthcare workers working in Debre Tabor General Hospital. Study population. Healthcare workers who are participated in actual data collection during the study period working in Debre Tabor General Hospital.The sample size was not predetermined, and all available healthcare workers from May 15 to June 15 were surveyed.Dependent variable. Anxiety (Yes/No) Independent variables. Socio-demographic variables like age, sex, marital status, religion, educational level, work experience, chronic illness, suspected COVID-19 family member, accessibility of PPEs, Having family member, Participation in the previous outbreak, and monthly income.Data were collected via a structured questionnaire. We used the English version of the GAD-7 scale to measure anxiety. TheGAD-7 scale was reliable with Cronbach alpha of 0.92 and test re-test reliability (intraclass correlation = 0.83) with good validity [23] . It is calculated by assigning scores 0, 1, 2, 3 for not at all, several days, more than half of days, and nearly every day responses for how often have you been bothered the seven listed symptoms of anxiety over the last 2 weeks. Adding the scores, the GAD-7 scale ranging from 0 to 21. The total scores of measurements were interpreted as normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , and severe (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . The cut-off score for detecting anxiety is � 5.This scale was reliable and valid Data was collected by assigned health care professionals (data collectors).A pretest was done on 5% of the study participants at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital in Bahir Dar. After training was given for data collectors, data was collected and properly filled on the prepared questionnaire.The data was coded and entered into SPSS version 23.Independent variables were analyzed by using binary logistic regression with anxiety (dependent variable) and those with a p-value of �0.2fromthe bivariate analysis were fitted to a multivariate logistic analysis to check their association with the outcome variable. Odds ratios with 95% CI (strength of association) and p-value were computed to identify associated factors. Tables were used to present data and summarized with frequency and percentage. P-values of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.The ethical clearance was obtained from Ethical Review Committee of Debre Tabor University College of Health Sciences Research and Community Service Coordination Office on May 11/ 2020 with protocol number Ref CHS/1089/2020. Letter of permission to conduct was obtained from, Debre Tabor General Hospital administrative body. Informed written consent was secured from every study participant before the start of the interview after telling them about the objective of the study. Confidentiality and anonymity were ensured.Anxiety. an emotion characterized by the feeling of tension, worried thoughts, and physical changes like increased heart rate.Anxiety scale. Anxiety (defined as a total score of �5 in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) was assessed by a seven-item, GAD-7scale [23] , which is defined as follows;The seven items will be scored as follows: Not at all = 0, Several Days = 1; More than half the days = 2; Nearly every day = 3, then by adding the scores, the total scores of measurements will be interpreted as normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , and severe (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) .Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems? The overall prevalence of anxiety among HCWs towards COVID-19 was about 63%. Being married (34.8%), having family members (42.3%), and not having access to PPEs (47.2%) were anxious ( Table 2) . Among HCWs 11.1% of them developed severe anxiety, while 26.2% were mild, and moderate 25.6%.In multivariate logistic analysis; age greater than 30 years old, being married, presence of chronic illness, having suspected COVID-19 family members, and lack of accessibility of PPEs were statistically significantly associated with anxiety (Table 3 ).During the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of patients requiring treatment increases significantly, which strains the healthcare system [12] especially in developing countries like Ethiopia due to lack of resources for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Healthcare workers perceive Prevalence of anxiety towards COVID-19 and its associated factors among healthcare workers a greater risk of anxiety due to their exposure to the patients who are most poorly which adds further stress [13, 15] . Research from previous epidemics/pandemics (such as the SARS outbreak 2003, the MERS epidemic 2012, or Ebola outbreaks in West Africa) shows that HCWs can experience a broad range of psychological morbidities including trauma, which might endure for many months after the outbreak [24] .The overall prevalence of COVID-19 anxiety among HCWs of in a Hospital of Ethiopia was found to be about 63%. A multicenter study done in China by Liu et al. on 1563 medical staff found the prevalence of anxiety (defined as a total score of �5 in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) to be 44�7% [25] , the study conducted in China by Wang [28] . The possible explanation might be due to poor healthcare facilities.Our study revealed that age of 30-39 (AOR, 3.05; 95% CI, (1.70, 5.47)) and age of �40 (AOR, 11.32; 95% CI (3.37, 37.98)),being married (AOR, 3.56; 95% CI, (2.30, 6.38)), having chronic illness (AOR, 3.43; 95% CI, (1.59,7.43)), having suspected COVID-19 family members (AOR, 5.20; 95% CI, (2.11, 12. 78)), and not having access to PPEs (AOR, 2.55; 95% CI, (1.43, 4.56))were statistically significantly associated with anxiety.In line with our finding, a rapid review and meta-analysis of 59 papers by Kisely S, et al. in 2020 on the occurrence, prevention, and management of the psychological effects of emerging virus outbreaks on HCWs found that being younger, more junior, parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member were significantly associated with anxiety [29] and having an intermediate professional title were associated with anxiety (AOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.38-2.39), and healthcare workers engaged in the direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with anxiety (AOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02) [28] .Being married, having a chronic illness, having suspected COVID-19 family members, not having access to PPEs, and the age group of 30-39 and greater or equal to 40 years might increase the risk of anxiety towards COVID-19. Based on our findings, we recommend Hospital to avail PPEs and insure proper utilization of it. We suggest Ethiopian Government to give more emphasis for HCWs having chronic illness, suspected COVID-19 family members and older age groups to minimize their anxiety.Supporting information S1 Checklist.(DOCX) S1 File.(SAV)Debre Tabor University and Debre Tabor General Hospital Staffs.

The health authorities have since early February stepped up various prevention and intervention activities against COVID-19. Extensive contact tracing and immediate isolation of the confirmed cases was implemented by the Government during the early stages of the pandemic. However, within less than three months after the index case of COVID-19, the virus quickly spread to all parts of the country. By the first week of June, all regions reported COVID-19 cases, with Addis Ababa constituting about 75% of the cases [11] . Increased number of imported cases along with increased number of secondary cases subsequently contributed to community transmission. As of 13 th December, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia has reached 116,769 and the number of deaths is 1,806.The initial containment measures used to contain COVID-19 in Ethiopia during March and April 2020 included intense surveillance for infections, not only in incoming travelers but also screening of individuals at high risk of infection who had close contact with a confirmed case, immediate isolation of all confirmed cases, quarantine, and a public campaign for social distancing and preventive practices. While many governments around the world have implemented drastic measures to slow down the rate of transmission of COVID-19 such as severe travel restrictions and lockdowns [24] , the Government of Ethiopia has implemented a variety of less drastic essential measures in response to the spread of the virus, such as airport surveillance and suspension of flights, travel restrictions, closure of international borders, flexible working arrangements, closing schools and universities, and mandatory quarantine well ahead of many countries around the world. Religious organizations cancelled services from March 31 st onwards, and conferences and other mass gatherings and sports have been banned. State of emergency was declared on 8 th April 2020 [25] . At the end of May, wearing facemask in public was enforced as mandatory.Studies have shown that strong public health measures such as social distancing and preventive behaviors have resulted in a substantial reduction in the transmission of COVID-19 [16, 20] . The impact of public health interventions and population behavioral changes that have been rolled out in Ethiopia to contain COVID-19 transmission has not been evaluated. High public compliance to proper risk reduction measures such as practicing social distancing, wearing mask, frequent handwashing and staying home can be effectively achieved if the public understands and is persuaded of the importance of these measures in the prevention and control of COVID-19 [27] .Thus far, very limited research has reported on how individuals have practiced protective behaviors in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia [28] [29] [30] . The aim of this study was to assess the health protective measures such as social distancing and preventive behaviors of government employees in Addis Ababa in response to COVID-19. The results of this study are important to inform future efforts focusing on the people's readiness to comply with pandemic control measures and the development of preventive strategies and health promotion programs, given that proper practices of social distancing and preventive behaviors can play important roles in the prevention and control of COVID-19.This study was conducted in Addis Ababa city administration three months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Ethiopia. Addis Ababa city has the highest rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ethiopia, and is considered as an epicenter of COVID-19 in the country. Of the total 4,070 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of 19 th June, the majority (73.4%) of the cases were reported from Addis Ababa. During the data collection period between 8 th and 19 th June 2020, the total number of confirmed new COVID-19 cases reported in the country was 2,064 including 45 deaths, of which Addis Ababa contributed 71.6% of the cases and 89% of the deaths.During the 12 days of data collection, the number of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa increased from 1,625 on 8 th June to 2,988 on 19 th June, representing an increase of 84%. The most impacted subcities included Addis Ketema, Lideta, and Gulele, while Akaki sub-city had the lowest number of cases, and most of the cases were due to community transmission as of the first week of May.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among government employees of 46 public institutions located in Addis Ababa. Due to physical distancing restrictions, it was not possible to conduct a representative community-based face-to-face interview during this period. As a result, this study collected data using institution-based self-administered survey. The study population for this study constituted all government employees, working in the selected government institution at the time of the survey and willing to participate in the study. These included professionals, experts, technicians and support staff working at different hierarchies and divisions/directorates in the institution including higher and midlevel officials.A paper-based self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data [Additional file 2]. The questionnaire was developed by the research team for the purpose of this survey, and some questions were adapted from the WHO tools used for a similar study [31] . The questionnaire had three main parts: (1) socio-demographic characteristics; (2) social distancing, and (3) preventive practices. The tool was initially developed in English and translated into Amharic and Afan Oromo by experienced personnel, and back translated into English for accuracy by independent personnel.Trained personnel with previous experience collected the data using standardized paper-based selfadministered questionnaires. The questionnaire included an introductory information on the cover letter to inform participants about the study and explaining the purpose of the survey, consent information to ensure voluntary participation in the study while ensuring confidentiality of data, and researchers contact information for any questions the respondent might have. Individuals who declined to participate were excluded from the survey. Participants completed the questionnaires by themselves in the local language (Afan Oromo in the Oromia Regional State Offices and Amharic otherwise).Preventive behaviors or hygiene practices include wearing a facemask, washing hands more frequently with water and soap, using hand sanitizer more regularly, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces including mobile phones, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing using a tissue paper or bent elbow.Basic descriptive statistical methods such as frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, and cross-tabulations were conducted to summarize the data and determine the differences between groups for selected demographic variables. Descriptive statistics by level of government were summarized using frequency distribution tables. Preventive health measures scores were compared according to demographic characteristics with independent samples t-test, or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test using Tukey HSD post-hoc comparison as appropriate.Bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with outcome variables. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each predictor were estimated from the logistic regression to quantify the associations between potential predictors and outcome variables. The statistical significance level was set at p<0.05.In total, 1,730 eligible participants from 46 government institutions were invited to participate in the study and 1,577 participants completed the questionnaires. Of these, 1,573 were valid and used for analysis (91.6%). The completed questionnaires per institution ranged from 18-58, with an average of 34.3. About 91% of the study participants provided written informed consent, while 9% provided verbal informed consent. Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants. About 40% of the study participants were drawn from national institutions, 38 .8% from Addis Ababa city administration institutions and 21.6% from Oromia Regional State institutions located in Addis Ababa. The majority of the respondents were in the age group of 18 and 39 years (73.3%), male (64.2%), with a bachelor's degree or above (88.3%) and lived in Addis Ababa (82.2%). The mean (±SD) year of service in the institution was 6.6 (±6.4) years. About 19% of the respondents reported that they were tested for COVID-19, 7.1% reported any chronic illness, and only 2% were quarantined due to COVID-19.Respondents were asked to indicate the types of protective measures they applied to prevent contracting COVID-19. Figure 1 presents the proportions of respondents who reported positively to the 14 social distancing measures and preventive practices taken in response to COVID-19.Overall, more than 9 in 10 respondents (95.9%) reported wearing facemask, 95.6% reported that they consistently followed the recommendations from the authorities to combat COVID-19, 92%reported that they recommended the wearing of facemask for healthy people out of the healthcare setting, 94.5% avoided close contact with people including handshaking, 94.1% reported frequently washing hands with water and soap, 90.8% covered mouth/nose while coughing or sneezing, 90.7% avoided touching eyes, nose and mouth (90.7%), and 89.5% practiced physical distancing. The majority of the respondents also reported avoiding mass gatherings and crowded places (88.1%), disinfected surfaces (77.6%), disinfected mobile phones (76.9%), restricted movement and traveling (71.8%), ate garlic, ginger and lemon (57.9%). The lowest level of compliance in response to COVID-19 was related to staying home, which was reported by 38.6% of participants.About 19% (n=300) of the respondents reported that they had ever tested for coronavirus infection, with 25% of respondents at national level, 19.3% from Addis Ababa and 7.7% from Oromia. With regard to the question on the certainty of getting a COVID-19 test if needed, 11% of the respondents were completely sure, 18.1% were very sure, and 26% were somewhat sure. However, 15 .1% did not know and 14.6% were not at all sure where and when to get coronavirus test if they wanted to be tested. Table 5 shows the results of the bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses conducted to explore factors associated with testing for COVID-19. In the bivariate analyses gender, age, year of experience, level of government, area of residence, reported chronic illness and being quarantined were significantly associated with testing for COVID-19. In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, the age groups 18-29 were more likely to test for coronavirus than the older age groups. In contrast, respondents from Oromia were less likely to test for coronavirus (adjusted OR=0.31, 95% CI:0.16-0.60) than those from national level. Gender, educational status, year of experience, household size, residence, reported chronic illness and being quarantined did not appear statistically significant in the multivariable logistic regression model to predict the odds of testing for COVID-19.The findings of the current study revealed high level of reported practices of COVID-19 protective measures, particularly with regard to mask wearing in public (95.9%), avoiding close contact with people and handshaking (94.5%), frequent handwashing with water and soap (94.1%), maintaining physical distancing (89.5%), avoiding crowds and gatherings (88%), and movement restriction (72%). A study conducted during the early phase of the pandemic in Ethiopia reported a lower level of protective behaviors against the COVID-19 infection such as washing hands frequently (77%), avoiding shaking hands (54%) and not going to crowded places (33%) [30] . A study conducted in Malaysia reported that a high proportion of respondents already adopted avoidance behaviors such as not going to crowded places (83%) and practicing proper hand hygiene (88%)at the time of their study in late March 2020, despite low level of mask wearing (51%) [35] . It has been observed that staying at home, maintaining physical distancing, avoiding public transport and escaping going to public places is particularly difficult for many government employees, resulting in less adoption of these protective measures.A study conducted during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in China identified that respondents adopted important protective behaviors, and nearly all study participants (98%) wore masks when going out in public during the study period [40] . In Hong Kong, individual behaviors in the population changed in response to the threat of COVID-19, and 85% of respondents reported avoiding crowded places and 99% reported wearing facemasks in public [16] . Until effective treatments and vaccines are available, behavioral interventions such as social distancing and preventive practices are the most recommended tools to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 [41] . Studies found that the non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine, isolation, physical distancing, and changes in population behavior) were substantially associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 [16] . Maintaining and sustaining high levels of actual protective practices, particularly wearing mask at public, is critically important and concerted efforts should be made by the government, media, healthcare professionals, local organizations, the community and individuals to combat COVID-19 focusing on preventive health behaviors.Recently, masks have mainly been worn by individuals in the general community who have certain respiratory symptoms and by those who feel particularly susceptible to infection and want to protect themselves [16] .The current study also assessed factors affecting the perceived effectiveness of mask wearing against the prevention of coronavirus infection. It was found that respondents from Oromia were less likely to report the effectiveness of wearing facemasks to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 than those from national or Addis Ababa levels, which could be associated with inadequate awareness or knowledge about the protective benefits of wearing facemask against the infection of SARS-COV-2. The more people became aware of the risk of COVID-19 to themselves, the more likely they begin practicing protective behaviors like mask wearing, handwashing and social distancing. In Ethiopia, mask wearing in public is not a common practice before the occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic. Even after the onset of the pandemic, mask wearing practice in public was very minimal, but it increased immediately when the mandatory policy of facemask wearing for all people in public and working places was enforced at the end of May 2020.A significant proportion (58%) of respondents in the current study reported that they used garlic, ginger and lemon to protect themselves against SARS-COV-2 infection, which indicates unconfirmed practices or misconceptions. Although these home remedies are important ingredients of our daily food and may have some medicinal properties, it is a great misconception to believe and use them against COVID-19 since they have not been tested against SARS-COV-2. Studies have found no evidence that the use of herbal remedies such as garlic and ginger is effective against infection from coronavirus or cure from COVID-19 [49, 50] . The WHO has also confirmed that there is no evidence that eating garlic or ginger has protected people from SARS-COV-2 infection [51] . Current evidence shows that using ginger or garlic or combining them with other ingredients, such as lemon, or drinking hot ginger tea will not prevent or cure COVID-19.This study had some limitations including selection bias that deserve explanations. First, the study only included government employees in Addis Ababa, and it failed to include unemployed people or other individuals working in non-governmental or private institutions, leading to concerns about the representativeness of the sample. There might be differences in adapting protective health measures between employed and unemployed people as well as between employees of governmental and non-governmental institutions. Second, due to the threat of COVID-19 and the physical distancing rule, it was not possible to conduct either a face-to-face interview or a community-based representative study. Third, the data presented in this study are based on retrospective self-reports of respondents without verification, thus the results might be subject to social desirability and recall biases.This study was funded by Addis Ababa University (AAU) and partly supported by the School of Public Health.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-12-16",12

Before COVID-19, there were previous pandemics and epidemics that impacted the global economy, such as the 1957 and 1958 H2N2 virus, the 1968 H3N2 virus, the 2009 and 2010 Swine Flu, the 2014e2016 Ebola virus, the 2012 MERS virus, and, at the height of them, the 1918 H1N1 virus pandemic. 1 The COVID-19 pandemic bears striking semblance with the 1918 pandemic in terms of biological features (both are respiratory diseases spread through contacts and droplets); coverage of transmission (the 1918 influenza spread to about one-third of the global populace while COVID-19 has recorded close to nine million confirmed cases worldwide in just about six months); and health response (quarantine, isolation, use of disinfectants, calls for better hygiene, and restrictions on travels and gatherings). 2 The economic consequences revealed by the novel coronavirus pandemic have brought to the fore the need to better understand pandemics and how they affect economic activities including the stock market. The theoretical basis for studying the pandemicsestocks nexus lies in the argument that stock prices, returns and volatility respond to news and macroeconomic conditions that shape investors' sentiments about the level of uncertainty in financial markets (see Haroon & Rizvi, 2020a Narayan, 2019 Narayan, , 2020 Salisu, Ogbonna, & Adediran, 2020, among others) . During pandemics, like during wars, natural disasters and financial crises, the level of uncertainty in the markets is exceptionally high, and so is the level of risk aversion among investors (see Eichenbaum et al., 2020; Haroon & Rizvi, 2020b; Ma et al., 2020; Qadan, 2019; .The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock market performance has been widely investigated (see Ashraf, 2020; bib_Akhtaruzzaman_et_al_2020Akhtaruzzaman et al., 2020 Al-Awadhi et al., 2020; Ali et al., 2020; Baig et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2020; Haroon & Rizvi, 2020a He et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2020; Phan & Narayan, 2020; Salisu & Sikiru, 2020; Salisu & Vo, 2020; Salisu, Ebuh, & Usman, 2020b; Topcu & Gulal, 2020; Zaremba et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . While the majority of these studies examined the effect of COVID-19 on stock market performance from the perspective of global trading, pooling developed and emerging stock markets (see Ashraf, 2020; Ali et al., 2020; Haroon & Rizvi, 2020a Phan & Narayan, 2020; Salisu & Vo, 2020; Salisu, Ebuh, & Usman, 2020b; Zaremba et al., 2020; , a few others focused on developed stock markets (see Akhtaruzzaman et al., 2020; Baig et al., 2020) .The studies on emerging stock markets, such as Al-Awadhi et al. (2020), Gu et al. (2020) , He et al. (2020) and Mishra et al. (2020) , only consider the stock performance of firms in China or India, thus precluding empirical evidence on the effect of COVID-19 on the stock market performance of emerging economies. Limited studies on groups of emerging economies include Haroon and Rizvi (2020a) and Topcu and Gulal (2020) . While Haroon and Rizvi (2020a) find that the increasing number of confirmed coronavirus cases deteriorates the liquidity condition of emerging stock markets, Topcu and Gulal (2020) conclude that the negative impact of COVID-19 on emerging stock markets has gradually fallen and had begun to taper off by mid-April 2020. Meanwhile, unlike most of the existing studies that focus essentially on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we consider a broader scope that covers various pandemics and epidemics and thus provide an in-depth understanding of the economic impacts of these infectious diseases in general and COVID-19 in particular. A broader understanding of pandemics has both policy and investment implications.In reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global financial markets dominated by advanced economies have been shown to generate increased fear-induced market risks (see Ali et al., 2020; Baker et al., 2020; Okorie & Lin, 2020; , leading to likely investment losses during the spread as investors tended to engage in panic stock selling (see Phan & Narayan, 2020; Shen et al., 2020; among others) . Can this conclusion be extended to all pandemics and epidemics? This is the main research question this study seeks to answer. In addition, we focus on emerging stock markets, which seem to have been understudied during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to their developed counterparts. The integration of both categories of stock markets (developed and emerging) usually constitutes the basis for determining the hedging potential of stock markets (see Jin et al., 2020, for a review) . A study similar to this one was undertaken by Haroon and Rizvi (2020a) and Topcu and Gulal (2020) ; however, these studies differ in terms of the scope of pandemics, measures of uncertainty, methodology and analyses. We also examine the role of government policy interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic (see Ashraf, 2020) .Overall, we offer the following contributions to the literature: First, we utilise data that captures uncertainty due to UPE, including those associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Zika virus, and COVID-19 (see Baker et al., 2020) , to examine the hedging effectiveness or vulnerability of emerging stock markets to pandemics. In other words, we employ UPE to assess whether emerging stocks can serve as a good hedge to uncertainty due to pandemics. Second, in addition to examining the hedging effectiveness or vulnerability of emerging stock markets to pandemics, we also test whether the information about the uncertainties can be exploited to produce better [in-sample and out-of-sample] forecast results for stock returns of emerging markets above the model with no predictor (historical average). Studies have shown that such information may be useful for forecasting purpose (see Salisu & Adediran, 2020; Salisu & Vo, 2020) .Third, we consider a newly constructed global fear index for the COVID-19 pandemic (see ) as a form of additional analysis to complement the results obtained for the same period using the UPE data. The intention here is to test whether the outcome is sensitive to the measure of pandemics. The global fear index has been assessed to produce better forecast outcomes for stock returns than the historical average (see . Finally, we extend the analyses to cover the developed stock markets in order to test whether the response of the stock market to pandemics is influenced by the level of integration or development of the market. For instance, there is evidence of a differing response of emerging and developed countries to the hedging effectiveness of global sectoral stocks such as Global Energy, Financials, Industrials, and Technologies ETFs (see Jin et al., 2020) . Overall, the results reveal that emerging stock markets offer less protection to investors against uncertainty due to pandemics and epidemics relative to developed stock markets. In addition, exploiting the information contained in the uncertainty data can improve stock return forecasts and outperform a restrictive model that ignores it. The results leading to this conclusion are robust to alternative measures of pandemics, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic.We pursue the objectives of the study in the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology, Section 3 discusses the data and preliminary results, and Section 4 discusses the predictability results. Conclusions are offered in Section 5.Our empirical model hinges on the international portfolio diversification theory, which has demonstrated that portfolio diversification in emerging economies could provide investors in developed market economies with a lower risk for a given level of expected return (Moosa & Ramiah, 2014; Al Nasser & Hajilee, 2016; Chen, 2018; Prasad et al., 2018; Dong & Yoon, 2019) . We therefore test whether the emerging stocks provide effective hedge against pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this objective, we consider the following. First, we formulate a predictive model that incorporates the uncertainty index for UPE as the only predictor. Second, we test whether the results are robust to additional (control) variables such as oil prices (a good proxy for the global factor) (see Phan et al., 2015; Salisu et al., 2019) and emerging market stock market volatility (a good proxy for financial uncertainty) (see Salisu & Vo, 2020) . 3 Third, we evaluate the predictive power of the uncertainty index both for in-sample and out-of-sample periods by comparing its forecast performance with a benchmark model that ignores uncertainty in the valuation of stocks. Lastly, we replicate all the analyses for the developed stock markets as a form of additional analysis while we also consider an alternative measure of index for pandemics, focusing on COVID-19 for robustness.From the foregoing, we construct the following predictive model for stock returns that accommodates any inherent heterogeneity and unobserved common factors among the crosssections in addition to the predictor series 4 (see Chudik et al., 2016; Chudik & Hashem Pesaran, 2015; Ditzen, 2018; Westerlund et al., 2016) :i ¼ 1; 2; :::; N; t ¼ 1; 2; :::; T:where r it denotes stock returns computed as log returns, given as 100*logðS it =S i;tÀ1 Þ with S it defined as the stock index data for country i at period t; UPE i;tÀj represents uncertainty due to pandemics and epidemics; Z it is a vector of control variables; a i andb ij represent the heterogeneous intercept and slope coefficients, respectively, which are allowed to vary across the units; f i is a vector of corresponding parameters for the control variables with similar features as a i andb i ; and ε it is the composite error term comprising an unobserved common factor loading ðc t Þ, accompanied by a heterogeneous factor loading ðl i Þ and the remainder error term. ðu it Þ. Thus, in addition to allowing for heterogeneity in the predictability, we also incorporate unobserved common factors for the selected stocks. For the predictability of UPE, we allow up to five lags given in a 5-day daily data frequency, in which stock return is expected to exhibit day-of-the-week effect (see also Salisu & Vo, 2020; Zhang et al., 2017) . Thus, the hedging potential of emerging markets against risk associated with pandemics is evaluated using the Wald test for joint significancemarkets are likely to at least retain the value of their returns, on the average, in the face of pandemics, if P 5 j¼1 b j is positive and statistically significant; otherwise, they are more likely to be vulnerable. As noted earlier, we test whether the inclusion of uncertainty information in the predictive model of stock returns will enhance its forecast outcome. This is achieved by comparing the forecast performance of the unrestricted model (equation (1)) with the restricted model (which is the historical average or, in this case, the constant return model). The constant return model ignores any potential predictor of stock returns and has been widely used in empirical research as the baseline model when evaluating stock return predictability (see Bannigidadmath & Narayan, 2015; Devpura et al., 2018; Narayan et al., 2016; Narayan & Gupta, 2015; Phan et al., 2015; Salisu et al., 2019) . The constant returns model could be specified as r it ¼ a þ ε it /t ¼ 1; 2; 3; :::; T; i ¼ 1; 2; 3; :::; N ½3We employ both the single root mean square error (RMSE) and pairwise Clark and West (CW) test (2007) forecast measures to evaluate the forecasts. While a lower RMSE value is preferred between two competing models, the CW test involves testing whether the difference in the forecast errors of two nested models is statistically significant. For a forecast horizon h, the CW test is specified aswhere b f tþh is the forecast horizon;M b SE r and M b SE u denote the mean squared errors of the restricted and unrestricted predictive models, respectively; and they are computed as P À1 P ðr i;tþh À b r ri;tþh Þ 2 and P À1 P ðr i;tþh À b r ui;tþh Þ 2 , respectively. The term is included to adjust for noise in the unrestricted model and it is defined by P À1 P ðb r ri;tþh À b r ui;tþh Þ 2 ; P is the amount of predictions in which the averages are computed. Lastly, the statistical significance of regressing b f tþh on a constant confirms the CT test. The null hypothesis of a zero coefficient is rejected if this statistic is greater than þ1.282 (for a one-sided 0.10 test), þ1.645 (for a one-sided 0.05 test) and þ2.00 for 0.01 test (for a one-sided 0.01 test) (see Clark & West, 2007) . In terms of data split for the forecast analyses, we adopt a 50:50 data split for the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast evaluations involving the full sample. Three out-of-sample forecast horizons, namely 10-day, 20-day and 30-day ahead forecast horizons, are considered. However, for the COVID-19 sample, we adopt a 75:25 data split due to data limitations.We collected the daily data of major stock indices of 24 emerging market economies based on the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) country classification. The countries include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. For completeness and comparison, the responsiveness to uncertainty of the stock returns due to UPE of 21 developed economies is also considered. These countries are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA).The stock index data for each country was obtained from www.investing.com/, historical data archive. 5 In addition, we collected the newspaper-based Equity Market Volatility Infectious Disease Tracker (EMV) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis database (available at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ INFECTDISEMVTRACKD). The EMV index documents and quantifies increases in economic uncertainty, and it is constructed by Baker et al. (2019) . To construct the index, the authors identify three indicators: stock market volatility, newspaper-based economic uncertainty, and subjective uncertainty in business expectation surveys that provide real-time, forward-looking uncertainty measures. The following three steps are involved in the construction of the Baker et al.'s (2019) newspaper-based EMV tracker for measuring uncertainty due to UPE. In the first step, calculate the monthly fraction of articles in 11 major US newspapers that contain (a) terms related to the economy, (b) terms related to equity markets and (c) terms related to market volatility. In the second step, identify the subset of EMV articles that contain one or more terms related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases (such as epidemic, pandemic, virus, flu, disease, coronavirus, MERS, SARS, Ebola, H5N1 or H1N1). In the third step, the fraction of EMV articles that contain one of these terms is multiplied by the EMV tracker to yield Infectious Disease EMV tracker (see Baker et al., 2019, for details) . This was used as the measure of uncertainty due to UPE in this study.The data sample start period was selected to ensure a balanced panel data set across the cross-section of countries. Therefore, the sample ranges between May 10, 2016 and June 17, 2020, which gives a total of 1058 observations. However, as previously mentioned, we perform distinct analyses before and after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the data is portioned into two periods: pre-and post-COVID-19. The pre-COVID-19 period ranges between May 2016 and December 2019, while post-COVID-19 covers the period of January to July 2020 based on data availability.The summary statistics presented in Table 1 show the mean and the standard deviation of equity market volatility, the stock returns of emerging and developed economies under the full sample, and before and after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate average negative return on emerging stock markets across all periods, while positive average returns were observed on developed stock markets over the full sample and before the COVID-19 pandemic. After the emergence of COVID-19, the results show that negative returns on emerging stock markets increased, and the average stock returns of developed stock markets became negative. This is indicative of the high adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on both the emerging and developed stock markets. The results also confirm an important corporate finance hypothesis, which states that the higher the risk, the higher the returns (see Salisu & Oloko, 2015) . This is apparent as the developed stock markets with relatively higher returns have a higher standard deviation, which indicates that the developed markets are relatively riskier compared to the emerging stock markets. Evidence of the higher risk of developed stock markets was displayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the results show that on the average, stock returns of developed stock markets fall with a higher magnitude (À0.12%) compared to that of the emerging stock markets (À0.06%).More so, the result of EMV for infectious diseases (Table 1) shows a drastic increase in the level of uncertainty after the outbreak of COVID-19. This implies that the outbreak has a significant impact on the confidence of investors, making them risk averse and thereby increasing stock market uncertainty and discouraging investment (Salisu & Vo, 2020) . Table 2 illustrates how the stock returns of emerging and developed stock markets behave under different level of uncertainties. With reference to emerging stock markets, the result suggests that in the period of tranquillity (when the EMV is low, below its mean), the average stock returns are positive but lower than those of the developed countries before the outbreak of COVID-19. With an increase in EMV after COVID-19 had been declared a pandemic (where EMV increases, higher than its average), the average stock returns for both emerging and developed markets were negative, but the negative effect was weaker for emerging stock markets than for developed stock markets. This is consistent with the earlier result (discussed in Table 1 ). This result can also be echoed from the empirical results for individual countries as seen in appendices A and B.Having highlighted some descriptive statistics for relevant variables, we proceed to the empirical section which involves 5 The platform provides real-time data, quotes, charts, financial tools, breaking news and analysis across 250 exchanges from around the world in 44 language editions. With more than 46 million monthly users and over 400 million sessions, the platform is one of the top three global financial websites according to both Similar Web and Alexa. predictability and forecast performance analysis. We first examined the sole effect of the predictor: in this case, uncertainty due to pandemics and epidemics -UPE (i.e., model without control). Our results show that, overall, emerging stock markets are more vulnerable to health risks than developed stock markets. By implication, this means that health risks impacted negatively more on emerging stock markets than on developed stock markets. This result also suggests that both markets showed a certain level of tolerance to health risk during the COVID-19 outbreak, with developed markets showing a significantly higher level of tolerance. This result is corroborated by Su et al. (2019) and Qadan, 2019. The relatively lower resilience of emerging stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that investment in emerging stock markets is not a suitable safe-haven option for potential investors (see Dutta et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020) . In other words, risk-averse investors in emerging stock markets will need to shun domestic asset sentiment and diversify their investment portfolio with assets that are more resilient to pandemics and epidemics, such as gold. Evidently, Dutta et al. (2020) noted that gold serves better than bitcoin as a safehaven asset. This was also supported by Ji et al. (2020) , who found that gold and soybean futures possess strong safe-haven roles. The result may also suggest that developed stock markets provide a better hedge against UPE than emerging stock markets (see Conlon & McGee, 2020) .The inclusion of some control variables, in this case financial risk, increases the overall vulnerability in both marketsdalthough developed market stock was more vulnerable during the COVID-19 period. A plausible explanation for this is because developed economies had high incidences of the coronavirus disease, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as lock down and social distancing were more adhered to in developed economies than in emerging economies. It is also noteworthy to mention that by the time COVID-19 was ravaging America and Europe, home to most developed economies, China, the primary epicentre of the disease and place of outbreak, was already recovering.We also evaluated the forecast power of the uncertainty indicator; therefore, we partitioned the data sample into insample and out-of-sample periods using the 75:25 data split, respectively. These results are presented in Table 4 . Forecast evaluation is based on the CW test, and the decision rule is that a positive and significant value of the constant parameter in the test equation shows that our model's performance outperforms the benchmark model (i.e. historical average). An overview of the table shows that our proposed model, with or without control variables, provides better forecasting results in contrast to the benchmark model. The significance of the CW test is higher during the COVID-19 Note: EMV denotes equity market valuation for infectious diseases; before and after denotes periods before and after the announcement of COVID-19 as a world pandemic, respectively; and full is the combination of both periods.

SD represents standard deviation. period than the pre-COVID-19 period for both markets, which implies that inclusion of health and financial risks is crucial when forecasting stock returns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the out-of-sample forecast are similar to the in-sample forecast; however, inclusion of financial risk may not be as crucial in the emerging market as it is in the developed market, Table 3 .In line with the study's second contribution, as discussed in the introduction section, we extend the predictability analysis for the post COVID-19 period using a newly constructed global fear and panic index ðgfiÞ constructed with the number of daily cases and deaths for COVID-19 (see . The stock returns predictability is re-estimated using the global fear index; thereafter, the forecast performance is evaluated and compared with both the baseline constant returns and emv-based predictability models. The predictability and forecast evaluation results are summarised in Table  5 . The estimated stock returns predictability regression for the global fear index shows that the coefficient of one-period lagged for gfi is negative and statistically significant. Furthermore, the forecast performance results show that the gfi-based model outperforms both the historical average and emv-based model for the in-sample and out-of-sample data partitions for the three forecast horizons. By implication, while both the infectious disease and global fear index stock returns predictability models perform better than the historical average model, the global fear indexdwhich combines both the reported cases and deaths due to COVID-19din its computation outperforms the infectious disease equity market volatility index.In addition, following Ashraf (2020), we examine the effect of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic on stock returns of emerging and developed stock markets. Government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were quantified using Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from OXCGRT database (see also Hale et al., 2020) . The OXCGRT Table 4 In-sample and out-of-sample forecast evaluations in-sample forecast evaluation. Clark & West, 2007) . Values in square brackets [ ] are for t-statistics; a, b and c indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively. Also, out-of-sample forecast evaluations during COVID-19 are h ¼ 5, 10 and 20, due to small sample size. government response index comprised three main indexes: the stringency index, containment and health index, and economic support index. The effect of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic is presented in Table 6 . Markedly, the results show that accounting for government responses does not significantly impact the relationship between UPE and emerging stock markets. However, government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic appear to reduce the impact of UPE on the developed stock markets. This suggests that developed economies respond more positively to government responses than emerging economies, and better performance of developed stock markets may be due to sounder government responses.This study attempts to contribute to the growing literature on the role of pandemics in the valuation of emerging market stocks.Following the proposition of the international portfolio diversification theory, we demonstrate whether harnessing information contained in the uncertainty of infectious diseases could help investors make decisions that will lower risks in the presence of pandemics. For the purpose of making meaningful generalizations, we collected daily data on 24 emerging stock markets; and for completeness and comparison, we gathered similar data on 21 developed stock markets. Thereafter, we partitioned our data into three sub-samples: full sample and periods before and after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.Empirical evidence from this study suggests that uncertainty due to UPE impacted negatively more on emerging market stocks than on developed market stocks. More importantly, we found that the negative relationship between pandemics and stock returns is more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result is robust to alternative measures of the COVID-19 pandemic and is consistent across in-sample and out-of-sample forecast periods. The relatively lower resilience of emerging stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that investment in emerging stock markets is not a good safe-haven option for potential investors (see Dutta et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020) . This also suggests that the developed stock markets provide a better hedge against UPE than the emerging stock markets. Accounting for the role of government policies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our results suggest that government policies have no significant influence on the effect of uncertainty due to UPE on the stock returns of emerging markets.

Morbidity and mortality of this pandemic are not evenly distributed. A number of factors including pre-existing immunity could explain the low mortality observed in some countries. In Gabon, from March (first case detected) to October 2020 more than 200,000 subjects have been screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a prevalence of 4.4% and a death rate among detected cases of 0.6% (https://africacdc.org/covid-19/). With median age around 20 years old and more than 60% of the population under 25 years old, Gabon is a T A B L E 1 Clinical and anthropomorphic data of subjects whom sera were reactive to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay | 129 country with a young population (IndexMundi). The youth of the population may only partially explain the very low mortality rate observed. Sette et al., 1 have illustrated a memory response to SARS-CoV-2 antigen from lymphocytes collected prior SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We believe that the diversity of pathogens in Africa increases the population probability to be exposed to cross-protective epitopes. The prevalence of the pre-existing immunity in healthcare workers continuously in contact with different pathogens is unknown. The present study investigated circulating cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers.In this study, we selected 135 sera from healthy subjects, collected five (5) Using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics France) for the qualitative detection of antibodies reactive against SARS-CoV-2, we screened selected sera for pre-existing humoral cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The tests were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay detects predominantly immunoglobulin G (IgG), but also immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M. Sera showing an index (cutoff index [COI]) ≥ 1.0 was said to be reactive illustrating the presence of antibodies reactive against SARS-CoV-2 in the sera. Reactive samples were re-assayed in an independent experiment for confirmation. We also screened all reactive samples for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus-1/2 antibodies (IgM and IgG). All participants signed written informed consent before enrollment.We screened 135 sera that we collected from healthy subject 5 years before the COVID-19 pandemic) for their reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen. The sera were from 88 females (65.2%) and 47 males (34.8%), aged between 14 and 80 years old. The median age was 38 years (clinical and anthropomorphic data of all study subjects are in the supplementary file). Overall, 23.7% (32 out of 135) of the tested sera were reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant nucleocapsid (N) antigen. Clinical and anthropomorphic data of subjects whom sera were reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 are confined in Table 1 . Figure 1 shows the distribution of the samples COI. Most reactive samples had COI between two and five (84% of reactive samples) indicating a strong antigens recognition in these samples. Only five participants (15.6%) had COI less than two (but above one). Antigen recognition was particularly high in six participants with COI above five. The observed COI were confirmed in a second experiment (Figure 2) . Four of the six participant with COI above five confirmed their strong reactivity. Cross-reactivity was confirmed in all samples in the second experiment indicating a robust reaction. This is the first report explicitly showing a cross-reactive humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in Africa particularly in healthcare workers. Our data is adding to the accumulating data that point toward the existence of cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. 1 It showed that years before the COVID-19 pandemic people had cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This observation not only supports the existence of a preexisting cross immunity in the African population. [3] [4] [5] One could attribute the occurrence of the SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive humoral response to the similarity between coronaviruses N-proteins. However, a study showed no cross-reactivity between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the N protein from common cold coronaviruses. 6 The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay used to identify SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies has been evaluated in several independent studies and is considered as one of the most accurate COVID-19 serological test. 3, 5 Although this assay is highly sensitive (above 98%) and specific (above 95%), according to the manufacturer, very few sera from acute CMV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections were reactive to the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. 7 This suggests cross-reactive antibodies in the sera of selected acute CMV and EBV patients. We would argue that the cross-reactivity observed by the manufacturer for CMV and EBV may be due pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies in these samples and not to the similarity of epitopes between CMV, EBV and SARS-CoV-2. Because, if the similarity of epitopes was the cause of cross-reactivity, the percentage of CMV and EBV samples positive on the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay would have been much higher.In our study, although the sera used were from healthy subjects with no signs of infection, 8 out of the 32 SARS-CoV-2 reactive sera (25%) were positives for anti-CMV IgG. One could be tempted to link the observed cross reactivity to selected anti-CMV IgG antibodies. We believe that any infection that leads to the production of antibodies that cross react with SARS-CoV-2 antigens need to be investigated further to substantiate or confute the development of a cross protective immunity. If the jury is still out regarding the origin or the source of pre-existing crossreactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, a high correlation between the presence of antibodies targeting against the N-protein and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies have been demonstrated. 8, 9 Therefore, cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may confer partial immunity that could be beneficial, as there is substantial evidence showing that preexisting cross-reactive immunity can be beneficial. 10, 11 Pre-existing cross-reactive humoral immunity in a segment of the population may have its drawbacks. Seroepidemiological surveys provide data that would make it possible to estimate the penetration of the virus into the population (infection attack rates) and to assess herd immunity. Here, pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein would lead to misinterpretation of the epidemiological situation. This finding has also an implication for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. In the present's light, COVID-19 vaccines clinical trials volunteers will have to undergo screening for pre-existing cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2; to guaranty the integrity of the trials. There is a possibility that pre-existing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 might be detrimental. 12, 13 The original antigenic sin, which describes the phenomenon whereby the development of immunity against antigen, is negatively shaped by the first exposure to a related antigen, is an example. It is clear that pre-existing immune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 is present in part of the population of all regions. The beneficial or detrimental effects of this pre-existing immune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 need to be investigated further.Cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are present in SARS-CoV-2 nonexposed people. Are these antibodies protectives? What infections may lead to cross protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2? Those questions could represent the starting point of perspective studies. recruitment of participants, acquisition the samples, experiments, and the study organization.

The first coronavirus was reported in 1966, and was isolated from patients suffering from common cold. (Bradburne et al., 1967) about 4 deacades later, severe outbreak of SARS reported in China in 2002 and spread quickly worldwide, resulting in an 11% mortality rate (Song et al., 2019) . In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) first emerged in Saudia Arabia and subsequently spread to other countries, with a fatality rate of 37% (Hui et al., 2018) . Recently, in December 2019, a novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 disease was originated during an outbreak from Wuhan, China (Sang et al., 2020; and finally, a recent outbreak has emerged in China in January 30, 2020, which became a serious public health emergency of international apprehension (Rodr ıguez- Morales et al., 2020) .The initial source of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown, although several studies have suggested that bats may be the potential natural host of SARS-CoV-2 Zhou et al., 2020) . The novel CoV can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets with direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes of the eye, mouth or nose, with an incubation period of about 5 days (average 2-14 days) Xia et al., 2020) . The symptoms start with fatigue, fever, dry cough, myalgia and dyspnea, and advance to have hypoxemia one week after onset, with septic shock, ARDS, metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction, with the danger of high recombination rates arising from high mutation rates of the virus. Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . Currently, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19, together with the serious lacking of clinical investigations (Rodr ıguez- Morales et al., 2020) .Some preliminary studies have investigated the effectiveness of anti-HIV combination, lopinavir/ritonavir, as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 protein synthesis, which is reported to bind to the endopeptidase C30 of SARS-CoV-2 protease as evaluated by molecular models (Lin et al., 2020; Walmsley et al., 2002) . Another study suggested the nucleoside analogues, such as Ribavirin, which was broadly used for treatment of SARS patients during the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, and Remdesivir which was conveyed to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vivo (Sang et al., 2020) . Immunosuppressive drugs as tocilizumab and meplazumab were also surveyed in an open-labeled clinical trial and resulted in a median virus clearance time, discharge time, and a better repair time (Bian et al., 2020; .Moreover, The antimalarial FDA-approved drug, Chloroquine, has been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug via effectively suppressing the recently emerged novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro (Savarino et al., 2006) . Undeniably, intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to face future outbreaks.Since some bioactive compounds from natural products have been reported to attain antiviral activity, they can be used as a starting point against SARS-CoV-2 (Ul Qamar et al., 2020) . Some flavonoids displayed antiviral activity as apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, amentoflavone and kaempferol, which were reported to inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Jo et al., 2020) . Therefore, the antiviral effect is presumed to be directly linked to suppress the activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in some cases (Jo et al., 2020) . So, we chose 14 bioactive flavonoids, most of them were isolated for the first time via metabolic profiling of the Lamiaceous plant, Ocimum menthiifolium, and proved to have anti-ulcer, local anaeasthetic and anti-inflammatory potencies (Zahran et al., 2019; Zahran et al., 2019) , and docked them against the 4 main targets: M pro , nsp16/nsp10 complex, ACE2-PD and RBD-S-protein involved in the Corona infection.The nsp16 protein is an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)dependent methyltransferase which is only activated in the presence of its activating partner nsp10. The activity of nsp16 requires the presence of SAM as a methyl donor which is seen in the active site of the methyl transferase. The methyltransferase catalyzes methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide at the ribose 2 0 -O position (2 0 -O-Me) (Aouadi et al., 2017) . The 2 0 -O-Me of virus cap RNAs shields itself from degradation by 5 0 -3 0 exoribonucleases, modify the genetic material of the virus to make it look more like the host (human) cell RNA, and helps to prevent recognition by the host innate immunity (Menachery, Debbink et al., 2014; Menachery, Yount et al., 2014) . The inhibition of nsp16/10 2 0 -O-MTase activities should restrain viral replication and enable recognition by the host innate immune system, making the nsp16/10-MTase a promising target for the identification of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs (Menachery, Yount et al., 2014) .Main protease (M pro ), on the other hand, is a key enzyme which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, via processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA and disrupting the viral life cycle (Jin et al., 2020) . So, inhibition of this enzyme can be a potential target to control SARS-CoV-2 infection as will be discussed. In addition, the integrity of the SARS-CoV particle is maintained via four proteins: The S (spike), E (envelop), M (membrane) and N (nucleocapsid) proteins (Han & Kr al, 2020) , where the S protein mediates the entry of the virus into host cells and is recognized by the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Based on that, S-protein and ACE2 are considered to play a crucial role in the biology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 (Li et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2012) .Ocimum menthiifolium aerial parts were collected in September 2016 from the National Garden of Jazan, Jazan KSA. It was identified by Professor Mohamed Abdelhady, Professor of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Minia University. A voucher specimen (Mn-ph-Cog-038) was reserved in the herbarium of Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Egypt.The butanol extract (3.7 g) of O. menthiifolium was subjected to LC-HR-ESI-MS Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography system coupled to a Synapt G2 HDMS quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, USA). A BEH C18 column (2.1 Â 100 mm, 1.7 lm particle size; Waters, Milford, USA) is employed for Chromatographic separation, as well as a guard column (2.1 Â 5 mm, 1.7 lm particle size) and a linear binary solvent gradient of 0%-100% eluent B over 6 min at a flow rate of 0.3 mL minÀ 1 . 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v) was used as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B, with injection volume 2 lL and a column temperature of 40 C. To convert the raw data into separate positive and negative ionization files, Ms converter software was used Using MZmine 2.12 as framework for MS data differential analysis were, the raw data were imported by selecting the ProteoWizard-converted files in mzML format ( Databases as DNP and METLIN were used for dereplicating each m/z ion peak (using RT and m/z threshold of ± 5 ppm), which provided the putative identities of all metabolomes of the butanol fraction in details (Elsayed et al., 2018 ).The structures of the four target proteins were downloaded from the protein data bank under the following codes: 6LU7, 6W4H, 6VW1 and 6M0J. The structures of the studied ligands were downloaded from PubChem and then subjected to energy minimization using 1000 steps of steepest descent followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradient algorithms on Avogadro software (Schrodinger, 2010) . Water molecules and non-protein residues in each enzyme were removed and hydrogens were added using PyMOL, then the proteins were prepared using Make Macromolecule command on PyRx (Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020) . For PDB files with multiple conformations, docking was done with both conformations and the best binding energy was reported (Dallakyan & Olson, 2015) . The docking calculations were done using AutoDock Vina (Trott & Olson, 2010) using a grid box of 25 Ã 25 Ã 25 Å 3 and exhaustiveness of 16. The grid box was centered on the internal ligand for 6LU7 and 6W4H. For 6VW1, the grid box was centered on residue E35 in the PD region of ACE2. For 6M0J, the grid box was centered on Q493 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) (Forli et al., 2016) . When possible, internal ligand was redocked to validate docking method and RMSD value was reported using DockRMSD server (Bell & Zhang, 2019) . 3D images were generated using PyMOL (Schrodinger, 2010) , while 2D interaction maps were generated using LigPlot Plus (Laskowski & Swindells, 2011 ).Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS 2020.2 molecular dynamics package (Abraham et al., 2015) . AMBER99SB-ILDN (Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010) force field was used for simulations. As the forcefield does not contain parameters for the ligand, all ligands were parameterized using ANTECHAMBER to generate parameters that are consistent with the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) (Wang et al., 2004) . AM1-BCC method was used to assign charges. ACPYPE was used (Da Silva & Vranken, 2012) for conversion of ligands topologies to format compatible with GROMACS. All simulations were performed in explicit water environment, using TIP3P model Complexes were solvated in a dodecahedron box system and were neutralized with the addition of Na þ and Clions (Mark & Nilsson, 2001) . Steepest descent was used for minimization and Fmax was set of no greater than 1000 kJ mol À1 nm À1 . Systems were equilibrated using NVT and NPT ensembles for 200 ps duration each, which was followed by a production run for 150 ns. The temperature in general was sustained at 300˚K using the Vrescale algorithm (Bussi et al., 2007) . For the regulation of systems pressure, the Parrinello-Rahman barostat was used (Parrinello & Rahman, 1981) . The LINCS (LINear Constraint Solver) algorithm was used for bond's length constraints (Hess et al., 1997) . The Particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used (Darden et al., 1993) for long-range electrostatics calculations. For all simulations timestep was set to 2 fs. Van der Waals cut-off distance was set to 1 nm. Binding free energies were calculated using g_mmpbsa program (Kumari et al., 2014) with MM-PBSA method adapted for GROMACS. In all cases, the predicted binding poses of complexes which are obtained by molecular docking were used as starting points for the corresponding simulations. MD runs were done for compounds 9, 11 and 14 with the 4 protein targets. Co-crystalized ligand if present was used as a control and was run under the same conditions.Investigated compounds were studied for their physicochemical properties and drug likeness using SwissADME server (Daina et al., 2017) . Toxicity profiles were predicted by pkCSM Server (Pires et al., 2015) and potential targets were investigated using Swiss Target Prediction (Daina et al., 2017) .Metabolic profiling of the secondary metabolites of the butanol fraction from O. menthiifolium using LC-HR-ESI-MS, resulted in the dereplication of 10 compounds (Table 1) using DNP and METLIN databases. The results revealed the identification of various flavonoids, iridoids and phenolic acids, named as: aucubigenin, caftaric acid, Gardoside, salvianolic acid F, tuberonic acid glucoside, sagerinic acid, prunin, acacetin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin-7-O-rutinoside and acaciin. The last 4 flavonoids were chosen for docking analysis with 10 other flavonoids previously isolated by us from both the DCM and the ethyl acetate fractions of O. menthiifolium via different chromatographic techniques (Zahran et al., 2019 (Zahran et al., , 2020 .Isolated bioactive flavonoids (1-14) (Figure 1) were docked against four SARS-CoV-2 potential targets. These targets were previously crystalized and are available through the protein data bank through www.rcsb.org. These targets include the viral main protease (M pro , PDB ID 6LU7), non-structural protein 16/10 complex (nsp16/10) which act as a methyl transferase (PDB ID 6W4H), human angiotensin converting enzyme 2-protease domain (ACE2-PD) which act as a receptor for the virus (PDB ID 6VW1) and the viral recognition binding domain (RBD) of the S protein which recognize its human receptor (PDB ID 6M0J). For the first 2 targets, M pro and nsp16/10 complex, the active site was easily recognized by the presence of a co-crystalized ligand and the docking grid box was centered on the internal ligand. For the other 2 targets, important amino acids that are involved in the interactions between human ACE2-PD and the viral RBD of the Sprotein, which include E35 in case of the ACE2 and Q493 in case of the S-protein, were used to center the grid box as reported in previous studies (Shang et al., 2020) .All the isolated compound showed the best binding energies with nsp16/10 complex, moderate affinities with the main protease and much weaker binding with the other two targets (Table 2) .To validate the docking procedure, the co-crystalized ligand (SAM) was redocked in the active site. The docking algorithm was able to reproduce very similar binding mode to the crystal structure with RMSD of 0.233 between the docked and the co-crystalized ligand (Figure 2a) . The binding site of the nsp16 is a negatively charged pocket that is formed by specific loops in the protein and shows KDKE methyl transferase motif consisting of Lysine-6844, Aspartic acid-6928, Lysine-6968 and Glutamic acid-7001. The crystal structure shows important interactions of SAM with nsp16 residues (Figure 2b ). The purine ring of SAM forms hydrogen bonds with L6898 and C6913 while the methionine part formed four hydrogen bonds with N6841, Y6845, G6879 and D6928. Several other residues involved in the hydrophobic interactions are shown in Figure 2b .The binding mode of the best docked compounds (9, 14 and 11), takes place in the same position of SAM in a close proximity to the KDKE methyl transferase motif. The carbohydrate part of these 3 compounds extend into a pocket that is formed between two alpha helices, aD and a6 (Figure 3 ). Apigenin-7-O-rutinoside (9) was the highest docked compound with nsp16/10 complex with binding energy of À9.4 Kcal/mol, along with prunin (11) and acaciin (14), with À9.3 Kcal/mol, for both, compared to the co-crystalized ligand (SAM) which attained À8.2 Kcal/mol, indicating higher binding affinities of the docked compounds. The flavonoid aglycon binds in the same binding site as SAM, where rings A and B of flavonoid 9 takes the same place of the adenosyl ring of SAM. Ring C of 9 extends into the KDKE methyltransferase motif and forms hydrophobic interactions with K6968 and D6828 of the KDKE motif. The 4 0 -OH of ring C forms a hydrogen bond with N6841 which is interacting with the methionine carboxylate of SAM in the crystal structure. Rings A and B substituents at 4 and 5 are involved in the hydrogen bond formation with N6899 which is a new interaction that was not seen in the crystal structure, in addition to other hydrogen bonds that are formed with D6912, C6913 and D6931. It worth to mention here that the sugar part especially the terminal moiety extends into a side pocket that is formed between the two alpha helices, aD and a6 and forms a new hydrogen bond interaction with D6931 ( Figure 4) .Binding mode of 14 was found to be very similar to that of 9 with most of the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions conserved (Figure 5a ). Binding of 11 is slightly shifted compared to 9 and 14. The single sugar moiety of 11 takes the same position of the terminal sugar of 9 which causes a shift of the whole flavonoid. Rings A and B are overlapped with the adenine of the SAM while ring C takes the same position of the ribose moiety of SAM (Figure 5b ). The compound still shows very similar binding energy (-9.3 kcal/ mol) comparable to 9 and 14.The results also suggest the importance of the rutinoside moiety in the binding, where two of the best compounds recognized by nsp16, apigenin-7-O-rutinoside (9) and Acaciin (14), attained the rutinoside moiety. In addition, loss of the terminal rhamnose in 14 decreased the affinity as seen with acacetin-7-O-glucoside (13) with a binding energy change of about 0.3 kcal/mol. Further removal of the remaining glucose moiety as seen with the aglycon acacetin (8) caused another 1.1 kcal/mol change in the binding energy. This clearly suggest the importance of the sugar moiety of the glycoside in the binding and recognition of nsp16.Binding of the tested compounds with M pro was generally weaker than that with nsp16/10 but stronger than the other 2 targets. Validation of the docking procedure with M pro was first done via redocking of the internal peptide-like ligand and the correct pose was predicted with good accuracy (RMSD of 1.839 between the docked the crystalized ligand). Among the tested compounds, 9, 10 and 14 showed the best binding energies with M pro which were higher than that of the internal co-crystalized ligand (Table 2) . It worth to mention that every one of these three compounds attains a disaccharide glycone, which suggests the importance of the sugar moiety in the binding of these compounds. The proposed binding mode of all the 3 compounds was found to be very similar. Interactions with the other two targets were much weaker with random binding poses in the grid box which suggest that the compounds do not bind well with these targets.The three compounds with the best docking energies were further investigated and simulated by molecular dynamics with the four SARS-CoV-2 potential protein targets (13 protein-ligand complexes, 150 ns each). The RMSDs of all ligands and proteins' alpha carbons were analyzed after fitting the alpha carbons to those of the minimized structures ( Figure 6 ).Based on the performed molecular dynamics simulations in case of the nsp 16/10 protein, compound 9 showed high stability during simulation, similar to the co-crystallized ligand, SAM, as a control, while the other compounds were relatively less stable compared to both the control and compound 9. For example, compound 11 is found to leave the active site of nsp16/10 after 130 ns of MD run as seen from the RMSD plot in Figure 6 . For RBD-S-protein, compound 11 was relatively more stable during simulation, compared to the other two compounds. In the whole set of simulations of M pro protein, compound 14 was stable during the whole length of 150 ns simulation, while compound 11 exhibited stability only at 90 ns. Finally, for ACE2-PD, all the three compounds didn't show that much stability in the active site during the production run.For the detailed analysis of interactions between studied compounds and proteins binding energies were calculated using MM-PBSA method (Table 3) . Last 5 ns trajectory of each simulation was used for calculations. Comparative analysis showed that in case of the nsp 16/10 protein, all three studied compounds have better binding energy scores than control compound, SAM (-53 kJ/mol), with compound 14 Table 2 . Docking results of the 14 flavonoids with the 4 main targets of SARS-CoV-2.M pro (6LU7) NSP16/10 (6W4H) ACE2-PD (6VW1) RBD-S-protein (6M0J) having lowest binding energy (-110 kJ/mol) and highest affinity. Compound 9 showed highest affinity to 6LU7 and 6M0J proteins, with following binding energies of À85 and À 82 kJ/mol, respectively. For 6LU7 protein, compound 14 demonstrated highest binding energy (-115 kJ/mol). Detailed information on interaction types between studied compounds and proteins, and corresponding values are presented in Table 3 . Figure 3 . Docking of 9 (pink) takes place in the same groove that is taken by SAM (blue) in the active site of nsp16, compounds 11 and 14 binded at the same pocket. The nsp16/nsp10 complex in exposed where nsp16 is shown as green surface and nsp10 is shown as yellow cartoon. 3.5. Adme properties, toxicity profiles and target prediction ADME properties of the investigated compounds were studied to predict the potential route of administration, check if these compounds would be absorbed orally and predict if they would cause any side effects via passing the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). All the investigated compound except compound 3 are not predicted to pass the BBB which suggest less adverse effects. Non-glycosidic compounds (1-8) are orally available while glycosides (9-14) are not absorbed orally which might suggest either preparation of prodrugs or changing the route of administration (Supplementary material Table S1 ). In addition, all compounds are found to obey Lipinski's rule of five except compounds 9, 10 and 14 which attain a disaccharide moiety. Toxicity profiles are also predicted through pkCSM Server (Supplementary material Table S2 ). None of the investigated compounds is predicted to cause skin sensitization or hepatotoxicity. Only compounds 11 and 12 are expected to cause AMES toxicity (test for mutagenic activity) which reflects potential carcinogenicity. Other predicted toxicity tests are shown in Table S2 (Supplementary material).We also ran a target prediction of top ranked compounds (9,11 and 14), clearly shown in Tables S3-S5 (Supplementary material). Compounds 9 and 14 are predicted to inhibit TNFa which might suggest a role in cancer and/or rheumatoid arthritis. None of the tested compounds is predicted to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 targets which is expected since target prediction is based on similarity search (as these targets are newly discovered with no reported inhibitors, so target prediction similarity search will not be able to find such targets). Furthermore, all the three compounds were predicted to interact with Adenosine A1 receptor which is interesting as all of them shares a similar scaffold.A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified from respiratory illness patients in December 2019 and has recently developed into a serious hazard to the world public health. However, no approved vaccines have been found to efficiently stop the virulent spread of the virus. Given the urgency of the current epidemic situation, it would be highly effective to find bioactive compounds from natural sources and make serious trials and investigations to incorporate them in future plans against COVID. In this study, ten compounds were dereplicated by LC-HR-ESI-MS coupled metabolic profiling of O. menthiifolium, ranged between phenolic acids, iridoids and flavonoidal glycosides. Flavonoidal glycosides were chosen along with other flavonoids previously isolated from the same plant and docked against the four main targets involved in SARS-CoV-2. Our results showed that, among all flavonoids tested, apigenin-7-O-rutinoside, prunin and acaciin attained the highest binding affinities towards the nsp16/10 complex. The stability of the docked complexes was further investigated by MD simulations which highlighted Apigenin-7-O-rutinoside to attain the lowest RMSD fluctuation which suggest the high stability of the ligand-protein complex. Acaciin also showed low RMSD fluctuation that took place after 60 ns of the production run. The MM/PBSA binding energy calculations demonstrated the strong binding of acaciin which showed double the binding energy of the co-crystalized ligand SAM. We also were interested to investigate the drug likeness of the tested compounds as well as their ADMET properties since they could be a potential medication against SARS-CoV-2 (see Supporting Information). This study opens the door for further investigations of these compounds or structurally similar analogues for their use as anti-SARS-CoV-2 medications. Table 3 .

Measuring the magnitude of stigma and understanding its relevance to HCWs' direct involvement in COVID-19 care pathways and other associated factors may help the concerned authorities address this issue more effectively. Such research may also provide preliminary evidence to design targeted public health education interventions. In this context, this study explores COVID-19-related stigma and its associated factors among Egyptian physicians.A cross-sectional study using an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire was conducted from 7 to 21 June 2020. Physicians working in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited using convenience sampling. A sample size of 455 physicians was calculated at a 99% confidence level and an alpha error of 5%, based on the assumption that 22% of physicians would report COVID-19 related stigma, a proportion similar to what HCWs had previously reported during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic [22] . Another 10% (n = 45) was added in case of non-response or missing data; the target sample was 500 physicians. Physicians working outside Egypt were excluded from the study. Participants were recruited until the sample size was achieved. There were no other exclusion criteria.The online questionnaire was developed using Microsoft forms through the secure platform of the Faculty of Medicine and an official e-mail address that is password-protected and available only to the research team. The link to the questionnaire was distributed through various social networks and emails. Participants were encouraged to share the form with workmates. No incentives were provided for participation. By clicking the link, an introductory page displayed the study rationale, its aims, noting participation was voluntary, ensuring strict anonymity and confidentiality of responses, and showed the informed consent statement. After providing consent, the participant was directed to complete the three sections of the questionnaire (see S1 Questionnaire): Section 1. Personal and occupational data: age, gender, marital status, residence, qualification, specialty, workplace, provision of direct care to COVID-19 patients, and COVID-19 infection status. Section 2. Perceived COVID-19-related stigmatization: Literature search revealed no specific tools or scales to measure COVID-19-related stigma. We widened the search scope to include any tool for measuring stigma in a similar epidemic caused by a respiratory virus. The only available tool was that developed by Verma et al. [17] , who adapted the HIV Berger scale [23] to measure stigma among HCWs during the 2004 SARS epidemic in Singapore. Verma et al. stigma scale consisted of 17 items that were categorized into four subscales: personalized stigma; disclosure concerns; negative self-image; and concern with public attitudes. The fourpoint Likert scale responses were: ""strongly disagree"", ""disagree"", ""agree"", and ""strongly agree"", scoring 1 to 4, respectively. The total or overall COVID-19-related stigma score was calculated as the sum of the scores of its 17 items, ranging from 17 to 68, with a higher score indicating a higher level of stigma. The 17 items of the stigma scale used in the current study that were adapted from Verma et al. had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.906, suggesting high internal consistency. The four subscales were calculated as the sum of their individual constituting items, noting that individual items can be assigned to more than one subscale (see S1 Questionnaire). The subscale items were: personalized stigma (11 items), disclosure concerns (4 items), negative self-image (3 items), and concern with public attitude about HCWs (10 items) (see S1 Questionnaire). Section 3. This section included questions about:a. facilitators to health-related stigma: role of the media in addressing COVID-19 public stigma against HCWs, and receiving psychological support/counselling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic;b. stigma experiences by physicians, including:Self-stigma. feeling guilty of exposing HCWs' family to infection with COVID-19. Anticipated stigma. needing to hide HCWs' positive COVID-19 result. Associative stigma. staying away from the family till the crisis subsides if the HCW is in regular contact with COVID-9 patients.Experienced discrimination. who were the people most stigmatizing HCWs and attitude towards refusal of burial of dead COVID-19 HCW cases, as such incident occurred in Egypt. c) physicians' major concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic and what measures they thought may help them most to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.Face and content validity of the questionnaire were assessed by three experts in occupational medicine, psychiatry and public health. The questionnaire was administered in English, as physicians in Egypt study Medicine in English and are familiar with the language. A pilot study was performed on 10 physicians to assess the clarity and appropriateness of the questions and answer categories, and the feasibility of the study. Feedback from the pilot study was followed by minor rephrasing modifications of the questionnaire items. The first modification was performed to one item of the stigma scale changing the word ""touching me"" into ""getting close to me"". The other adjustment was in the wording of the question about experienced discrimination. The 10 questionnaires from the pilot study were not included in data analysis.The Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University Research Ethics Committee approved the study (FMASU R 22 / 2020). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.Using IBM SPSS 25.0, descriptive statistics including mean and standard deviation (SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR) were performed to describe continuous data, while frequencies and proportions were calculated to describe categorical variables. Bivariate analysis was done using chi-squared test, independent samples t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and linear regression to identify the factors associated with participants' direct involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients, as well as participants' overall COVID-19-related stigma scores. As individual items may fall under more than one subscale, the total stigma score is not a simple summation of the four subscale scores. To enable direct comparison of the four subscales, percentiles and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated: participants' scores for each subscale were divided by the total possible score for the corresponding subscale [24] . Using the calculated percentiles, the overall stigma scores were categorized into three categories: 0-33% = no or mild stigma, >33% and < 66% = moderate stigma, and �66% = severe stigma. This approach was suggested by Charles et al., given the lack of universal cut-off points for stigma scores [25] . Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with the following outcomes (expressed as continuous scale variables): overall COVID-19-related stigma score, and scores of the: personalized stigma subscale, disclosure concern subscale, negative self-image subscale, and concern with public attitudes about HCWs subscale. The independent variables that showed statistically significant associations with each of these outcomes in the bivariate linear regression analysis were introduced into the multivariable model using the enter method. These included age; gender (male, female); marital status (unmarried, married), qualification (MBBCH, Diploma, Master, Doctorate), residence (Cairo, other governorate), specialty (Internal Medicine, Surgery, other), workplace (quarantine hospital, fever hospital, public hospital, primary healthcare center, university hospital, private hospital/clinic, other), direct involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients (no, yes), current work in a COVID-19 affected healthcare facility (no, yes), having a positive test result (no, yes) if the participant has done a test to check whether they got infected. A p-value of � 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The mean age of the 509 participants was 41.5±10.2, ranging from 24 to 70. Most participants were females (n = 353, 69.4%), married (n = 978, 74.3%), had a post-graduate degree (n = 443, 87%), and lived in Cairo (n = 420, 82.5%). More than half of the participants specialized in Internal Medicine (n = 261, 51.3%) and almost a half of the participants worked in a university hospital (n = 242, 47.5%), while less than 1 in 20 of the sample worked in a quarantine hospital for COVID-19 patients (n = 19, 3.7%) or a fever hospital (n = 2, 0.4%) Table 1 .Two-fifths of the participants reported they currently worked at a COVID-19 affected healthcare facility during the period of survey administration (n = 219, 43.0%), less than a quarter of whom were involved in triage for COVID-19 case detection (n = 49, 22.9%). Only a quarter of the participants had done tests to check whether they got infected (n = 128, 25.1%); 19 (14.8%) of those indicated they had a positive test result Table 2 .Approximately a quarter of the sample reported they were directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients (n = 138, 27.1%) Table 2. In the bivariate analysis, participants who were directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients were significantly more likely to report being younger, male, unmarried, and specialized in Internal Medicine, working in a quarantine, fever, public hospital, or a COVID-19 affected healthcare facility, and had performed a COVID-19 test-than those who were not directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients Tables 1 and 2.The mean scores of participants' overall COVID-19-related stigma scores and the four subscales scores are shown in Table 3 . The mean overall COVID-19-related stigma score was 40.6 ±8.0. The mean scores for the subscales were: personalized stigma 26.0±5.7, disclosure concerns 9.3±2.2, negative self-image 6.9±1.6, and concern with public attitude 24.4±4.9 Table 3 . The score percentiles indicated that the participants perceived higher stigma related to the concern with public attitudes about HCWs subscale (61.0, 95% CI: 60.0, 62.2) and comparatively lower stigma related to the negative self-image subscale (57.5, 95% CI: 56.3, 58.7). Approximately one third of the participants reported a severe level of COVID-19-related stigma (n = 159, 31.2%), 327 (64.2%) reported a moderate level of stigma, and 23 (4.5%) reported no or a mild level of stigma. This pattern was also true for the subscales.In the bivariate analysis, direct involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients was significantly associated with a higher proportion of severe stigma level [54 (39.1%) versus 105 (28.3%), p = 0.050] and participants' higher scores for the negative self-image subscale Table 3 . Most participants thought they should stay away from their families until COVID-19 subsides if they were in regular contact with COVID-19 patients ""associative stigma"" (n = 463, 91.0%) and felt guilty they might expose their families to infection ""self-stigma"" (n = 462, 90.8%). A quarter of the sample reported their neighbours were the people most stigmatizing them (n = 129, 25.3%), and almost a half of the participants were most stigmatized by others (not co-workers/ family/ friends/ neighbours/ household members) ""experienced discrimination"" (n = 251, 49.3%). However, less than a fifth of the participants thought they should hide a positive test result in case they had one ""anticipated stigma"" (n = 88, 17.3%) Table 4 .Most of the participants thought that media increased COVID-19 public stigma against HCWs (n = 329, 64.6%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the most common concern reported by the participants was their health (n = 434, 85.3%) and the most helpful measure they suggested was orientation of the public through mass media (n = 195, 38.3%) Table 4 .Participants directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients were significantly more likely to recommend provision of protective equipment as the most helpful measure during the COVID-19 pandemic than those who were not directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients Table 4 .In the multivariable regression models, participants' overall COVID-19-related stigma score was negatively associated with higher qualification (β = -0.19, 95% CI: 2.32, -0.64, p = 0.001), and positively associated with working in an quarantine hospital (β = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01, 7.14, p = 0.050). For the four subscales, all were also negatively associated with higher qualification. In addition, negative self-image was negatively associated with increasing age and positively associated with working in a fever hospital. Concern with public attitudes was negatively associated with increasing age and positively associated with working in an quarantine hospital Table 5 .This study is one of the first attempts to explore COVID-19-related stigma among HCWs using a stigma-specific tool and to assess its associated factors. In this sample of Egyptian physicians, our preliminary findings suggest that most participants experienced some level of COVID-19-related stigmatization. Lower qualification, younger age, and working in an quarantine or fever hospital were the factors independently associated with COVID-19-related stigma in the multivariable analyses.Disease-related stigmatization was previously reported for the Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome [23] , the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [26] , and SARS [17, 27] . Similarly, the current COVID-19 pandemic may have led to stigmatizing experiences and practices, such as social exclusion, discrimination, self-blaming and shame [28] . In this exploratory study, approximately one third of the participants reported a severe level of COVID-19-related stigma. During previous respiratory disease epidemics, such as the 2004 SARS epidemic, 22% of the studied HCWs reported stigma and rejection in their neighbourhood [22] . A similar proportion of participants in this study (25.3%) experienced discrimination from their neighbours.In the current study, direct involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients was significantly associated with participants' higher scores for the negative self-image subscale and a higher proportion of severe level of stigma in the bivariate analysis. Similarly, a previous study found an association between higher stigma scores, particularly scores related to the concern with public attitudes subscale, and general practitioners' involvement in treating SARS [17] . However, direct involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with COVID-19-related stigma in the multivariable regression analyses, suggesting that stigma was universally experienced in this sample of Egyptian physicians, regardless of whether the nature of their work at the workplace required direct involvement in COVID-19 care pathways. Participants' total COVID-19-related stigma score, concern with public attitudes and negative self-image subscale scores were positively associated with working in quarantine and fever hospitals. Working in these healthcare facilities, regardless of HCWs' direct involvement in the COVID-19 care pathway, seems to have introduced the COVID-19-related stigma 'marking' to these HCWs. A recent review of psychological consequences related to COVID-19 in healthcare workers and quarantined people revealed that stigma was reported as well as several emotional disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and frustration [29] . According to the calculated percentiles of COVID-19-related stigma subscales, participants reported relatively higher stigma related to the concern with public attitudes subscale and comparatively lower stigma related to the negative self-image subscale; both subscales were inversely associated with increasing age. These findings are consistent with previous literature from the SARS epidemic in Singapore, where younger age was found to be significantly associated with higher stigma subscales [17] . Also, participants' total COVID-19-related stigma score and all subscale scores were inversely associated with higher qualification. This might be explained by the lack of experience of those physicians, which highlights the importance of psychological support and training especially to junior staff.Because of the ambiguity around COVID-19 and its evolving nature several false beliefs and myths might arise in the community [2] and be propagated by the media, especially with the 'infodemic' associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [10] . Approximately two-thirds of participants thought that media had a negative role in increasing COVID-19 public stigma in agreement with other reports [30] . Participants in this study perceived higher stigma related to the concern with public attitudes subscale and suggested that public orientation about the role of HCWs during the epidemic would be a helpful measure that needs to be addressed through mass media.COVID-19-related stigmatization was addressed in press in many countries, such as Egypt [21] , India [31], Malawi [32] , and Mexico [33] . It was also tackled in scientific journals in the form of letters to the Editor [34]. However, COVID-19-specific stigma research is lacking despite that stigma may influence health outcomes not only on the individual level, but also on the population-level, by affecting, worsening or interfering with social relationships, stress, psychological and behavioral responses [35] . Unfortunately, stigma experiences like discrimination may last for a long time, even after the epidemic subsides [36] . A review of infectious diseases stated that HCWs felt greater stigmatization than the general population and experienced more avoidance behaviors from the community [29] . Most participants in this study reported other stigma experiences as well, such as self-stigma as they felt guilty exposing their families to infection with COVID-19 and associative stigma as participants thought they should stay away from their family till the crisis subsides, if they were in regular contact with COVID-9 patients.Only 14.7% of all participants in this study received psychological support or counselling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. This proportion seems insufficient considering that most participants reported some form of COVID-19-related stigmatization. Assessing people's knowledge about the disease to help identify stigmatization, collaboration with community organizations to address stigma, and raising community awareness and skills-building training to fight stigma are among the practical strategies to diminish disease-related stigma during an epidemic [37] . Psychiatrists from 13 countries recommended developing multi-component, multi-level, long-term, and broad interventions that address COVID-19-related stigma, its drivers and facilitators using the 'Health stigma and discrimination framework' [8, 10] . However, more systematic research is required for a deeper understanding of the underlying complexities concerning COVID-19-related stigma among HCWs. COVID-19 stigma-focused interventions targeting HCWs need development and incorporation into the existing system, specifically psychological and public support for younger HCWs and those with lower qualifications.This study is one of the first endeavours to measure COVID-19-related stigma among HCWs. It included a considerable number of physicians, who worked in different healthcare facilities in Egypt and were directly and indirectly involved in the COVID-19 care pathway. It also examined various aspects of COVID-19-related stigma. This exploratory study highlights the need for specific research and targeted interventions particularly addressing COVID-19-related stigmatization among HCWs.However, findings of this exploratory study are preliminary and should be further investigated in-depth with more robust study designs, sampling methods, and validated COVID-19-specific tools. Some limitations may prevent the generalizability of these results. First, due to the lack of a specific tool to measure COVID-19-related stigma, we had to use a scale designed to measure other health-related stigma. Verma et al. adapted a stigma scale, which was originally developed to measure HIV-related stigma [23] , to measure post-SARS stigmatization among HCWs [17] . Although SARS and COVID-19 are different in their indices and clinical profiles, they are both respiratory infectious diseases that have caused epidemics. Further studies should be carried out to validate a specific scale for COVID-19-related stigma among HCWs. Second, the scarcity of studies on stigmatization against HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic did not allow comparison of the findings of this study with the extent, level, and factors associated with stigma among HCWs in other settings. Third, self-selection bias may have been introduced due to the convenience nature of the sampling technique used in this study, where stigmatized physicians were more likely to choose participating in this study. Fourth, the cross-sectional study design disallows drawing causal inferences between COVID-19-related stigma and its associated factors. Future studies are required to address these limitations to advance understanding and cover the existing gaps in knowledge on COVID-19-related stigma among HCWs.Findings suggest that a considerable proportion of Egyptian healthcare providers in this study experienced COVID-19-related stigmatization, mainly from their neighbours and others they interacted with in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may explain why participants' COVID-19-related stigmatization was particularly higher for concerns with public attitudes about HCWs. COVID-19-related stigmatization was universally experienced in this sample of Egyptian physicians, regardless of whether the nature of their work at the workplace required direct involvement in COVID-19 care pathways. Thus, public health education and raising community and media awareness about the importance of public support for HCWs are necessary to alleviate their perceived stigma. The overall COVID-19-related stigma score and its subscale scores were inversely associated with higher participants' qualification, highlighting the need for providing targeted psychological support for the younger and inexperienced physicians.

For these systems, where it is never very easy to anticipate the evolution of the environment, the forms ofCrisis management logistics are getting more and more attention, especially the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For these systems, where it is never very easy to anticipate the evolution of the environment, the forms of changes undergone are varied and rapid. Logistician's decision-making concerns actions that take place in an everhectic environment. In addition, responding to an emergency call, by definition, they have no way of predicting what will happen. A Crisis Management Supply Chain CMSC can fall victim to delivery delays, poor consumption estimates, loss of cargo, spontaneous spikes in consumption, and many other unpredictable events at any time. All of these unforeseen events are likely to lead to stock-outs at any point in the supply chain, which can have dramatic consequences that can lead to human loss. These extreme situations are not acceptable, this justifies the need to create a tool that would simulate real and/or probable logistical situations, the objective being to observe the behavior of the different areas in place and identify the best strategies to adopt according to crisis situations.An increasing number of articles have been published on the subject of disaster management. Most of the current work on crisis management supply chains agrees that future research should focus on methods for improving inventory management, designing distribution systems, cooperation, coordination and performance measurement. Indeed, an increasingly obvious observation is the fact that the crisis management supply chain is not just a dyadic relationship or even a set of relationships limited to one or two ranks. A crisis management supply chain is often a network of geographically distributed entities that is larger and therefore more complex to manage.In the first section of our paper, we present a state of the art and the context of our research, emphasizing the characteristics of advanced distributed logistics. The second section presents our issue and a focus on the resolution methodology to be adopted in the form of an alliance of multiagent systems and the foundations of optimization, within the framework of artificial intelligence. In the third section, we study the contribution of multiagent systems in the design and implementation of logistics systems. We then propose a multi-agent organization dedicated to modeling and optimizing a CMSC by detailing our architecture and the behaviors of the different agents. The fifth section is devoted to the solutions proposed to optimize the flows of the crisis management supply chain. Finally, we detail the applications of the system adopted to demonstrate the validity of the solutions proposed.The word ""logistics"" appeared in France in the 18th century with the appearance of problems of military support, hence the definition of military origin: ""Logistics consists in bringing what is necessary, where it is necessary and when it must [5] [13] . In the industrial environment, ""global logistics"" is the set of activities internal or external to the company that bring added value to products and services to customers. There are several types of logistics: supply logistics; production logistics; distribution logistics; military logistics and retro-logistics.The concept of Supply Chain SC has brought a certain unity to the field of logistics. The supply chain is defined as ""The sequence of stages of production and distribution of a product from suppliers to suppliers of producers, to customers of its customers"" (Supply Chain Council). For Rota-Franz et al., doing Supply Chain Management SCM consists of integrating all internal and external means to meet customer demand [13] . The aim is to optimize all logistical processes simultaneously, rather than sequentially. The main objective of SCM is to improve industrial competitiveness by minimizing costs [11] , ensuring the level of service required by the client and effectively allocating activities on the actors of production, distribution, transport and information; ensuring that actors do not develop antagonistic local behaviors that affect overall performance.For any type of supply chain, decision-making is divided into three levels:  Strategic: also called Strategic Management or Strategic Planning, groups together all strategic decisions for long-term [9] [10].  Tactical: is concerned with medium-term decisions which will have to be executed to deploy the strategy decided by the company.  Operational: The operational level, or Operational Planning according, decisions have a more limited scope in space and time.The SCM generally seeks to improve productivity. To achieve this goal, we often use many performance indicators. These indicators can be customer satisfaction, compliance with delivery times, chain flexibility, information sharing, risk management, improved traceability, etc. [4] [6][9] [10] Three main supply chain performance indicators are widely used, each corresponding to a type of flow: ""cooperation"" indicators with regard to the performance of the information flow, ""costs"" for the financial flow and ""delivery times"" for the physical flow. The first step in performance monitoring is therefore to ""measure performance"". Then, it is necessary to take reengineering decisions and act on the system and the model through decision variables in order to tend towards the set objectives. The implementation of a high-performance system therefore reflects a need for control of the supply chain and improvement of performance.The vision of logistics decision making has changed radically from the conventional centralized perspective to a distributed perspective. This change of perspective is based on new needs in terms of flexibility and responsiveness. Thus, these new systems propose to give an answer to problems such as: distributivity, reconfigurability, interoperability, reusability, etc [2] . Managing a SC made up of several entities is a function that makes it possible to exploit the resources that are available in this supply chain. The information system makes it possible to store, adapt and make available the data on which decision-making centers are based. The role of the information system is to provide each decision center with the information necessary and sufficient for adequate decision-making. We have the conventional centralized systems and the intelligent distributed systems. Several motivations are offered for decentralizing management, such as [8] feasibility; robustness and flexibility; reconfigurability.We quickly present three main areas of research in terms of methodologies and techniques used in the service of supply chain management, namely modeling, optimization and decision support. 1) Modeling : There are different models of supply chains. The choice of model depends directly on the type of problem and structure that we want to study [8] [12] .2) Optimization : The optimal quality of service in logistics implies a satisfaction of the users of the proposed system by the integration of the functionalities necessary for the good management of the logistics chain. Optimization was introduced in order to improve the services provided regardless of the area to which they apply. An optimization problem concerns the execution of specific methods in search of an optimum [1] . The latter can be a value that maximizes or minimizes a function f, called the objective function or the cost function; it is also called optimization criteria [13] .3) Decision support : The purpose of decision support techniques is to model the preferences of an expert as faithfully as possible. This modeling will then make it possible to design and build suitable tools capable of assisting or replacing a decision maker on complex problems. Decision support formalizes the expertise obtained after an interview with the decision-maker and the interactions between the decision-maker and his environment. Since we are mainly interested in the expertise of decision-makers in the field of logistics, the model used must be flexible and sufficiently developed to allow the representation of the different decision-making behaviors most commonly encountered in supply chain management crisis management CMSC [2] .Agent-oriented methodologies are concerned with the problems of designing multi-agent systems relating to: the identification of agents, the specification of reasoning skills, the organization of the multi-agent system and the representation of interactions between agents. Their objectives are to guide the designer in the analysis and design phases of multi-agent systems.The research proposal that we are making consists more precisely of a set of tools and approaches allowing the optimization of flows in a CMSC. We opted for a modeling of the CMSC based on communicating agents [1] [3] [10] . In this model, the agents who represent the various actors in the logistics chain, are in direct contact with what is happening in the field, they pump information continuously from the field layer and compare the real situation to the reference logistics situation (Fig. 1) .We can consider a multiagent system as being a homogeneous or heterogeneous set of agents located in the same environment and which interact. These agents communicate and collaborate to achieve individual or collective goals, or to solve problems that exceed each individual's abilities or knowledge [9] . One of the most important characteristics of an MAS is interaction. It is defined as being a dynamic relationship established between several agents due to their combined and reciprocal actions. Interaction can take many forms: cooperation, coordination, negotiation, collaboration, etc [1] [9] [13] . Authors propose the modeling given in Fig. 2 in order to schematize all the possible interactions between the agents. . This emergence can be explained by the ability of MAS to model increasingly complex systems. Among the first applications developed using communicating agents, there is an application for air traffic control [14] . In this application, MAS cooperation strategies have been used to resolve conflicts between the plans of a group of agents. Each agent, representing an aircraft, seeks to build a flight plan which must guarantee a safe distance from each other agent. In the event that the agents are in conflict, they must choose between the agent best able to draw up a new flight plan without creating new conflict situations. This choice is based on the amount of information available to each agent and the number of constraints. Indeed, it is up to the most knowledgeable officer to carry out the new flight plan that resolves the conflict and to the least constrained officer to execute it.In 1996, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in collaboration with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) began a research effort of approximately $ 80 million called the Advanced Logistics Project: Advanced Logistics Projetc (ALP), aimed at developing the next generation of logistics systems [5] [13] . This project is mainly based on the following strategies: Gathering; Supporting; Decomposing; Acting; Delegating; Assessing and Reporting.The designers use a dynamic workflow engine to build the models, interconnect the representations of the cognitive components and accomplish the tasks. We have opted for an alliance of MAS and optimization in a specific architecture, which we detail in the following sections.In this section, we study the contribution of multi-agent systems in the design and implementation of logistics systems. We then propose a multi-agent organization dedicated to the modeling and optimization of a crisis management supply chain by detailing the architecture of our system and the behaviors of the various agents [3] [4] [7] .With the essential aim of countering the problems of exponential complexity, we propose to set up a resolution system which is based on the decomposition of the global process into a set of less complex tasks executing in parallel. The multiagent concept is favorable to the implementation of a dynamic distributed architecture. Thus, in order to establish an efficient and efficient optimized treatment in terms of complexity, we propose to set up a multiagent system. This system, called OBCA (Optimization Based on Communicating Agents), is equipped with a multitude of functionalities involved in the process of optimizing the functioning of the logistics chain and the response to the crisis.The proposed MAO (Multi-Agent Organization) is dynamic; it considers each actor of the CMSC as an autonomous agent, capable of exchanging information with the other actors. In our SCM, the actors are many and varied. Multiple models are possible. We propose a dynamic and open system, based on the interaction of several types of software agents which will help the smooth running of exchanges of physical and information flows: Zone Agents, Transport agent, the Integrator/Evaluator Agent, the Weather Agent, the GUI Interfaces Agents and the Watch agent. The Interfaces Agents play the role of interface between the users and the system, the Zone Agents are responsible for the logistic zones and take care of the scheduling of the local delivery tasks, the Transport Agent manages all the transport vectors of the supply chain, the Integrator/Evaluator Agent are responsible for the evaluation and composition of the final delivery plans and the Weather Agent provides information on weather conditions. Another type of agent is involved in the operation of the CMSC: the NEA (Need Estimating Agent), which has the role of estimating consumption at the level of disaster areas.The organization of our system is illustrated in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 4 , data flows are exchanged between the various agents helping the system to run smoothly in a context of obvious synchronization. The Zone Agents are of 4 types of a population of Zone Agents: -Metropole Agent MA : this is a fixed agent who manages all the resources in the Metropolitan area. It has a very large starting stock and plays the role of supplier for the entire CMSC; -Resource Zone Agent RZ: It is a dynamic agent that is created only in the event of a crisis. At the level of this agent, resources will be pooled to be allocated to the various possible means of transport. It is the second link in the CMSC. The operation of bringing metropolitan resources to the RZ Agent is called pre-routing. These are generally areas for grouping goods awaiting expatriation outside country borders; -Intermediate Zone Agent IZ:. When the distance between the resource regrouping zone RZ and the disaster zone is significant, an intermediate logistics zone is placed and an Intermediate Zone Agent IZ is created to manage this zone.-Terminal area Agent TZ: It represents the disaster area and the consumption of resources is the most random.The Metropole Agent activity diagram is shown in Fig. 5 . Integrator/Evaluator Agent IEA: This agent's role is to compose a global planning for the routing of resources throughout the CMSC, from local planning received from the zone agents (Fig. 6) .Need Estimating Agents (NEA): The Need Estimating Agent (NEA) is a holonic agent or a multi-agent subsystem whose role is to provide an estimate of consumption coming from a logistics site.It is important to keep your stocks above a certain critical level. It is possible to have an idea of this consumption, but in the event of modifications of certain parameters, a consumption peak for example in the case which concerns us, this consumption can vary enormously. The mission of NEA is to combine the expertise of people used to determining these consumptions, with corrections according to certain environmental parameters that we obtain from a database retracing the old CMSCs and their conditions. The NEA agent therefore examines, from the field layer, information on the climate and the number of people and uses the estimation models developed in the mathematical layer to simulate and anticipate the variation in the consumption phenomenon at the level of logistics areas.Weather Agent WA: The Weather Agent is directly linked to the estimating agents; it gives the NEA all the information relating to the environment of their area. Three types of data were selected: the room temperature; the humidity level of the area and the number of persons to be supplied, near the area. The Weather Agent provides an estimate of this data for the same day, as well as the next 6 days, which allows the estimators to be able to make precise estimates on the needs of an area (Fig. 7) . GUI Agent: The GUI (Graphic User Interface) Agent is an agent directly attached to the control window. He will therefore dialogue with all the agents to give them the desired orders by the user. It is also responsible for retrieving information allowing to have a global vision of the chain on the screen, and finally carrying out a risk study [3] [7][8] [10] . As soon as it is created, the GUI Agent goes to sleep waiting for any event likely to reactivate it and trigger its own process (Fig. 8) .The interaction between a company of agents, composed of zone agents, NEA agent and the Weather Agent is illustrated by the three-partition activity diagram in Fig. 9 .All of the agents in our crisis management supply chain, because of their different properties (autonomy, communication, cooperation, etc.) can have different modes of activity. Indeed, at a given time t, some agents negotiate among themselves, others transmit orders while others schedule delivery tasks. We have identified four modes of activity : parallel activity, staggered activity, interruption and different duration activity.Each day, four main steps are used to summarize the operations that can be carried out : i) Receipt of packages; ii) Consumption of goods; iii) Transmission of requests and needs to the superior; and iv) Sending packages to a subordinate area.We have therefore adapted and developed an algorithm for positioning logistics zones, which will allow us to optimize the structure of our CMSC. In the same way, a distributed scheduling process, and therefore a new scheduling behavior integrated into the core of each zone agent, was developed and implemented.Several constraints are involved in decision-making relating to the geographic location of the CMSC. In fact, to ensure effective logistical coordination, different points must be taken into account: -The extent of the damage in the country affected by the disaster. As part of our research, we are proposing to offer the logistician decision-maker a tool that guides him in his decision-making when configuring the CMSC, to choose the geographic location of intermediate logistics bases (Hubs). The goal here is to suggest to the designer the optimal geographic areas that guarantee a rapid and efficient response and response to the crisis. To solve this problem, we offer a decision support module within our OBCA demonstrator which offers the logistician two modes of operation : automatic mode and manual mode.We propose to introduce optimization agents and scheduling techniques into Zone Agents in order to allow them to facilitate the circulation of CMSC flows and determine a better scheduling solution satisfying a certain number of criteria. Conventional centralized approaches propose to concentrate the resolution of the optimization problem within a single agent who plays the role of mediator. However, this centralization of resolution has problems in terms of fault tolerance and adaptability. In our context, we propose a distributed and cooperative resolution approach that makes all the entities making up our system interact. The scheduling problem under consideration will make it possible to establish resource routing plans along the CMSC. Our scheduling problem is composed, in its most complete representation, of several entities, as illustrated in the Fig. 10 . Fig. 10 . Model of delivery system scheduling Fig. 11 . Running multiple JADE platformsWe chose the JADE platform (Java Agent Development framework) for the development of our system and the simulation of the results of our distributed optimization approaches. JADE is a 4 middleware software-mediator which allows flexible implementation of multi-agent systems communicating through efficient transfer of ACL (Agent Communication Language) messages, in accordance with FIPA specifications. JADE is written in Java, supports mobility, evolves rapidly and is today one of the rare multi-agent platforms that offer the possibility of integrating Web services to optimize the performance of a distributed agent system (Fig. 11) .We simulated the operation of the optimization approaches adopted in our OBCA demonstrator. We had done several simulations to evaluate the performance of our system for crisis management. The simulation results and scenarios show the flexibility and adaptability of the system in the face of the vagaries of the crisis. The OBCA certainly helps logistic decision-makers.In this paper, we are interested in decision support solutions to facilitate the work of logistics decision-makers in the event of a crisis as we saw during the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have brought solutions based on a modeling, optimization and simulation approach geared towards logistics flow agents, in a context with strong disruptions, more precisely, in the case of a crisis management supply chain. .Our contribution covered three areas of investigation: a module to help with the positioning of logistics zones which makes it possible to minimize the distances between zones and to optimize their numbers and this for better circulation of flows, a multiagent oriented approach for the distribution of delivery tasks which provides a solution to a highly distributed flow management problem, and finally a holonic agent whose role is to provide an estimate of the future consumption of a logistics site by combining human expertise in mathematical models.","Morocco","first author","2020-12-31",12

In Africa, the total number of cases of COVID-19 was 451,129, while the number of deaths was 10,928. Nigeria had 27,564 cases of COVID-19 with 6280 death and third in Africa at the time of writing this article. 4, 5 The low cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria may be under-reported due to low testing capacity. 5 Currently, Nigeria is experiencing ongoing community transmission of SARS-COV-2 from asymptomatic individuals across the various states. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the number of daily reports of the cases of COVID-19. 5 The direct impacts of COVID-19 in Nigeria include widespread economic and community lockdown. These resulted in increased poverty among the masses. The elites were affected by the restriction on international travel, and some of them depend on medical services overseas. The direct impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers is the risk of exposure to the hazards of COVID-19 infection.SARS-COV-2 is transmission via droplet aerosol, from sneezing, coughing, and talking. Other means of transmission include contaminated surfaces, and person to person contacts. 6, 7 Person to person transmission through the routes mentioned above make it easy for the virus to spread within the community. Factors that are responsible for the spread of the disease are overcrowding, lack of isolation facilities, and environmental contamination. Lack of awareness on the preventive measures against COVID-19 may also contribute to the increase in COVID-19 cases among HCWs. [8] [9] [10] Healthcare workers are at the frontline in the fight against COVID-19. Thus they are at increased risk of SARS-COV-2 infection. 11, 12 In addition to the hospital or nosocomial acquired infection, HCWs may become infected from the community and transmit the disease to vulnerable people under their care. Likewise, HCWs who become infected may be a source of infection to their friends and family members. 13, 14 Because COVID-19 is new, there is a lack of prospective data that will guide the government and stakeholders addressing the need of HCWs to competently and effectively respond to the spread of SARS-COV-2.This study aimed to access the preventive behavior, anxiety, and responses relating to national preparedness and response readiness in respect to the COVID-19 outbreak by Healthcare workers in Nigeria.A cross-sectional study was carried out among healthcare workers in Nigeria, West Africa, in April 2020. The submission of the answered questionnaires was considered as consent to participate in the study. The questionnaire was made available to the participants through social media (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Tweeter). The questionnaire was pre-evaluated for consistency and error. Corrections from the participants were considered and integrated into the final questionnaire while ensuring its consistency with the published literature. The reliability coefficient was calculated using SPSS v. 16 . The value of Cronbach's alpha was found to be 0.7. 15 The data from the pre-evaluation or pilot study was not included in the final analysis. We sent the survey questionnaires to 1200 HCWs via social media. Three hundred and forty-six (346) participants accepted and completed the questionnaires.The research ethics committee of the Borno State Hospital Services, Ministry of Health, Maiduguri, Nigeria, approved our study protocol (HREC/03/2020/00022). A consent note was not required. The submission of the online answer to the questionnaire was considered as consent to take part in the study.Data were collected using an online (Google form) self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of four parts. Below is a brief description of the questionnaire:Part one (1). Demographic characteristics of respondents. Demographic variables included gender, age category, religion, years of experience in healthcare services, the region of residence, and speciality.Part two (2) . National preparedness. This part consisted of eight (8) questions. The questions focused on government policies such as the composition of COVID-19 task force or committee, One health initiative, provision of palliative for the poor and less privileged, adequate provision of medical equipment such as test kits, isolation centers, respirators, and other essential equipment for the Healthcare workers. We employed a Likert scale (Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree) and dichotomous questions (yes or No) to assess the opinions of HCWs on the national preparedness of the Federal government of Nigeria in response to COVID-19 outbreak.Part three (3). Preventive behavior of healthcare workers towards COVID-19. The questions in this part covered the issue of personal behavior concerning the use of protective equipment, and observation of preventive measures by healthcare workers. Two dichotomous questions were used to assess the preventive behavior of HCWs towards COVID-19. Part four (4). This part raised issues of concern about the safety of healthcare workers and their family while on duty and provision of life insurance in case of permanent occupational hazards. The questions in this category include (1) Do you think you are at risk of COVID -19 virus infection? (2) . Do you believe that your family is at risk of COVID-19 because of your profession?Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and later imported into SPSS version.16 for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistical methods were used to summarize data on socio-demographic characteristics, and responses to questions regarding preventive behavior, anxiety, and responses relating to national preparedness and response readiness in respect to the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria by Healthcare workers. Data were summarized as frequencies (n) and percentages (%) for categorical variables. Furthermore, we presented the data in tables and graphs. To find possible determinants of preventive behavior, and anxiety, a binary logistic regression analysis was applied and expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (C⋅I). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant in all tests. Three hundred and forty-six (346) healthcare workers in Nigeria participated in this survey. Table 1 showed the demographic characteristics of the study participants. More than two-thirds of the respondents were male 249 (72.0%), 214 (61.8%)belong to the age group 30-39, those that had worked for 6-10 years in healthcare services were 145 (41.9%), HCWs in the Northeast and North Central Nigeria were 113 (32.7%) and 104 (30.1%) respectively. Veterinary doctors were 120 (34.7%), while Medical doctors represent 67 (19.4%).Majority 140 (40.5%) of the HCWs believe that one health approach is the best approach to contain the spread of COVID-19. Also, 120 (34.7%) of the respondents agreed that the FGN should seek foreign assistance to combat the COVID-19 outbreak while 45 (13.0%) disagreed on the same need. Concerning palliative and emergency response to vulnerable people, majority 104 (30.1%) of the HCWs strongly disagreed, and 105 (30.4%) disagree that the FGN provided one in their community.The majority of the HCWs agreed that there is no provision of insurance in the course of their service while about 22% of the respondents were no sure. More than 92.5% of the HCWs held that veterinary doctors be part of the PTF against the zoonotic COVID-19 in the country. The majority (80.4%) of the HCWs disagree that Nigeria is prepared to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. All the details are presented in Figs. 1 and 2.Out of the many factors line listed to be associated with COVID-19 preventive behaviours among HCWs in Nigeria; age, working experience in the health sector and geographical locations of the HCWs appears to be the only significant (p < 0.05) factor associated with preventive behaviours by HCWs against the disease in Nigeria.The associated factors analysis revealed that those within the age group 20-29 were less likely (OR = 0.02; 95% C⋅I: 0.001-0.635; P = 0.027) to observe protective measures against COVID-19. Those with 0-5 and 6-10 years working experience in health facilities are 105 times and 24 times more likely to observe protective measures against COVID-19, respectively, than those with long years of working experience (reference group, OR = 1). With regards to the geopolitical zones of the HCWs, those from the S.E. region were 35 times more likely to use a face mask (OR 35.0; 95% C⋅I 3.48-370.41; P = 0.0003) than the HCWs from the Southwest (reference epicentre, OR = 1).Healthcare workers who strongly agreed that people should avoid large crowds to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were seven times more likely (OR = 6.939; 95% C⋅I: 2.567-18.759; P < 0.001) to wear a face mask when leaving home than those who strongly disagreed (ref.). Families of HCWs who held that SARS-CoV-2 is not a biological weapon were about ten times more likely (OR = 9.787; 95% C⋅I: 2.379-40.265; P = 0.002) to observe preventive measure against the spread of COVID-19 than those who held that SARS-CoV-2 is a biological weapon. Similarly, those who had confidence that the medical scientist in Nigeria will overcome COVID-19 pandemic were about six times more likely (OR = 5.769; 95% C⋅I: 1.635-20.354; P 0.006) to wear a face mask when leaving home than those who do not have confidence in the medical scientist (Table 2) .On the concern of healthcare workers in this survey, those within the age bracket: 20-29, 30-39 and 40-49 years were more likely to be anxious that they would become infected with of SARS-CoV-2, having Healthcare workers who were neutral about whether Nigeria should seek foreign aids for the COVID-19 outbreak were about 13 times more likely (OR = 12.519; 95% C⋅I: 2.193-71.457; P = 0.004) to be a concern that they will be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, they were about six more (OR = 5.885; 95% C⋅I: 1.634-20.973; p = 0.007) anxious about their families becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as a result of their occupation. HCWs who were not aware that they have life insurance were about six times more likely (OR = 5.370; 95% C⋅I: 1.799-16.636; p = 0.010) to be concerned that they will be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Also, HCWs who were not aware that they have life insurance were more (OR = 7.624; 95% C⋅I: 1.373-42.320; p = 0.020) anxious that their families will become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, HCWs who were aware that they have life insurance were more (OR = 3.757; 95% C⋅I: 1.580-8.931; p = 0.003) concerned that their families were at risk of COVID-19 infection (Table 3) .Ensuring the safety of HCWs is not only essential for the protection and prevention of nosocomial transmission of SARS-COV-2 but prevent community spread of the virus 8 the battle against COVID-19 pandemic require both the effort of HCWs, governments and non-governmental organization and their partners at all levels. On the part of the government, there is a need for the provision of minimum standard infrastructure, provision emergency relief for the vulnerable, policy formulation, and provisions of essential equipment such as diagnostic tools, personal protection equipment (PPE), and environmental protection. 16 Healthcare workers in Nigeria are provided with health insurance as part of terms of employment under the national health insurance scheme (NHIS), which is optional. 17 However, the scheme is not effective in the coverage of many health care issues, emergencies, and even life insurance among healthcare workers is not guaranteed. Moreover, the fact that the Majority of the HCWs agreed that there is no provision of insurance is in line with the existing situation.The reason for the high proportion of respondents who held that Veterinary doctor is part of the presidential task force because of the recent campaigns for One Health Initiative and Global health strategy for the control of emerging diseases by the World Health Organization. [18] [19] [20] Secondly, the result may have been influenced by the high proportion of veterinary healthcare workers' participation in the study. Also, the Federal Government of Nigeria, in collaboration with Nigerian Center for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC), emphasized the need for a multispectral approach and centralized coordination during the response to COVID-19. 5 A significant number of respondents agreed that FGN should seek foreign intervention to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. This response may be related to the socioeconomic factors, fear, and uncertainty of SARS-CoV-2 as a novel virus. The country may require foreign intervention such as training of isolation center staff on IPC and case management to prevent the spread and to manage the confirmed cases of COVID-19 as part of capacity building. Also, procurement of crucial IPC supplies to curtail the chain of transmission, laboratory test kits, and reagents to increase testing capacity and attaining the recommended positivity rate of < 5. 21 In an emergency, provision of relief to the vulnerable is key to ensuring an effective response to an outbreak due to compliance. The provision of reliefs by the government is consistent with the palliative measures adopted by the United States of America and other developed countries of the World. 16 Palliative measures are particularly essential during lockdown where people are not allowed to go out for business and other anthropogenic activities. Moreover, this could lead to a lack of sustainability for livelihood. It is a fact in the Nigerian health care system that those with good working experience are expected to observe rules and regulations regarding disease prevention. However, our findings show that willingness to abide by the protective measures among the HCWs decreases with increasing years of working experience. Therefore, the duration of service could be a risk factor of COVID-19 among HCWs due to inadequate protective behavior among those with long years of experience. Our finding was consistent with the previous report. 22 On the contrary, our finding also revealed that the protective behavior of HCWs towards COVID-19 increases with the increasing age of HCWs in a directly proportional relationship. Those with 20-29 years of age were less likely to use protective measures against COVID-19 than those within the age bracket 50-59 years.Though it appears that HCWs from the southeast region had more likelihood to use protective measures like a face mask, gloves, and other PPE than those from the southwest region, but this is contrasting in the sense that Southwest Nigeria has more literacy than the southeast. Other factors that may be responsible for this disparity be cultural or social beliefs. 23, 24 We found a significant association between the opinion of HCWs to avoid the large crowd and the use of face mask when leaving home in that those with the opinion were more likely to use face mask than those who strongly disagree. The reason for this different opinion among HCWs with regards to the use of face mask and avoidance of large crowd (social distance) could be due to effect rumour, misinformation through social media, myths, and social beliefs. 25 Similarly, families of HCWs who thought that COVID-19 is a biological weapon were less likely to observe preventive measures against COVID-19. All these findings are clear evidence of misconception of COVID-19 among HCWs. The risk assessment of the country was considered high. Moreover, rumours facilitate the spread of infodemic. These, collectively, may have negative impacts on the national response activities. 26 In this study, we found that the majority of the HCWs within the age category of 20-49 years were more concerned about the risk of SARS-COV-2 infection than the elderly age groups (50-59 years). This age group (20-49 years) was expected to have the highest risk of infection due to exposure and activeness compare to the reference group. Though, the age group 30-39 years perceived to have had moderate anxiety compared to the group 40-49 years, the same group may be considered a transition age between youthfulness and adulthood were thought to be at higher risk of infection compared to the other age groups because of the nature of being youthful 13, 27 Healthcare workers are at the frontlines in emergency response activities, likewise in the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the married HCWs are more likely to infect their partners or family members and vice versa than the unmarried. For instance, an HCWs who were infected with SARS-COV-2 serve as sources of infection to their partners and family members. Therefore it is natural that the married HCWs would be more likely to be concerned that they will become infected with SARS-COV-2 than the unmarried.The national preparedness and response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria were inadequate in the initial statge of the pandemic. Majority of the HCWs agreed that palliatives were not distributed to the poor and the less privileged in their communities. The demographic factors of HCWs in this study were associated with preventive behavior against COVID-19. However, the age category 20-26 demonstrated less likelihood of observing preventive measures against the COVID-19. Healthcare workers were worried that they might become infected with SARS-CoV-2. They also expressed fear that their families were at risk of COVID-19 infection.Francis Enenche Ejeh conceived and designed the study.

Mortality: The primary outcome measured in this study was mortality which was defined as the percentage of deaths that occurred during a study period. Virological cure rate: Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved negative PCR. Time to negative PCR: Defined as the number of days until the PCR becames negative. It also included the virological cure rate in the days matched between at least two studies. Based on the results, we found matching on days 4, 10, and 14.Hospital Stay: was defined as the duration of patients' hospital stays measured in days.Radiological progression: included the number of patients who showed progression in their radiological CT results during the period of a study.Clinical worsening: was defined as the deterioration of the case during the study's period, or development of complications such as severity progression, or worsening of clinical symptoms.Need for mechanical ventilation (MV): was represented by the percentage of patients who needed respiratory support through MV during treatment.Experiencing side effects: This outcome included any side effect that happened from using the studied treatment during a study.QT prolongation: In this study, we target specifically the effect of HCQ/CQ/AZM on QT prolongation during a study period which is defined as being more than 460 msec in females or 460 msec in males 10 All records were exported to an Endnote library to detect and remove duplicates using the ""remove duplicate function"". All references that had the same title and author and published in the same year or the same journal were removed. References remaining after this step were exported to a Microsoft Excel file with essential information for screening.The title and abstract screening were done by seven independent reviewers to select papers based on the inclusion criteria. Each article was checked by two independent reviewers. Any disagreement was solved by the first author (RG). During the full-text screening phase, all selected articles were downloaded, and the full text was reviewed by two independent reviewers. The decision to include or exclude articles for qualitative and quantitative analysis should be agreed upon by the two reviewers to pass through. If any disagreement was noticed, the first author was asked to give his decision. The completed data were then thoroughly checked by two reviewers (RG, AK).We applied three methods to do manual searching. Firstly, we searched the reference lists of the included articles. Secondly, we performed citation tracking in which the reviewers track all the articles that cite each one of the included articles. This might involve the electronic searching of databases. Thirdly, like citation tracking, we followed all ""related to"" or ""similar ""articles. All excluded records were given exclusion reasons. Manually added research included preprint, and unpublished data if fulfilling the inclusion criteria.During the data extraction and the quality assessment, in a Microsoft Excel sheet, two reviewers extracted data related to patient characteristics and outcomes (authors, year of publication, country of patients, inclusion or exclusion criteria, when the study was conducted, study design, sample size, treatment option, dosage and duration, adverse events, primary and secondary outcomes).Method of data analysis. Data were analyzed using Review Manager Software V5.3 for Windows. For the continuous variables, data were pooled using the standardized mean difference (SSMD). For categorical variables, data were pooled using Risk Ratio (RR) with the perspective of a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) in the meta-analysis model. In the case of zero frequency, the correction value of 0.1 was used. In the case of significant heterogeneity, we used the random effect model, otherwise, the fixed-effect model was used. Metaregression analysis was done to examine the impact of the age difference, disease severity, sex, and country on HCQ regimen group mortality RR.Heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Chi-Square test (X 2 ) and measured by the I-Square test. Following Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 10, I 2 was interpreted as follows: ""0% to 40%: might not be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. The importance of the observed value of I 2 depends on the magnitude and direction of effects, and strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the chi-squared test, or a confidence interval for I 2 ). In the case of heterogeneity, DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were applied to pool the outcomes. Otherwise, the inverse variance fixed-effect model was used. Forest plots were presented to visualize the degree of variation between studies. In the case of missing standard deviation (SD), we calculated it from the corresponding 95% confidence interval or the standard error 18 . In the case of the absence of mean, authors were emailed and asked for the required data, or they were calculated according to the mathemetical equation developed by Wan, et al. 19 .Quality assessment. Quality assessment (QA) of the research depended on the study design. The risk of bias in the individual studies included for meta-analysis was assessed using the Cochrane risk assessment tool in cases of randomized control trials (RCTs) 20 , study quality assessment tools for observational studies 21 , and Robins-1 for non-randomized control trial 22 . The assessment was performed by three independent reviewers (AA, AK, SH) and further checked by two additional reviewers (RG, RS). Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is known to be an essential part of systematic reviews with metaanalyses to determine the robustness of the obtained outcomes to the assumptions made in the data analysis 23 . We conducted leave one out sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of studies that greatly influenced the result, especially by their weight through excluding them from the meta-analysis.Study selection process. A total of 4730 articles were found after searching 12 different databases. Of this number, 1151 duplicates were found by Endnote X8, and 472 were published before 2019 so they were excluded. Title and abstract screening of 3107 papers resulted in exclusion of irrelevant papers (2394), retracted articles (15) , and manually found duplicates (586). A total of 112 articles were screened for eligability. Finally, 23 papers were eligible, in addition to, 12 mannually added research. Of these 35 papers 14 studies entered in the metaanalysis (Fig. 1 ).Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis: 3 RCTs, 2 non-RCT, 3 casecontrol studies, and 6 retro or prospective cohort studies. HCQ arms of the comparative studies have been com- www.nature.com/scientificreports/ bined with observational studies for effect size meta-analysis. The studies' sample size ranged from 30 to 1438 participants. Characteristics of studies entered the systematic review presented in Table 1 .Quality assessment. Quality assessment for the studies included in this meta-analysis was conducted using Cochran risk assesment tool, Jadad, ROBINS-I, and NOS checklists. Quality assement for RCTs is presented in the summary of the risk of bias graph Fig. 2 .Publication bias. Publication bias assessment of studied that assessed mortality was conducted by visual inspection of the funnel plot 24 .Primary outcome: mortality associated with exposure to CQ/HCQ ± AZM. Mortality of HCQ was addressed in 8 studies, however, controversial results were seen. Yu et al. 39 and Membrillo et al. 51 showed that there was higher mortality rate in the standard care (SC) group compared to the HCQ group. While Rosenberg et al. and Magagnoli et al. 41 , showed that there was a higher mortality rate among those who did receive HCQ. Of note, among the 20 patients included in the study of Guatret et al. 15 , 6 patients were on AZM. Pooled RR showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in mortality (RR of 0.99, 95% CI 0.61-1.59, P = 0.96, I 2 = 82%) (Fig. 3 ). Leave one out sensitivity analysis revealed a considerable heterogeneity at all stages of the test. All studies nearly equally contributed to the overall heterogeneity. Hence, meta-regression was conducted to underline the possible effect of covariates. The risk of mortality was regressed considering mean or median age, country, percentage of male patients, and severity of illness as regressors. Age was not a significant predictor (P = 0.323) as the mean or median age was above 60 years across all selected studies except for the study of Gautret, et al. 15 , in which the median age of the participant was 45 years. Moreover, the severity of illness was not significant (P = 0.105) as the patients in almost all selected studies were hospitalized with varied clinical status except for the study of Yu et al. 39 , in which patients were all critically ill. Interestingly, the country of the study was a significant predictor for the risk of mortality at two levels (France and USA) setting for China (Yu 2020) as a reference country. Switching from Chinese to French studies increased the relative risk of mortality in HCQ groups by 7.28 times (P = 0.001). Similarly, switching from Chinese to American studies increased the relative risk of mortality in HCQ groups by 4.29 times (P = 0.005). By Meta-regression, the overall heterogeneity of selected studies was not significant (P = 0.243, I 2 = 22%). The publication bias of the included studies is presented in Fig. 4 . Mortality among patients treated with HCQ + AZM was compared with those received SC in 4 studies. Pooled analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (RR of 1.81, 95% CI 1.19-2.77, I 2 = 70%) (Fig. 3) . So, we performed leave one out sensitivity test. The study of Singh et al. 49 contributed most to the overall heterogeneity. By exclusion of this study, the heterogeneity between other studies was insignificant (P = 0.71, I2 = 0%), and the overall effect remained significant (RR: 2.23, 95% CI 1.70-2.91, P < 0.0001).Secondary outcomes. Duration of Hospital Stay associated with exposure to CQ/HCQ ± AZM. The duration of the hospital stay of patients on the SC group was significantly shorter than the HCQ/CQ group (std. mean difference was 0.57, 95% CI 0.20-0.94, P < 0.01). Of the four included studies, three studies favored the SC with std. mean difference ranging from (0. 50-1.19) . The heterogeneity of the included studies was as follows (I 2 = 81%, P < 0.01) (Fig. 5 ). In the sensitivity analysis, the study of Huang et al. 40 , contributed most to heterogeneity. Excluding this study made the overall effect relatively higher (std. mean difference = 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.85, P < 0.01) and the test of heterogeneity was not significant (P = 0.54, I 2 = 0%).The duration of hospital stay in case of treatment with (HCQ + AZM) combination versus SC was reported in two studies. In the analysis, we found a significant difference between both groups. Patients treated with HCQ + AZM combination had longer mean duration of hospital stay than the SC group. The pooled std. mean was 0.77, 95% CI 0.46-1.08, P < 0.01. The heterogeneity was statistically significant, P < 0.01, I 2 = 92% (Fig. 5) .Virological Cure associated with exposure to CQ/HCQ ± AZM. To get more insight over the virological cure rate (VQR), we were able to find two studies that analyzed the VQR of HCQ on day 4, two studies analyzed it on day 10, and three analyzed it on day 14. There were no differences between the HCQ group and the SC group [(RR: 1.11, 95% CI 0.26-4.69), (RR: 1.21, 95% CI 0.70-2.10), and (RR: 0.98, 95% CI 0.76-1.27) (Fig. 6 ). The heterogeneity of the three analyses were (I 2 = 85%, P = 0.01, I 2 = 95%, P < 0.01, and I 2 = 85%, P < 0.01) respectively. The comparison of the VQR at day 14 was subjected to leave one out sensitivity analysis. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies at all stages of the test. However, the study of Huang et al. 40 contributed to most of the heterogeneity. The overall VQR was not statistically significant between the intervention group and the SC. The pooled RR was 0.92, 95% CI = 0.69-1.23, P = 0.57. The heterogeneity of the studies was as follow I 2 = 67%, P = 0.03 (Fig. 7) . Sensitivity analysis revealed that the study of Gautret et al. 30 contributed to most of the heterogeneity. By exclusion of this study, the heterogeneity was not significant between the rest of the studies (P = 0.26, I 2 = 25%).Two studies reported the virological cure of HCQ + AZM in combination versus SC. The archived VQR of HCQ + AZM (9/23) did not differ significantly from the SC (4/31) (RR = 3.24, 95% CI 0.71-14.74, P = 0.13). The heterogeneity of the study was not significant P = 0.12 I 2 = 58% (Fig. 8 The test of heterogeneity was statistically significant I 2 = 81%, P = 0.001. Upon performing leave one out sensitivity analysis, there was a substantial heterogeneity at all stages of the test. In fact, the study of Rosenberg et al. 35 contributed most to heterogeneity between studies. By exclusion of this study, the heterogeneity became insignificant (P = 0.08, I 2 = 61%) while the overall effect remained insignificant (P = 0.95). Pooled analysis of the four studies that evaluated the need for MV among (HCQ + AZM) and SC groups revealed that 186 of 1627 patients on HCQ + AZM required MV versus 153 of 1389 patients on the SC. This difference was not significant between both groups (RR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.76-2.13, P = 0.36). The heterogeneity of the studies was as follows I 2 = 88%, P < 0.01 (Fig. 9 ). Leave one out sensitivity analysis was performed. Rosenberg et al. 35 Fig. 10) . Sensitivity analysis revealed that the study of Huang et al. 40 contributed most to heterogeneity. By the Exclusion of this study, the heterogeneity between the rest of the studies was insignificant (P = 0.45, I 2 = 48%). Moreover, pooled std. mean turned to be significantly shorter in SC groups (std. mean difference = 0.55, 95% CI 0.09, 1.02, P = 0.02).Three studies evaluated the diference in radiological improvement between the HCQ group and the SC group. Only one study reported better radiological improvement of the SC (RR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.02-2.11). The pooled analysis revealed that treatment of COVID-19 patients with HCQ didn't improve the radiological findings signficantly compared to SC (RR: 1.11, 95% CI 0.74-1.65, P = 0.61) (Fig. 13) . The heterogeneity between studies was not significant (P = 0.16, I 2 = 45%) (Fig. 11) . Sensitivity analysis showed that Chen 28 contributes most of the heterogeneity. By exclusion of this study, the I 2 index approached 0%, while the overall effect remained insignificant (RR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.60-1.34).Side effects. The three studies that addressed side effect of HCQ revealed that intervention group witnessed greater side effects than the SC (27/116) and (9/126) respectively, this difference was statistically significant (pooled RR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24, P < 0.01) (Fig. 12 ). The heterogeneity of the studies was not significant (I 2 = 0%, P = 0.79).Worsening of clinical symptoms. Five studies evaluated the differences between the HCQ or CQ group and the SC group in terms of clinical worsening. The meta-analysis showed that there was no differences between the HCQ group and the SC group regarding the worsening of clinical symptoms (RR: 1.28, 95% CI 0.33-4.99, P = 0.72). The heterogeneity of the studies was not significant P = 0.07 and I 2 = 54% (Fig. 13) . Sensitivity analysis revealed that the study of Huang et al. 40 contributed most to this heterogeneity. By exclusion of this study, the heterogeneity of studies was not significant (P = 0.29, I 2 = 19%) while the overall effect remained insignificant (RR: 0.74, 95% CI 0.28-1.97, P = 0.72).Other outcomes. QT prolongation. Many studies have evaluated the effect of HCQ on inducing QT prolongation; Chong et al. 29 demonstrated that 45.5% of patients exposed to HCQ developed QT prolongation. On the same vein, Broek et al. 37 noticed that 23% of CQ patients developed significant QT prolongation (˃500msec). Voisin et al. 38 reported that of 50 patients treated with HCQ + AZM; 6 patients stopped the treatment due to significant QT prolongation, and 38 patients (76%) presented with short-term modifications of QTc duration (meaning > 30 ms). The same figure was reported by Ramireddy et al. 42 and Saleh et al. 55 who reported that there was no difference regarding QT prolongation in-between patients treated with CQ or HCQ. Moreover, combination with AZM increased the risk of QT prolongation as (470.4 ± 45.0 ms) versus monotherapy (453.3 ± 37.0 ms), P = 0.004. This increase in QT prolongation was incriminated in discontinuation of treatment in 3.5% of the studied patients. On the other hand, Rosenberg et al. 35 reported a lower incidence of QT prolongation among patients treated with a combination of HCQ + AZM than HCQ alone (11.0% vs. 14.4%) respectively. Finally, Chang et al. 57 reported that 17.9% of patients treated with HCQ ± AZM had QT prolongation > 500 m-second. The prolongation of QT after administration of HCQ + AZM or HCQ alone was not statistically significantly different. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Fever. A total of three studies that evaluated body temperature normalization after HCQ therapy; Huang et al. 40 reported that body temperature returned normal after a geometric mean (coefficient variation), 1.2 (53.5) among HCQ group versus 1.9 (110.0) among non HCQ (P = 0.0029), while Chen et al. 14 reported that patients' temperatures returned to normal at approximately at the same rate in both groups. (Median 1, IQR 0-2 for HCQ and Median 1, IQR 0-3 for no-HQR). Chen et al. 28 reported that the duration of fever was shorter in the HCQ group (mean 2.0 ± 0.2) than in the non-HCQ group (mean 3.1 ± 1.5).Cough. Chen et al. 28 reported that 15 of 31 (48.39%) of the control patients and 22 of 31 (70.97%) intervention patients had reported cough resolution. This difference was statistically significant P = 0.0016.Two studies evaluated the change in laboratory test after exposure to HCQ, first Mallat et al. 44 reported that median lymphocyte count at day 7 was 1870 (1115-2625) compared to its baseline 1890 (1430-2230) in the control group, while it was 1650 (980-1950) at day 7 in the intervention group compared to its baseline level 1650 (980-1950). Additionally, the median serum ferritin level at day 7 was 398 (52-1030) compared to its baseline 292 in the control group, while it was 249 (130-614) at day 7 in the intervention group compared to its baseline level 165 (63-320). Barbosa et al. 43 reported that change in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was higher in HCQ (9.55 ± 21.5) than SC (1.58 ± 6.26) but this increase was not COVID-19 is a life-threatening disease with no proven effective therapy. There are a few high-quality randomized control trials that evaluated the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in the management of COVID-19. This attempt was followed by many reported poor methodologically designed observation studies that addressed the role of these drugs alone or in combination with AZM in facing this pandemic. Of note, most of these studies recruited few heterogeneous numbers of participants aimed at studying different outcomes with variable endpoints providing different doses of drugs for different durations. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In this study, we shed the light on the effectiveness and safety of CQ/HCQ with or without AZM in the management of COVID-19 to provide robust evidence for health policy decision-makers to face the ongoing pandemic. We included 14 articles to study the desired outcomes. The included studies according to their design were three RCT, two non-CT, three case-control, and six retro or prospective cohort. All included studies were conducted at hospitals. In the systematic review section, the highest number of recruited patients in a single study was 1438 35 , while the smallest number was 11 subjects 29 . The outcome that included the highest number of patients in pooled outcome analysis was mortality (3868 patients), while the smallest number of patients was included in studying the effectiveness of HCQ and AZM in achieving virologic cure (54 patients).Based on the finding of this meta-analysis, mortality of the HCQ group was not different from that of SC. The country of residency was a significant predictor of mortality outcomes. The alarming finding was that SC patients had lower numbers of mortalities if they were compared to the AZM and HCQ combination group. Exposure to HCQ was associated with a longer duration of hospital stay, whether AZM was included or not in the treatment regimen. Generally, exposure to HCQ alone or in combination with AZM was not associated with any witnessed decrease in the need for mechanical ventilation. Regarding the difference in viral clearance between HCQ and SC, the time to negative conversion was not statistically different between the two groups (HCQ and SC). Similarly, virologic cure rates at either day 4, day 10, or day 14were not different between both groups. It is worthy to mention that adding AZM to HCQ did not affect the cure rate compared to SC. Furthermore, neither clinical worsening nor radiological improvement of the studied patients was affected concurrently with exposure to HCQ. Side effects were more encountered if patients were treated with HCQ/CQ.In the current research, mortality rate of HCQ alone did not significantly differ from that of the SC. Due to high heterogeneity and failure of sensitivity analysis to identify the source of heterogeneity, we carried out meta-regression analysis. In Meta-regression analysis, the heterogeneity dropped to www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 22% and we identified that country was a strong predictor of mortality. The insignificant difference in mortality after exposure to HCQ was similar to what was reported by Shamshirian et al. 58 who almost included the same studies in their meta-analysis with a high heterogeneity of 86.93%. However, in their meta-regression analysis age was the only significant predictor of mortality concurrently with exposure to HCQ. We speculate that not only receiving HCQ is the only predictor of mortality, but also access, quality, and availability of health services within different countries are considered as a strong predictors of disease prognosis 59 . However, a country like France that provides one of the best health services worldwide, had witnessed the second-highest number of case-fatality ratio due to COVID-19 (5.9%) after Mexico (10.5%). On the other hand, a country like Morocco which is ranked 29th on the list of the world health system had a case fatality ratio of 1.8% 60, 61 . These discrepancies in case fatality ratio despite the difference in health service quality may trigger the need for studying other determinants of disease outcome in different countries like ethnicity, population age structure 62 , national interventional measures (i.e. lockdown strategies), PCR testing capabilities 63 , the bias in a testing (more diseased individuals are priority) cultural habits, viral strains, and history of previous vaccinations (BCG vaccine) 64 .Notably, one of the alarming findings was that mortality of the HCQ and AZM was significantly higher than SC (pooled RR = 1.81, 95% CI 1. 19-2.77) . This significant risk ratio remained even after excluding a study that had a high risk of bias. The increased mortality of this combination may be due to the increased risk of arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. The arrhythmogenic effect of HCQ is due to its structural similarity with quinidine (Class 1A antiarrhythmic drug.) This group inhibits voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels resulting in QT prolongation and increased risk of torsade de point 65 Virological cure rate of CQ/HCQ ± AZM versus standard care. In vitro study showed that HCQ and CQ were effective in inhibiting the growth of different viruses including SARS corona, enteroviruses, ebola, and Zika virus, however, results of in vivo studies were less promising. Historically, it was very effective in achieving higher virological response if combined with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. In addition to the aforementioned advantages, these drugs are relatively safe, cheap, and worldwide available. These facts encouraged researchers to study the effectiveness of HCQ/CQ in the treatment of COVID-19 70 . In the current research, the achieved cure rate of HCQ (day 4, 10, and 14), and time to negative conversion among the HCQ group were not statistically different from the SC. It is worthy to mention that the term SC was not firmly defined in each study; this may represent a source of prescription bias. Moreover, doses and duration of treatment with either CQ or HCQ were not the same across the different included studies considering the wide rang of half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of both agents 71 . Another explanation is that HCQ is associated with impairment of interferon alpha and gamma production resulting in impaired immune response 72 . Interestingly, the pooled standard mean difference of this outcome included the paper published by Huang et al. 40 , resulted in a significant heterogeneity in many outcomes especially time till virologic cure. By reviewing this article, we found that the authors did not address the effectiveness of this combination versus SC 41 .Need for mechanical ventilation of AZM + HCQ versus standard care. Of Fever and cough. The initial manifestation of COVID-19 are fatigue, low-grade intermittent fever of prolonged duration, myalgia, dry cough and shortness of breath, which then either improve spontaneously or with conservative therapy or progresses to dyspnea and productive cough 76 . Resolution of respiratory symptoms and fever is one of the symptoms-based indicators of disease recovery. In this study, we evaluated the recovery of these two symptoms after exposure to HCQ 77 . Huang et al. 40 and Chen et al. 28 demonstrated that patients treated with CQ recover from fever faster than those on SC, however, Chen et al. 27 did not report any significant difference between both groups in resolution of fever. Chen et al. 28 reported a more significant resolution of cough among patients exposed to HCQ. Due to insufficient data, we did not conduct a meta-analysis.Computed tomography is more sensitive tool than X-ray in diagnosis of COVID-19. The predominant radiological feature of COVID-19 patients is groundglass opacification, consolidation, air bronchogram, and nodular opacities without pleural effusion. Moreover, it can be used to follow the disease course 78, 79 . In this metanalysis, treatment with HCQ did not provide any additional benefit in terms of radiological improvement or clinical worsening versus the SC. We included three published articles in this analysis of the impact of HCQ on radiological improvement and five articles evaluated the effect of CQ/HCQ on clinical worsening. The heterogeneity of both analyses was 45% and 54% respectively.QT prolongation. Abnormal myocardial repolarization results in QT interval prolongation. The normal QT interval is 450 ms in females, and 460 ms in males 80 . Among patients treated with HCQ, QT prolongation was identified in 23-45.5% 29, 37 . About 12% of patients on AZM and HCQ stopped treatment due to significant QT prolongation. It is important to notice that there was no difference in the incidence of drug-induced QT prolongation by CQ or HCQ. A combination of HCQ and AZM increases the risk, however, Rosenberg et al. 35 reported a lower incidence of QT prolongation among patients who received this combination versus SC.Side effects. Chloroquine is used as a chemoprophylactic and therapeutic agent for malaria and amebiasis 81 , while HCQ is a less toxic metabolite of chloroquine used to treat SLE, RA, etc. 82 . Nonetheless, these agents can cause ocular manifestation starting from blurring of vision up to optic disc pallor in the end-stage 83 . In this meta-analysis, we included three published pieces of research that addressed the reported side effects of HCQ treatment. Patients on HCQ treatment had a higher risk of experiencing side effects, (pooled RR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24) with I 2 of 0%. In this work, the reported side effects were diarrhea, headache, rash, elevated transaminases, fatigue, and anemia.Limitation. Our analysis must be interpreted in the context of the limitations of the available data; despite the huge number of published articles during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these studies lack good quality and may contain inconsistent results. There is an urgent need for high-quality randomized control trials that address the effectivness of HCQ. Consequently, we depended in our analysis on few published or even cited preprints. These numbers may be considered insufficient to provide robust evidence on HCQ/CQ supplementation. Moreover, we included many observational studies due to the scarcity of randomized control trials. It is well established that observational studies cannot discover causality. This fact also contributed to the highly found heterogeneity of analysis especially for the study of Huang et al. 40 . After leave one sensitivity analysis the heterogeneity dropped to acceptable value in many outcomes. Another important source of bias was patient selection bias; as some studies did not classify patients according to their disease's severity. This source of bias may significantly affect the course of illness. Differences in HCQ and AZM dose, duration of treatment, and route of administration may also affect the consistency of our results. We could not perform a subgroup analysis based on disease severity as there is no gold standard tool that uses clinical features or laboratory parameters to classify different disease severity.Treating COVID-19 patients with CQ/HCQ did not decrease mortality. even it was increased if AZM was added. Besides, CQ/HCQ alone or in combination with AZM increased the duration of hospital stay. Overall virological cure rate and that on days 4, 10, or 14 were not affected by receiving HCQ. Adding AZM to HCQ/CQ did not show any benefit in terms of virological cure as well. The Need for MV was not improved by exposure to CQ/HCQ alone or in combination with AZM. Moreover, CQ/HCQ, did not neither shorten the duration till conversion to negative PCR, prevent radiological progression, nor affect clinical worsening of the disease. Future randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these conclusions.","Egypt","first author","2020-12-17",12

In most cases, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly resolved, whereas 26% require intensive care unit admission [1] .Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary from mild pneumonia to progressive Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Its singular features are severe hypoxemia often associated with near-normal respiratory system compliance at the beginning [2] . On these distinctive grounds, a crucial question rose: How does COVID-19 damage the lungs to cause a rapidly progressive onset of profound hypoxemia?In 1967, Ashbaugh et al. assumed that diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on lung histology is the pathological hallmark of ARDS [3] . However, recent shreds of evidence point out that DAD is only a phenotype of ARDS among others, but with a higher mortality [4] . COVID-19 is a systemic disease that affects multiple organs, including the lungs, pharynx, heart, liver, brain, and kidneys [5] . Very little is known about the ""weaponry"" of COVID-19; however, its main target seems to be the vascular endothelium. Initial reports documented clinically significant coagulopathy in critically ill patients [6, 7] . According to the Berlin definition [8] , diagnosing ARDS does not take into account pathologic findings which leaves a considerable gap in categorizing COVID-19 ARDS (C-ARDS) and its peripheral vascular changes. On the other hand, previous work studied the coinfection rate between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens and focused only on nasopharyngeal swabs [9] but failed to address it in the lower respiratory tract.Understanding the precise pathophysiology of C-ARDS will assist researchers and physicians in improving their therapeutic approach. Here, we conducted a descriptive study performing an open-lung biopsy (OLB); taking into account the benefit-to-risk ratio, in patients with C-ARDS. This study is aimed at determining C-ARDS pathological characteristics and coinfection with other pathogens in lung tissue.We selected patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection-admitted to the COVID-19 ICU of the University Hospital from the 25 th of April to 25 th June 2020-who later developed ARDS that met the Berlin definition [8] and were put under mechanical ventilation. Initial chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed bilateral diffused ground-glass opacities in different percentages. Informed written consent from the next of kin was obtained. The ethics committees of the University Hospital approved this research respecting the regulations of the Helsinki declaration (ID UCA020-041).Technique. An open-lung minithoracotomy with rib spreading was performed using the wedge resection technique from the anterolateral segment with a stapler (Figure 1 ). The anterior end of the incision was placed 3 to 4 cm lateral to the middle line of the breastbone. Pleural space was entered above the fifth rib. A chest tube was placed through another incision, and the muscle layers were loosely closed with a running absorbable number 0 suture. A lung tissue fragment was immediately soaked in 4% formalin solution, and the other fragments along with pleural effusion fluid were put in a culture environment. The surgical team wore level 3 personal protective equipment during the invasive procedure ( Figure 2 ).Specimen's Analysis. Biopsy lung tissue was analyzed with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff for detecting bacterial and fungal infection and also Masson trichrome staining to identify pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. The slides have been digitized using a Leica SCN400 Slide Scanner, and then images of tissue sections were captured. Pleural effusion fluid and biopsy lung tissue were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and a panel of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral pathogens (adenovirus, coronavirus metapneumovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, MERS-CoV, parainfluenza virus, syncytial respiratory virus, and flu viruses A and B), along with standard bacterial and fungal respiratory cultures.Features. An open-lung biopsy in 3 patients with C-ARDS was carried out. All of them were male and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab at the time of hospital admission. The median age was 65 years (range, 57-72 years). The median duration from symptoms to admission is 10 days (range, 7-13days), and the median duration from admission to death was 9.6 days (range, 5-15 days). Initial symptoms in 3 patients were mainly fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, whereas Case 3 reported anosmia.Hypertension was found in all patients as preexisting comorbidity, Case 1 had hyperthyroidism and benign hypertrophy of the prostate, and Case 3 reported being a chronic smoker for 20 years with dyslipidemia ( Table 1) .All patients were managed with the same national Moroccan protocol, which is hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, zinc, vitamin C, and therapeutic dose of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH), in addition to acetylsalicylic acid. Two patients had A+ blood type and Case 1 had O+. The median duration of noninvasive ventilation management was 6.3 days (range, 3-10 days), and the median duration of mechanical ventilation was 3.3 days (range, 2-5 days). Open-lung biopsy was performed on the first day of endotracheal intubation in all patients.Results. D-dimer serum levels at the admission of Cases 1, 2, and 3 were 7.41 μg/mL, 2.27μg/mL, and 0.31 μg/mL, respectively, whereas at their last day were elevated to 21.27μg/mL, 22.95 μg/mL, and 1.1 μg/mL ( Table 2 ). It is difficult to claim that none of the patients had thromboembolic events as no autopsy was performed.Histological examination showed diffuse alveolar damage with collapsed alveoli and intensified thickening of the intercellular septa in Cases 1 and 2 ( Figure 3 ), whereas Case 3 exhibited enlarged airspaces, consistent with emphysema ( Figure 4 ). The lumen was filled with proteinaceous and fibrin exudates ( Figure 5 ). Type II pneumocytes were found hyperplasic with an atypical appearance, multinucleated with enlarged and prominent nuclei ( Figure 6 ). There were significant focal points of pneumocyte desquamation, multinucleated giant cells (Figure 7) , and hyaline membrane formation on the alveolar wall ( Figure 8 ). Interstitial tissue displayed edema and widespread inflammatory infiltrates marked with lymphocytes mainly but also plasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophilic polynuclear cells. Prominent microthrombi (Figures 9(a) and 9(b)) and vascular congestion ( Figure 10 ) were the major pathological finding in all cases. Also, a fibrin deposit was found in the vessel intima with a thickened vessel wall. Anthracosis deposit was also seen in Cases 1 and 2. No malignant tumor proliferation and no alveolar fibrosis were found in the 3 cases (Table 3 ). An additional file shows more of these results (see Additional file 1).Bacterial and viral (other than SARS-CoV-2) culture returned negative. Qualitative RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in the pulmonary parenchyma and pleural fluid of Cases 2 and 3.Herein, an open-lung minithoracotomy was performed in 3 patients, who developed C-ARDS, in the first 24 hours of endotracheal intubation. Then, pathological, viral, and bacterial elements of lung tissues were examined. In all samples, the early phase of proliferative DAD was found associated with unexpected thrombosis of alveolar capillaries.It seems plausible to hypothesize that, as a signature of ARDS, there were two intriguing mechanisms of hypoxemia and ventilation-to-perfusion ratio (V A /Q) mismatch caused by COVID-19. The first evident explanation is that thickening of alveoli walls and hyaline membranes is responsible for hypoxemia, but not solely [10] . The characteristics of type II pneumocytes suggest viral cytopathic-like changes, which could represent a direct attack on pulmonary parenchyma. Thus, collapsed alveoli arise in low ventilation, therefore a low V A /Q. Finding DAD in our patients' lung corroborates with previous postmortem pathological data of C-ARDS [11, 12] and also severe pneumonia due to influenza A/H1N1 [13] . It is important to mention that ventilation-induced lung injuries were significantly reduced since the biopsy was carried out on the first day of endotracheal intubation.Second, the most striking result to emerge from the above data is the pattern of microthrombi formation in alveolar capillaries. New vessel growth through a mechanism of 3 BioMed Research International intussusceptive angiogenesis was reported recently [14] . Furthermore, pulmonary changes were observed and limited only to thrombotic microvascular injury with complement precipitation in lung septal microvasculature [15] . A large recent lung autopsy series points out the anticipated exudative phase of DAD with type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and interstitial edema, associated with congested capillaries and platelet- fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels [16] . Hence, low perfusion of lungs results also in a high V A /Q, worsened by the loss of perfusion regulation. Both shunt effect and dead space contribute to the increase in minute ventilation and work of breathing and might simultaneously play a pivotal role in the heterogeneous pathogenesis of COVID-19 hypoxemia. Interestingly, it has now been suggested that respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 is not a typical ARDS [2] . In 2009, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was responsible for a global pandemic alert [17]. Capelozzi et al. conducted an Open-Lung Biopsy in 5 patients with ARDS with confirmed H1N1, and the main pathological features found were necrotizing bronchiolitis, DAD, and alveolar hemorrhage, and it was hypothesized that DAD is a repercussion of bronchiolar obstruction [18] , whereas in our patients, DAD is related to SARS-CoV-2 lesions. They also suggested that the bronchiolar epithelium was the primary target cells for swine-origin influenza A (H1N1), while SARS-CoV-2 damages mainly alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells.It is noteworthy that fibrin thrombi were found in all patients as well as high levels of serum D-dimer. An increasing number of researchers highlighted coagulopathy [19, 20] . Moreover, this result has further strengthened the positive correlation between the elevated D-dimer level and the fatal prognosis of the disease course of COVID-19 [21] . In fact, a high incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 has been described in an autopsy series [22] .Most host responses in severe cases of COVID-19 reflect hyperinflammation and cytokine storm [23] , which leads to intense recruitment and infiltration of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in alveolar capillary beds, as in SARS-CoV-1 [24] . These infiltrates are known to produce uncontrolled proinflammatory chemokines and therefore intensify the vicious hyperinflammation cycle.The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral elements within the endothelial cells and the accumulation of inflammatory cells [25] may generate a prothrombotic state by activating endothelial coagulation factors. Thus, unrestrained and extensive immunothrombosis may increase the severity of microangiopathy [26] , notably in older patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. A hypercoagulable state is allied with a relative hypofibrinolysis imbalance and results in fibrin deposits in the intra-alveolar space [27] . Severe hypoxemia resulting initially from the V A /Q mismatch might BioMed Research International be the last straw to further amplify inflammation and increase blood viscosity [26] , through activating platelets and plasma coagulation as well as through inhibiting the anticoagulant protein S [28] . In this study, bacterial and fungal cultures were negative, in contrast with the recent finding of bacterial abscesses in 4 patients among 38 who succumbed to COVID-19, with a single fungal abscess in one [16] . SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR was positive in two of our patients, whereas other respiratory pathogens were not present in lung tissue. Coinfection with other pathogens cannot be ruled out since it could be present in another pulmonary parenchyma that is not included in the biopsy fragment.This research was carried out primarily to formulate adequate therapeutic strategies based on the uncovered BioMed Research International pathogenesis of C-ARDS. Increasingly, it was pointed out that LMWH administration is tied to a better outcome in patients with severe COVID-19 that are showing an elevated level of D-dimers [29] . In addition to anticoagulation, heparin has anti-inflammatory properties that may be helpful to manage this disease but also provide endothelium protection [30] .There are several possible explanations for the inefficacy of LMWH administered in our patients. On the one hand, perhaps an asymptomatic pulmonary embolism was already present before the hospitalization of our hypercoagulable patients [31] , considering their advanced age and their cardiovascular comorbidities but also the delay between the symptom onset and their hospitalization. On the other hand, it seems plausible that patients with C-ARDS require higher dose anticoagulation for preventing microvascular thrombosis and endothelial injury, in the absence of any medical contraindication. In this setting, randomized clinical trials studying the efficacy and safety of the full dose of LMWH or UFH (unfractionated heparin) are urgently needed and are being conducted worldwide (NCT04401293, NCT04409834, and NCT04362085), as no data is available at this time for this indication. Even though minimal alveolar hemorrhage was found in the biopsy, managing the plurifocal fibrin microthrombi outweighs the risk of bleeding, which seems to be consistent with the low incidence of hemorrhagic complications in patients with severe BioMed Research International The intensity was appreciated independently by two investigators and estimated. ""+"": focal; ""++"": plurifocal; ""+++"": diffuse. 9 BioMed Research International COVID-19 coagulopathy [29] . Thus, a pragmatic necessity to use an intermediate/therapeutic dose of anticoagulation in this setting imposes itself.From another angle, these findings would seem to support the role of corticosteroid therapy. It is well known that glucocorticoids reduce endothelial leakage through decreasing capillary permeability and lower leukocyte migration to the inflammation site, while effectively stopping the inflammatory cascade. It is interesting to note that concerning C-ARDS, it was reported that methylprednisolone appears to have reduced the risk of death [32] ; moreover, a high dose (1000 or 500 mg/day) and short term use of methylprednisolone provide a better prognosis of patients with C-ARDS [33] . Although the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend routine use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS-CoV-2 [34] , it was found that severe COVID-19 patients who received methylprednisolone improved their oxygenation significantly with no negative impact on viral clearance [35] . On another note, early use of dexamethasone was proven to lower the duration of mechanical ventilation and improve survival [36] . A preliminary report of the RECOVERY trial indicated that the administration of 6 mg of dexamethasone reduced mortality by 35% in patients with COVID-19, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation [37] .The present study has not investigated the samples using immunohistochemical staining for additional insights, due to lack of materials. Despite the sample size, we believe our preliminary work could be a starting point to further provide concrete and substantial answers regarding the mechanism and pathogenesis of severe hypoxemia in C-ARDS and its management.The evidence from this study allows us to not only hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 directly attacks lung alveoli leading to diffuse alveolar damage and more particularly plurifocal fibrin microthrombi in the peripheral vasculature beds, but also elucidate the mechanism behind V A /Q mismatch in severe C-ARDS hypoxemia. Additionally, this paper points out the crucial benefit of anticoagulant therapy and corticosteroids in terms of dead space and shunt effect, respectively. Further investigation should be conducted in order to determine pertinently C-ARDS hypoxemia mechanisms and the proper ventilation and therapeutic management.All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its supplementary information files.The ethics committees of the University Hospital approved this study (ID UCA020-041).Written informed consent was obtained from the next of kin.The authors declare no competing interest.","Morocco","first author","2020-12-09",12

The current pandemic causes severe socio-economic burden (Nicola et al., 2020) . Due to the importance of understanding of the mode of recognition and viral entry, spike protein sheds drug designers as the first look protein target. The first solved structure for the spike protein is released on February 26, 2020 (PDB ID: 6VSB) (Wrapp et al., 2020) .Heat Shock Protein A5 (HSPA5), or the Glucose Regulating Protein 78 (GRP78), was reported to be a possible route for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry (Elfiky, 2020; Ibrahim et al., 2020; Ha et al., 2020; Saghazadeh and Rezaei, 2020) . The binding site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike is predicted to be the nine residues CNGVEGFNC (C480-C488 region) found in the S1 C-terminal domain, as shown in Figure 1 (see the enlarged panel) (Ibrahim et al., 2020) . The prediction was based on the structural conservation between this region of the spike, and the cyclic Pep42 peptide (CTVALPGGYVRVC) that previously reported to target GRP78 (over cancer cells) selectively in vivo (Kim et al., 2006; Quinones et al., 2008; Braun et al., 2020) . It was recently reported in Nature journal that SARS-CoV-2 spike has conserved motifs compared to previous strains of human coronaviruses (HKU1, 229E, NL63, OC43) (Braun et al., 2020) still experimental validation is required to prove the hypothesis.The sequence comparison between the known human coronavirus strains, including; alpha coronaviruses (NL63, and 229E), and beta coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), reveals exciting results in terms of C480-C488 region of the spike protein. Figure 2A shows part of the multiple sequence alignment, made by clustal omega webserver and viewed by ESpript 3, for the different human coronavirus strains at the GRP78 recognition site (C480-C488 in SARS-CoV-2). The recognition of the GRP78 by the peptide Pep42 is previously reported to be restricted for the cyclic form of the peptide (the first and last CYS residues form a disulfide bond) (Kim et al., 2006; Quinones et al., 2008) . Surprisingly, the residues C480 and C488 is . The alignment is made using the Clustal Omega web server and is displayed by ESpript 3 software. The yellow highlighted residues are conserved among the seven HCoVs. GRP78 recognition site (C480-C488 in SARS-CoV-2) is marked in red (B) Pairwise sequence alignment between Pep42 from one side and NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, and SARS-CoV-2 from the other side. Red and yellow residues are identical and similar residues, respectively.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 577467 2 Elfiky SARS-CoV-2 Spike -GRP78 Recognition in HCoVs found in SARS-CoV-2 and the immersed human coronaviruses strains (NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1), but missing in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Additionally, at least three identical (four similar) residues are found among the immersed human coronaviruses strains compared to SARS-CoV-2 (see Figure 2B ). This implies the possibility of cross immune the SARS-CoV-2 and the immersed human coronaviruses strains (NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1). The human coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1, have been less impacted the human being (Zumla et al., 2016; van den Brand et al., 2015) . People previously infected with these strains of human coronaviruses may develop immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, the immersed human coronavirus strains characterized by mild flu-like symptoms and information about viral distribution is rare (Huynh et al., 2012; Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013; Zumla et al., 2016) .Molecular dynamics study (using NAMD software) for the SARS-CoV-2 spike combined with molecular docking (Using AutoDock Vina software) revealed the existence of at least four interactions (H-bonds or hydrophobic contacts) between GRP78 and C480-C488 of SARS-CoV-2 spike. The hydrophobic contacts (two up to six) are found in all the docking experiments (seven replicas done at different dynamics states of SARS-CoV-2 spike after 100 ns MDS). This is in support of the previous reports about GRP78 recognition of hydrophobic patches in the unfolded proteins (Tsai and Lee, 2018; Li and Lee, 2006) . Further experimental validation is required to prove this hypothesis.Conclusively SARS-CoV-2 Spike-host cell recognition is crucial in fighting COVID-19 both as a therapeutic and prophylactic routes. The C480-C488 region is an essential viral spike epitope to be targeted by drugs, natural compounds, or antibodies to prevent or weaken the host cell recognition of SARS-CoV-2. This represents a hot topic that need further validation in laboratory.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.","Egypt","first author","2020-12-11",12

The world health organization has announced that the viral infection related to the new strain of corona virus as pandemic in March, 2020 (Mahase, 2020) . Many measures and precautions were adopted by healthcare officials worldwide in order to contain the infection (Jin et al., 2020a) . The whole world has turned into a huge prison for human kind in ""quarantine"" (Parmet and Sinha, 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 is the third respiratory syndrome to affect human after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Su et al., 2016) . How the virus infects human cells has been published in many reports (Wrapp et al., 2020) with a key step involving the binding of the spike protein of the virus (S) to the trans-membranal angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Yan et al., 2020) . This has revealed the first biological target in fighting infection. The second target was human serine protease TMPRSS211 that has a crucial role in S protein priming (Matsuyama et al., 2020) . Another target was the RNA dependent RNA polymerase responsible for replication of viral RNA (Elfiky, 2020) . Finally there are two proteinase viral enzymes that are responsible for the release of essential proteins for viral structures (Stobart and Moore, 2014) , main protease (M pro , also known as 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease; 3CL pro ) & papain-like protease (PL pro ), presenting an additional target (Báez-Santos et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020) .The ongoing research for developing a vaccine may be the ultimate solution to this pandemic. However, vaccine development has not succeeded with many RNA viruses including SARS and MERS, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, several reports originating from pharmaceutical industry expected that the vaccine will not be out till 2021 (Amanat and Krammer, 2020) .The design of new molecules using artificial intelligence and molecular software techniques has been launched by many companies (Emanuel and Wachter, 2019) . Almost every day since the announcement of this pandemic, an article, a study or a report is discussing design suggestions (Yassine and Shah, 2020) . The problem is that any new molecule cannot be approved for human use in controlling this infection until it passes all safety and efficacy requirements through clinical trials which may take a very long time (Hughes et al., 2011) .Drug repurposing of existing drugs with an established safety profile may comprise a solution in dealing with such a dilemma (Pushpakom et al., 2019) . Drug repurposing is based on computational techniques including pharmacophore, molecular docking, homology modeling and molecular dynamics for the virtual screening to the aforementioned targets (Liu et al., 2013) . The published protein structure of main protease (M pro ) with an inhibitor was a breakthrough for medicinal chemists to act swiftly to find an inhibitor from already known drugs (Jin et al., 2020b) .Zheng and colleagues have published an article (COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system) (Zheng et al., 2020) that highlighted the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 infection. They claimed that ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor (AT1) blockers (ARBs) will elevate the severity of infection in cardiovascular patients who are treated with such drugs, the over-expressed ACE2 in those patients may explain that finding . ACE2 acts on both Angiotensin I (deca-peptide) and Angiotensin II (octa peptide) to hydrolyze them into Angiotensin I (1-9) and Angiotensin II (1-7), respectively (Clarke and Turner, 2012) . This action is considered a counter action to ACE in forming Angiotensin II, which is considered as one of the molecules that is responsible for elevated blood pressure in hypertensive patients (Crackower et al., 2002) .Hence they claimed that blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may contribute to the high mortality rate of cardiovascular patients (Atlas, 2007) .This article received a correspondence by Mourad and Levy who stressed on the need to differentiate between the different blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on the expression of ACE2 (Mourad and Levy, 2020) , where different level of inhibition of RAAS will affect the level of ACE2 differently. In a closer look, inhibition of ACE enzyme or AT1 receptor will definitely lead to ACE2 overexpression (Zheng et al., 2020) . On the contrary, inhibition of renin will lead to the down regulation of ACE2 (Ferrario et al., 2005) . In this context Mourad and Levy has suggested the well-known renin inhibitor aliskiren as a possible candidate to aid in the management of COVID-19 infection (Mourad and Levy, 2020) .In this study, we do agree with Mourad and Levy in their suggestion on the possible use of renin inhibitors. Remikiren, a second generation peptidomimetic renin inhibitor, failed the clinical trials because of its low bioavailability and weak blood pressure-lowering activity (Stanton, 2003) but passed several drug discovery process stages and thus is an excellent candidate for drug repurposing. The fact that renin is a protease enzyme was encouraging to examine renin inhibitors as possible main protease inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2.The catalytically active site of 3CL pro acts through a protease Cys-His dyad. In this system, cysteine thiol functions as the nucleophile in the proteolytic process ( Fig. 1) , binding with these amino acids is the key step in inhibiting the protease activity (Siklos et al., 2015) .Virtual screening for drugs was not possible till the release of the structure of this protease co-crystallized with inhibitors. Fortunately, PDB IDs (6W63, 6LU7, 6Y2F and 6Y7M) Jin et al., 2020b; Mesecar) have the required criteria to be utilized for pharmacophore generation. Pharmacophore is the set of structural features that is recognized at the receptor site & is responsible for its biological activity (Gund, 1977) . It's a type of mental model which is complementary to the receptor and forms the bases for non-covalent interactions (Yang, 2010) . In the present work pharmacophore elucidation is a powerful tool to explore the essential binding interactions with SARS-COV-2 main protease enzyme, this was performed through a ligand-based approach depending on the structure of the inhibitors that were crystallized with this enzyme and released in protein data bank. Virtual screening was performed using a database of 84 released co-crystallized renin inhibitors, the hits were filtered relying on Lipinski's drug-like filter and a docking study was then carried out to confirm the results. Furthermore, a Molecular dynamics simulation was run to investigate the stability of the ligand in the active site of the enzyme.Pharmacophore model generation was adopted using the ligands cocrystallized (OEW, N3, X77 & O6K) in PDB IDs (6W63, 6LU7, 6Y2F and 6Y7M). The essential binding interactions of the co-crystallized main protease ligands are illustrated in (Fig. 2) through MOE generation of Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprint (PLIF) of the four PDB files, the figure shows the main interacting amino acids (His41, Phe140, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145, His163, His164, Glu166, Pro168, Gln189 and Thr190).Upon pharmacophore automatic elucidation, 1036 pharmacophores were generated. For model selection; further narrowing down steps were adapted for choosing the best representative model. Firstly, we selected the models that covers all four used ligands which reduced the number to 910 models. Secondly, according to query size (QSize), models with higher features number (five) were chosen to increase the model specificity which further reduced the number to 411. Finally, through comparing the overlap score of the selected models, only two models exceed the score of 2.00, those models were then used for virtual screening. The final selected model was the one with lower number of hits upon screening the database, see (Fig. 3 ).The chosen model has five features; three hydrophobic features two of which are close by, separated by a distance of 2.72 Å, the third is separated by a distance of 9.59 Å and10.44 Å. The other features are two H-bond acceptor which are separated by 4.83 Å and are away from the third hydrophobic feature by 2.91 Å and 6.10 Å (Fig. 4) .In order to find an approved drug that complies with this model for repurposing, a list of FDA-approved drugs (2684 drugs) was virtually screened using the above pharmacophore but unfortunately no hits were identified. Another database of 84 renin inhibitors, whose their chemical structures and PBD IDs are listed in (supplementary data: Table S1), was compiled and was screened using the pharmacophore model. Ten ligands were identified as hits (R32, R31, 0GM, 0IU, 0QB, C60, REM, 3OX, L1A and 2Y2).For further refinement of these hits, drug-likeness concept was applied. Walters and Murcko define 'drug-like' compounds as ''molecules which contain functional groups and/or have physical properties consistent with the majority of known drugs'' (Walters and Murcko, 2002) . Lipinski defines drug-like ''as those compounds that have sufficiently acceptable ADME properties and sufficiently acceptable toxicity properties to survive through the completion of human Phase I clinical trials'' (Lipinski et al., 1997 ). Lipinski's rule of five states that for a compound to be drug-like with acceptable physicochemical features, it should have a molecule weight <500, log P value < 5, not more than 5 HBD (H-bond donor) groups (OH and NH) and not more than 10 HBA (H-bond acceptor) groups (O and N) (Lipinski, 2004) . Analysis of the ten selected hits was performed through measurement of molecular weight, count of HBD and HBA groups and consensus log P o/w (obtained from SwissADME web server), the results are summarized in (Table 1 ). The two hits that fulfill the rule are highlighted.Consequently, only two ligands (0IU & Remikiren) were selected for further investigation. The chemical structures and the superimposition of 0IU & Remikiren on the pharmacophoric features is displayed in (Fig. 5) . The zero hits count on FDA approved drugs and only 10 hits from 84 renin inhibitors can highlight the selectivity of the generated model.Before the docking of the renin inhibitors, a validation experiment was carried out to ensure that the docking protocol is acceptable. The validation results were found to be satisfactory, where the relative position of the co-crystallized ligand and the docked ligand were found to be similar (Fig. 6) . RMSD Between the atoms of the co-crystallized ligand and the docked ligand was calculated to be 0.8851 Å. Docking of the two renin inhibitors identified by the pharmacophore model was carried into the active pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease to examine the binding modes of both compounds within the active site. Of the two compounds, remikiren was found to bind through an extensive hydrogen bond network (Fig. 7) .The active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease has a Cys-His catalytic dyad formed by Cys-145 and His-41, similar to that reported in other SARS main protease enzymes (Anand, 2002; Yang et al., 2003) . Known protease inhibitors are known to form covalent bonds with the Cys145 residue Tang et al., 2020) . Visual examination of the chosen binding pose of remikiren within the binding pocket showed that the amide carbonyl is oriented towards the Cys145 residue, suggesting the possibility of covalent bond formation. Additionally, it has been reported that the catalysis reaction is stabilized through the formation of hydrogen bonds with His41, Gly143, Ser144 and/or Cys145 . Remikiren was found to form hydrogen bonds with both His41 and Cys145 through hydrogen bonds, suggesting the stabilization of the complex. The active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease also has a S1 binding pocket consisting of Phe140, Leu141, His163, Glu166 and His172 (Jin et al., 2020b) , the imidazole moiety of the remikiren was found to be oriented towards the S1 pocket and was found to form hydrogen bonds with both His163 and Glu166. Interactions of known inhibitors with the S1 pocket have been previously reported and are thought to be advantageous for inhibitor activity Tang et al., 2020) . Furthermore, remikiren was found to form an additional hydrogen bond between the sulphonyl oxygen and Met49. Interactions between remikiren and the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease are displayed in (Table 2) .A molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to confirm and further elaborate on the activity of remikiren in the active pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Fig. 8 shows the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) fluctuations of the protein (black) and the ligand (red) over 10 ns The RMSD of protein and the ligand level off at around 0.3 nm (3 Å) and 0.15 nm (1.5 Å) respectively, which are quite small. This suggests that the binding of the ligand in the active site is stable. Additionally, visual inspection of the trajectory of the binding pose confirmed the stability of the ligand in the active pocket (Fig. 8) .There's no doubt that COVID-19 panic pandemic through the past months forced all researchers to try to find a solution. Our search was focused on the fact that renin inhibitors downregulate ACE2 receptor which is a first target for SARS-COV-2 infection, as well as their inhibitory activity on proteases. Based on this knowledge, we utilized the cheminformatic computational techniques such as pharmacophore elucidation & search, virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics to identify a potential hit from known renin inhibitors to be repurposed against one of the most important SARS-COV-2 enzymes, the main protease. Remikiren was identified to fulfill the pharmacophore query and showed promising results in both molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies and is recommended for further clinical studies. The X-ray crystallographic structures of the co-crystallized SARS-COV-2 main protease inhibitors with the following PDB IDs (6W63, 6LU7, 6Y2F and 6Y7M) were downloaded from protein data bank (htt ps://www.rcsb.org/). Pharmacophore elucidation, validation, selection followed by virtual screening were performed by MOE (2019.0102) software. The co-crystallized main protease inhibitors were first prepared by conformational search and charges adjustment, they were rigidly aligned, and pharmacophore models were automatically generated, the large number of pharmacophores were filtered based on cover, QSize and the overlap score to choose a suitable one. The selected model was then used for virtual screening on a list of 2684 FDA-approved drugs (downloaded form Drugbank) and a database of 84 co-crystallized renin inhibitors (downloaded from protein data bank). Lipinski's drug-like filter was applied to minimize the number of hits by calculating the compounds' properties from SwissADME free web server (http://www. swissadme.ch/).A docking experiment was carried out to examine the binding of the renin inhibitors identified by the pharmacophore screening into the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease using Autodock Vina (Oleg and Arthur J, 2010) . The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB code: 6W63) (Mesecar) was downloaded from the protein databank (https://www.rcsb.org/). The downloaded structure of the protein was prepared using Autodock tools 4 (J. Westbrook, 2002) , by the deletion of water molecules and assigning of partial charges using Gasteiger charges. Before the docking procedure was performed, validation was carried by the redocking of the co-crystallized ligand. The database of renin inhibitors was also prepared used Autodock tools 4 (J. Westbrook, 2002) , through the addition of Gasteiger charges. The active pocket was defined using a grid box of dimensions 60 X 60 X 60 points centered on the native ligand with a spacing of 0.375 Å. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used to carry out a 100 docking runs for each compound using the default Autodock parameters. The results were analyzed and visualized using UCSF Chimera (Morris et al., 2009 ).A molecular dynamics simulation was performed for 10ns to further analyze the binding of remikiren into the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease using GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations) v. 5.1.2 (Pettersen et al., 2004) , The topology and co-ordinate file of the protein was generated using GROMACS, applying the AMBER99SB force field (Berendsen et al., 1995) . On the other hand, the parameterization of remikiren was carried out using ACPYPE (AnteChamber PYthon Parser InterfacE) module of AmberTools (Maier The docking score and interaction formed between remikiren and SARS-CoV-2 main protease. R.H. Refaey et al. et al., 2015) and the automated topology builder (http://bio2byte.be/ acpype/) (Case et al., 2020) . 23046 TIP3P water molecules were added to the system, in addition to 68 Na + and Cl − ions, in order to achieve a final concentration of 0.15mM. Prior to the molecular dynamics simulations, the system was minimized using the steepest descent method, applying a force tolerance of 100 kJ/mol and for a maximum of 5000 steps. This was then followed by two restrained molecular dynamics simulations were carried out, each for 100 ps, serving to equilibrate the system. This was then followed by a 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation, using a leap frog algorithm. Temperature and pressure were kept constant at 300 K and 1 bar respectively using Berendsen temperature coupling and Berendsen pressure coupling set 0.1. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle Mesh-Ewald (PME) method with a 1 nm short-range cut-off and short-range non-bonded interactions were computed only within a cut-off of 1.2 nm. Finally, the trajectories produced from the dynamics simulation were analyzed used XMGrace (Sousa da Silva and Vranken, 2012) and visually inspected using VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) (Humphrey et al., 1996) .","Egypt","first author","2020-12-24",12

[4] [5] [6] Several factors may limit the use of RT-PCR, eg, the availability of skilled trained laboratory personnel familiar with molecular techniques, the need for special equipment, and a specific laboratory infrastructure with safety measures and equipment. Moreover, molecular tests are costly and often time-consuming, creating a burden especially for countries with low resources. 7 There is a strong need for rapid and easy-to-perform tests, particularly in countries with limited access to molecularlevel assessments. 5 A rapid antigen detection (RAD) test for SARS-CoV-2 can be interpreted without specialized equipment, and results can be available within 30 minutes. The RAD tests can thereby decrease the workload in laboratories and hospitals and improve the turnaround time for results. However, the WHO has noted that the role of RAD tests in antigen detection for SARS-CoV-2 requires further evaluation, and the tests are not recommended for clinical diagnosis. 8, 9 The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag test as a frontline test in comparison to the molecular RT-PCR technique to evaluate the potential of its use during the peak period of the pandemic, especially in high-risk symptomatic populations such as healthcare workers, reducing the need for expensive molecular confirmatory testing.This study was performed at Fayoum University Hospital in Egypt and was approved by the Fayoum University Research ethics committee, which is a member of the Egyptian Network Research Ethics Committee. The study included 310 specimens: 160 from patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and 150 from exposed healthcare workers and patient contacts. Specimens were all collected during May 2020.Nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens were obtained using flocked NP swabs and transported to the laboratory in universal viral transport media (UTM-RT System, Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) within 1 to 2 hours of collection.The RT-PCR technique used the SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV Multiplex real-time PCR detection kit, DNA technology in the instrument RT-PCR DTlite 4 (Russia), and the extraction was done using the LabTurbo 48C (Taiwan).PCR-characterized specimens (universal transport medium with swabs) were kept at 4°C and tested within 24 hours by the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag, which is a lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay that uses a dual-color system for the qualitative detection of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen from NP swab specimens. The recommended specimen volume of the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag kit was 90 to 150 μL. To unify the specimen volume, a 100 μL specimen volume average was used.All statistical calculations were done using SPSS software version 18 under Windows 7. Qualitative data were statistically expressed in the form of frequency and percentages. Numerical data were statistically represented in terms of range, mean, and standard deviation. The Pearson χ 2 and t-test were used for comparing categorical variables. A probability value (P value) >.05 was considered significant.A total of 310 specimens were included. Of those, 188 were RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 122 were RT-PCR-negative. Among tested patients, 59.4% were men and the median age was 42 years. Positive specimens from patients were taken during the initial phase of the disease with a median duration of symptoms of 3 days. The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of positive RT-PCR specimens was 20.2 (range, 15.8-32.3) ( Table 1) .The overall sensitivity of the evaluated RAD test was 43.1%. The sensitivity was significantly increased in the subgroup of specimens with Ct values <25.5, indicating high viral loads ( Table 2 ). All false negative results according to the RAD test (n = 107) corresponded to specimens with Different diagnostic test manufacturers have developed rapid tests based on SARS-CoV-2 protein detection in respiratory specimens. 7 The analytical performances of rapid antigen tests depend on different factors including the viral load, the quality of the specimen, and the setting of the people tested.Rapid tests have different advantages, including low cost, short turnaround time, simple noncomplicating test performance, and the lack of a need for special equipment or skills compared with molecular techniques. 10 In this study, we assessed the performance characteristics of the rapid antigen test BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens and compared the results with RT-PCR testing. Our data indicated that (i) RAD testing for SARS-CoV-2 had a lower sensitivity than RT-PCR testing, (ii) negative results could not exclude the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection with confidence, and (iii) therefore, results should be confirmed by further RT-PCR testing. We also noted that the RAD test can detect SARS-CoV-2 with a high viral load (Ct <25.5), but the sensitivity declines substantially when the viral load decreases with Ct values >28, which is often the case in patients with COVID-19. In this study, the overall sensitivity of the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag test was 43.1%. A similar study revealed an overall sensitivity of 30.2% in 106 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive specimens. 6 Although the RAD test was positive for corresponding RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection, we recommend checking the specificity more by using the RAD test for other viruses that could cross-react with other human coronaviruses, eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which can each cause severe acute respiratory illnesses because of their genetic relationship with SARS-CoV-2.In summary and based on our data, the application of the RAD test alone in clinical settings is not recommended in favor of continued molecular diagnostics and should not be considered for use in the screening of asymptomatic individuals or for population-based surveillance studies. However, the balance between cost, turnaround time, ease of performance, and sensitivity in adopting an antigenbased assay should be considered in symptomatic patients with a high pretest probability of having COVID-19. The use of these tests should be considered when there is a need for immediate clinical decisions and infection control measures, and negative results in this scenario should be confirmed with a laboratory-based molecular test.

The virus was believed to be originated in bats and its mode of transmission to humans is definitely unknown. The disease is transmitted by droplets of respiratory discharges or contact with contaminated surfaces. It presents with fatigue, malaise, fever, cough, sore throat and difficult breathing. Many people are asymptomatic, most of cases are mild and some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ dysfunction. The case fatality rate varies from 0.13% to 4.34% according to patients' registries of different countries [1, 2] .Detection of the virus in respiratory secretions by PCR confirms the diagnosis. There is no specific treatment and treatment is essentially supportive. Severe cases need intensive care with artificial ventilation. Prevention entails social distancing, isolation of both suspected and symptomatic cases as well as infection control practices at health facilities [3] . Case definitions are important for E-mail address: ahgilany@gmail.com surveillance purposes; however it does not replace epidemiologic or clinical assessment and management of individual patient [4] .Caseness (also called case definition, clinical definition, or clinical case definition) in epidemiology is a set of diagnostic features used to make decision as to whether the subject is diseased or not. This can be based on clinical, laboratory and/or epidemiological criteria with the consideration of place, time and person [5] [6] [7] . In epidemiology the case definition is broader than the clinical definition as a variety of criteria can be used to define cases in epidemiology [8] .Standard case definition is applying a standardized set of criteria to identify a particular disease [6] . This standardization ensures that all cases are diagnosed in the same way, irrespective of time, place and person. This should not rely on laboratory detection of the organism alone, as some organisms may be present without disease [9] [10] [11] .Case is a person who has the particular disease which meets the case definition for surveillance and epidemic investigation purposes. This can differ from the ordinary clinical definition [5] . Patient is a person who receives health care according to his/her needs. Most patients are classified as having a disease, illness or sickness. Sometimes patients are not diseased e.g. seeking vaccination, family planning or routine periodic health check-up [12, 13] .Disease is the pathological changes or deviation from the normal biology, most often physical and sometimes psychiatric. It is an objective term diagnosed by health care personnel and includes a specific diagnosis based on systematic and standardized codes [12] .Illness is a subjective experience of a disease or illness based on subjective feelings and symptoms, sometimes no disease can be diagnosed. It is entirely personal and is not related to a stage of infectiousness [12] . It is an absence of wellness as perceived by the subject or others [14] .Sickness is the external aspect of ill-health. It is the social function an ill or sick person takes or is given in community, in different life situations [15, 16] .Case classification Gradients of being a case (suspected, probable or confirmed). This is used where early case reporting is important and where definite diagnoses is difficult (e.g. laboratory confirmation) [5] such as in COVID-19 in poor countries that lack diagnostic facilities.Modifying case definitions Case definitions can be refined or changed over time as more information becomes available. For new communicable diseases such as COVID-19, it is preferred to use sensitive case definition to identify every possible case. These changes include a adding new laboratory criteria, suspected and probable case definition as two different levels (rather than a single level), and a new epidemiological criterion. A major issue of changing case definition has a tremendous impact on case numbers and case ascertainment. It causes confusion in classifying cases and increases the burden of managing non-cases. Optimal case definition can vary from locality to another depending on the diagnostic facilities [16] [17] [18] .Ideally case definition should be simple, clear, appropriate, concise, sensitive, specific and easy to apply to whole population of concern. Patients fulfilling the definition can be categorized as suspected, probable or confirmed [7] .Balancing sensitivity and specificity is crucial in case definition. A broad or loose definition is a sensitive one so as to catch all or most of the true cases as it focuses on clinical criteria. This is associated with high both true positive and false negative rates. On the other hand, specific definition is a strict one to be sure that any subject identified really had the disease as it relies on laboratory confirmation. This minimize both the false positive and the true positive rates [9, 10, 19, 20] .The benefits and limitations of case definition in practice depend on their purpose, the skills of the user and the context in which they are used. Case definition is used for [7, 9, [21] [22] [23] [24] : 1) surveillance as it forms the basis for any efforts at case search and is an essential epidemiologic surveillance, consistency and comparability in reporting, tracking the presence and distribution of cases in a given locality; 2) clinical care: early case finding and isolation of those with extremely infectious diseases are important for timely initiation treatment and control of further transmission of the infection. 3) research: all research on the diseases depends on the selecting a reliable and valid definitions in order to measure morbidity and mortality rates accurately and to detect biological markers.Case definition is important in all types of epidemiological and clinical studies. Ideal case definition is problematic with the lack of a valid gold standard test [17] . 4) service provision: development of a lucid case definition is crucial to effective investigation of epidemics. The use of a common case definition helps in standardization of the cases both within a current epidemic investigation and perhaps between outbreaks that differ over time or place. 5) Standardized case definitions will improve the quality of data reported in any the national infectious diseases notification [25] .Cases of disease can be classified into overlapping and nonmutually exclusive types and each type has utility in different settings [26] . This is applicable to COVID-19. The following is a brief description of each type of case definition:There is confusion between the three terms and often used synonymously. Actually they have different definitions.-Patient (case) zero is a term used to describe the first human infected by a disease, it may be diagnosed or not. Finding the patient zero will allow medics to determine where it came from. While, index case (patient) is defined as the first reported case of the disease that is diagnosed by clinician or epidemiologist. On the other hand the primary case is a person who gets the disease from an exposure and is the first case in the population. It is not always the index case [8, [27] [28] [29] . Tracing back to the index case it is very difficult particularly if it had a mild disease. Knowing the patient Zero in an outbreak like coronavirus is paramount to trace the origin and exact initial genetic structure of the virus and identify the exact lineage of transmission. Also it helps to find if there has been a change in the genetic structure of the virus [30] . Earlier cases may be found and are labeled primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. Many epidemics of the emerging infectious diseases begin with a single case contracting an infection. It is notable that knowing the origin of an epidemic (i.e. zero/primary case) does not elucidate their cause [31] . Identifying patient zero is important both epidemiologically and politically [32] . The origin of COVID-19 has already caused a diplomatic spat between the US and China.Is a person who gets a disease from exposure to a diseased person, or primary case, rather than the epidemic source itself (e.g. home contacts who get infected) [29] .Missed case is a subject having an infectious disease with minimal symptoms and signs and does not seek medical advice or the health care provider fails to diagnosis it [33] .A clinically compatible case has the medical history, signs and/or symptoms that agree with the clinical description of the disease [33] , and its specific clinical criteria are included in the case classification [34] . It is a general clinical impression that this is a case of disease [26] .This is a case in contact with a diseased person or exposed to environmental source together with possibility of acquiring infection by the known methods of spread [26, [33] [34] [35] [36] .In latent diseases the causal pathogens remain dormant for extended periods of time with no active replication. Herpes simplex viruses, varicella-zoster virus can reactivate to become active infections during stress and immunosuppression [37] . It is not clear whether COVID-19 remains latent then reactivates.It is possible that a large proportion of the population will have COVID-19 yet have no symptoms at all, especially in the children and young age groups. Figures up to 80% have been reported [38] [39] [40] . Some asymptomatic cases will become symptomatic over the next week (known as pre-symptomatic) [39] . Asymptomatic spread of the COVID-19 is of concern. Many researchers believe that asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 could be an important source of spread [40] [41] [42] . Asymptomatic infections are to be regarded as cases, if the infection has public health or therapeutic implications [35] .It is not clear if patients recovered from COVID-19 can be reinfected. Some recovered patients fulfilling the discharge criteria may become positive again for COVID-19 RNA [43] . There are few case reports of individual confirmed cases whose oropharyngeal swab test turned positive in convalescence and they recommended active surveillance of COVID-19 RNA for infectivity assessment [43, 44] . There are several possible explanations. The remaining viruses in patients reactivate due to lack of sufficient immunity or the immune weakened after recovery or the virus stayed dormant before reactivating. Another possibility is the reinfection through another virus [45] . However, there is no current evidence of reinfection with the virus after recovery. Viral RNA shedding declines with symptoms resolution, and may continue for few weeks [46] . However, clinical recovery has been associated with the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies, a signal of immunity [47, 48] .is not yet available to classify it as confirmed, probable or not a case [49, 50] .It is an individual (or a group of individuals) who have signs and symptoms of the disease yet has not been diagnosed as having the disease [51] . This is a case with lower certainty and is classified as suspected for surveillance purposes. It has the clinical criteria mentioned in the case definition but lacks epidemiological or laboratory evidence of the disease. This definition has high sensitivity and low specificity. This allows for finding of most cases however, some false positives cases will be included [25, 26, 29, 33, 35] .The suspected case of COVID-19 is defined as ""a patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of cough, shortness of breath) AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset; OR a patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; OR a patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that fully explains the clinical presentation"" [50] . Suspected cases that are not tested should be isolated either at home or isolation institution till 48 h after resolving symptoms for at least 10 days after onset [50, 51] .Probable case is a suspected case plus supportive laboratory results or epidemiologic link [29] and is classified as probable for surveillance purposes [25, 26, 33, 35, 50] .Presumptive or supportive laboratory results: Specified laboratory findings that are consistent with the diagnosis but do not fulfill the criteria of laboratory confirmation [33] .In the probable case of COVID-19 laboratory testing is not conclusive or was not done for any reason.A subject with fever (>38 C) and/or cough plus one of the following within two weeks before the onset of illness: travel to an infected area or contact with a probable or confirmed case or contact with a person with acute respiratory symptoms who has been in an infected area with unavailable, negative or inclusive laboratory testing of COVID-19 [4, 25, 51] .A case that is classified as definitive for surveillance purposes and is laboratory confirmed by one or more tests and may fulfill the described clinical case definition or not. This definition should have high specificity and less sensitivity; so that most of the cases will be true positive and some will be missed [25, 26, 34, 35] .A confirmed case of COVID-19 is a case with laboratory confirmation of infection using a real-time PCR or nucleic acid sequencing on at least one specific target genome performed at a reference laboratory (Canada MOH, 2020) irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. If testing is unavailable or limited, confirmed case counts will not reflect the true burden of disease [51, 52] .Laboratory definitive evidence requires detection of COVID-19 from a clinical specimen using a validated PCR, and/or significant rise in IgG antibody level to COVID-19 between paired sera (if serological testing is available) [50] . Although other laboratory methods can be used in clinical diagnosis, only tests approved in the standard definition are accepted for national surveillance system [26, 33] . Based on the evolving situation with COVID-19 there is no longer a Presumptive Confirmed Case definition for surveillance purposes [49, 53] .An 'under investigation' case that has a negative test and has been failed to fulfill the criteria for a possible, suspect, probable or confirmed case. A summary of diagnoses for discarded cases should be made routinely [10, 34, 50] .In the early phase of COVID-19 spread with little number of cases and little burden on health facilities and maximum capacity of laboratory testing patients may be discharged to home based on clinical improvement and laboratory tests. The clinical criteria include absence of fever for more than three days, disappearance of respiratory symptoms and resolution of pulmonary inflammation as evidenced by imaging with no need for hospital care of other morbidities. The laboratory evidences of recovery include viral clearance in respiratory specimens; 2-4 negative PCR tests for nasopharyngeal swabs with ≥ 24 h apart; as well as appearance of specific IgG when serological test is available. When deciding on criteria for hospital discharge of COVID-19 cases consider the epidemiological situation, the existing capacity of the healthcare facilities and the diagnostic laboratory resources [54] . The WHO defined the criteria for release from isolation for symptomatic patients as 10 days after symptom onset, plus at least 3 days without symptoms (without fever and respiratory symptoms) and for asymptomatic patients as 10 days after test positive [55] .15-Severe and critical case: The WHO [55] defined severe COVID-19 as cases with severe pneumonia. However Zhang et al. [56] defined severe cases as having at least one of the following: respiratory rate ≥ 30/min; oxygen saturation ≤ 93% at rest; and oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg. The WHO [55] defined critical cases as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and or septic shock. While Zhang et al. [56] defined critical cases as having septic shock, respiratory failure, and/or multi-organ dysfunction or failure.There is a continuous and ongoing change in the epidemiological, clinical and diagnostic criteria of COVID-19. Ma et al. [57] have been analyzed the seven versions of China's national guidelines. These included changes of case classification, in ""suspected case,"" in ""confirmed case,"" in clinical classifications, and in ""severe case"".Case definition, among others, is an important factor that determines the number of COVID-19 cases. Variable case definition contributes to failure of progress in prevention and control of the disease. Failure to agree on a precise definition reduces the efforts of aligning findings from epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers, and subsequently hinders progress towards improving outcomes. A standard case definition is essential for understanding the epidemiology and impact of any disease. In addition, it is important for education (of epidemiologists, scientists, and providers) as well as for benchmarking the quality of patient's care [58] .Reporting and research on COVID-19 focus on laboratoryconfirmed cases and do not include suspected and probable cases [59] . In China on 13 February 2020 there was a single day steep increase of 13,332 COVID-19 cases due to broadening of case definition to include clinically confirmed cases (based on chest imaging without laboratory conformation) together with the confirmed cases [60] . Tsang et al. [61] examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in China during the first epidemic wave. They reported that the case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases (especially milder cases and those without epidemiological links). Thus the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 7.1 times. They recommended that these changes should be considered when making inferences on epidemic curves, doubling times and the reproductive number.A significant proportion of cases are currently undiagnosed in many countries. This is attributed to many factors. The variability of case definitions, the populations that are screened and timeline of the outbreak, testing techniques and interpretation of laboratory results will affect the number of cases enumerated. In early phases of the epidemic there was a restrictive case definition of ""suspect cases"", with scarcity of laboratory test kits and testing was limited to ""suspect cases"". Thus fewer laboratory tests are done with few confirmed cases and many undiagnosed cases. With increased capability to do laboratory tests, more people were screened and the number of confirmed cases increased. The technical considerations of laboratory testing that affect the accuracy of disease counts include: specimen collection (variable collection methods); samples collected (from upper or lower respiratory tract), time of collection in relation to course of disease, different laboratory kits and test methods; trained manpower, approved laboratories and sensitivity of the test [62] .Despite the availability of excellent diagnostic techniques of symptomatic COVID-19 patients in well-equipped laboratories; gaps still exist in screening asymptomatic people who are incubating the virus, and in the determination of live viral shedding during convalescence to end isolation [63] .The current diagnosis of COVID-19 infection relies mainly on the centralized laboratory-based RT-PCR. It provides a relatively rapid result (within 3-4 h), it is limited by transportation to the laboratory and the requirement to batch samples in a large run. Public health sectors are in need for fast and reliable tests for COVID-19. Furthermore, a negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test is insufficient to rule out COVID-19. Thus, over-reliance on the results of the test may be dangerous, and the push for widespread testing may be overstated. The exact sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 are unknown and it appears that a positive test is highly suggestive of true COVID-19, but a negative test does not rule out the disease [64] .There is a marked variability in the concepts of case definitions of COVID-19. Awareness of health care providers about these terms and the correct application are essential steps for surveillance and proper management of the COVID-19 pandemic.No funding sources.None declared.Not required.","Egypt","first author","2020-12-09",12

We shall attempt to give an analytical form of the different data by comparing the predictions of three models:-A cubic polynomial which has described successfully the small phase of the pandemic (Narison, 2020) :-An hybrid-exponential Model, hereafter named Large Population Semi-Gaussian (LPE-SG) Model (Maltezos, 2020 ) (see also (Ziff and Ziff, 2020) ):where: a s ≡ A is an arbitrary amplitude, b s ≡ n the degree of the model and c s ≡ τ the mean infection time from which one can deduce the position of the peak x p = b s c s .-A Gaussian-like Model (Barmparis and Tsironis, 2020) :where: a g , b g , c g are the height, position and width of the Gaussian.N I c,d / D I c,d is the cumulative / daily number of infected persons while the coefficients: a i , b i , c i and d i will be determined from the fitting procedure.Most epidemiological models for studying the pandemic are based on the classic Susceptible-Infected Recovered (SIR) model introduced in Ref. (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) or on its extension, namely the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) or / and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) models and some other variants (in addition to (Narison, 2020; Maltezos, 2020; Ziff and Ziff, 2020 ; Barmparis and Tsironis, 2020) , see e.g.: (Dehning et al., n.d.; Ratsimbarison, n.d.; Hattaf et al., 2013; Li et al., 2002; Liu et al., n.d.; Mo et al., n.d.; Sardar et al., n.d.; Savi et al., n.d.; Carcione et al., n.d.; Anastassopoulou et al., n.d.; Siettos and Russo, n.d.; Vasquez, 2006) . SIR is described by the set of coupled differential equations:where S(t), I(t) and R(t) are respectively the number of suppress, infected and recovered persons as a function of the time t. N = S + I + R is the size of the system / population assumed to be constant with time.The parameters of the SRI model are the: -Constant transmission rate a.-Constant recovering rate β ≡ 1/τ R where τ R is the mean recovering time.-Basic reproduction number R 0 ≡ aτ R . In the following, R 0 and the effective reproduction number R eff will be identified as:In the LPE-SG model, R eff can be parametrized as (Maltezos, 2020) :where β can be fitted from the data through τ R .The data from (Ratsimbarison, n.d.; National Radio-Television Malagasy, n.d.; WHO's national agency, 2020) are shown in Fig. 1a ) for the absolute number of infected persons and in Fig. 1b) for the ratio ℜ c I/T defined in Eq. 1. One can notice that the shape of the two curves shown in Figs.1 are quite similar expect at the period after the peak of the 2nd phase of the pandemic, where the ratio shows clearly the decline of the pandemic. This (surpising) feature indicates that the number of tests affects only slightly the behaviour of the evolution of the pandemic.The daily behaviour of the ratio ℜ d I/T defined in Eq. 2 is shown in Fig. 2: a) The first months behaviour until 7th May; b) the second phase behaviour from 7th May until 12th September.One can notice from the previous figures that there are two phases: -Small or Epidemic phase until 48 days (7th May).-Large or Pandemic Phase after 7th May. We shall see later on that these two phases can be subvided into two phases ⊕ a background phase from 7th to 31th May.Detailed analysis and a comparison of different models can be consulted in (Narison, 2020) . One can deduce, from the analysis done there, that the peak (stability of the cumulative number of infected persons) is reached for 25 to 30 days after the beginning of the pandemic (stability). The two models LPE-SG and Gaussian-like models according to the parameters fitted in this paper gives a value around 40 days which is still compatible with the data though in the higher sides.A similar analysis is repeated here but with the ratio of the cumulative number of infected persons over the cumulative number of tests. The results of the fit are given in Fig. 3a) where the corresponding best fit parameters are:-Cubic Polynomial (Narison, 2020) :where one finds:-LPE-SG Model (Maltezos, 2020) :with:-Gaussian-like model (Barmparis and Tsironis, 2020) :with: From the previous analysis, one can see that the cubic polynomial finds a maximum peak around the 30th day, the LPE-SG model around 15 days and the Gaussian-like one around 40 days. The results from the cubic polynomial and Gaussian-like model are consistent with the absolute one obtained in (Narison, 2020) , while the one from LPE-SG is much lower (perhaps) indicating that the Model is not quite appropriate for analyzing the ratio ℜ c I/T .Similar analysis is done for the daily ratio which is shown in Fig. 3 . The parameters fit are:-Cubic Polynomial (Narison, 2020) :-LPE-SG Model (Maltezos, 2020) :-Gaussian-like model (Barmparis and Tsironis, 2020):From the previous analysis, one can see that the cubic polynomial and the LPE-SG model find a maximum peak around the (14-17)th day while the Gaussian-like model peak is around 46 days (not shown in the figure).Comparing the results from the cumulative and daily ratios, one can see that the LPE-SG prediction of the peak position is almost the same (15-17)th day for the cumulative and daily ratios, the cubic polynomial predicts a peak around (14-28)th day and the Gaussin-like around (28-46)th day. One can also notice from Fig. 3b ) that the 3 models do not give a good prediction of the intensity of the daily peak unless considering that the three data points shown there around (15-20)th days are statistical flucuations. This discrepancy is less pronounced for the cumulative ratio shown in Fig. 3a ). Analogous observation on the imprecision of models to predict the intensity of the peak has been discussed in Ref. (Roda et al., 2020) for the case of the Wuhan pandemic. 5. Before the 2nd peak: 07/05/2020 to 12/08/2020The result of the analysis is shown in Fig. 4 .-Cubic Polynomial (Narison, 2020) :-LPE-SG Model (Maltezos, 2020) :-Gaussian-like model (Barmparis and Tsironis, 2020) :From the previous parameters, one finds that the LPE-SG model finds a peak around b s × c s ≈ 126 days, while the Gaussian-like model finds a gaussian centered at 109 days which are compatible. One can notice that the cubic polynomial gives a good fit of the data but cannot predict a peak.Doing a similar analysis for the ratio ℜ c I/T , we show in Fig. 4 the fit from the cubic polynomial with the parameters:We do not show the fits from the two models LPE-SG and Gaussianlike which are not good and which lead to unrealistic values of the fitted parameters.One can notice that the fit from the 2 models are less good here than in the absolute case shown in Fig. 4 .After the peak, one can see that the total number of infected persons increase linearly as:which corresponds to an increase of about 72 infected persons / day, while the ratio ℜ c I/T decreases slightly as:corresponding to -0.05% infected person per day. It indicates that the cumulative number of infected persons decreases slowly when the cumulative number of tests increases which is a clear signal that the pandemic is decreasing.7. Fit of the 2nd phase from 07/05/2020 to 28/08/2020Here, we redo the analysis but for a global fit of the 2nd phase. The fitted parameters are:The analysis is shown in Fig. 5 .-Cubic olynomial:-LPE-SG Model:-Gaussian-like Model:The polynomial fit shows a maximum around 150 days. The LPE-SG Model indicates a peak around: b s × c s ≃ 126 days, while the Gaussian is centered at 109 days. These predictions are compatible each others.The results from different models are shown in Fig. 5 which correspond to the parameters:-Cubic Polynomial (Narison, 2020) :Fit of the absolute cumulative # of data in Fig. 1a ) from 50 days to 100 days; b) same as in a) but for the ratio. The legends are the same as in Fig. 1 . -Gaussian-like model (Barmparis and Tsironis, 2020): a g = 27.31; b g = 106.82; c g = 46.01.One can deduce from the analysis that the cubic polynomial fit and the Gaussian-like model indicate a peak around (105-107) days i.e. on (3-7) th of July, while the values of the LPE-SG fitted parameters are not conclusive when analyzing the ratio ℜ c I/T . However, if we start the analysis from 15th June (origin of the xaxis), we obtain a much better fit (see Fig. 6 ) with reasonnable values of the fitted parameters:-Cubic Polynomial (Narison, 2020) :-LPE-SG Model (Maltezos, 2020) :-Gaussian-like model (Barmparis and Tsironis, 2020):a g = 27.72; b g = 65.08; c g = 37.52.The three appraoches predict a peak around the (65-70)th day i.e. around (19-24)th August 2020.We analyze these quantities using the definition proposed in (Fraser, 2020) based on a SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) , where the discrete instantaneous reproduction number is:I i is the number of infected persons at a time t i which follows a Poisson distribution; w i is the measures of infectiousness with the properties: 0 ≤ w i ≤ 1 and ∑ w i = 1.We attempt to provide a lower bound on R 0 by using the data reported on the first four days from 19/03/20 to 22/03/2020 where the daily infections are respectively 3,0,0 and 9. Using these data and the properties of w i , one can deduce:The bound is rather weak but may reflect the epidemic (not yet a pandemic) nature of the disease. It may be also useful to improve the accuracy of predictions of R 0 from some other models.Considering that the result from the 1st week is statistically poor, one can deduce from Fig. 7 the rough estimate from the beginning of the 2nd week:Using the previous SIR-like model, we attempt to extract the instantaneous / effective reproduction number R eff for an interval period of about one week. We show the results in Fig. 7 . The large error bars take into account the low and high values of the predictions obtained in (Ratsimbarison, n.d.). In the dashed region, we show the tentative weighted average:where its relatively low value may indicate that this first phase is still an epidemic but not yet a pandemic period.We have noticed in the previous analysis that the LPE-SG model fitted parameters are very sensitive to the starting / ending points of the data. The reason is that the model is asymmetric contrary to the gaussian-like model and the cubic polynomial. Therefore, for better exploiting this model, it is more convenient to divide the total period of the pandemic into 3 phases (see Fig. 8 ):-The 1st phase for the first 2 months until 2nd May (epidemic).-The phase between 2nd May to 15th June (background), which is below the pandemic threshold where the data fluctuate eventually showing the beginning of the pandemic. It can be considered as a continuation of the 1st phase.-The 2nd phase from 15/06/20 to 12/09/20 (real pandemic).We show in Fig. 9 the predictions of the LPE-SG model corresponding to the parameters: which give:The position of the peak around 12 days is consistent with the one obtained in Fig. 3 by a direct fitting of the data from which one can deduce a more precise value of R 0 than in the previous Eq. 41:This value is comparable with the mean value of R eff from SIR-like model in Eq. 35.We study in Fig. 10 the behaviour of R eff using the daily ratio of corrected data.-We show in Fig. 11 the predictions of the LPE-SG model using raw daily reported data. It corresponds to the parameters: n = 4.15, τ = 8.25 days, β = 0.10 days − 1 ,where β ≡ 1/τ R is the inverse of the meaning recovering time τ R . It leads to:-We redo the analysis but for the 2nd phase from 15th June until 12th September. Unlike the previous analysis leading to Eq. 41, we use the raw data corrected by daily tests. We show in Fig. 12 It leads to: The green curve is the moving average of R eff every 13 days. This time period has been used as an optimum average. and a peak around 34 days from 15th June i.e. 121 days in total (19th July). However, the peak is obtained earlier than in Fig. 6 from a direct fit of the data and using different models.-Starting with a well adjusted value β = 0.075 days − 1 , we show in Fig. 12a ) the raw data of daily infected I(t) persons (red open connected circles) and the one of cured / recoverded (green open connected circles) as function of time.-The same data are shown in Fig. 12b ) but after a low pass filter obtained using Matlab alogrithm which is expected to reduce the statistical (stochastic) variations of the data. The full blue connected circles show the prediction of R eff using Eq. 8.-It is important to observe that the data of R(t) -the green oneafter the 40th day diverges from the expected one based on the theory of SIR. This underestimated values can be explained either due to the way of counting the recovered (cured) people, or the rate β is a function of time and has been changed (decreased) suddenly for unknown reasons, leading to a serious discrepancy from the basic SIR model.-We show in Fig. 13 the predicted values of R eff as function of the number of days using the daily infected data (open red circles) given in Fig. 12 . One can notice like in the previous sections that the analysis from the LPE-SG models are quite sensitive to the starting and ending points where the results are very inaccurate. Around (35-45) days, the values of R eff pass below one and reach a minimum around the 60th day. However, the increases above the 60th day which can be due to the nonmonotonic decrease of the data beyond this date (Fig. 12 ) deserves more attention.-We compare the results of R eff with the ones from Imperial College (Watson, n.d.) shown in Fig. 14 . One can notice a good agreement of the SIR-like model predictions in Fig. 7 (2nd column) within the errors with the ones from (Watson, n.d.) (3rd column): Fig. 11 . Fit of the daily a) and cumulated b) reported data for infected persons using LPE-SG model from 15th June to 12th September. -For the 2nd phase shown in Fig. 13 from the LPE-SG model, one can notice a good agreement with the ones from Imperial College in Fig. 14 (Watson, n.d.) . We deduce from Fig. 13 :for the 2nd phase.-We consider the case of Greece and Switzerland as these countries has relatively few numbers of population (≈10.42 billion for Greece and 8.57 billion for Swizerland) which may be comparable with the one of Madagascar (≈27.69 billion) We show the value of R eff obtained using the same LPE-SG model in Fig. 15 where one can notice that the value of R eff as a function of time are lower in Madagascar than that in Greece (GR) at the first outbreak of COVID-19:-We show in Fig. 16 the results for R eff for different African countries including Madagascar from Imperial College studies where one can notice that the prediction:agrees with our tentative average 〈R eff 〉 ≃ (1.06 ± 0.18) of the first phase in Eq. 36 from a SIR-like model but smaller than the one from the LPE-SG model of about 2. This difference indicates the difficulty of each model to provide an accurate prediction, a point discussed in (Roda et al., 2020) .The data on the absolute # of deaths are shown in Fig. 17 . A cubic polynomial fit which smears the data is also shown. The parameters fit are: One can notice that the (officially declared) absolute cumulative number of deaths are hopefully small. However, the unofficial observation of the population does not support this small number and needs more clarifications.We show in Fig. 18 the per cent cumulative number of cured persons relative to the one of the infected persons. Looking at the behaviour of the number of cured persons which reflects the performance of the medical cares, one can notice that:• On the first 48th day, the medical care performance was quite good due mainly to the few numbers of infected persons.• On the 48th day when the new pandemic phase has started and where the number of infected persons has jumped, the medical care performance has decreased until the 80th day. It has indicated the limitation of the hospital equipment and the way to face the pandemics. Notice that the miraculous Covid-organics (CVO) treatment using artemisia leaves mixed with some other traditional plants (white eucalyptus and ravintsara leaves) to cure the pandemic has been officially announced with great fanfare by the Republic President on 29th april was not helpful and inefficient.• From the 80th day (8th June), the care performance started to increase and becomes excellent after the 150th day just beyond the peak for infected persons around the 110 days (8th July). Many possible effects may have contributed to this success such as the:-Uses of the Prof. Didier Raoult protocol based on hydroxychloroquine and azythromycine.-More strict sanitary measures (respect of social distancing, masks, …) including confinement.-Obtention of more medical equipment thanks to the call of the former health minister, … -Relative decrease of the number of infected persons when approaching the peak.We have scrutinized the spread of COVID-19 in Madagascar from its beginning to the present day (12th September 2020) where the work has been finalized. We summarize our analysis below:• We have introduced the ratio ℜ c I/T which is the ratio of cumulative number of infected persons over the total number of tests and the analogue daily ratio ℜ d I/T in order to avoid the dependence of the results on the number of tests, as the existing analysis based on the absolute numbers of the infected persons is often criticized on its dependence on the number of tests. However, a comparison of the results from the absolute numbers with the one from the ratio (hopefully and surprisingly) shows that the results are (almost) independent on the number of tests.• We have also shown that the COVID-19 in Madagascar can be split into three phases: the small phase until 43th days called epidemic where the peak is reached around the (15-28)th day, the transition background phase from 7th May to 15th June and the large phase (real pandemic) beyond 15th June where the peak is reached around the end of August 2020. We have noticed that the gaussian-like and the polynomial fit is not sensitive to the background effect while the LPE-SG does at the starting and ending points of the analysis.• We have performed our analysis using three independent approaches: a simple cubic polynomial fit, a semi-Gaussian and Gaussianlike models. All aproaches give (almost) consistent predictions of the peak for the absolute cumulative number of infected persons, while for the LPE-SG model to give realistic predictions for the ratio ℜ c,d I/T , the analysis should be done in the large second phase (3rd period).• We have used a SIR-like and the LPE-SG models to predict the reproduction numbers R eff where we found that the results present large uncertainties both for the small first and large second phases. The difficulty to reach accurate predictions for different models have been discussed in (Roda et al., 2020) . However, we found that the value of R 0 is relatively low explaining the small number of the infected persons.• As the pandemic is approaching the ending phase, we do not expect that the results obtained in this paper until 12th september will be affected by the new results not included in the analysis. We expect that the evolution of the cumulative number of infected persons will follow the straightline predicted in Fig. 4 . September. The oliva curve is a smearing of the data with a cubic polynomial. The legends are the same as in Fig. 1.   Fig. 18 .

Some factors as the eventual origin of this success have been enumerated previously. However, despite this success, the social and economical conditions of the population induced by ths pandemic are enormous. The often raised ""big question"" without any clear and convincing answer from the government is the opaque management of the international donated funds dedicated to save the present social and economical situations caused by this pandemic.• One can finally notice that during the completion of this work, a new cluster of the pandemic has been detected in the north of Madagascar especially in the small tourstic island of Nosy-Be which may have been induced after the international opening of the airport for tourists.","Madagascar","abstract","2020-12-05",12

The family has four genera: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. From these genera, beta and alpha CoVs infect human beings. Even though most CoVs infection causes a mild symptom, the infection of the two beta CoVs, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), caused greater than 10,000 cases with mortality rates of 37% for MERS-CoV and 10% for SARS-CoV. [1] [2] [3] Unexpectedly, the world has faced a severe public health problem due to the current pandemic of atypical pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 disease, an acute pulmonary syndrome characterized by dry cough, fever, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, dyspnea, and atypical pneumonia. In the severe state, SARS-CoV-2 causes cute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ie, a lung inflammation that causes fluid accumulation that leads to septic shock due to decreased blood pressure and oxygen starvation. 4, 5 The World health organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11 th , 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak spread all over the world with more than 62,730,726 confirmed cases and 1,459,317 confirmed deaths worldwide as of November 30th, 2020. 6 CoVs are enveloped plus single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA viruses. CoVs have the largest genomes (29.9-kilobase) among the known RNA viruses with several open reading frames (ORFs). 7 The two ORF (ORF1a/ORF1b) in combination contain two-thirds of the viral genome which directly encodes two polyproteins; namely, pp1a and pp1ab using host cell protein translation machinery. These polyproteins further processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) by viral proteases enzymes like papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Most nsps involved in the synthesis viral RNA. These nsps are Mpro, cleaves viral polyprotein (nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), RNA binding protein (nsp12), primase (nsp8), exoribonuclease (nsp14), endoribonuclease (nsp15), RNA helicase (nsp13) and 2_-O-methyltransferase (nsp16) which are important for viral replication. The remaining ORFs posses one-third of the viral genome like SARS and MERS translates the four structural proteins and the accessory proteins. 8, 9 Spike protein (S) is a transmembrane protein, lies as a trimer on the virion surface, giving the virion a ""corona"" or crown-like appearance. S protein facilitates the virus's entrance into Type II pneumocyte through interaction with the ACE2 receptor. S protein is the most immunodominant proteins of the viruses that can induce the host immune response. It has two domains, S1 and S2 domain. S1 domain helps in host receptor binding while; S2 domain is responsible for the fusion of the viral membrane with the infected cell. The former (S1) contains two subdomains, namely the N-terminal domain (NTD) and Cterminal domain (CTD) which act as the receptor-binding domains interacting with the host receptors. The S1 CTD contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD). [10] [11] [12] M protein is the most abundant structural protein that gives a definite shape to the virus. M protein induces the suppression of the IFN-I transcription along with nsp-1 that break down the host's mRNA. M protein has a vital role in the intracellular formation of virus particles without S protein. In the presence of Tunicamycin, coronavirus produces noninfectious virion that has M protein but without S protein. 13 The E protein is the smallest structural protein that has a vital role in the pathogenesis, assembly, and exocytosis of the new virion. Inactivation of E protein affects the virulence of CoVs. The nucleocapsid (N) protein affects complex formation with viral genome, facilitates M protein interaction during assembly, and enhances transcription of the viral genome. Several studies proposed that both the structural and non-structural proteins act as promising novel targets to develop a new drug. 14 Currently, there is no known antiviral agent approved for the management of COVID-19 disease. However, several studies are undergoing to develop an effective and safe drug to control COVID-19 disease. 15, 16 Currently, the management of severe COVID-19 cases mainly focused on symptomatic management and supportive care. According to World health organization guidelines, a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus managed with supportive care like adequate nutrition, bed rest, prevention of dehydration, and antibiotics. World health organization endorses extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for patients presenting with refractory hypoxemia. 17, 18 Preventive measures such as social distancing, maintenance of good immunity, use of masks, awareness, and maintenance of hygiene, isolation, and movement restrictions can help in control of SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading. Besides, several studies are ongoing on vaccine development, repurposing of clinically approved drugs, inhibiting enzymes used during viral replication and transcription, using convalescent plasma, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, interferon-based therapies, mAbs target host cell receptor, neutralizing antibodies, antiviral peptide act at S2 domain and natural product. 19 Potential Therapeutic Target for Drug Development for COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by high contagiousness, high morbidity, and mortality. Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, no specific antiviral drug developed for COVID-19 disease treatment so far. Many researchers proposed several therapeutic targets of the virus to discover high-efficiency, low-toxicity-targeted drugs. 20 Inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, block the host ACE2 receptor, blocking viral endocytosis, and inhibition of proteolysis of polypeptides that are involved in viral replication and proliferation are some of the proposed target sites as displayed in Figure 1 . 21, 22 But, new drug development from scratch is a long process, thus impossible to face the immediate global challenge. Drug repurposing is an submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comClinical Pharmacology: Advances and Applications 2020:12emerging strategy that provides a new treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 at a faster pace than developing a new drug. By relying on the already known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic property of the repurposed drugs, researchers gain a chance to evaluate a large number of drugs for their in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against novel targets. The repurposing method saves time and money for developing a new drug. In this context, Several Repurposed drugs evaluated and displayed antiviral effects against SARS CoV-2. 22, 23 Recombinant Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (APN01)The S protein is proposed as the main drug target for isolating CoV antiviral agent such as S protein blocker, neutralizing antibodies, S protein cleavage blocker, RBD-ACE2 interaction inhibitor, fusion inhibitor, and protease enzyme inhibitors. 11 Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane protein that is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. It is the main entry site for the SARS-CoV-2 into cells. 24 ACE2 exists in two forms; a transmembrane receptor with an extracellular domain that uses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor and as a soluble form. So inhibiting the S protein binding to the host cell ACE2 transmembrane receptor is a promising strategy against SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Emodin and promazine interrupted the binding of S protein to the host cell ACE2 receptor. The selective ACE2 inhibitor DX600 may display an effect in SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, its clinical effect in COVID-19 has not been studied. Besides, administering an excessive soluble form of ACE2 recombinant human Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (rhACE2) produced significant blockage SARS-CoV-2 entry by blocking the S protein from interacting with host ACE2 transmembrane receptor and down-regulates transmembrane ACE2 receptor that facilitate virus entry. 24,25 APN01 is a rhACE2 agent registered with a clinical trial number (NCT04335136) in Phase II to evaluate the role of rhACE2 in COVID-19 pneumonia. In a similar strategy ACE2 expressing CAR T cells as a decoy with cytotoxic targeting SARS-CoV-2 virus registered on (NCT04324996) as a phase II trial. 26, 27 Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) CQ/HCQ is an antimalarial agent used for the management of chronic Q fever and different autoimmune disorders. It has a broad-spectrum antiviral effect including SARS coronavirus, Zika virus, rabies virus, Ebola virus, poliovirus, HIV, influenza A and B, hepatitis A and C virus, Chikungunya virus, and Dengue virus. CQ/HCQ blocks the entrance, fusion, release and replication of different viruses by various modes of action. 28, 29 CQ/HCQ blocks the viral entrance by inhibiting the synthesis of sialic acids that causes suppressed binding affinity between the host ACE2 receptor and the S protein.CQ/HCQ binds with host cell sialic acids, inhibiting S protein interaction with the host cell membrane. CQ/ HCQ also blocks the endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 by suppressing the phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein. CQ/HCQ stored in endosomes, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes where it increases the pH of these acidic organelles. The increased pH inhibits aciddependent proteolytic breakdown by protease enzymes like cathepsin or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that are crucial for viral fusion and entry by endocytosis into the host cells. Recent studies showed that CQ/HCQ inhibits replication and post-translational modification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in simian Vero cells by increasing endosomal pH crucial for virus/host cell fusion. 30, 31 CQ/HCQ inhibits endosome-lysosome membrane fusion that leads to viral membrane uncoating and genome exocytosis into the host cell cytoplasm as shown in SARS-CoV. The immunomodulatory effect of CQ may also important in regulating the cytokine storm that occurs in critically ill COVID-19 patients. 31, 32 Gao et al showed that CQ has a significant effect in controlling the exacerbation of pneumonia, improves lung imaging, facilitate the virus-negative conversion, and decrease the disease course. 33 Thus, several countries initiated clinical trials to determine the efficacy of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 disease.Andrea Cortegiani et al reviewed the efficacy and safety CQ/HCQ on 32 studies (6 RCTs, 26 nonrandomized) for a total of 29,192 participants. Among 32 studies only two studies had a low risk of bias. So, the quality of these studies remains poor and data cannot be synthesized to clear conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ. Data from Low and moderate risk of bias studies proposed treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CQ/HCQ may not decrease the risk of death compared to standard care. Besides, higher dose regimens and combination with macrolide may associate with harm. Post-exposure prophylaxis with CQ/HCQ may not decrease infection rate but the quality of the study is low. 34 The Axfors et al meta-analysis, based on 28 published and unpublished RCTs, including 10,319 patients, shows that treatment with HCQ was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients, and there was no benefit from treatment with CQ. 35 Generally, the available data do not support the effectiveness of HCQ/CQ for the treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19. However, still limited number of well-powered and well-conducted observational studies, the heterogeneity of findings from observational studies, and the scant evidence from RCTspractically based on a single trial -proposed that the current data on the efficacy of HCQ/CQ in reducing mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients are not conclusive. 36Arbidol is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent marketed in Russia and China for the management and prevention of influenza virus infection. Arbidol displays antiviral effect against several RNA and DNA viruses, including SARS-CoV, Lassa virus, Chikungunya virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza type 5, poliovirus 1, hantaan virus, hepatitis B virus, and C virus. Arbidol is a haemagglutinin inhibitor that blocks the fusion of the influenza virus with the host cell membrane after endocytosis. Arbidol also induces interferon production against virus replication; enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and natural killer cells. 37, 38 A study has shown that arbidol blocks the SARS-CoV -2 virus replication at 10-30 μM concentration. 39 The structural similarities between the Arbidol binding receptor sites for SARS-CoV-2 virus S protein and H3N2 haemagglutinin proposed that Arbidol may be effective to manage COVID-19 disease. 40 Arbidol is now added to China's NHC guide for the management of COVID-19. A pilot clinical trial conducted in China showed Arbidol reduced viral load and mortality. 41 Another study with Arbidol plus lopinavir/ritonavir for 2-week treatment, 94% of the Arbidol plus lopinavir/ritonavir treated patients was negative vs 53% in the control group, and the chest tomography scans improved for 69% of the arbidol treated groups vs 29% in the control group. 42 Huang D et al conducted meta-analysis on 12 studies showed arbidol was safe and associated with a higher negative rate of PCR on day 14 in COVID-19 patients. But, it could not significantly decrease nucleus acid negative conversion time, improve symptoms, or decrease the risk of disease progression. Generally, there is no enough evidence to support the therapeutic use of arbidol for patients with COVID 19 and need to be verified in future studies. 43 Currently, several clinical trials are ongoing on the efficacy of arbidol as a single agent (NCT04255017, NCT04260594, and NCT04254874) and in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, chloroquine or carrimycin.Protease enzymes like 3CLpro and PLpro have a key role in the maturation, and replication of different viruses in the host cell. Protease also inhibits the host innate immune system. Protease inhibitors, such as diarylheptanoids, cinanserin, and flavonoids are promising agent for the submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comClinical Pharmacology: Advances and Applications 2020:12 treatment SARS-CoV-2. 28 Based on modes of infection and genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2, there are several promising repurposed agents. Most agents are in the preclinical stage to be used as anti-COVID-19 agents.LPV/r is a protease inhibitor used for management of HIV infection. Based on evidences in managing SARS-CoV during the 2003 pandemic and MERS, LPVr is supposed to manage COVID-19 patients. 44 Besides, Chu et al showed the activity of LPV/r on SARS-CoV by in vitro antiviral susceptibility testing. Hence, LPV/r was explored for the management of COVID-19 disease. A retrospective cohort study, done by Deng et al showed LPV/r with arbidol was significantly better than LPV/r alone for nasopharyngeal swab PCR conversion to negative and improvement on CT chest. 45 In another study, LPV/r was not significantly than the standard of care for the management of COVID-19. 46 Generally, the data on the therapeutic use of LPV/r for the management of COVID-19 is limited. Larger controlled clinical studies are required to determine the role of LPV/r in COVID-19 disease. Nelfinavir is another protease inhibitor that blocks SARS-CoV replication may also inhibit SAR-CoV-2 virus. 47 Darunavir is a protease inhibitor usually used in combination with ritonavir or cobicistat, for the management of HIV. The in-vitro studies proposed the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 replication. It is still under clinical trials for the effectiveness of the drug against SARS-CoV-2 virus. 48 The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to ACE2 by its S proteins to enter the host cells. 24 After binding into the ACE2 receptor, the viral S proteins require to be primed by proteases enzyme like TMPRSS2 for the viral s protein and host membranes fusion, which is crucial for the virus to infect the different cells. Hence, inhibiting the entrance of virus by inhibiting viral protease has a promising potential to identify a novel therapeutic agent. 49 The serine protease inhibitor agents such as Bromhexine, Nafamostat, Camostat, and Aprotinin inhibit TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate first developed for the management of postoperative reflux esophagitis and chronic pancreatitis significantly reduced infection with SARS-CoV-2. 25 Nafamostat mesylate is another TMPRSS2 inhibitor developed for the management of acute pancreatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and anticoagulation in extracorporeal circulation. A study done on simian Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, nafamostat mesylate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection. 50 Antivirals are the major therapeutic agent understudy for the management of COVID-19. Even if SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 82% RNA sequence, their RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) shares a 96% sequence identity. 51 Therefore, drugs inhibiting viral RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV may have promising effect on SARS-CoV-2 virus. Several nucleoside analogs agents available that inhibit RdRp including, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin, Sofosbuvir, and galidesivir showed promising in vitro effects against SARS-CoV-2 infections. 52Remdesivir is an investigational phosphoramidate prodrug of adenosine analog developed by Gilead previously evaluated to treat Ebola and now being studied in patients with COVID-19 disease. Remdesivir is a Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases inhibitor. It inhibits RNA synthesis by replacing ATP in the polymerization and thus is a wellknown premature chain terminator drug. 53 In vitro studies showed that Remdesivir is a promising antiviral agent against different viruses including, the measles virus, Ebola virus, MERS-COV, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections in cultured cells, mice, and primate models. Besides, remdesivir is active against several Covs like HCoV-NL63, HCoVOC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. 53 ,54 A recent study showed that Remdesivir inhibits viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 = 0.77 μM in Vero E6 cells). 55, 56 Wilt et al conducted a systematic review of 4 published randomized clinical trials of hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared remdesivir use for 10 days with placebo. The result showed a small reduction in mortality and a better recovery and decrease time to recovery but may have little to no effect on hospital length of stay. Remdesivir may reduce serious adverse events moderately and may reduce any adverse event by a small level. 57 In another meta-analysis conducted by Elsawah HK et al included four clinical trials and one observational study. The result showed that Remdesivir increases the recovery rate of moderate and severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but mortality reduction has not proven although short-term benefits observed. The efficacy of remdesivir showed in severe COVID-19 patients who do not need mechanical ventilation; these patients can tailor Clinical Pharmacology: Advances and Applications 2020:12 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress 207 the treatment course from 5 to 10 days without loss of the drug efficacy. 58 Sarfraz A et al conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on four studies that have 3013 participants with 46.3% (n=1395) in the remdesivir group and 53.7% (n=1618) in the placebo group. This review showed Remdesivir reduced the mortality, adverse events, and oxygen support in moderate to severely ill COVID-19 patients. 59 At moment, several phases 3 studies of remdesivir are ongoing to determine the efficacy and safety in hospitalized patients, ie, NCT04252664, NCT04257656, NCT04292730, NCT04292899, NCT04280705, and NCT04315948.Favipiravir is an orally effective guanine analog approved in 2014 for the management of influenza infection. It differs from the neuraminidase inhibitors like zanamivir in that it inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Favipiravir inhibits replication of several RNA viruses, including Lassa virus, yellow fever virus, Ebola virus, chikungunya, norovirus, and enterovirus. 60 A recent in vitro study displayed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 = 61.88 μM in Vero E6 cells). 61 Recently, patients recruited to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir (ChiCTR2000030254, ChiCTR2000029600), and favipiravir plus interferon (ChiCTR2000029600) and favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil (ant influenza drug) (ChiCTR2000029544), Favipiravir plus Tocilizumab (ChiCTR2000030894) based on their synergistic effect. Indeed, in March 2020, favipiravir approved for experimental use in COVID-19 disease in Russia, Italy, China, and other countries. 62 But, a study in Japan, Favipiravir did not display significant benefit in mild and moderate COVID-19 diseases. 63 Galidesivir (BCX4430) is an adenosine derivative developed for HCV. It showed antiviral activities in preclinical studies against several RNA viruses including, SARS and MERS.Convalescent Plasma Therapy Antiviral antibodies produced in convalescent (Immune) plasma from recovered patients from viral diseases used for the treatment of various viral infections (eg, polio, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, influenza A (H5N1), H1N1, SARS-CoV, and Ebola) and post-exposure prophylaxis (eg, hepatitis, mumps, polio, measles, rabies). 64 The human convalescent plasma is a promising option for management of COVID-19 patients because it provide immediate passive Immunity for COVID-19 patient. Several reports showed that convalescent plasma COVID-19 patients displayed potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody (NAb) responses in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, convalescent plasma efficacy in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains unclear. 65, 66 Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Nabs) are another passive immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of several diseases. Nabs specifically bind to the target site to produce the desirable effects, which can be either inhibit or activate those molecular pathways. The S protein is the main inducer of Nabs. Most NAbs specifically target RBD and inhibit the interaction of RBD with its receptor ACE2. Some NAbs recognize epitopes on the S2 unit. 67 The final virus removal occurs by complement activation or antibody-dependent opsonization. Several studies identified several effective Nabs like CR3014 and CR3022 that bind to RBD to neutralize the virus. 68 A recent study showed that CR3022 could be a promising therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia that specifically binds to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and displayed significant prophylaxis effect in vitro and animal models. 69 Thus, the use of Nabs represents a promising approach to enhance humoral defense against CoVs by inhibiting different S protein epitopes. 70 Nabs also target the host ACE2 receptor to inhibit the access of the virus. NAbs that bind to the soluble version of ACE2, which binds to SAR-CoV-2, thus sequestering it away from cell surface-bound ACE2 in host cells. 71 Interferon Interferons (IFN) are broad-spectrum antiviral proteins synthesized by the host cells during viral infection. IFN is used for the management of viral infection, tumors, and autoimmune diseases. IFN-α suppresses virus infection by inhibiting viral protein synthesis, degrade viral RNA, and apoptosis by promoting both innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. 72 During the SARS outbreak in 2003, a study in the Rhesus monkey model revealed that IFN-α spray can prevent SARS-CoV infection by inhibiting virus replication. Further clinical evaluation showed that IFN-α significantly reduces the infection rate of the respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV. 73 Clinical trials involving interferon have been initiated, such as a trial testing the approved anti-HCV combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (ChiCTR2 000029387). Thus, IFN-α is a promising candidate drug for COVID-19 therapy.Cytokine response is crucial for the host immune response. However, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience the upregulation of cytokine, chemokine and interferon synthesis, which causes cytokine storm, followed by massive immune cell infiltration into the lungs leading to decreased lung function, and death. Cytokine storm induces a strong inflammation that contributes to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and death. Thus, the identification of existing approved therapies to treat hyper inflammation is crucial to reduce COVI-19 associated mortality. 73, 74 Corticosteroids, IL-6 blocker (tocilizumab), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra), and JAK inhibition suppress exaggerated immune systems in different diseases. Hence, this can be important for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome and associated pathologies in COVID-19 patients. 74 Corticosteroids are extensively used for acute respiratory conditions that have similar pathological features with COVID-19 including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H1N1 influenza, community-acquired pneumonia, and ARDS. But, their role in reducing mortality and improving these conditions remain controversial. 75 The early observational study revealed promising results in terms of improving survival, 76 but subsequent observational studies and data from a single randomized trial showed mixed results. A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Tlayjeh H et al included one RCT and 19 cohort studies with low to moderate risk of bias assessed the association between Corticosteroid treatment, and viral clearance, disease progression and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This systematic review showed that Corticosteroid treatment was not associated with reduced short-term mortality but possibly with delayed viral clearance. 77 A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Yang Z et al on a total of 5270 patients from 15 studies showed that critical patients were more likely to require corticosteroid treatment but associated with higher mortality, a longer length of stay, and a higher rate of bacterial infection. 78 A recent prospective meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials conducted by Horby P et al included 1703 critically ill COVID-19 patients. This study showed that Corticosteroids were associated with lower mortality among critically ill patients at 28 days after randomization. 79 Currently, WHO recommends against the routine use of steroids for COVID-19 patients, due to delayed viral clearance, vascular necrosis, and psychosis. Generally, steroids should not be used solely to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection but may be required to treat other conditions that may accompany it. 80 Tocilizumab (Interleukin-6 Receptor Blocker)In critically ill patients with COVID-19, IL-6 levels were almost tenfold higher. Tocilizumab is monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6R), thus blocking IL-6 signaling and its mediated inflammatory response. IL-6 receptors may curb fever and inflammation, but this blunts the host defense against infection. Tocilizumab has a profound immunosuppressant effect that increases the risk of sepsis, pneumonia, and hepatotoxicity. Yet, despite these severe side effects, IL-6 inhibitors are now being given to patients with COVID-19 in several countries who develop cytokine release syndrome. 81 Although basic science proposes the rationale for therapeutic use of IL-6 receptor antagonists for COVID-19 patients, several studies have shown inconsistent results. A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed Tocilizumab was not effective in preventing intubation or death in moderately ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 80, 82 Another systematic review conducted by Cortegiani A et al on 28 clinical studies with 5776 COVID-19 patients (13 with a comparison group, 15 single-arm) and 3 indirect pre-clinical studies revealed no sufficient evidence on efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19. 83 But, a recent non-controlled, prospective clinical trial showed tocilizumab may be a promising therapeutic agent for severe or critical COVID-19 patients, if promptly initiated during the severe stage. 84 A prospective open-label uncontrolled multicenter trial showed tocilizumab may improve some clinical parameters and reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 patients, especially if used in the early stages of respiratory failure. 85 Currently, several studies are undergoing on the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab to treat COVID-19 disease (ChiCTR2000029765), (ChiCTR2000030796), and combination with other drugs (ChiCTR2000030442 and ChiCTR2000030894). SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through endocytosis by interacting with ACE2. AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) is the major regulators of endocytosis. AAK1 inhibitors inhibit the entrance of the SARS-CoV2 virus into cells and may be helpful in preventing virus infections. Baricitinib, an AAK1 inhibitor and a JAK inhibitor was proposed as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19. But, JAK inhibitors inhibit inflammatory cytokines including INF-a, which has a significant antiviral activity (ChiCTR2000 030170), (ChiCTR2000029580). 86Up-to-date, there is no effective antiviral agent for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, authorities rely exclusively on enforcing strict preventive and control measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Currently, several clinical trials are ongoing to develop new drugs and vaccines. These clinical trials follow two main strategies. The first strategy is the therapeutic use of repurposed drugs including hydroxychloroquine (LPV/r) against the virus. Due to the need for urgent responses and high-quality evidence on the efficacy and safety of the drug, repurposing of existing drugs are currently the best treatment option until safe and effective vaccine development. The second approach is dampening of the proinflammatory state produced during COVID-19 with drugs such as Corticosteroids (eg, Dexamethasone), IL-6 inhibitors (eg, tocilizumab), IL-1antagonist (eg, Anakinra) and JAK inhibition which give better clinical response by reversing multi-organ failure and ARDS. Although some therapeutic agents mentioned in this review are promising, definitive evidence regarding their effectiveness remains inconclusive.

It is the main cause of morbidities and mortalities in young children (0-5years) and pregnant women in many developing countries [1] . Malaria is mainly transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. In late 2019, China experienced an outbreak of a new betacoronavirus with over 70,000 morbidities and 1,800 mortalities within two months. [2] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the virus ""SARS-CoV2"" and the disease ""COVID-19."" [3, 4] COVID-19 is mainly transmitted to susceptible humans through infected nasal droplets which are released via coughing, talking, or sneezing. [5] There is very little data on malaria and COVID-19 co-infection glob-ally especially in African countries which experience both diseases with significant number of cases (morbidities and mortalities) daily. Sex (biological factor) and gender (behaviour and socio-cultural factors) are vital in understanding the dynamics of these diseases. Initial data from China and other countries globally have highlighted similar numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases between men and women [6] . The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of sex (biological factor) in the co-infection of malaria and COVID-19 as well as some associated factors in Rivers State, Nigeria.Before the commencement of this study, ethical clearance was obtained from the Rivers State Health and Ethics Com-mittee. Study participants were three hundred randomly selected consenting laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 laboratory testing and confirmation was conducted prior to this study at the COVID-19 testing centres in the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) and Rivers State University Teaching Hospital (RSUTH); both centres are located in Rivers State, Nigeria. Intravenous blood samples were collected from all study participants and examined for Plasmodium species using Giemsa microscopy according to standard laboratory methods [7] . Data on sex (male and female), symptoms experienced (fever, difficulty in breathing, cough/sneezing, headache, loss of smell or taste, running nose, and sore throat), and risk factors (travel history, nose mask usage, regular hand washing, and maintaining social distance) were also obtained from study participants. Malaria parasite load was graded into three groups: the high parasitaemia (HP), moderate parasitaemia (MP): and low parasitaemia (LP) groups. Data obtained were statistically analyzed by Chi-square test while Cramer's association coefficient and Fisher's exact were used to determine the goodness of fit for any significant Chisquare statistics. A P value less than 0.05 (P < 0:05) was considered significant.All study participants had Plasmodium species (100% prevalence) and P. falciparum was the only identified species. In Table 1 , study participants with low parasitaemia (LP) had the highest prevalence of 49.7% and 57.9% in males and females, respectively, while those with high parasitaemia had the least prevalence of 21.8% and 15.7% in males and females, respectively (P > 0:05).In Table 2 , male study participants experienced more symptoms than females except for sore throat which had an equal value for males and females; all symptoms were not significantly associated with sex (P > 0:05).Males had higher compliance to nose mask usage (58.9%), regular hand washing (58.2%), and maintaining social distance (64.2%) as well as had higher recent travel history (91.2%) ( Table 3) .All study participants had Plasmodium species and P. falciparum was the only species observed; some studies on malaria in Nigeria identified P. falciparum as the only malaria parasite [8] [9] [10] . Malaria is endemic in Rivers State, and it is unsurprising that all study participants had P. falciparum (despite varying parasite loads) but this also confirms that COVID-19 and malaria can be misdiagnosed in malariaendemic areas since both diseases share similar symptoms. More research is necessary to aid in adequately distinguishing COVID-19 from malaria (vice versa) especially in rural malaria-endemic areas which lack quality laboratories or testing centres and unavailable clinicians or health personnel. Males exhibited more symptoms than females in this study. A study conducted using 168 severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, reported that men were significantly prone to hospitalization and death as well as reduced likelihood of hospital discharge compared to women during the study [11] . In another research on SARS-CoV infection using mouse models, male mice had higher virus titres with more symptoms due to higher severe pulmonary damage from monocyte-macrophage infiltration and cytokine production [12] . More studies on co-infection of malaria and COVID-19 are needed to fully understand the role of sex (biological factor) and gender (behavioural and sociocultural factors) in relation to susceptibility, morbidities, and mortalities.Males had higher recent travel history and were more compliant in undertaking necessary health precautions (washing hand frequently, regular wearing of nose/face masks, and maintaining adequate social or physical distance in public places). Travelling is a major factor in the epidemiology COVID-19 and malaria; travelling or migration is a significant factor in the epidemiology of diseases globally because it plays a key role in the existence, intensity, and dissemination of diseases within a population or area. Individuals (irrespective of their sex) should minimize their public movements (except when necessary), wash their hands frequently with soap and running water or use any alcoholbased hand sanitizer, properly wear nose masks or face shields especially in public or enclosed places, and always maintain a safe distance while in a public gathering with other individuals; these will reduce the spread of COVID-19. The World Health Organization has emphasized that the response to the COVID-19 pandemic must utilize and strengthen existing infrastructure for addressing malaria and other infectious diseases globally [13] ; therefore, results from this study will aid in formulating public health policies which will address the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on comorbidity, access, and control of malaria in relation to sex (biological factor).Malaria and COVID-19 are major public health issues in Nigeria; more researches especially in epidemiology, co-morbidity, pathology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine production are vital to successfully curb the scourge of these diseases.Data available on request (excluding names and sensitive information of study participants due to confidentiality/ethical reasons).Ethical clearance was obtained from the Rivers State Health and Ethics Committee before the commencement of this study.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-12-02",12

The SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and how COVID-19 disease spread rapidly in the early phase across the globe contributed to the genetic diversity inside the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 including clades (2, 3) . Scientists isolated the virus and named SARS-CoV-2, they found a high nucleotide sequence homology with Betacorona viruses isolated from bats such as bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (88%) and Malayan pangolins Pangolin-CoV (85.5% to 92.4%) (4) . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 share similarity with other emerging human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV (79.5%) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, MERS (50%) (5, 6) .The family of coronaviridae under the betacoronavirus genus as an RNA virus causes various diseases in birds and mammals, including SARS-CoV-2. It contains an RNA polymerase with proofreading activity (7, 8) . The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains ~29800 bp (9) , therefore Sprotein (spike protein) covers the surface of SARS-CoV-2, and consists of 1273 amino acids with a protein size between 180-200 kDa. The S-protein is composed of two subunits (S1 and S2) which play a key role in the cell membrane fusion process and receptor recognition, hence Spike protein becomes a target for vaccine development(10) (11, 12) . The analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence showed that Spike protein and RNA polymerase endure constant mutations according to geographic location (Asia, Europe and America). The SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis and generation of data have been a key component of discovering SARS-CoV-2 4 pathogenicity (13) (14) (15) . Due to the frequent travels link between Rwanda to other geographic regions like China, United Arab Emirates, Europe, America and other African countries. It enhanced the chance to spot the first COVID-19 case on March 14, 2020;  in Rwanda and the initial period of total lockdown started seven days later on March 21, 2020 (16) . We hypothesized that the viral evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We aimed to track evolution and mutation within nucleotides sequence and proteins of SARS-CoV-2 genome by phylogenetic analysis to understand the pathogenesis and viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda.In total, we downloaded 75 genomes sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) database, such as 10 genomes parameters (17) . All targeted genomes of SARS-CoV-2 samples were aligned to the reference strains using the Maximum Parsimony method by the Subtree-Pruning-Regrafting algorithm (18) .The nucleotide variants within the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the coding regions were performed by Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool (19) .We compared the SARS-CoV-2 query sequences isolated in Rwanda from July to August 2020 to the other SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in Africa with Wuhan strains. The analysis of phylogenomic indicated that SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Rwanda belongs to lineage B.1. We found a significant sequence similarity of 90-95% between the WH-Human1_China_2019-Dec genome sequence and the SARS-CoV-2 present in Rwanda. Our data add to important information about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda (Supplementary figure S1).The lineage assessment among the different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B and B.1) indicated that lineage B.1 dominant in the SARS-CoV-2 genome isolated from Rwanda. All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequence from Rwanda presents a universal type of mutations. The government of Rwanda implemented public health measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 like national lockdown, social distance between people, wearing face masks in public.Therefore, the tracing showed that COVID-19 disease was maintained within the cities of Rwanda and no further spread of SARS-Cov-2 in the entire population, which resulted in a lower number of positive COVID-19 cases (16) (Fig. 1) . The availability of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 supports valuable resources to understand the viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (20) .The genetic variation of the virus is classified into three clades (S, V, and G) (21); hence we note that clade G appears to be predominant in ten clinical sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Rwanda. The clade G was mostly spread in North America and Europe (22, 23) . The phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Rwanda showed to be belonging to 1 1 phylogenetic lineage B.1, which is sharing a common ancestor with the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in Europe, America, Asia and Australia (24) . Further, the evolutional history was inferred using the Maximum Parsimony method with 0.223 of consistency index (CI), 0.636 of retention index (RI) and 0.142 of the composite index, therefore if CI is less than 0.5 designated that much homoplasies has occurred which is similar to our findings (25) . The percentage of replicated tree taxa clustered indicated 90-95% (Supplementary figure S1). We performed a mutational analysis by observing changes in bases within SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table 3) andwe found that all genomes sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Rwanda has a common type of mutations (Table 4) The phylogenetic analysis shows genetic variation and the common genes or proteins but doesn't rule out the probability that the importation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus originates from Europe, Asia or America. We recommend that the utility of epidemic surveillance based on genome sequence analysis as a key factor in monitoring the evolution and origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda. 1 3 ","Rwanda","abstract","2020-12-15",12

Thus, we aimed in this study to highlight the efficacy of the three aforementioned antimicrobial drugs in the management of COVID-19 and proposing their possible mode of action via a comprehensive in silico investigation.The clinical and computational studies applied on three FDA-approved antimicrobials together with their recent clinical findings revealed that both nitazoxanide and doxycycline have great therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The future in vitro mechanistic investigation may confirm our primary computational outcomes, and in turn, these classes of compounds provide a promising starting point for further anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.• The repurposing of nitazoxanide, doxycycline and azithromycin may be effective to improve the symptoms in mild and moderate COVID-19 subjects.• This study aimed to detect and explain the efficacy of reusing of these drugs in treating COVID-19. The subjects were given a treatment of azithromycin or doxycycline and added nitazoxanide to the treatment if the subject had diarrhoea.Subjects were divided into four groups: Group 1: subjects treated with azithromycin (20 subjects); Group 2: subjects treated with doxycycline (20 subjects); Group 3: subjects treated with a combination of nitazoxanide and doxycycline (20 subjects); and Group 4: subjects treated with a combination of nitazoxanide and azithromycin (20 subjects). The dose of azithromycin was 500 mg once daily for 5 days; doxycycline 100 mg daily for 10 days; nitazoxanide was 600 mg twice daily for 5 days. The subjects were followed up daily for symptomatic improvement. In this study, 80 (30 females) subjects with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 with mild and moderate symptoms from Beni-Suef University hospital clinic were included from June to July 2020. The oldest subject was 70 years and the youngest one was 18 years. Most subjects were The symptomatic improvement (especially if there was diarrhoea) of mild to moderate subjects was seen on the fifth day after starting treatment in Group 3 and Group 4 and was seen on seventh day after starting treatment in Group 2; however, for Group 1, the symptomatic improvement of mild to moderate subjects was not seen at fifth day after starting the treatment. So, the subjects in this group needed replacing azithromycin with doxycycline to get the symptomatic improvement. None of the subjects needed intensive care admission and no deaths were reported.Docking of the three proposed drugs against all available viral-based and human-based targets ( Figure 2 ) revealed that both nitazoxanide and doxycycline have the potential to modulate the viral ADP-ribose phosphatase (ADPRP) and the human Adaptor-Associated Kinase 1 (AAK1), respectively. ADPRP is a phosphatase that removes the terminal 1″-phosphate group of ADP-ribose-1″-phosphate (Appr 1″-p). Such a process can breakdown the cellular innate immunity, and hence, facilitate the completion of viral replication and release without a host immune response. 16 Recently, the activity of ADPRP has been linked to the cytokine storm syndrome that is commonly observed in COVID-19 severe cases. 17 Herein, nitazoxanide showed a high binding affinity towards ADPRP (Docking score = −10.1 kcal/mol) and comparable with that From the clinical results, we noticed that nitazoxanide, doxycycline and azithromycin in combination gave good results in treating COVID-19. The Egyptian protocol for treating COVID-19 includes hydroxychloroquine. However, the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination has some safety problems, as drug-drug interactions and cardio-toxicity, specifically in old subjects. 22 The results of this study demonstrate that the treatment with azithromycin alone was associated with a non-significant symptomatic improvement of mild to moderate subjects on the fifth day after starting treatment and required replacement by doxycycline.Previously, subjects who received azithromycin alone were shown to have the strongest cumulative hazard. 23 The high evidence of effectiveness for azithromycin is because of its role as an antibacterial drug. Although there is no direct proven effect of azithromycin in COVID-19, some scientists have suggested that the antibacterial properties of azithromycin are still clinically useful as empirical treatment of COVID-19 infection. 24 Because of the risks of using azithromycin especially in combination with hydroxychloroquine, we suggest the use of doxycycline as an alternative to azithromycin. Doxycycline has anti-inflammatory effects with in vitro antiviral efficacy against many RNA viruses.The use of this drug in our study was associated with clinical improvement and decreased cytokine production in some infections with RNA viruses. 5 Doxycycline is safe to use in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome. It could be a better option for COVID-19 treatment. 25 F I G U R E 7 Interacting amino acid residues with both nitazoxanide (A) and doxycycline (B) during the course of MDS Nitazoxanide is an orally broad-spectrum anti-parasitic and antiviral drug and unlike metronidazole, its metabolites are safer and free of mutagenic factors. 26 Nitazoxanide also potentiates the production of interferon alfa and interferon beta and it has been previously shown to exhibit an in vitro activity against MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses. 27 Moreover, when nitazoxanide was given in a dose of 600 mg twice daily for 5 days, it was noticed that it reduces the duration of symptoms in subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza with little adverse effects. 28 So, this dose regimen can be used in combination with azithromycin or doxycycline to decrease SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality.The nitazoxanide when used in combination with azithromycin or doxycycline appeared to be a safe and more effective regimen that might replace hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination as standard care for COVID-19, especially if the preliminary data regarding the low efficacy of azithromycin alone have been detected. 29 In the computational study, we were able to virtually screen these drug molecules against several viral protein targets, thanks to the rapid characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins.Additionally, previous reports on other viral diseases including SARS-CoV-1 revealed that other host-based target proteins can enhance viral virulence. Hence, these targets were also included in our primary screening step. As a result, two enzymes, ADPRP and AAK1, appeared to be the possible targets of both nitazoxanide and doxycycline.ADPRP is a key enzyme that enables the virus to bypass the host immunity, while AAK1 is a host-based kinase that controls the viral entry and processing inside the host cell. Consequently, targeting both of these enzymes can provide effective anti-COVID-19Subsequent MDSs and binding free energy calculations tentatively illustrated the mode of interactions of nitazoxanide and doxycycline inside the active sites of both proteins. Surprisingly, each tested drug molecule achieved binding free energies higher than the reported co-crystallised inhibitors, and thus, they possess the interesting potential to be considered as drug candidates for further in vitro evaluation.Besides the observed therapeutic efficacy of these antimicrobial agents in treating COVID-19, they can alleviate the secondary bacterial infection associated with the disease, particularly in immunocompromised subjects, since 15% prevalence of secondary bacterial infection were found among hospitalised subjects. 30 The repurposing nitazoxanide, doxycycline and azithromycin are highly effective for the symptomatic improvement of mild and moderate COVID-19 subjects. Dual therapy by combining nitazoxanide with azithromycin or doxycycline is considered to be better than monotherapy. The use of azithromycin alone is not recommended, as it was not effective against symptoms compared with the other regimens used.The clinical and computational studies applied on three FDAapproved antimicrobials together with their recent clinical findings revealed that both nitazoxanide and doxycycline have great therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The future in vitro mechanistic investigation may confirm our primary computational outcomes, and in turn, these classes of compounds provide a promising starting point for further anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.No conflict to declare.

Human to human transmission of the infection emphasizes the importance of adhering to public and social measure to halt its spread. However, the recent #ENDSARS protests led by angry youths in Nigeria resulted to complete flouting of all WHO guidelines meted to curb the spread of the virus. Given that the nation is the most populous African country with over 50 percent of her population been youths, this situation has huge implications for the country and Africa as a whole. The risk of community transmission occasioned by the protest, coupled with travels and active mobility across countries within the continent increases the risk of community transmission with possible increases in new cases over the next few weeks to months. From the foregoing, it is expedient to increase awareness and enforcement of the use of personal protective equipment especially use of nose masks, face shields and frequent hand washing or sanitizing in public places. These individual-targeted measures will go a long way to curtail the imminent community transmission of COVID-19 across Nigeria. It is therefore recommended that Government and non-governmental agencies across the region actively engage to increase collaborative efforts; screening facilities and access to these services across the country, as well as accentuate regular adherence to preventive measures to the general public.The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease which is primarily transmitted between people through droplets and contact routes causing mild respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia with a fatality rate of about 2% [1, 2] . Over 50 million people have been infected during the ongoing pandemic and this has resulted in over 1.2 million deaths globally of which majority are recorded in the region of the Americas [3] . The African region has recorded over 1.9 million cases and over 45,000 deaths with South Africa and Ethiopia reporting highest numbers of new cases, followed by Mozambique, Uganda and Nigeria [3, 4] . Currently, Nigeria has recorded over 64,000 cases of COVID-19 with over 1,100 deaths as at 12 th November, 2020 [5] . Several countries including Nigeria have implemented extensive public health preventive measures spanning both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown, closure of borders and social distancing to reduce the surge in imported cases and local transmission of the disease [6] . In spite of this, community transmission is on the rise in Nigeria with new cases been recorded every week. This is suggested to be due to human to human transmission facilitated through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes [1, 5] .The recent #ENDSARS movement, which had been trending on the social media for a while resulted in nationwide protests on major roads of Nigeria. This protest started on the 2 nd of October, 2020 and spanned over three weeks in almost all the states of Nigeria, with some recent resurgence of the protests in some places such as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The protesters are mainly youths who have gathered together to protest the alleged murders, rape, and assault and brutality by a Nigerian Police unit called Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) (Figure 1) . The unit was created in 1992 and was supposed to be in charge of robberies, kidnapping, and other violent crimes. Instead, it has been accused of using its position to extort, rob, defraud, injure, and even murder people. Between January 2017 and May 2020, Amnesty International recorded at least 82 cases of ""torture, ill treatment and extra-judicial execution"" at the hands of SARS agents [7] . The youth have therefore called on the Nigerian government to reform and decentralize the policing system. The protests have over the period garnered solidarity and support from celebrities and individuals within and outside the country with solidarity protests held in Europe, the United Kingdom and United States of America etc. Thus, leading to widespread gathering of youths during the demonstrations. The resultant effect of these have been the breaching of several safety protocols previously recommended by the National Center for Diseases Control (NCDC) [8] . The implications of these breaches with respect to the transmission of infectious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic is huge due to the fact that these healthy youths could be undetectable transmitters of the disease in the community.The WHO guidelines for public health and social measures for slowing or stopping the spread of COVID-19 at national or community level include individual and environmental measures, detecting and isolating cases, contact-tracing and quarantine, social and physical distancing measures including for mass gatherings, international travel measures, vaccines and treatments [6] . The social and physical distancing measures aim to slow the spread of disease, by stopping chains of transmission of COVID-19 and preventing new ones from appearing. These measures secure physical distance between people (of at least one metre), use of facemask and reduce contact with contaminated surfaces, while encouraging and sustaining virtual social connection within families and communities [9] . Measures for the general public include introducing flexible work arrangements such as teleworking, distance learning, reducing and avoiding crowding, closure of non-essential facilities and services, shielding and protection for vulnerable groups, local or national movement restrictions and staying-at home measures, and coordinated reorganization of health care and social services networks to protect hospitals. The measures are used in conjunction with individual protective measures against COVID-19 such as frequent hand washing and cough etiquette and use of face mask in public places [5, 9] .Unfortunately, with the wake of #EndSARS protest in Nigeria, mammoth crowds of youth have gathered in different places across the country (Figure 2) . In these cases, most people flouted most of these COVID-19 public health and social measures which play an essential role in reducing the number of infections and saving lives. The youths were mostly observed without their face/nose masks, crowded together in locations without handwashing points and no hand sanitisers (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) , thereby exposing and increasing the risk of many individuals contracting COVID-19 disease.In addition to the imposition of curfews and movement restriction put in place to curtail the spread of the protests in several states, consistent awareness was created by the NCDC during the protest [8] . However, it is quite unclear if measures such as screening and testing were escalated or strengthened to help curtail the potential rippling effect of a spike in infections across communities both in Nigeria and other countries especially at the ports of travels.Recently, there has been reported increase in the number of COVID cases recorded in the country, such that in the weeks just after these protests the country recorded a 32 percent increase (923 cases in the week of 25-31, October, 2020) from the preceding weeks and a subsequent 2 percent increase (in the week of November 1-7, 2020) to 937 new cases [10] . These increases have been recorded in Lagos, FCT, Rivers, Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti, Kwara and Sokoto [5] . Although these figures may seem negligible, given the nature and unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 disease, it is important to take cognizance of these increases to mitigate against possible spike of the diseases curve in the country. This is especially necessary in the face of the fast approaching yuletide period, which is usually characterized with increased travels, mobility and mass gatherings. Futhermore, the full effect of the protest is yet to be felt and there are some potential dire consequences for the continent in the nearest future, due to the fact that Nigeria is the most populous black nation with youths making up over 50% of her population. In addition to this, the impact of travels in and out of the country could pose more risk of community transmission within and outside the country in the aftermath of these protests.This event has raised the need to engage youth leaders and mobilisers of such demonstrations -as youth influencers-to enlighten the youths on the need to adhere to the prevention guidelines to curb infections that could diminish the gains of nations in the fight against the current pandemic. Given the current realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for individuals to be proactive and take responsibility in preventing transmission of the disease. Hence it is important to increase awareness and enforcement of such measures as the use of nose masks, face shields and frequent hand washing or sanitizing in public places. These measures will go a long way to curtail the imminent community transmission of COVID-19 across Nigeria. This situation also calls for more strengthening of these measures put in place by the National Center for Diseases Control (NCDC) especially increasing access to COVID-19 screening services to accommodate the possibility of increased infections in communities within the country.Furthermore, there is an urgent need for the Africa Centre for Disease Control in collaboration with other stakeholders such as individual National Centers for Disease Control to increase screening facilities and access to these services across regions. Finally, it is strongly recommended that countries collaborate with relevant health agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop or strengthen existing contingency plans; revise existing COVID-19 guidelines to factor in potential consequences of such events as conflicts situations, unrest, and protests across countries in Africa and globally.

Assessing the impact of lockdown and reopening on the active COVID-19 cases in Nigeria","The emergence of Novel Corona Virus, otherwise known as COVID-19, in Wuhan, China and its eventual spread worldwide have caused panic across the international community. This development has resulted in the shutdown of social, religious and economic activities across the globe. As the COVID-19 is contagious (Cheng and Shan, 2020; Lauer et al., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020) , policy makers across the globe have taken preventive measures such as shutdown of international flights, lockdown of cities including banning large gathering and enforcing social distancing. Developing countries like Nigeria, despite their differences from the developed countries, decided to ""copy and paste"" similar measures to slow down the spread of the disease. Policy makers have begun to 'live with the virus' by opening up as the countries cannot cope with the continuous lockdown. This study focuses on the impact of lockdown and reopening on the active COVID-19 cases (ACC). The number of the ACC is an important factor in determining the hospitalisation need of a country. Hospitalisation need simply means the number of medical personnel, equipment and facilities needed to take care of the active COVID-19 patients. The government authorities implemented the lockdown measures in order to 'flatten the curve', but have to reopen because of unbearable social and economic conditions of the lockdown. Hence, empirical modelling of the impact of these measures on the ACC can give more insight on their outcomes. Thus, the outcome can help the authorities in making decisions whether to continue with the lockdown or reopen completely. The outcome can also help the authorities in taking the best measures when faced with similar incidence in the future.Policy makers implement various measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 from the unidentified infected to non-infected persons (Lau et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith and Freedman, 2020) . By 20 March, the Nigerian government began to take certain measures in order to curb the spread of the disease. By 28 March 2020, the Nigerian government enforced a sweeping 14-day lockdown (otherwise known as quarantine) of three major cities, namely Lagos, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), that is the Nigerian Capital Abuja. Consequently, international and domestic flights were banned, a 24-h curfew was enforced and all social, religious, political and educational gatherings were cancelled.A number of studies attempt to model the COVID-19 cases (Li et al., 2020; Ma, 2020; Read et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020a,b) . Some of these studies use epidemiological models (Ahmed et al., 2020; Anastassopoulou et al., 2020; Isa Abdullahi Baba, 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020) , correlation analysis (Zhao et al., 2020a,b) , while other studies attempt to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak (Anastassopoulou, 2020; Roosa et al., 2020) . Few studies also examine the effect of lockdown on various variables; Collivignarelli et al. (2020) analyses the effects of lockdown on air quality; Killeen and Kiware (2020) arithmetic models for analysing the impact of lockdown using Shiny and Excel formats; Lau et al. (2020) explores the positive impact of lockdown on containing COVID-19 outbreak in China; Cowling and Aiello (2020) studies the effectiveness of non-pharmacological intervention measures on the spread of COVID-19. Chowdhury et al. (2020) employs a multivariate prediction modelling to compare sixteen countries worldwide.The contributions of this study are as follows. To the best of author's knowledge, this is the first study in which ARIMA modelling is used to assess the effects of lockdown and reopening on the ACC. This study also focuses on Nigeria, the most populous country and largest economy in Africa. The study develops the most appropriate ARIMA model from a myriad of alternative plausible models. The study also quantifies the effectiveness of the lockdown and reopening measures. The technique developed in this study can guide future studies aimed at assessing the effectiveness of other intervention policies.Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and is located on latitude 10 0 00 ′ N and longitude 8 0 00 ′ E. Fig. 1 presents the map of West Africa and Nigeria, while Fig. 2 shows the map of Nigerian States with the distribution of COVID-19 cases. It is obvious that Lagos, Kano and the FCT have the largest number of COVID-19 total confirmed cases. Fig. 3 depicts the fan plot of the total, active, recovery and death cases of COVID-19. The larger the sector of the fan plot, the larger the number of the respective case. The figure reports the extracts of the top four of each COVID-19 case. It is observed that Lagos leads in terms of each case, followed by Kano in terms of all but the number of active cases. The FCT comes second in terms of the number of active cases. The number of active cases for the FCT is larger than that of Kano because the number of recovery cases for the latter is 1.8 times larger than that of the former. Surprisingly, Kaduna, which is ninth in terms of the total confirmed cases (369), comes third in terms of the number of recovery cases. This moves its position down to twelfth on the scale of active cases. The State of Edo maintains its fourth position on both the scales of active and death cases. This is because Edo is the fifth State on the ladder of total cases.The data sets for this study are extracted from the daily Situation Reports by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The link to the website is https://ncdc.gov.ng.The variables used in this study are defined as follows. The new cases refer to the daily laboratory record of COVID-19 patients, that is the number of new confirmed cases recorded daily. The total cases refer to the cumulative sum of new cases. Death cases refer to the total number of COVID-19-related deaths recorded over time. Recovery cases refer to the total number of COVID-19-infected persons that get recovered. The active cases refer to the number of COVID-19 patients currently on admission. The number of active cases is calculated as follows;In Equation (1), A t is the active COVID-19 cases, T t is the total COVID-19 cases, R t is the total number of recovery cases and D t is the total number of death cases. The subscript t represents time in days. Explicitly, the number of active cases is determined by the number of total, recovery and death cases. Implicitly, the number of active cases is also a function of the number of the new COVID-19 cases.Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was proposed by Box and Jenkins (1976) and Box et al. (2015) . The ARIMA (p,d,q) model is represented by Equation (2). The letters p, d and q indicate the autoregressive order, order of integration and moving average order respectively.Y t is the stationary dependent variable, ε t is the white noise error term,For more details on ARIMA, see Enders et al. (1990) , Enders (2015) and Akalpler et al. (2017) . Therefore, the ACC can be modelled in terms of ARIMA as followsThe new variables d t and r t in Equation (3) stand for the dummy variables for periods of lockdown and reopening respectively. The ARIMA is used to model the ACC as it is most appropriate for intervention analysis (Enders et al., 1990) .The time series plots of the number of active, death, recovery and total cases are shown in Fig. 4 , while the descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1 .The focus of this paper is on the impact of lockdown and reopening on the ACC. Therefore, only the ACC is modelled in this section. A new series a t is created by taking logarithmic changes of the ACC. Specifically, a t = ΔlnA t × 100, where Δ = (1 − L). Therefore, a t series can be interpreted as the daily growth rate of the ACC. The first task is to plot {a t } in order to observe whether it is stationary. A cursory look at Fig. 6 shows that the mean is constant, but the variance changes over times. However, formal unit root tests Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF), proposed by (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) , and Phillips-Perron (PP), pioneered by (Phillips and Perron, 1988) , show that a t is stationary at level. In other words, a t is I(0). The results of the unit root tests are reported in Table 2 . This necessitates modelling a t as an ARMA(p,q) process because it is stationary I(0).The convention of an intervention analysis is to estimate the ARMA model over sample before or after the intervention (that is lockdown or reopening in this case). The lockdown measure in Nigeria began around March 20, 2020. The sample prior to the lockdown is not included because it is smaller than the sample for the post-lockdown period. Hence, the initial estimation sample of the ARMA model for {a t } series ranges from March 20, 2020 to July 3, 2020. The dummy for the lockdown (d t ) is a series of zeros for period prior to March 20, 2020 and unity otherwise. That is, d t = 0 for all t < March 20, 2020 and d t = 1 for all t ≥ March 20, 2020. Similarly for the reopening dummy, r t = 0 for all t < June 10, 2020 and r t = 1 for all t ≥ June 10, 2020. After determining the best ARMA model, a new model is re-estimated which includes the lockdown and reopening variables as described in Enders et al. (1990) and Enders (2015) . The steps are illustrated in Fig. 5 below:The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) in Fig. 7 help in identifying the probable models. The significant lags of the PACF indicate the probable AR order (p), while the significant lags of the ACF suggest the probable MA order (q). It is observable that the probable models include AR(2), MA(2), MA(3), MA (4), ARMA(1,2), ARMA(2,1), ARMA(2,2) and so on. All the probable models are estimated and then compared against each other in terms of the values of R 2 , Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1973 (Akaike, , 1974 (Akaike, , 1981 , Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) (Schwarz, 1978) , and residual diagnostics. The R 2 is used to measure the explanatory power of the regressors, the SIC is preferred over the AIC as it selects the most parsimonious model. The AIC and SIC are given as AIC = − 2ln(Ω) + 2k and SIC = − 2ln(Ω) + ln(n)k, where k is the number of regressors, n is the number of estimated residuals and Ω is the likelihood function. Parsimony is the idea that the lower the number of regressors in a model, the better. Fig. 8 reports the ARMA criteria graph of the top 20 models in ascending order of their SIC values. Although AR(3) has the lowest SIC value, ARMA (1,2) is used to estimate the a t series as it contains no redundant parameters, no autocorrelation, and Fig. 9 shows that its actual correlogram resembles the theoretical correlogram well. The following ARMA(1,2) model is estimated with a sample ranging from March 20, 2020 to June 10, 2020 to cover the lockdown period only. a t = 20.83 For the sake of comparison, Equations (6)-(8) report the estimates of AR(3,0), AR(3,1) and AR(1,3) respectively. These equations use the same sample as Equation (4). It is observed that Equation (4) is the best model because it does not contain redundant regressors. where a t is the ACC daily growth rate and Δ is the difference operator and k is the lag-length and ε t is a white-noise error term. The deterministic terms include constant (C), constant and trend (C&T) and none (N). Similarly, Equations (9)-(11) provide the estimates of AR(3,0), AR (3,1) and AR(1,3) respectively over the same sample as Equation (5). It can be observed that these equations contain some redundant regressors. For this reason, Equation (5) Both Equations (4) and (5) indicate stability as each of the coefficients of the AR terms, 0.57 and 0.59 respectively, is less than unity.The aim of this study is to examine the impact of lockdown and reopening on the active COVID-19 cases (ACC). Two models are estimated as in Equations (4) Fig. 9 . Correlogram of the ACC growth rate (a t ). the sample size. It is obvious that, the longer the sample size, the smaller the effect of the lockdown on the growth rate of the ACC. This shows that the lockdown is effective in reducing the daily growth rate of the ACC, but the effect diminishes with time.The ARMA(1,2) is also estimated along with the reopening dummy (r t ) only, and another with both lockdown and reopening dummies as regressors. The coefficient of the dummy (η) is not significant in both cases. The estimation is not reported as the coefficient of r t is not significant. Therefore, reopening has neither immediate nor long run effect on the growth rate of the ACC. This might be due to the fact that the reopening sample is small and therefore it is too early to detect its effect on the ACC. In other words, without a longer post-reopening data series, it is difficult to estimate the correct model. For this reason, the government should be wary about complete reopening until proper assessment is carried out. However, assessment of the doubling time shows that it takes more days for the ACC to double after the reopening than before. Doubling time is calculated as DT = 70 n , where n is the growth rate. The result is not reported, but it is available upon request. The implication of this is that Nigeria can continue with its reopening policy as it does not reduce the doubling time of the ACC.This study has examined the ""copy-paste"" policies of lockdown and reopening to control the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The ARIMA modelling is used to estimate the daily growth rate of the ACC. The lockdown measures have led to the reduction of daily percentage rate of growth of the ACC. Even though the lockdown policy is successful, the big question is whether the benefit of this policy outweighs its cost. This question is difficult to answer as it is not easy to quantify the economic losses due to the lockdown or place economic value on the success of the lockdown policy.The reopening measures are difficult to assess as the post-reopening data series is too short for exact estimation. However, the doubling time of the ACC indicate that it takes more days for the ACC to double after the reopening. In view of this, this study recommends that the government should be careful about complete reopening until exact estimation is possible.The outcomes of this study indicate how ARIMA modelling can be used to examine lockdown and reopening policies. Future studies can adopt this technique to examine the effectiveness of other policies.Sagiru Mati: wrote the manuscript.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.","Nigeria","first author","2020-12-26",12

To our knowledge there are no published cases of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission to hospitalised neonates, although transmission is possible from contaminated surfaces, equipment and hands, and exposure to the respiratory droplets of COVID-19 infected caregivers and HCWs. 6 In Africa where neonatal unit outbreaks are frequent but underreported 7 , the risk of staff-to-staff and staff-to-patient COVID-19 transmission is high, especially in hospitals with limited isolation facilities and overcrowding. In this brief report, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection at a tertiary care neonatal unit in Cape Town in late April 2020, seven weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa.Two preterm neonates admitted in the same 8-bed cubicle of a neonatal 30-bed high-care ward had new-onset of respiratory distress (one day apart) with subcostal retractions, tachypnea, increased nasal secretions and hypoxia ( Figure 1 ). Baby A (28-week gestation, 720g birth weight) was a twin who was given up for adoption at birth. His mother was clinically well at delivery and had no contact with the baby thereafter. Baby A had recovered from prematurity-related respiratory distress syndrome and was nursed in a closed incubator in room air. On day 42 of life (5 May) he deteriorated and was placed on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. A work-up for infection was performed including blood culture (negative), full blood count (hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL, white cell count normal), C-reactive protein (55 mg/L) and a chest radiograph (CXR) (non-specific streaky infiltrates bilaterally). He was commenced empirically on meropenem, but developed apnoea requiring intubation and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A tracheal aspirate, taken 2 days after his deterioration, was sent for multiplex respiratory virus and SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT PCR). Four days later (11 M a n u s c r i p t 4 May), COVID-19 infection was confirmed, with no other respiratory viruses identified. He was extubated 5 days later, had a negative repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test 14 days after illness onset and was discharged 5 weeks later weighing 2kg.Baby B (28-week gestation, 850g birth weight) was also initially treated for respiratory distress syndrome, had been oxygen flow dependent from birth and was admitted in the same cubicle as Baby A. On day 48 of life (6 May), he had a respiratory deterioration requiring escalation to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. A work-up for infection was performed including blood culture (negative), full blood count (hemoglobin 7.0 g/dL, white cell count normal), C-reactive protein (19mg/L) and a CXR (diffuse bilateral infiltrates). He was commenced empirically on piperacillin-tazobactam plus amikacin but was switched to azithromycin 2 days later as his septic markers did not suggest bacterial infection and his CXR suggested viral or atypical pneumonia. On 7 May, one day following his deterioration, a multiplex respiratory virus panel and SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR test was performed; on 11 May, the PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection, and was negative for other respiratory viruses. Baby B's mother had no symptoms/signs compatible with COVID-19 infection and tested SARS-CoV-2 negative. Baby B's condition stabilised over the following days and he was weaned back to nasal prong oxygen. His repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR test 2 weeks after illness onset was negative. He was subsequently diagnosed with chronic lung disease, received dexamethasone and was successfully weaned off oxygen. He was discharged home 5 weeks following the COVID-19 infection weighing 2.3kg.At the time of the neonatal outbreak, COVID-19 infections among hospital staff were rapidly increasing with 50-100 new infections per week (1-2% of the staff complement). Three nurses in this neonatal ward who had worked together on the same shift in the week prior to the neonates' deterioration, were subsequently evaluated for COVID-19 after reporting compatible symptoms. Nurse 1 had developed cough, myalgia and dizziness on 26 April, the last day of her shift, but was not tested for COVID-19 at the time. She remained symptomatic and was placed on sick leave from the 29 th of April when she was due to return to work, eventually undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing 17 days after symptom onset (test negative). Antibody testing to confirm recent COVID-19 infection was not available at this time.. The other 2 nurses who had worked 4 shifts with Nurse 1, developed myalgia, fatigue and fever on 6 May and 15 May respectively;, both were tested and had COVID-19 infection confirmed on the 19 th of May. A doctor who was 29 weeks pregnant developed compatible symptoms on the day of the neonates' COVID-19 diagnosis and required prolonged hospitalisation following COVID-19 respiratory complications. A week later in the same ward (22 and 23 May), a further 2 nurses and the ward cleaner developed symptoms and all tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. M a n u s c r i p t 5 Following identification of the index neonatal cases of healthcare-associated COVID-19, all babies in the same cubicle were tested but found to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. As single negative pressure rooms are not available in our unit, the infected infants were nursed in closed incubators under droplet precautions in attempt to limit further spread of the virus. Before COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs performing aerosol-generating procedures included face masks, gloves and aprons, but this was changed to N95 respirators at the beginning of the pandemic. Hand hygiene and use of surgical gloves when handling bodily fluids forms part of standard infection prevention precautions in our hospital. Various additional containment measures were put in place at the time of the outbreak, including ward closure to new admissions for a 2-week period and a restricted visitor policy. Mothers could visit their babies at any time, but fathers were only allowed to visit if their baby was critically ill. Previously, 2 close relatives were allowed to visit. Universal masking for hospital staff and caregivers had been recommended in the week prior to this outbreak but was not fully implemented until a week later. Extensive training regarding COVID-19 transmission risk was provided to staff and mothers, emphasizing the need for physical distancing and mask use, especially in tearooms and neonatal cubicles. Neonatal mothers were identified as a high-risk group for incident COVID-19 infections, as many travelled home daily and others stayed in the on-site mothers' rooms and hostel. There was insufficient laboratory capacity to routinely test all neonatal mothers for COVID-19, so ongoing counselling was provided reinforcing twice daily symptom screening, hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning. Following the emergence of COVID-19 in Cape Town, our hospital's environmental cleaning programme was adapted to twice daily cleaning with use of detergent and surface disinfection. Processes for triage and SARS-CoV-2 testing of symptomatic staff and mothers were streamlined and test turnaround times were reduced to under 24 hours for priority samples. Following the implementation of these measures, no further healthcare-associated COVID-19 transmission occurred.Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are major contributors to neonatal morbidity and mortality in low-and-middle income countries, exacerbated by overcrowding, understaffing, lack of isolation facilities and poor infection prevention practices. 8, 9 Gram negative bacteria are the leading cause of neonatal HAI and outbreaks in these settings although outbreaks of viral pathogens do occur. 7 Typically, neonates with in-hospital deterioration are investigated for bacterial HAIs, but viral pathogens should always be considered. Viral pathogens have been transmitted to hospitalised neonates seasonally (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus) or during pandemics (H1N1 influenza). The high transmission rate and large proportion of asymptomatically-infected individuals are likely to facilitate healthcare-associated (HA) COVID-19 transmission. In this neonatal ward, alert clinicians promptly M a n u s c r i p t 6 identified the index neonatal COVID-19 cases, as the incidence of communitytransmitted SARS-CoV-2 in Cape Town was escalating.These two neonates with HA COVID-19 presented with clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings in keeping with that described in a recent systematic review. 4 Treatment for COVID-19 infected neonates to date has been supportive care only with excellent outcomes described. 4 Although both neonates required several days of respiratory support, both recovered without any specific treatment. The cluster of seven symptomatic (six confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected) staff temporally-linked to the neonatal cases fulfilled local criteria for initiating an outbreak investigation. 10 An outbreak investigation team was assembled including neonatology, infectious diseases, infection prevention and public health specialists. For each affected patient and staff member the outbreak team documented potential COVID-19 exposures and infectious periods, to facilitate contact tracing. Although many hospital-wide COVID-19 infection prevention policies were in place, there were initial delays in staff screening, testing and access to COVID-19 test results. As universal masking was not fully implemented at the time of the outbreak, many high-risk staff-to-staff exposures occurred resulting in severe nursing shortages while staff completed the required quarantine period. This created ongoing challenges in patient care and environmental cleaning of rooms and equipment. The 2-week ward closure to new admissions allowed staff to maintain high-quality neonatal care despite the staff shortages.Although the source case in this outbreak was not confirmed, the timeline, symptoms and subsequent transmission chains strongly suggested COVID-19 infection in Nurse 1. Further factors that facilitated rapid spread from the putative source case were the shared rooms with 8 babies each, crowded physical space, poor ventilation, difficulty in physically distancing, delayed presentation for SARS-CoV-2 staff testing and presenteeism (4 staff worked additional shifts after the onset of possible COVID-19 symptoms and prior to laboratory testing).This first report of HA COVID-19 infections in a neonatal ward highlights the propensity of SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted in overcrowded settings, with vulnerable patients who have prolonged hospital stays.These cases also emphasize the need for rapid access to SARS-CoV-2 testing for hospital staff and caregivers of hospitalized neonates to ensure prompt detection of COVID-19. Adherence to quarantine until COVID-19 PCR results are available is critical to avoid additional staff exposures and negative impacts on patient care. Implementation of universal masking and bi-daily COVID-19 symptom screening for staff and mothers in the neonatal unit terminated the outbreak, with no further HA COVID-19 transmission events.","South Africa","first author","2020-12-02",12

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with non-specific symptoms, although a few becoming critically ill with septic shock and multiple organ failure. There is an unknown proportion of infected individuals who remain asymptomatic and infectious. Universal screening for infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. We highlight a Cochrane rapid review which assessed the effectiveness and accuracy of universal screening for COVID-19 infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an ongoing global pandemic. COVID-19 protocols such as universal screening have included strategies to minimise the spread of the virus to identify any of the symptoms suggestive of having been infected [1] [2] [3] . The screening protocols include temperature checks or asking about international travel or contact with COVID-19 patients, or performing rapid diagnostic tests. Screening can also occur over the telephone, online, or in person, in homes, clinics, workplaces, airports or schools. Such a strategy has limitation given that some people may be infected with COVID-19 virus during incubation period; variation in the severity and detectability of symptoms once the disease begins to progress; imperfect performance of screening equipment or personnel; or active evasion of screening by travellers [1, 4, 5] . To limit the spread of this virus, the identification of infected people become critical as a measure to contain the spread of the disease. Infected individuals can seek appropriate healthcare and stay away from others. Screening accompanied by rapid diagnostic tests which are later confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been broadly implemented as a strategy to prevent further transmission of COVID-19 [2, 6] . In this commentary, we discuss a Cochrane rapid review by Viswanathan and colleagues on the effectiveness of universal screening for COVID-19 infection compared with no screening and to determine the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID-19. The review assessed the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with no screening, and the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID-19 [7] . Specifically, the review authors assessed the 1) effectiveness of universal screening, screening among people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms related to COVID-19, for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with (a) no screening or (b) screening in selected populations based on occupation, geographic setting, or community characteristics? Outcomes include incident cases, missed cases, successfully detected cases, averted cases, reduced transmission, mortality, false alarm, and false reassurance.2) The accuracy of universal screening strategies among people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms related to COVID-19 for SARS-CoV-2 infection? Outcomes include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. On the Several databases were searched to identify studies to be included.Searches were conducted in various databases between 04 April 2020 -26 May 2020 to identifies trials, observational studies and modelling studies assessing the effectiveness and accuracy of screening in the general population. The databases searched were Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database, Embase.com, the Central, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, LitCOVID, and three model repositories (COVID-Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS] , and Society for Medical Decision Making). The review authors included randomized and nonrandomized studies and modelling studies to answer the question of screening effectiveness. For accuracy, the review authors included study designs on patients that provided information on test accuracy which also included modelling studies. The languages considered were English and Chinese. Screening of articles was conducted followed by data extraction and the assessment of the quality of the included studies conducted in duplicate. The results were synthesized narratively and in a tabular form. Paired forest plot for sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence interval reported. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used for assessment of certainty of the evidence the synthesized studies.The review included 22 publications with 17 cohort studies reporting on diagnostic accuracy and 5 modelling studies reporting on the effectiveness of screening and screening test accuracy. The studies were conducted in the United States of America, Europe, and Asia. The modelling studies that evaluated the effectiveness of screening strategies which included symptoms screening of air travellers and symptomatic laboratory testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers in emergency departments. To assess the effectiveness of screening, one study suggested that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases. The authors assessed risk of bias as minor or with no concerns, and low certainty of evidence, but further downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study indicated that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers. The certainty of evidence was downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening.To assess the accuracy of screening, all 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference RT-PCR test. Only one study reported on the accuracy of single point-in-time screening and varied widely in the prevalence of COVID-19, settings, and method of measurement. The overall risk of bias was unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. One study was rated at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalence. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. All screening strategies in 17 studies with 17,574 people incorrectly identified infected people as healthy; healthy people as infected. Thirteen studies which included 16,762 people incorrectly identified infected people as healthy and healthy people as infected. A similar trend observed in 6 studies with 14,741 people where temperature measurements were taken and asking about international travel, exposure to known infected people and exposure to known or suspected infected people. Also asking about symptoms plus temperature measurement observed in 2 studies with 779 people incorrectly identified infected people as healthy and healthy people as infected. Three studies modelling entry and exit screening in airports indicated 70% of infected travellers being missed while another detected 90% of infections but used an unrealistic scenario. The third study used very unreliable methods which the review authors could not use evidence from this study. The review authors highlight that there are limitations in the confidence of these findings because most studies did not describe their screening methods clearly, some found very few cases of infections and the types of participants and settings varied greatly, making it difficult to judge whether the results apply broadly.The ability to perform effective screening for COVID-19 infection at the earliest presentation is a critically important first step to curbing the spread of the virus in any setting [8] . COVID-19 has presented challenges with screening infected individuals as many may not present symptoms at the time of screening [1, 5, 9] . Screening at entry points such as airports may only yield 9% of accurate case detection since many with mild symptoms, asymptomatic, concealed symptoms and pre-symptomatic are likely to be undetected during the screening process [9] . World Health Organization recommends screening for infectious diseases in a two-step process, namely primary and secondary screening, most notable with the Ebola crisis [9] . Primary screening can be performed by trained personnel who may or may not be a medical professional and this includes temperature and symptoms screening [9] . The secondary screening performed by medical professional which include an in-depth interview, laboratory test and secondary temperature screening [9] .African countries have challenges with implementing many of the recommended strategies because of weak public health infrastructures while having the greatest infectious disease burdens beside COVID-19 [10]. It is therefore paramount for African countries to have effective screening strategies for the rapidly spreading COVID-19 to alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. Results from this review have shown very low certainty of evidence of screening methods with most of the studies showing low sensitivity and low specificity for the screening strategies implemented in different studies [7] . Even when strategies were combined, there was still low certainty of evidence that some of these strategies could be effective in many settings [7] . Most countries within the African region have implemented their screening strategies [10] and according to the review authors, the screening strategies are only likely to slow down transmission slightly as few infections could be potentially detected through most of these methods while missing approximately 70% of infections using some of the screening strategies [7] . The authors agree that there is a need for more research on rapid laboratory test combined with screening and for better reference standards to effectively to curb the spread of COVID-19 [7] . Research on costeffective screening strategies is also needed in African countries given the already strained public health systems.The findings from this review suggest that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. However, the uncertainty and variation in the accuracy of screening strategies suggest that a high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. This becomes critical as many African countries open their borders to resuming economic activity. While the African continent had a relatively low number of cases compared to high-income countries, screening at borders remains the only tool available to ensure that there is no importation of new cases to Africa. As thus, studies are needed to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. The accuracy of RT-PCR is needed for further research to be used as a reference standard. Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, the findings of this review point to the greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmissions such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.Universal screening for COVID-19 is used as a strategy to assess potential individuals who may need to be isolated and seek medical care; 2.The screening method uses a questionnaire accompanied by a temperature check to assess if a person may have been infected with COVID-19; 3.Asymptomatic individuals do not present with symptoms which make the screening likely to miss infected individuals.The current screening approach is likely to miss the asymptomatic individual infected with COVID-19; 5.As many countries open their borders, this study emphases the need to incorporate multiple screening approaches which incorporate point of care tests for everyone in their screening protocols to ensure that there is a rapid response in the management of cases.","South Africa","first author","2020-12-16",12

Over the period, COVID-19 has infected close to 26 million people worldwide with close to 1 million fatalities reported, necessitating the WHO to declare it a pandemic. With no viable vaccine at the moment, COVID-19 has initiated efforts focussed on containment and strategies aimed at reducing infections and fatalities. On the global platform, there has been a flurry of activity in determining the best strategy in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A host of countries have instituted interventions not limited to social distancing, curfews, and total lockdowns. In [2] , a model taking into consideration bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission network was implemented, where reproduction numbers R 0 were computed to determine the transmissibility of the virus between people and reservoirs. e value of R 0 of reservoir to people was found to be 2.30 while that of people to people was 3.5. In [3] , they delved into mathematical models of the COVID-19, and with a reproduction number of 2, they considered an SEIR model to model the effects of local social gatherings. With a 14-day infectious period, the model showed that, with 18-hour exposure, the attendees of the event had a protection efficacy of 70%. In [4] , a conceptual SEIR model to gauge the effects of individual reactions and government reactions was investigated. is was in line with the Chinese government implementation of social distancing measures in areas considered as epicenters. e model incorporated zoonotic introductions and emigrations and showed that there were close relations with reported cases, even though asymptomatic transmission could not be established. In Ontario, Canada, Tuite et al. [5] implemented a mathematical model for transmission and mitigation strategies. ey considered measures taken in the population which included quarantine, isolation of infectious cases, and hospitalization with intensive care unit (ICU) cases. It was reported that, in the absence of substantial physical social distancing and enhanced case detection and isolation, the ICU resources would be quickly overwhelmed. In [6] , the authors considered a model for the prediction of new cases and made a comparison study of the United States of America, India, and Italy. Different scenarios under physical distancing measures such as lockdown were considered, and predictions were made using the available data. It was reported that, without mitigation of physical interaction of the populations, the peaks of infections would be realised much earlier in all the three countries.Of late, the modeling efforts have advanced to cater for age-structured modeling to determine the transmission across different age strata. In [7] , they use an age-structured SIR model with social contact matrices from surveys and Bayesian imputation to gauge the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in India, where they use a generalization of the time-dependent R 0 case study data, age distribution, and social contact structure. eir predictions implore on the duration of social distancing mitigation on such lockdowns and give a scope of when periodic ease of the lockdowns can be implemented. Further age-structured morbidity and mortality are reduced on implementation of these measures. Ivorra et al. [8] investigated a more complex variant of the SEIR referred to as θ-SEIHRD model to take into account the undetected infections and based their study in China.eir study showed that mitigation measures of limiting physical contact decrease the basic reproduction number, and subsequently, there is a reduction in infections. Further brisk detection is needed in order to reduce the number of infections. In [9] , results of social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic are presented. ey simulate the reduction of reproduction numbers as a result of social distancing measures. In [10] , an important parameter referred to as the identification parameter is included in the simulations to predict the peaks of the epidemic in Japan.is parameter is the ratio between the positive cases to the number of tests performed. Further, they used available data and the least-square-based procedure with Poisson noise to estimate the infection rate as a function of the identification rate, and they considered an SEIR compartmental model. ey report that interventions have a positive effect in delaying the peak of the epidemic, and they propose longer interventions to contain the epidemic. e results of the research studies outlined provide techniques knowledge on implementing a mathematical model for the epidemic in Kenya. Recently, in [11] , the authors outlined the forecast of the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya. In the study, they investigated the dissimilarities between China and Kenya in terms of demographics and geography. ey forecasted the potential incidence rate and magnitude of the epidemic using the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed cases in China. ey reported that the number of infected cases is likely to be high and that isolation of the asymptomatic infectious population will not be an adequate measure.Further, they proposed exceptional social distancing to ""flatten the curve"" and cautioned on the expected rebound of infections when the restrictions are lifted. In [12] , an SEIR model was implemented taking into consideration the population's interaction with the environment.is was achieved by considering the environment as the host of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the absence of social distancing, transmission and spread of COVID-19 was rife. As at 7 May 2020, Kenya had performed 28,002 tests, with 607 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19, 197 recoveries, and 29 fatalities [13] . e country's peak is not yet predicted and, in this paper, we investigate a variant of the SEIR model to predict the peaks of the infections, severity of the illness, and fatalities with and without the nonpharmaceutical measures.To model the mitigation efforts to curb the transmission and spread of COVID-19, we use the compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model. We consider human-human transmission and divide the human population N at a time t into eight compartments. e susceptible population is denoted by S(t), the exposed population by E(t), the asymptomatic infectious population by A(t), the mild symptomatic population by M(t), the population who are severe and hospitalized by H(t), the critically ill population in the intensive care unit (ICU) by C(t), the recovered population by R(t), and the fatalities by D(t). Hence, the total human population is given as follows:(1) S(t) is the human population in Kenya that may be infected with (SARS-CoV-2) virus. e susceptible individuals move to E(t) after the incubation period to the onset of the disease. e exposed individuals move to either asymptomatic A(t) or the mild symptomatic M(t). Assuming the population in the asymptomatic have ""immunocompetency,"" they move to R(t). e population from M(t) can move either to R(t) or if their conditions deteriorate warranting hospitalization, they move to H(t) and are considered severe. e severe population on assessment can move to critical compartment C(t), and if their condition improves and becomes less critical, they are referred back to the general ward as severe cases. Further, on improved conditions, they recover and move to R(t).e population in C(t) who succumb move to D(t).On 13 March 2020, after the first confirmed case, the Government of Kenya (GOK) instituted measures towards addressing the spread and transmission of COVID-19. e measures and interventions initially include a dusk-dawn curfew and massive campaign and sensitization measures of social and physical distancing. On 6 April 2020, the GOK extended and upscaled these measures with partial lockdowns in towns considered as hotspots in Kenya. ese measures constituted enabled the formulation of assumptions for the development of the mathematical model. We assume the following: Figure 1 culminates to an eight-dimensional dynamical system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given bywith the initial conditions:e parameters used in the model are given in Table 1 . e terms (β 1 SA/N) and (β 2 SM/N) describe the rate at which the susceptible population are infected by the asymptomatic population and the mild symptomatic, respectively.In order to gauge the extent of the spread of COVID-19, experts have recommended extensive testing in the populations, but due to economic constraints in the country and globally, this testing has been below par. erefore, many countries have resorted to introducing a wide range of NPIs to at least slow down the epidemic spread as they gather resources for mass testing and isolation of confirmed cases. In order to simulate and predict infection cases from the model, we use the framework developed by [10] . In this case, it is assumed only a fraction of the infected individuals are identified by the diagnosis. is fraction is given by p and it is referred to as the identification parameter which is 0 < p < 1. For this study, p is calculated as the ratio of the confirmed cases to the tests performed. Its usage in this study is as follows: suppose S + E + A + M + H + C + R + D � 1, and one person is infected in Kenya of population 4.76 × 10 7 at time t � 0. en, the infectious individuals. At any time t, the number of infectious individuals is given byTo determine the DFE of the COVID-19 in Kenya, we solve the system of equations (2) after equating the right-hand side of the system to zeros. In this case, A � 0, M � 0, and H � 0, and subsequently, C � 0, R � 0, and D � 0, which yields a DFE point as (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) .We compute the basic reproduction number R 0 at DFE using the next-generation approach. Let x � (E, A,Obtaining the derivatives of F(x) and V(x) at DFE point yields F and V matrices as follows:e R 0 is the spectral radius of the product of FV − 1 :where R 0 is given byis R 0 consists of two terms showing transmission by the asymptomatic population and the mild symptomatic population.e endemic equilibrium point of model (2) is determined as positive steady state in which the COVID-19 is said to persist in a given population.e COVID-19 model has a unique endemic equilibrium point when R 0 > 1; otherwise, the endemic equilibrium does not exist.Proof. Suppose that (S * , E * , A * , M * , H * , C * , R * , D * ) is a nontrivial equilibrium point of (2). From (11) and (12), we getFrom (14), we getFrom (15), we getFrom (13), we getUsing (18) in (19) yieldsFrom (15), we getBoth A * and M * should satisfyUsing (23) in (22) yieldsUsing (23) in (16) yieldsAn endemic scenario I ≈ αN, where α is the attack rate, since almost everyone gets infected. erefore, solving the following equations simultaneously yields A * and M * :Hence,In the quest to determine the level of preparedness to curb the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict future numbers of daily infection cases and cumulative infections. is provides a basis for policymakers to know when the available healthcare infrastructure is likely to be overwhelmed. In this section, we used a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for nonlinear Gaussian functions to estimate the daily and cumulative cases from Kenya's data of daily confirmed cases. Using 20,000 iterations of the MCMC procedure, we are able to predict the daily infection cases and the cumulative infections for a period of 90 days. Using the available daily data of the COVID-19 cases [13] , we are able to use these procedures to predict the daily infection cases as shown in Figure 2 and when the country is likely to have reported the first 1,000 infection cases from In this section, we report on the results of simulations of the COVID-19 model. e model's equation (2) is solved using a fourth-and fifth-order Runge-Kutta method, which is implemented in MATLAB. We consider N � 4.76 × 10 7 people which is Kenya's total population as per the 2019 census. e simulations are done using the parameters listed in Table 1 . e human-human contact reduction measures we consider are school closedown, dusk-to-dawn curfew, and partial lockdowns in towns and cities perceived as COVID-19 hotspots. e essence of contact reduction is to mitigate the interaction between the susceptible and infectious populations. Based on studies of COVID-19 spread in China, Italy, and Spain, we suppose that if no mitigation measures are in place, then an infectious individual would infect three secondary cases, in his/her interaction sphere. us, we consider the R 0 as 3, for the unmitigated scenario. e first case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed in Kenya on 13 March 2020. On 16 March 2020, schools were closed, which was the first NPI that was implemented by the Kenyan government. en 14 days into the school closedown, curfew measures were implemented. ereafter 24 days into school closedown, partial lockdown was implemented. In our simulations, we implement the school Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases closure for 210 days, curfew for 196 days, and partial lockdown for 186 days. is is done via a time-dependent R 0 , which was taken as a cosine function (see [9] ). We presume that school closure yields a 20% reduction in contact while adding a curfew on to the school closure results in a 40% reduction, and introduction of the partial lockdown on to the other two NPIs yields a 60% reduction in contacts as shown in Figure 4 .A reduction in R 0 implies that fewer individuals are being infected, and hence, the disease spread is slowed down. In Figure 5 , predictions of the daily confirmed cases and the prediction of the cumulative infections are given which shows that, with a basic reproduction number of greater than 1, the infections shall continue increasing.In Figures 6(a) and 6(b) , we report on the simulation of infections and the cumulative infections under different scenarios.ese different scenarios are when there is no mitigation, when the schools are closed, when schools are closed and dusk-dawn curfew is instituted, and when schools are closed, curfew is in place, and partial lockdown is in place.From the figures, we deduce that the NPIs instituted aid in containment of the epidemic spread, resulting in fewer people being infected as compared with the unmitigated scenario. In particular, we see a much higher peak of infections in the unmitigated scenario, which arrives much faster due to the high rate of infections when R 0 � 3.0. For the first two NPIs, the infection peaks are lower and come at a later date. When all the three NPIs are combined, resulting in R 0 of 1.2, the infections peak at a much lower value and the epidemic begins to subside. However, this leaves a large population in the susceptible compartment such that when the value of R 0 begins to rise, towards the end of the NPI duration, a rebound of infections occurs. Due to the effectiveness of the combined NPIs, the new peak is much lower and the epidemic is eradicated. e measures result in a reduction in the cumulative number of infections (see Figure 6 (b)). Combining all the three NPIs leads to a significant delay of the epidemic spread, a time the health system can utilize to put mechanisms and facilities to respond to the epidemic appropriately.In Figures 7(a) and 7(b) , we report on the number of severe cases of COVID-19 who are hospitalized. Reduction of the severe cases is important as this represents the proportion of the population who are directly utilizing the healthcare facilities at a given time. Due to limited hospital infrastructure and resources, delay of this peak is vital for the health systems to prepare for a guaranteed influx of patients in need of medical attention. Furthermore, any Figure 7 : Over the duration of the implementation of the NPIs, the daily severe cases are shown in (a) where the duration of these interventions is indicated by the colored region. In (b), the cumulative severe cases for the three mitigation measures are shown. It shows that the implementation of the three measures leads to a reduced number of severe cases. reduction of the hospitalized results in significant reduction of severe cases transfer to critical cases that require ICU services. From Figures 7(a) and 7(b) , we deduce that stringent implementation of the NPIs is key in ensuring the available hospital infrastructure is not overwhelmed during the epidemic. e national government and county governments under the Health Ministry directive have boosted the bed capacity at all hospital levels, including establishing isolation centers. If schools are closed, curfew is implemented and lockdown is instituted, the simulation shows that the hospitalized population may not overwhelm the established healthcare infrastructure capacity.In Obviously, fatalities from COVID-19 will have the highest peak if NPIs are not instituted. From Figure 8(a) , delayed peaks are realised if the NPIs are in place and the best scenario is if the considered measures are combined, for the considered duration of implementation. A rebound of infections also results in a resurgence of fatalities due to the severity of the disease, especially among the older population.Since COVID-19 vaccine development will take a significantly longer period of time before it becomes globally available, it is imperative on all medical sectors in the country to adhere to mitigation measures and intervention policies set by the government. e implementation of school closure, dusk-to-dawn curfew, and partial lockdown is the measure in curbing the spread of COVID-19 that are effective and lead to the flattening of the curve within the duration of implementation. Relaxation of the mitigation measures on or before September 2020 will likely lead to a resurgence and the country may experience a new wave of infections. Devoid of the aftershocks of these interventions, the country will have no infections as at 31 December 2020.is model developed at the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the projections of infections and fatalities as a result of the pandemic in Kenya.

These viruses are known to be common in animals around the world with very few cases known to affect humans. The World Health Organization was notified about a possible emergence of a novel coronavirus infectious disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. The virus was thereafter named COVID-19. The epidemic spread to 19 countries with 11,791 confirmed cases and 213 deaths as of 31/01/2020 which prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Importance. However, due to the widespread of the virus from China to other countries, the COVID-19 virus was declared a pandemic on 11/03/ 2020 [2] . The first case of the virus in Nigeria was announced by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on the 28/02/2020. As at 30/05/2020, the total global cases of the pandemic was 5,968,693 confirmed cases with 365,796 deaths, the United States of America recorded 1,749,846 confirmed cases with 102,900 deaths while Nigeria recorded 9,855 confirmed cases and 273 deaths attributed to the pandemic.Factors such as access to quality healthcare, inadequate medical personnel, poor technology, and high rate of poverty have been attributed to the prediction that Africa will be the worst impact from the effect of the pandemic. However, fear and anxiety have been identified as a powerful emotion that can be associated with overwhelming reports of the COVID-19 pandemic through social, electronic and print media. Considerable anxiety is natural and promotes preventive and protective behaviour [3] . But at the peak of the pandemic situation, people with persistent anxiety can panic and are more likely to make mistakes that lead to irrational decisions and behaviour. It should be noted that such fears have generated stigmatization against those with likely symptoms of the pandemic especially in developing countries like Nigeria. In some health facilities in Nigeria, a lot of patients have been denied access to healthcare and this has led to several avoidable deaths recorded during the current pandemic period. In the light of the pandemic challenge faced by the world, it was observed that most of the related studies focused more on the assessment and estimation of the confirmed cases and mortality of the COVID-19 while little or no study considered the survival rate of the COVID-19 patients. Assessing the survival rate of COVID-19 patients is important because the outcome of the study can be used to examine the quality or effectiveness of treatment rendered in managing the pandemic in Nigeria or the world in general. Hence, the need for the present study to examine the survival rate of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nigeria.The author [4] considered a holistic picture of the current research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Their results showed that numerous studies on the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus, have been published. They noted that most studies reviewed have focused on the epidemiology and potential causes. While studies exploring prevention and control measures began to increase gradually. It has been observed that most government agencies around the world have quickly incorporated recent scientific discoveries into public policy at the community, regional and national levels to slow and/or prevent the spread of COVID-19.The author [5] stated that as of 18 th March 2020 about 46 out of the 47 World Health Organization (WHO) member states from 56 African countries have recorded more than 2,400 cases of COVID-19, with South Africa leading with more than 700 cases. Egypt has the second highest with more than 400 cases and more than 20 deaths, followed by Algeria with more than 260 confirmed cases and more than 19 deaths, while Sudan has the lowest record of one death in the 2 cases reported within this period.A study by [2] examined the preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. The study estimated early transferability through time-varying reproductive numbers using the Bayesian method, which takes into account uncertainties in the distribution of the serial interval. In this case, they took into account the time interval between the appearance of symptoms in an infected person and the infector and were further adjusted for importing the disease. It was found that 318 confirmed cases and 10 virus-related deaths were recorded in Nigeria were recorded in Nigeria as of April 11, 2020 . The study found that on day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 with a doubling time of 9.84 days.In their study, [6] considered estimating the serial interval of the novel coronavirus from information obtained from 28 infectorsinfectee pairs. The study employed the Bayesian approach with the doubly interval-censored likelihood to obtain the estimated serial interval. The outcome of the study found an estimated median serial interval of 4 days. This result shows that the serial interval of the new coronavirus is close to or shorter than its mean incubation time.A study by [7] noted that machine learning can be used to offer a solution to a challenging problem like COVID-19 by improving existing predictive models, identifying vulnerable groups, diagnosing early, driving drug delivery, assessing the likelihood, and developing the problem into integrated systems for Spatial-temporal prediction, assessment of the risk of infection, further development of reliable biomedical knowledge graphs and data mining of social networks. The authors noted that due to the novelty of the COVID19, the lack of quality data has been attributed to the inaccuracy of many machine learning models in predicting the outbreak and mortality rate in many nations. However, the potency of machine learning-based model relies on choosing the right model according to the context and the relevant assumptions. In support of the argument by [7] , author [8] speaking on employing artificial intelligence (AI) in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, he explained that the lack of adequate and unbiased time series data has hindered the use of artificial intelligence in providing a solution to the fight against the COVID-19. However, the growing number of international contributions for more diagnostic testing and the use of other analytical tools should be encouraged for providing policymakers with inferences that will help in the effective management of the pandemic and reducing its cost in human lives and economic damage. Also, [3] examining the anxiety and fear of being infected among healthcare workers during the pandemic situation observed that most dental practitioners across the globe are aware of the pandemic. But a high level of fears exists while providing medical services due to the COVID-19. This situation has led to a number of the practitioners to either modify their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.The source of the data used for this study was the secondary data obtained from the daily publication/report of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from 28 th February 2020 to 30 th June 2020.The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) approach has been identified as a useful tool for estimating and predicting the epidemic trend of diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A few months after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, several publications have contributed to the body of knowledge in trying to determine the trend of the COVID-2019 pandemic using different approaches ( [6] ; [9] ; [11] ; [12] ; [13] ).One of the forecasting approaches used in some literature was the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model [11 -14] . The ARIMA model could be considered as one of the most widely used prediction models for epidemic time series [14] . It is often used in nonstationary time series to capture the linear trend of an epidemic or disease. In particular, it is possible to predict a certain time series taking into account its lags. This can be achieved by taking into account the previous values of the time series and the forecast errors. However, the choice of the ARIMA forecasting approach in the present study is because the ARIMA model does not account for noise and the sensitivity of the model in identifying outliers in the data. The ARIMA model is known to work effectively for relatively short series especially when the number of observation is not sufficient to apply more flexible methods. The COVID-19 pandemic is novel and lack of sufficient time-series data on COVID-19 cases across the globe has hindered the use of other approaches such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Hence, the reason for the choice of the ARIMA model for the present study. Also, the ARIMA model requires only the prior data of a time series to generalize the forecast due to the strict statistical approach involved in building the model [15] . This indicates that the ARIMA model increases the forecast accuracy while keeping the number of parameters to a minimum. One disadvantage of using the ARIMA model is the ability to identify an appropriate ARIMA model for the series of interest.ARIMA models are also known as Box-Jenkins models which require historical chronological data of the underlying variables. The time-series approach involves three stages, namely the process of identifying the model, estimating the parameters, and verifying the model. At the model identification stage, the data series is determined if the series is stationary before the development of the Box-Jenkins model or the ARIMA model. A stationary series in the Box-Jenkins model will have a constant mean, a constant variance, and a constant autocorrelation. For a non-stationary series, a differentiation on the non-stationary series one or more times will be made to achieve stationary.The order (the p and q) of the autoregressive and moving average terms can be identified when the series has been tested for stationarity. The tools employed for determining the order of the model are the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF). The procedure used to identify the terms of the autoregressive or moving average models is given below; a. An ACF with a steady decline and a PACF which cut off suddenly after p lags indicates an autoregressive process at lag p, AR(p).b. An ACF that cuts off suddenly after q lags and a PACF with steady decline indicates a moving average process at lag q, MA(q). Also, when both the ACF and PACF have large spikes that are gradually becoming extinct, it indicates that there are both autoregressive and moving average processes. In the present study, the Auto ARIMA approach was used to determine the appropriate ARIMA model for the study. The auto ARIMA function uses the generated AIC and BIC to determine the best combination of parameters for the model. The AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) values are estimators for comparing the models. The lower these values, the better the model.Suppose we consider the following ARIMA model define by [16] as:Equation (1) can also be expressed as:The degree of homogeneity d is determined in the identification process while is the response variable representing the stationary series. However, the model parameters are estimated using the least-squares method.The response variable in this study is the daily survival rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria which was computed using the formula:Survival Rate = Number of Discharged Patients / Total number of active casesThe required data to compute equation (5) was obtained from the daily report of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from 28 th February 2020 to 30 th June 2020 and presented in table 1. The report showed that the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Nigeria was 28 th February 2020. 30  28  3  16  0  0  31  29  3  16  0  0  32  30  3  16  0  0  33  31  3  34  0  0  34  1  4 The result presented in table 2 shows the descriptive analysis of the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria from 28/02/2020 to 30/06/2020. The result obtained in table 2 found a daily mean survival rate of 27.5% with a median of 25.4% and a coefficient of variation of 85.41. The Skewness was found to be 0.56 while the Kurtosis was -0.37. The low mean and median survival rate can be attributed to the non-existence of an approved vaccine or treatment procedure for the pandemic.A test of stationarity was carried out as required for the ARIMA model using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. H 00 : Series has a unit root (Non-Stationarity) Versus H 01 : Series has no unit root (Stationarity) The result of the unit root test on the variable using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test statistic obtained in table 3 found that the series has no unit root and stationary overtime at integration order of zero (0) since the test statistic value has a more negative value than the critical values and p-value falling on the rejection region assuming a 95% confidence level. This result implies that the series has no unit root and can be used to make a forecast for future behaviour of the process.The auto ARIMA function in R software was employed as discussed in the methodology to identify the appropriate ARIMA model for forecasting the Survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria using data from 28/02/2020 (the official date of report of the first confirmed case of COVID19 in Nigeria) to 31/05/2020 (which comprises of 76% of the total data set) while data from 01/06/2020 to 30/06/2020 (which comprises of 24% of the total data set) was used to verify the adequacy of the obtained ARIMA model for the estimation of survival rate of COVID19 patients in Nigeria.The result of the auto ARIMA function was obtained as: Series: Survival_Rate ARIMA(0,1,1) The result obtained in figure 1 shows that the distribution of the survival rate of COVID19 patients in Nigeria from 28/02/2020 to 31/05/2020 has a random increasing trend from the date of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The result in table 5 showed that by 01/06/2020 and 30/06/2020 the survival rate of COVID-19 patients will be about 38.99% all things being equal. Also, the result obtained from figure 2 showed that there is very little variation between the forecasted and actual survival rate of COVID-19 for June 2020. This result implies that the obtained model is adequate for estimating the survival rate of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The novel coronavirus is a disease threatening the population size and economic activities across the world. Due to the rate of poverty in Africa as well as poor access to quality healthcare, inadequate medical personnel, and poor technology, Africa has been predicted to be amongst the worst hit by the COVID-19 in the world. This study examined the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria using a tine series approach unlike studies such as [4] which focused on epidemiology and potential causes of the pandemic and [5] which considered the number of confirmed cases in some Africa countries.The data for the study was split into 76:24 ratio where 76% (this comprises of data on the survival rate of patients from 28/02/2020 to 31/05/2020) data was being used for building the ARIMA model and 24% (data on the survival rate of patients from 01/06/2020 to 30/06/2020) was used for testing the adequacy model in estimating the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria.The mean daily survival rate of COVID-19 patients was found to be 27.5% with a median survival rate of 25.4% which is below 50%. The low mean and median survival rates can be attributed to the lack of an approved vaccine or treatment regimen for the pandemic. Also, the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) was identified to be appropriate for predicting the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria within the observed period. Further findings showed that little variation exists between the forecasted and actual survival rate of COVID19 for June 2020 which indicates that the obtained ARIMA (0, 1, 1) model is adequate for estimating the survival rate of COVID19 in Nigeria.The outcome of the present study found that the daily mean and median survival rate of COVID-19 was below 50%, hence the need for the Nigerian government to explore effective treatment strategies both internationally and locally to improve the survival rate of patients with the disease. Also, the government should encourage local manufacturing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as garment, which is expected to help health workers effectively manage affected persons without fear of being infected at the front line.In addition, there is a need for the media to shun instilling unnecessary fear about the virus on the people because this has given birth to the stigmatization of a person suspected to have the symptoms. Rather we recommend that the media should focus more on educating the people on the recent guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO) on how to stop the spread of the virus.Also, the media practitioners delivering the COVID-19 guidelines should do that by example by wearing their face mask during the delivery and observe the acceptable physical distancing. This will help the viewers to learn and adapt easily in the challenging fight against the pandemic.","Nigeria","first author","2020-12-30",12

Amongst those most vulnerable to the virus are older adults (Shahid et al., 2020) , having led to shielding in many countries, in addition to public health measures of lockdown, social distancing, wearing protective masks and gloves and washing hands regularly.Experiences of public health measures and their impacts are likely to differ between countries, possibly even more so between high-and low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). In Uganda, older adults (aged 60 and above) form 2.7 percent of the population (United Nations, 2017) and are amongst the poorest members of society without a steady income or state pension system (Kowal et al., 2010) . Most older people in Uganda (and generally in sub-Saharan Africa) are living with family members in multi-generational households with their children and grandchildren , with younger generations looking after their elderly. However, without a reliable and consistent income, and high levels of chronic conditions in older adults, accessing healthcare is very limited and often restricted to basic medicines (Nawagi et al., 2018) . Considering that the proportion of older adults is rising faster in LMIC, with the latest figures from 2015 of 46 million older adults in sub-Saharan Africa estimated to be more than triple by 2050 (United Nations, 2018) .LMICs are likely to be more severely impacted by COVID-19 outbreaks. This is because of poor living standards which are common and include: poor access to food, water and other basic necessities (such as medication), less well-established healthcare systems (which might be too expensive to access), as well as overcrowded living facilities (Hodkinson et al., 2020) . These factors can all contribute to the faster spread of the virus, and without appropriate and implemented public health measures containment might be impossible. Older adults in LMIC might particularly struggle due to poorer living conditions and potential inabilities to adhere to measures due to lack of water and sanitation facilities (Lloyd-Sherlock et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 pandemic is shown to have a severe impact on people's lives, whether by directly being infected with the virus or dealing with public health restrictions (Chen et al., 2020; Wright et al., 2020) . However, it is unclear to what extent the public health measures as such are impacting on the lives of older adults in LMIC, including Uganda.The aim of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 public health restrictions (including social distancing, curfew, increased hand washing and face masks) on the lives of older adults in Uganda. To date, no research has explored the indirect effects of COVID-19 on the lives of people of any age in a LMIC. Knowledge about how COVID-19 public health restrictions are affecting some of the most vulnerable in our societies can help to identify potential strategies to supporting them better. Considering the expected longevity of COVID-19 and its impacts on people's lives, it is important to ensure that public health measures keep people safe and ensure their well-being, and do not cause any harm.Participants and recruitment Older adults aged 60 or above living in Uganda were eligible to take part. Participants' phone contacts were retrieved from a list of registered older persons from the Mukono district, approximately 24 km from the capital of Uganda. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling, and those who agreed to take part were interviewed in the order people had agreed to participate. Age (60 years or above) guided the sampling of the participants' phone contacts. Ethical approval was obtained from The Aids Support Organization Research Ethic Committee [Ref: TASOREC/084/20-UG-REC-009] and individual consent approval was sought from the participants as well.In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted by two trained research assistants in June 2020. Phone call interviews lasted approximately 25-60 minutes in a free and flowing in-depth discussion and were audiorecorded. Verbal informed consent was obtained at the beginning of the interview. The interview questions to participants were asked in ""Luganda"", which is a locally spoken dialect. Verbatim of all the audiorecorded interviews were transcribed in the local dialect and then those transcripts were back translated into English by the research assistants supervised by ID. This process was chosen to ensure the original meaning of the participant's thoughts/statements, so that no response was altered or lost in the process of transcription.A semi-structured interview guide was developed by the team to understand the impact of public health restrictions on the well-being of older persons. The opening question focused on highlighting older adults' living situations, how they spent their days before the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of public health restrictions on their daily life, their perception on their inability to perform certain tasks due to the public health measures and how the public health measures have affected their social life.The analysis followed thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) deductively focusing on how corona virus public health measures affected the well-being of older persons in Uganda. The transcripts were then entered into Atlas from where they were coded into a codebook developed by the study team. Textual data relating to the theme would be highlighted and attached to the corresponding them. A manual process of pile sorting similar quotes attached to particular codes was conducted which led to the identification of sub-themes under each code. One researcher coded by hand without software. These were summarized into mini-statements from which following a perusal process, the main themes were derived. Codes and themes were discussed amongst the team after individual coding, and final themes were agreed upon.Thirty older adults took part in this study. Participants were mostly female (76.7%) and on average 74 years (±8, 60-88 range) old. All participants lived in multi-generational households.Thematic analysis generated five overarching themes, with further sub-themes also highlighted in Table 1 : (1) economic impacts; (2) lack of access to basic necessities; (3) impact on healthcare utilization; (4) social impacts and (5) violent reinforcement of public health restrictions. Overall, most older adults were impacted by public health restrictions in some form, whilst some people appeared to be affected very little due to lack of mobility and generally staying at home. THEME 1: Economic impactsOlder adults often relied on their children to give them money or food, many of whom are now unable to work due to the public health restrictions. Many older adults had some farm land they maintained and worked on every day. However, due to COVID-19 public health restrictions and lack of transport, they were now unable to reach the farm and create extra produce to sell. Similarly, some participants were digging every day in their garden and usually sold some limited surplus either at a stall in front of their homes or at the nearby market. Due to transport limitations, they were unable to reach the market to sell their produce.'Due to the Corona Virus Disease outbreak, we are no longer getting money because the person who takes care of us used to at least go to town, bring some food and also give us some 2000 Ushs for home use to maybe buy myself some milk but I am no longer able to afford it.' P23 (female, 73 years) 'It's entirely due to corona because I used to go to some work and earn, I used to sell some potatoes from my garden, sell it and earn money, now this is not possible but now this pandemic has stopped us from this.' P14 (female, 68 years) 'we no longer do anything we used to sell our cassava here and get some little money for survival but now we can no longer do that, we can't even afford a piece of soap because we don't have any money with us, the money we had saved, we have consumed all of it during this season, all this is due to the corona virus pandemic' P15 (female, 70 years)Usual buyers of their produce also did no longer show up as they themselves had no income or were unable to reach the stall.'Before covid I had my livestock so I would sell and pay fees but now we eat them ourselves at home because those who used to buy them are not working anymore.' P12 (female, 78 years) 'I used to work for myself, I could eat and drink, because I used to make roasted g-nuts and I sell them in this area. But when corona came, there is no moving. People have no money.' P24 (female, 82 years) Some participants also had people renting a room in their home and were suffering a lack of income from renters no longer paying their rent. Renters apparently stated that the government put a temporary hold on paying rent, which participants questioned, and had no income source.'Another problem is that the tenants no longer want to pay rent, they have this excuse that the government requested landlords to relax and so I have nothing to do but wait.' P12 (female, 78 years) THEME 2: Lack of access to basic necessities F O O D Older adults experienced severe difficulties getting access to food during the pandemic. Many older adults were used to farming and growing their own food but were restricted due to public health measures. They were also unable to buy food at the market because of a lack of income. Whilst the government was handing out ""posho"" to people in need, some participants did not receive the governmental food support or it was delayed, whilst others could not eat the meal as it made them feel unwell. As a result, many people had to cut down their meals, some down to one meal a day and many were constantly hungry.'Maybe food is really hard to get since there is no transport. So hunger is really one of those problems brought by this covid.' P06 (female, 66 years) 'The price for food is now high so as a result we can no longer afford two meals a day so we end up eating one'. P12 (female, 78 years) Impact of COVID-19 public health restrictions on older people in Uganda 3 'Even the food that was distributed by the government for us we didn't even get, so how are we surviving given the fact that we no longer even go to the garden to get food.' P14 (female, 68 years)The curfew at 7 pm each night also caused particular difficulties, as certain food ingredients are only sold in the evening, making it impossible for people to buy certain basic food items.'But for now, I can't even afford sugar because the curfew could not allow us because the maize and tea only could be sold in the evening but now, by 7 pm you have to be indoors.' P05 (female, 68 years)Many participants stated they were unable to pay their grandchildren's school fees any longer, due to a lack of income. In some cases, participants had to decide on what to use their very limited funds for, if they indeed had any funds. In those instances, money was spent on food, and not on buying a newspaper for example to help the grandchildren learn how to read.'Corona has even affected our children with regard to their education. Our kids don't go to school anymore and what they teach on TV they don't understand and can't ask questions like they do in class rooms. So it's not helping. They just sit and watch. The other option is buying newspapers yet I can't afford them, because if I have the money, I rather buy food other than just papers so we should pray that this pandemic ends. This has affected us a lot.' P08 (female, 62 years)'it has really affected us because we get school fees from our gardens after selling produce, so it's going to be very difficult for us to acquire school fees as compared to how it has been.' P03 (female, 60 years) T R A N S P O R T Nearly every participant raised transport difficulties affecting their daily lives since the pandemic breakout, including those participants who no longer leave the house due to frailty and old age. One of the biggest difficulties was that their children were struggling to visit them and bring them food or money. For those who were reliant on public transport, all participants raised the issue of increased costs of transport since the pandemic, which has made transport unaffordable. THEME 3: Impact on healthcare utilization Access to healthcare was severely diminished by the inability to board public transport and a lack of income to buy vital medicines and see healthcare practitioners. As a result, many participants have received no healthcare or medicines at all since the pandemic and are struggling with their health conditions.'I didn't access the medicines due to transport issues because I could not access the hospital. It's at the hospital where they could determine the type of medicine I need in case there are any change but now that public transport has been allowed I got some help because I accessed the hospital and I now feel better.' P03 (female, 60 years)'I don't have access to medical care anymore because I can't move to go to the hospital due to the problem of transport. It's really hard and if am to get from the nearby clinics, the medicines are also very expensive. So when I get help from people, I get some pain killers and I survive on that.' P06 (female, 66 years)'We can't go to the hospitals, so you remain home and feel the pain. You buy some tablets, swallow and then sleep. We don't have transport means, and you can't accept to be carried on the back. So, you stay home and send for tablets, or the doctor tells you to buy some tablets.' P25 (female, 66 years)One thing that also emerged was that participants predominantly saw treatments in the form of medicine, and no other form of non-invasive treatments, such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, changes in lifestyle or other ways to help alleviate some of their health concerns.'maybe treatment, getting medicines is really hard because some of us used to get our medicines from [name] hospital, [name] hospital but now we have no means to get there because public transport was closed. So that's a very big challenge to us.' P07 (male, 72 years) THEME 4: Social impactsParticipants were unable to see their family and friends, due to social distancing measures and very costly public transport. Whilst they stayed in contact via phone, it did not provide the same support as seeing loved ones face-to-face. In many cases, their children are supporting them financially and/or bringing them food, which has become difficult to impossible due to the public health measures. Social distancing measures and transport issues also caused some participants to feel cut off from what is going on in their community, making people feel disconnected.'it has also really cut us off from accessing information about what's happening within the community. So currently you can't even know what's happening within society so this is not good.' P15 (female, 70 years)Participants were affected by no longer being able to go to church and pray together within their community. Whilst participants were continuing to pray at home, for those who were religious, they complained about this not being the same as they missed the social aspect of gathering together every week. Being unable to attend funerals, particularly in the time of COVID-19 and increased mortality rates, was also distressing to many participants.'Another effect of this lockdown due to the virus is that we cannot burry our relatives anymore. This is indeed so painful because this is culturally not correct.' P19 (female, 80 years) THEME 5: Violent reinforcements of public health restrictions Several older adults reported violent reinforcement of public health measures by guards that have subjected them to beatings. One of the main reasons why guards were violent was because people were out after the 7 pm curfew imposed by the government. However, with many older adults struggling to get any food during the pandemic or needing urgent medicines, they sometimes were looking for food or money after the curfew, thereby following a basic need.'The curfew has also affected me because sometimes you can be walking around to may be buy something and then the security guys find you and beat you up.' P11 (male, 65 years)'since it began, I have never gone to the hospital. I get my aid from here, because I am afraid. We hear that people are being beaten.' P25 (female, 66 years)'Even the curfew time and transport have stopped us from moving to help us get food. Imagine if the LDU's find you moving past 7 pm, they never have mercy whether old or young, they just beat.' P14 (female, 68 years)Others reported that the curfew was beneficial, as fewer younger people were out in the evening and not getting drunk anymore, with reduced crime rates, thereby creating a more peaceful environment.The curfew has helped us on reducing idlers on the streets. People rush home always and that's good for all of us including the young ones. P08 (female, 62 years)The crime rate has tremendously reduced in our area because it's now hard to find someone walking past 7 pm. So the number of thieves has actually reduced during this period. P11 (male, 65 years)This is the first study showing the impacts of COVID-19 public health restrictions on older adults in an LMIC, specifically in Uganda. Public health restrictions have had a severe impact on the lives of older adults, in many cases affecting their basic existence and making it very difficult to obtain any basic necessities. Many older adults in Uganda and generally in LMIC belong to the poorest members of society (Golaz et al., 2017) . COVID-19 public health restrictions, such as social distancing, curfews and movement restrictions have caused older adults to lose the little income they had by being unable to use their farmlands and create produce to sell (where this was the case), and having no customers who would have the money to buy their produce or who are able to visit their stalls. As a result, many older adults are struggling to survive, with some having had to reduce their meals from two a day to one. As suggested by Lloyd-Sherlock et al. (2020) , older adults in LMIC are recommended to be involved in social distancing decisions, as they may already face difficulties in obtaining food and other basic necessities. Findings from this study provide the first evidence that older adults do struggle getting basic necessities as a result of social distancing and other public health measures, such as the 7 pm curfew implemented across Uganda. Whilst it is unknown how public health restrictions are affecting the lives of older adults in other LMICs, it is important for governments to work closely with the older members of societies to ensure their basic needs are not compromised by COVID-19 measures that are meant to safeguard society, and not cause harm.Considering the frequent multi-generational households (UNPD, 2005) , these impacts are not only felt by older adults themselves but also going down to their grandchildren. The lack of income and little money available, if any, make it impossible for many to pay for their grandchildren's school fees, with older people having to make the decision between survival (buying food) and education. Access to education is usually the responsibility of parents, but due to the multigenerational households, and us interviewing older adults, not having sufficient funds within the household equally affects older members of the family.Impact of COVID-19 public health restrictions on older people in Uganda 5It was a prominent topic amongst participants and was therefore important to include, as it was pertinent to them. Whilst the government apparently provides some form of food supplies, these were considered too limited for multi-generational households or often were not even received. Accessing primary, secondary and higher education in sub-Saharan Africa is unevenly distributed by household income, with those from wealthier backgrounds more likely to access secondary or higher education (Lewin, 2009; Lewin and Sabates, 2012) . This will have long-term implications for society, with the youngest generation being unable to receive adequate education. Since education can be a way out of poverty for the younger generation, the current inaccessibility of it and uncertainty in regard to how long various public health restrictions are going to stay in place means children may lack vital opportunities. This will in turn prevent them from providing their elders with the necessary support in the future (Golaz et al., 2017) . One way to overcome this issue would be to provide free education, with the government paying school fees or generally opening up school without any costs involved.Pre-pandemic difficulties of accessing suitable healthcare, as is the case in many LMICs (Hsiao et al., 2019) , have been further exacerbated by COVID-19. Many older adults needed medication or healthcare assessments, but due to the lack of income from selling their produce and increased public transport fares, amongst others, were unable to access the healthcare and treatments they needed. This lack of access can magnify existing health conditions and worsen the physical and mental health of older adults, which has also initially been reported in older Filipinos (Buenaventura et al., 2020) and is a concern for many LMIC (Vahia and Shah, 2020) . Therefore, governments need to work closely with older adults in their societies and generate public health measures that can better support them, without affecting their physical and mental health.As part of this, being unable to continue social practices has had a detrimental impact on people's lives. The cancellation of religious ceremonies has been of particular concern to participants. Faith is an important aspect of the daily routine to older Ugandans and being unable to attend weekly mass and burials of loved ones has affected them negatively. In the light of COVID-19 and increased mortality in older adults (Zhou et al., 2020) , being unable to attend funerals to farewell close friends and family members has particularly impacted people's quality of life and well-being. Whilst social distancing measures need to be adhered to in order to contain the spread of the virus, religious gatherings could instead be held outside (where contagion is reduced compared to inside) with the necessary distance between churchgoers. This is corroborated by recent research from the UK showing how important face-to-face contact is to well-being and how sudden withdrawal during the COVID-19 lockdown has had negative impacts on people with dementia's and carers' well-being (Giebel et al., 2020) . With lockdowns having been lifted in most countries across the globe after the first wave, and likely further waves of lockdown and intense public health restrictions, it is important to create ways to support the mental and physical well-being of older adults.Whilst this study benefits from a substantial sample size of older adults across Uganda, there are some limitations to consider. Older adults were interviewed from a relatively rural region of Uganda outside the capital, so that problems faced by participants might not be reflective of urban residing older people. However, we interviewed a substantial number of participants, thereby generating a representative account of problems faced by older Ugandans, many of whom reside in more rural areas throughout the country. One limitation though is that over three quarters of participants were female, therefore limiting the generalizability based on gender. Given the fact that life expectancy is higher in women than men in Uganda, according to the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory (2020), having a greater representation of women is likely though to be more representative of the older adult population. A further limitation is that the topic guide focused predominantly on social-economic impacts of COVID-19, as opposed to psychological impacts. Therefore, limited conclusions can be drawn on the wider psychological impacts of public health restrictions. This is furthered by a lack of information about the level of sickness of participants prior to COVID-19. To avoid possible linguistic limitations, interviews were conducted by a researcher fluent in both English and the local language.Conclusions COVID-19 public health restrictions have a severe impact on the lives of older adults in Uganda, affecting their basic existence and causing the inability for them to have access to sufficient food, healthcare and education for their grandchildren. Future research needs to explore the impacts of public health restrictions on the elderly in other LMICs. These first findings already strongly support the need for governments to consider the impact of the first wave of restrictions on the lives of older adults. Future restrictions need to be created that enable older adults to have access to basic necessities. These restrictions should not cause harm but should protect the most vulnerable of our societies. However, these first findings already strongly support the notion of governments taking into account the impact of the first wave of restrictions on the lives of older adults and adjust future restrictions in future waves to enable older adults to not be short of basic necessities and for restrictions not to cause harm, but merely to protect the most vulnerable of our societies.","Uganda","abstract","2020-12-17",12

Facility-based measures have so far included the use of personal protective equipment before handling patients, testing of patients with symptoms, treatment, and contact tracing, and the isolation of the suspected cases and diagnosed cases (10) .Appropriate knowledge, attitudes, and practices could improve the proper uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures. Studies so far done to evaluate the level of KAP toward measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among certains African communities and in Uganda in particular have targetted specific groups such as health workers (11) , lecturers and students (12) and market vendors (13) . These studies show a good knowledge, a positive attitude and good practices among the mentioned participants. However, our study aimed at the general population to determine the variability in knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 among different sectors in a bigger Ugandan population. Previous studies on viral disease outbreaks, like SARS in 2003 (14) and Ebola in 2018 (15) , have shown that the management and control of an outbreak requires a good understanding by the populations about the disease transmission and prevention to avoid its spread in the community (6) .This was a nationwide cross-sectional online survey conducted among Ugandans living in any of the four regions (Northern, Central, Eastern, and Western) of the country at the time of the study.All literate Ugandans aged 18 years and above with access to the internet constituted the population of this survey. The population of Uganda stands at 44,269,594, of which 78.4% (34,707,362/44,269,594) are literate (16). In Uganda, 44% (20,000,000/44,269,594) of the general population have a mobile subscription, among whom nearly half are mobile subscribers who are also able to access mobile internet services (17) . By June 2018, there were nearly 10 million mobile internet connections in Uganda, a penetration rate of 23% (17) .To calculate the sample size for this study, we hypothesized that at a 99.9% confidence interval (CI), 50% of the respondents would have a satisfactory knowledge level on measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country. Using the Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health (OpenEpi), v.3.01 (Dean AG, Sullivan KM, Soe MM. OpenEpi: www.OpenEpi. com, updated April 6, 2013), the minimum sample size of 1,083 participants was needed, adding a 30% contingency to the sample size, a minimum of 1,408 participants were targeted and at the end of data collection period, a total of 1,768 participants were registered in the study.Ugandans with a minimal computer literacy level and able to operate a social media account such as an email, WhatsApp, Twitter, or Facebook and consented to participate were included in the survey. Those who had filled in the form but were unable to submit the questionnaire were automatically not reflected and therefore excluded in the survey's database.Due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown policy enforced in the country at the time of data collection, a physical and paper-based questionnaire was not feasible. Data was collected using an online structured questionnaire developed in English using Google forms 1 with a consent form appended to it.The questionnaire was developed based on WHO requirements for knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) (18) and from the validated and published study on KAP among Chinese (6) and it was composed of 22 questions focused on several key constructs. The constructs captured by the five questions on socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, occupation, location, and marital status); eight on knowledge; three on attitude, one on self-reported practice toward the measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among Ugandans and one on source of information. The knowledge questions were composed of 12 questions (K1-K12) comprising: (K1) incubation; (K2) mode of transmission of the COVID-19; (K3) clinical presentations of COVID-19; (K4) risk factors for severe illness of COVID-19 and (K5-K12) preventive measures. Three (A1-A3) attitudes questions assessed participant's responses related to their COVID-19 risk perceptions, measures to prevent the spread of the disease and their level of perception about the cure of COVID-19. One (P1) question assessed participants response related to the measures they observed for self-prevention toward COVID-19. Participants were asked their source of information about COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 1) .As the country was under lockdown limiting physical access to potential study participants, social media was used to conduct the survey. The snowball sampling technique was used by asking all initial study participants accessing the online form to recruit their acquaintances fulfilling the eligibility criteria, by sharing the link to the online questionnaire and requesting them to participate within the study timeline. The questionnaire was administered for a period of 10 days from 6th to 15th April 2020. On receiving and clicking the link, the participants were auto-directed to the informed consent page of the survey tool. After reading the preamble and accepting to participate in the study, they were directed to the survey questionnaire.Each rightly mentioned single and multiple choices responses on knowledge questions was scored 1 to give a total score for the knowledge of a particular participant. The range of the knowledge was scored 0-30. The knowledge score was grouped into 3 categories namely: 0-9 (poor), 10-19 (moderate) , and 20-30 (high).Those who ""Agreed"" or answered ""Yes"" to the questions related to attitude were scored 1 and those who ""Disagreed"" or said ""No"" were coded 0. The category of attitude for this study was a binary variable with score 1 taken to be positive attitude and score 0 as negative attitude.Each correct response on self-reported practice questions was scored 1 and the incorrect one was scored 0 and then the sum of all the 8 right responses was used to develop a practice score. The self-reported practice was scored as adequate or good practice for those who selected 5-8 correct answers and poor for others who selected 0-4 correct answers.The raw data was cleaned and entered into Microsoft Excel and exported into STATA 14.2 for processing. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 14.2, where by categorical variables were summarized using frequency tables while continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviation (SD).The distances between the categories of the knowledge score were not normally distributed, and therefore, we used the ordered logistic regression for multivariable analysis of knowledge and socio-demographic characteristics indicating adjusted odds ratios (aOR).The attitude and Self-reported practice and sociodemographic characteristics were analyzed using the Chi-square, p-values at univariate analysis, and Odds ratio at 95% CIs. The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05.Ethical clearance for the survey was obtained from the Institutional Research Ethical Committee of Kampala International University in Uganda (UG-REC-023/201914). As participants logged in online, a statement regarding the consent to participate in the survey was in the preamble of the questionnaire and could only proceed after reading the consent and accepting to participate in the survey. Participation in this survey was voluntary. Participants were free to withdraw from the survey at any time by not submitting their form online, and there was no repercussion. The participants' identity was concealed as the form does not require any identification. No name or mail was required from the participant. Therefore, the information was obtained and stored anonymously, and this was treated confidentially. Only five members of the research team were allowed to access data, and the principal investigator accessed the entire dataset.A total of 1,768 participants completed the online questionnaire. Five (5) participants were excluded from the survey because were aged below 18 years, thus the final sample size considered was 1,763. Other*: Widowed, cohabiting, separated and in relation. Other**: Technologist and point of entry agent.Out of 1,763 participants, 56.9% were male and 50.5% were single. The mean age of the overall respondents was of 32.1(± 9.9) years. 23 The knowledge scores significantly differed across occupation and location (p < 0.05) of the study participants but was not significant across age groups, sex and marital status (p > 0.05) in ordered logistic regression analysis ( Table 2) . However, knowledge scores significantly differed across the Table 2 ).The ordered logistic regression of knowledge level ( (Figure 1) . The attitude about contracting COVID-19 (A1) varied across sex, marital status and location (p < 0.05). The attitude on following the recommendations (A2) and on agreeing that COVID-19 can be cured (A3) differed across sex and occupation ( Table 3) . The distribution of high knowledge on measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among participants was significant for positive attitude on A1 and A3 but not A2 ( Table 3) .Participants reported good practice of 99.26% for selfmonitoring, use of face masks, washing hands, application of social distancing respectively; 85.25% for house cleaning and ventilation; 68.29% of staying at home and avoiding gathering; 30.97% of applying respiratory etiquette. But some of participants reported applying social distancing of <1 m (14.01%) and some (0.7%) did not follow any of the mentioned measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Uganda ( Table 4 ). The practices differed significantly across sex, marital status and occupation of participants (p < 0.05). Most participants (99.3%) reported having adequate practice and 0.7% (13/1,763) reported poor practice toward measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 ( Table 5 ).Currently, the world faces the coronavirus pandemic, which is highly infectious; measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population across the world. The population requires an appropriate and sufficient knowledge about these measures, their importance, and how to apply them appropriately (8, 9) . When a human population faces an outbreak, changes in behavior in response to the disease can alter the progression of the infectious agent. In particular, people aware of a disease in their proximity can take measures to reduce their susceptibility (18) . However, beyond a critical infection rate, spreading awareness can slow down the spread of the disease and lower the final incidence, but it cannot completely stop it from reaching epidemic proportions and taking over large parts of the population (6) as have been observed in the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong (19) .Ten days after the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Uganda, we conducted a nationwide online survey on Knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practice toward measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 among the Ugandan population. We found that 80% of participants were highly knowledgeable toward measures for the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 among Ugandans. This result is similar to the knowledge rate (90%) found among Chinese residents during a quick online survey on COVID-19 (6) and during the Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone in 2014 (20) and DRC in 2018 [12 = 15] but higher than findings (69%) by Olum et al. (11) among Health (21) . Our findings could be explained by the fact that the COVID-19 found Ugandans already familiar with observing similar measures to prevent the spread of some other highly infectious diseases within the country such as Ebola and Marburg disease (22) . The ordered logistic regression from our survey showed that the level of knowledge was significantly associated with a certain degree of education level as per health worker, teacher, and student. This survey included all Ugandans with a minimal computer literacy level which is 78.4% of all the Ugandan population (17) . The Ministry of Health of Uganda uses social media to post information related to measures for prevention of the spread of the pandemic within the country and this could explain the findings mentioned above which could be different among uneducated people. Zhong et al. findings related to Knowledge in China explain their findings by the fact that most respondents during their survey held an associate's degree or higher (6) . The Uganda government could use these categories of participants as a strategy to reach out and sensitize the uneducated population about measures to be observed in the country.Most participants reported positive attitude on following recommendations that have been provided by the Ministry of Health or directorate of district health officer to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Even if the participants agreed that COVID-19 can be cured (73.3%), most of them were worried of contracting COVID-19 (89.1%). These findings can be explained by the high level of knowledge among participants, and also, the country being under lockdown as one of the measures to prevent the spread of the pandemic. A study conducted about KAP of COVID-19 in the Philippines found that most of participants were afraid of contracting COVID-19 (19) . Reuben et al. found an association of good knowledge and positive attitude among participants about COVID-19 (23) . In China, a survey revealed that most population took precautions to prevent infection by COVID-19 such as not going to crowded places and wearing masks when going outside but with an optimistic attitude toward COVID-19 which could be attributed to the stringent prevention and control measures implemented by governments such as banning public gatherings (6) . In Nigeria, a study evaluating the KAP of Ebola outbreak among secondary school children found an association between poor knowledge and negative attitude toward the outbreak (20) . In this survey, householder and driver occupation were associated with a negative attitude. During the Ebola outbreak in DRC and Guinea, it was found that a group of participants had a negative attitude toward measures for prevention of Ebola in their respective areas (15, 24) the same as for a study done among Chinese residents during the coronavirus pandemic (6) . Among confirmed cases in Uganda, one-third are truck drivers who are coming from surrounding countries (10) . The result gives useful information that the government has to increase sensitization among these categories of people about measures toward prevention of the spread of COVID-19, which can be considered as a cross border infection in Uganda and the East African region. Households can get information from the students, health workers (11, 12) and those who have shown an immense knowledge about measures to be observed and the government can also tap into such categories of people in implementing strategies to control the pandemic within the country. As of November 10, 2020, Uganda had registered 14,704 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 7,836 recoveries and with 133 reported deaths, a case fatality ratio of 0.9% (10) , and this low case fatality ratio can be explained by high prevalence (99.3 %) of good practice among Ugandans.Similar KAP studies among students, lectures, health workers, and rural market vendors in Uganda suggested that education level could play a key role in molding KAP in the community (11) (12) (13) .In our study occupations such as security agents, drivers, and business people had a low level of knowledge on COVID-19. These categories of the population need an urgent sensitization across the country to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. If measures are not considered, Uganda could continue to register increasing numbers of confirmed cases by these categories.Our study was limited to participants who had smartphones, computers, tablets, and internet connectivity and had an understanding of English. Therefore, those with no smartphones and internet connectivity could not access the online form and participate in the survey. The survey captured the country's literate population, so it could not be generalized to the whole population. The knowledge and attitudes among uneducated people might be different from the findings of this survey.Therefore, knowledge and attitudes toward COVID-19 of vulnerable populations deserve special research attention. There was an inadequate assessment of attitudes toward COVID-19, which should be developed via focus group discussion and indepth interviews and constructed as multi-dimensional measures the same as for self-reported practice, which is not easy to evaluate as the survey was online. However, this was not possible due to the country's lockdown during the survey period, and one of the strategies observed by all population in the country was social distancing to avoid the spread of the COVID-19.At the time of the study, most Ugandans were knowledgeable, had a positive attitude, and observed good practices toward measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the country. Despite these findings, there was lack of knowledge and attitude among specific populations, namely drivers, business entrepreneurs, and security personnel. These groups should be targeted for sensitization to avoid becoming the source of spread of the coronavirus disease. There is a dire need to mobilize all populations around the country to have the same level of knowledge, which will impact attitude and practice. The government of Uganda could use the health workers, teachers, and students to help in mobilization of all populations within the country about measures toward prevention of the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.Ethical clearance for the survey was obtained from the Institutional Research Ethical Committee of Kampala International University in Uganda (UG-REC-023/201914).

The disease can be a mild common cold or more severe pneumonialike sickness (1) . The common transmission routes of the coronavirus include direct transmission (cough, sneeze, and droplet inhalation transmission) and contact transmission (contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes) (2). Contaminated air or environmental surfaces are possible sources of infection (2). The standard of care for COVID-19 is symptomatic therapy with antipyretics, hydration for mild cases and provision of ventilatory support if a patient develops respiratory distress. At the time of writing, there is no proven cure for COVID-19 and global efforts are in progress to find a vaccine (3). COVID-19 exhibits some similar symptoms with tuberculosis (TB) (4) . According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 10 million people fall ill with TB every year and approximately 1.5 million people die from TB each yearmaking it one of the major causes of mortality worldwide (5). TB is highly endemic and a major public health problem in Zimbabwe with an estimated incidence of 210 per 100,000 population in 2018 (6).The gains realized over the years in the fight against TB are under threat due to the COVID-19 pandemic (7) (8) (9) (10) . The pandemic has resulted in a diversion of resources meant for other existing public health threats, including TB. Threats to the TB response in the COVID-19 era have been well established elsewhere (10) . These include movement restrictions due to the implemented lockdowns (11) (12) (13) , diversion of human and diagnostic resources from TB services (10), misdiagnosis of TB in areas where COVID-19 testing is not available (14) and tuberculosis stigmatization as some of the symptoms of TB and COVID-19 are similar. All these threats to the gains observed in TB control in Zimbabwe require swift strategic measures to mitigate the effects of, and manage the COVID-19 pandemic while implementing effective TB prevention and treatment programs (10) Since COVID-19 and TB infections present with similar symptoms, an extensive range of differential diagnosis should be considered, including TB at first clinical presentation. Significantly, similar general preventive measures for all respiratory tract infections should be implemented for safety and the prevention of more transmissions in health facilities and to health-care workers. The overlap and commonalities for surveillance, screening, diagnosis, care, and management can be exploited (15) and increase the rate of TB treatment initiation. The management of patients with respiratory symptoms should encompass combined testing for both infections, hypothetically increasing the sum of people tested for TB. Also, due to the comparisons of two diseases, there is a great opportunity to leverage the infrastructure (16), extensive experience, and knowledge of TB researchers and healthcare workers on infection control.Health promotion interventions are important to manage TB in the context of COVID-19. Most factors that lead to TB propagation are modifiable through health promotion. To prevent stigma and discrimination towards people affected or suffering from COVID-19, the government has to embark on a massive community engagement initiatives. This can be done in conjunction with civic groups, media organizations, and community leaders. Communities can be empowered through education and awareness campaigns and education on COVID-19 and TB. Such platforms can also encourage citizens to seek medical attention without fear of discrimination at health centres.The healthcare system in the country was sub optimal pre-COVID-19 and the pandemic has worsened the situation. There is a need for political commitment to strengthen the healthcare system that can adequately address gaps in the health systems in the long term (10) . In the immediate response, TB programs may use locally derived, simple risk stratification methods to focus interventions like active case finding and preventive treatment to family members at high risk of infection to increase their impact and cost-effectiveness (17) . The scaling up of TB prevention and control initiatives involves monetary, material resources, as well as investments in the workforce to fight the disease together with patients (18, 19) .During this COVID-19 pandemic the country should redefine the minimum package of HIV care and stregnthen differentiated service delivery (DSD) models to include TB prevention therapy (TPT). DSD is a client centric approach that streamlines TB services that address the needs of patients and minimise the burden on healtcare facilities. TB patients will benefits from five common models of DSD for effective TPT. Firstly, health facilities to remain open and offer fast track refills of anti-TB medications. Secondly, since the distribution of TB medication to patients may prove to be difficult, health facilities ought to consider a two-tiered approach: make delivery of medications to patients communities or arrange specific days where patients can come to collect their medication. To minimize frequent travelling by patients to healthcare facilities to collect their medication, patients can be given a one time six-month dosage of anti-TB medication (19) . A recently concluded clinical trial has revealed that 4 months of treatment for TB works as well as a 6-month regimen (20). This will create more treatment success and less cost. Fourthly, creation of healthworker managed groups at healthcare centres or in communities to encourage treatment adherence, medication refills and teen support. Healthcare workers must provide information on dosage, frequency of medication, and possible adverse reactions to the medications. Fifthly, TB infected managed groups such as community anti-TB treatment groups that facilitate refills may be utilized. For each model, there is need to facilitate documentation and identification of best practices and taking these to scale. Widespread implementation of DSD for TPT is inexpensive, with potential to prevent advancement to clinical disease, decreasing TB associated mortalities, morbidities, including hospitalizations and eventually decreasing TB transmissions and, thus, unburdening healthcare systems.Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the country healthcare and affected TB care continuum. The country can benefit from adopting innovative strategies such as incoporation of TPT in DSD models. Widespread implementation of DSD for TPT is inexpensive, with potential to prevent advancement to clinical disease, decreasing TB associated mortalities, morbidities, including hospitalizations and eventually decreasing TB transmissions and, thus, unburdening healthcare systems.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Zimbabwe","abstract","2020-12-01",12

These models play a major role in determining the methods of quantify and analyzing effective control and preventive measures of infectious diseases [1] [2] [3] . There are several infectious diseases; as for compartmental diseases models, beginning with the very classic SIR model and making more complex proposals [4] .It is well known that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a quagmire worldwide, with more than eight millions people infected worldwide, the mortality-recovery ratio appears to be in a positive proportion. Nevertheless, due to the sensitivity of Polymerase Chain Reaction, the absence or presence of the previously infected host is observed and the recovery rate appears to be promising in the absence of any curative vaccine. The challenge facing health care professionals, the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control in each quarter was whether reinfection could occur after a COVID-19 patient had been clinically treated. The subtle nature of the disease has brought to the attention of several scientists and medical practitioners to embark massively on multiple research to fully counterattack and stop the spread of the disease [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .Of the seven known human coronaviruses, 4 are common human influenza pathogens. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV are responsible for severe respiratory diseases [5] . Although the COVID-19 has long been established and studied by researchers and medical practitioners, but many people lack awareness towards the disease and still vaccines and antiviral drugs to specifically prevent or treat the infection is not available. SARS-CoV in 2003 was the last major outbreak in China. It was an acute respiratory infectious disease with high fatality rate. The outbreak of SARS was controlled by China through multiple controls and good preventative steps. The incubation period for COVID-19 is significant and rather long when compared to SARS. Many studies calculated different incubation periods for the disease,for example; 5.2 days [6] , 3.0 days [7] and 4.75 days [8] . In [7] , an incubation period of up to 24 days is reported, this extends to 38 days as reported in Enshi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture in Hubei province of China. Note that asymptomatically infected people are quite numerous [11] and compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV the fatality is far inferior [7] . Genetic virus studies show that SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV are 85% homologous [9] . But 2019-nCoV binds ACE2 to an affinity higher than SARS-CoVS [10] . At the end of 29 January 2020, SARS will be exceeded in the optimistic confirmed cases induced at COVID-19. The uncertainty of the asymptomatic cases, incubation period and the virus' supertransmissibility bring great difficulties in the epidemics control.The subtle characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic necessitated leaders from each country to impose some rules to curb the massive spread of the virus. Both developed, under-developed and developing countries agree to apply lock-down measure in order to restrict the movement of the people. In some countries the lock-down strategy could bring the desired results while in some the situation could worsen the spread of the virus due to poor management and lack of facilities, palliatives and incentives. To this regard, we feel motivated to develop a new mathematical model that consider the lock-down strategy with the case study of Nigeria.Nigeria recorded its first case of COVID-19 on February 27, 2020, in Lagos city [12] . From the mid of March 2020, the Federal Ministry of Health started to take necessary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Travelers started to be screened and schools were short down. It is crystal clear that unlike the western countries, either the epidemic in Nigeria progressed through a slow phase or the number of asymptomatic cases in Nigeria is high. Since effective vaccine for the diseases is not available, the only available options are contact tracing and prevention of migration into the country. While China succeeded in preventing the spread of the disease by completely shutting down the country, Italy recorded worst case scenario by negligence of communities towards simple public health strategies. Observing these and many more cases, made the government of Nigeria to impose 14 -day lock down in some of its states which starts on March 30, 2020 [12] .Many recent researches in literature studied mathematical modeling of COVID-19 [23, 24] . Some of these researches were concerned with fractional order models [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .The aim of this research is to study the dynamics of COVID -19 in Nigeria with and without the lock down. This will enable us assess the significance or otherwise of the imposition of lock down in the country. We use real data from Nigeria Centre for Disease Control for our numerical simulations.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, Introduction is given. In Section 2, the COVID-19 model with lock down is formulated. In Section 3, analysis of the model is carried out. In chapter 4, local stability analysis of the solutions of the model are conducted. Chapter 5, compares three different numerical schemes; Euler, Runge -Kutta of order 2 and Runge -Kutta of order 4 for the numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical results. Finally, conclusion is given in chapter 6.Let S(t) represents the population of Susceptible individuals that aren't yet under lock down, S L (t) represents Susceptible population that are under lock down, I(t) represents Infective population that aren't under lock down (isolation is referred to as lock down for convenience) and I L (t) refers Infective population that are under lock down and then cumulative density of the lock down program is L(t). Then the total population is denoted by N(t). System of ODE is used to represent the dynamics of this population. The parameter meanings as used in the model are given in Table 1 .(1)In this section, some important properties of the proposed model such as boundedness, existence of equilibrium solutions and basic reproduction number will be analyzed.The system trajectories are confined within a compact set. Then, the total population N(t) = S(t) + S L (t) + I(t) + I L (t). Thus taking the derivative leads toConsequently,where C is constant. The initial value condition at t = 0givesThis implies thatWe get and this givesHence the population is bounded above.In order to obtain the equilibrium solution, we equate system (1) to zero and solve simultaneously. We obtain three different equilibrium solutions, viz; Disease free equilibrium, Endemic equilibrium in the absence of lock down, Endemic equilibrium in the presence of lock down.Disease . Whereand I 2 can be obtained by solving the quadratic equationHere, we study the local stability of the equilibrium solutions.Consider the following Jacobian matrix from (1);The disease free equilibrium, E 0 is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1.Consider the Jacobian matrix at E 0 then,Theorem 6. The endemic equilibrium without lock down E 1 is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 > 1.Consider the Jacobian matrix at E 1 then,That is, E 1 is locally stable if R 0 > 1.The endemic equilibrium with lock down E 2 is locally asymptotically stable if μλ 2 I 2 < μθ 2 I 2 + α 2 ϕL + ϕ 2Consider the Jacobian matrix at E 2 then,This equilibrium point is stable if μλ 2 I 2 < μθ 2 I 2 + α 2 ϕL 2 + ϕ 2 .In this portion we implement three effective numerical schemes: Euler, second-order Runge-Kutta, and fourth-order Runge-Kutta. The obtained solutions is compared with that of the ode45 GNU Octave function.For the Euler, assume that a well-posed initial-value condition is given by dy dt = f (t, y) and y(a) = χ a⩽t⩽b,A sequence of approximation point (t, w) ≈ (t, y(t)) is established by EM to the exact solutions of ODE by t i+1 = t i +h and w i+1 = w i + hf(t i ,w i ),Suppose that a well-posed IVP is given, the RK technique of order two establishes a sequence of approximation points (t, w) ≈ (t, y(t)) to the exact solution of the ODE by t i+1 = t i + h, Suppose that a well-posed IVP is given, the RK technique of order two establishes a sequence of approximation points (t, w) ≈ (t, y(t)) to the exact solution of the ODE by t i+1 = t i + h, Fig. 1 depicts the solution of the system Eq. (1) with the stated initial conditions, established by the ode45 versus the Euler method. It is wellknown that, EM is one of the simplest scheme that gives a captivating approximation on the behaviour of each of the system variables. The same discretization knots is used for both implementations within the interval [0, T] with a step size given by h = T/100. Fig. 2 depicts the solution of the system of Eq. (1) with the stated initial value conditions establish by the ode45 versus the RK-2 method of order two. It can be observe that, RK's-2 method gives a better approximation than EM. This is due to the indistinguishable in this case. Fig. 3 depicts the solution of Eq. (1) with the stated initial values computed by the ode45 versus the RK-4 method. The results of the RK-4 method give extremely good outcome. In addition, Rk-4 requires four evaluations per step and its global truncation error is O(h 4 ). Fig. 4 depicts the overall comparison of all the schemes that have been used for the approximation of the system Eq. (1).In conclusion, this paper consists of a system of five nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The aim of the model is to study and assess the imposition of lock-down on the dynamics of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Mathematical analysis of the model were carried out, where boundedness, computation of equilibria, calculation of the basic reproduction ratio and stability analysis of the equilibria were carried out. We finally study the numerical outcomes of the governing model in respect of the approximate solutions. To this aim, we employed the effective ODE45, Euler, RK-2 and RK-4 schemes and compare the results. It will be important if the fractional order analogue to this model will be studied. Also the rest of the COVID-19 control measures are to be studied and their significance will be analysed.We don't have data attached to this research.

Vehicular emissions and various industrial activities are the principal sources of particulate matter (PM) and NO 2 , which are harmful to respiratory systems. Both PM and NO 2 are hazardous to human health, as they cause lung damage and asthma (Olivieri and Scoditti 2005) .The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern (World Health Organization 2020a, b), which led to unprecedented public health responses in many countries around the world, including travel restrictions, curfews, and quarantine. The WHO on March 11, 2020, declared COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, as a pandemic (Bashir et al. 2020a; Shi and Brasseur 2020; WHO 2020a, b, c) because of its widespread transmission, a significant number of deaths, and higher infections and mortality rate compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks. Shereen et al. (2020) state that it is a singlestranded RNA as nuclei material with a diameter of~80 nm. Long-term air quality data significantly correlated with cases of COVID-19 in Italy, giving evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination represents an encouraging context for the spread of the new virus (Fattorini and Regoli 2020) .The Egyptian government announced that COVID-19 had reached the country on February 14, 2020. On March 19, 2020, the government implemented some preventive measures by closing all public areas (e.g., restaurants, cafes, clubs, and beauty centers) throughout the country from 7 pm until 6 am, excluding pharmacies and delivery services. Positive COVID-19 cases are increasing daily. On March 22, 2020, governments decided to start social distancing by suspending ritual activities and prayers in all mosques and churches to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Bauwens et al. (2020) stated that lockdown and reductions in human activities affect the environment positively in China and Western Europe. Similar studies in India (Gupta et al. 2020) and North America (Bashir et al. 2020a, b ) support these findings. Although several studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Europe, no such study was conducted in the Middle East. Therefore, this investigation was conducted in Alexandria City, Egypt, to fulfill the above knowledge gap. This study investigates the impacts of activity reductions and lockdowns, because of COVID-19, on air quality (presented as the concentrations of PM and NO 2 ) in Alexandria City, Egypt.Air quality sampling Sequential sampling of PM 10 and PM 2.5 was conducted using a Partisol™ Plus 2025-D dichotomous sequential air sampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The simultaneous sampling of fine and coarse PM is critical for source identification because these particle size fractions often have different origins. The sampler uses the classical US EPA dichotomous virtual impactor design to separate incoming PM air streams into its fine (PM 2.5 ) and coarse (PM 10 ) components which were collected onto 47-mm Teflon filters for gravimetric analysis (Gelman Teflon, 0.2-μm pore size; Pall Corporation Port Washington, NY) at a rate of 10 L/min (24 h day −1 ). Samples were collected daily from June to May 2020. Teflon filters were weighed before and after sampling using Mettler microbalances (Mettler Tole-do® XPR10, Scales Galore, NY, USA) up to an accuracy of 0.001 mg for gravimetric determination of PM (Basahi et al. 2017; Ismail et al. 2017; Harrison et al. 2016a, b) . All quartz fiber filters were preheated for 6 h at 550 ± 8°C and maintained at 20 ± 1°C and relative humidity of 50 ± 5% for 24 h before weighing and sampling. After sampling, all filters were conditioned for 48 h. NO 2 was monitored using a NO 2 /NO/NO x Monitor (model 405 nm, EQNA-0217-243, 2B Technologies, USA), providing extreme selectivity for NO 2 (absorbance at 405 nm) over the range 0-500 ppb. Concentrations were recorded on the data logger. Both the Partisol air sampler and NO 2 monitor were placed on the roof of a residential building in the city center near a busy traffic road in Alexandria City (31°12′ N 29°55′ E),~15 m above the ground, north of Egypt (Fig. 1) . Wind speed and wind directions were collected from the meteorology authority in Egypt (www.ema.gove.eg).The association between COVID-19 and climate indicators (temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and air quality) in Alexandria City, Egypt, was investigated using Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests (SPSS statistical package).This study reproduced the evolution of ambient NO 2 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 concentrations in Alexandria City, located in northern Egypt, from the beginning of January to the end of May 2020. Figures 2 and 3 show PM and NO 2 concentrations, respectively, before and during the coronavirus outbreak, as well as before and during the lockdown. The vertical red line in both figures shows the timing of lockdown and reduction in human activities (March 19, 2020) implemented by the Egyptian government.The average PM 10 concentration was 197 during January, February, and the first 2 weeks in March 2020. This PM10 concentration started to decline after implementing lockdown, and the average concentrations were~152 μg m −3 during April and May. Therefore, the lockdown reduced PM 10 concentrations by 22.8%. Moreover, the government implemented drastic measures and a full lockdown during Easter (April 20) and Eid festival (May 23-25, 2020, after the holy month of Ramadan), where PM 10 concentrations on these occasions dropped to 121 μg m −3 (38.6% reduction) and 106 μg m −3 (46.2% reductions), respectively (Fig. 2) .Similarly, PM 2.5 concentrations were 82 and 58 μg m −3 before and during the lockdown, respectively (lower line in Fig. 2) . Moreover, the lowest concentrations were recorded during the full lockdown on April 20 (44 μg m −3 ) and May 23-25 (40 μg m −3 ) (Fig. 3) . The partial lockdown on March 16, 2020, reduced PM 2.5 concentrations by 29.3%, whereas the full lockdown during festivals in April and May reduced the concentration by 46.3% and almost 1-fold, respectively. Shi and Brasseur (2020) found that lockdown reduced PM 2.5 concentrations by 35% in northern China.Fattorini and Regoli (2020) studied the role of chronic air pollution levels in the COVID-19 outbreak risk in Italy. They found that a strong influence of daily averaged ground levels of PM concentrations was positively associated with average surface air temperature and inversely related to air relative humidity on COVID-19 cases in Milan (Zoran et al. 2020) . NO 2 concentrations were 62.5 and 46.3 μg m −3 before and after the lockdown of March 16, 2020, respectively. The lockdown reduced PM 2.5 concentrations by 25.9%. Moreover, the NO 2 levels recorded during the full lockdown in Easter, and Ramadan and Eid were 35.9 and 30 μg m −3 , respectively (Fig. 2) . The concentrations during the full lockdown were 42.6% and almost 1-fold lower, respectively, than before lockdown (Fig. 2) . Bauwens et al. (2020) stated that ambient NO 2 concentrations were reduced by 40%, 20%, and 38% in Wuhan City (China), Western Europe, and the USA, respectively, because of effective lockdown after the outbreak. However, NO 2 concentrations in Iran did not decrease because of a delay in lockdown implementation (Bauwens et al. 2020) .Nevertheless, Hassan et al. (2013) found that reductions in NO 2 concentrations increased the ambient O 3 ozone levels in Jeddah. Recently, Shi and Brasseur (2020) stated that the reduction in ambient NO 2 was associated with an increase in tropospheric O 3 in China. Although air quality has significantly improved in Egypt, ambient O 3 ozone can still be a problem (Zhang et al. 2019 ). Thus, the relationship between tropospheric O 3 and its associated precursors (e.g., NO 2 ) warrants further studies. Significant decreases in NO 2 levels were observed over widespread areas in China, Europe, South Korea, and the USA in January-April 2020, according to high-resolution spaceborne data. Figure 4 shows the wind speed and direction. Lockdown significantly affected both meteorological parameters, and consequently, the air quality index significantly improved from that during January and February from the same year (EMA 2020). One could argue that changes in wind speed and wind direction during April and March 2020 could be because of seasonal effects. However, Fig. 5 shows that both parameters for the same site during the same period (April-May) in the previous year (2019) indicate poor air quality, assuring our assumption that lockdown was significant in improving air quality. Zoran et al. (2020) stated that COVID-19 could be attached to airborne aerosols in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host in agglomerated urban areas, exacerbating the situation. Moreover, Bauwens et al. (2020) stated that the decrease in NO 2 and PM is evident from the comparison of NO 2 levels before and during the lockdown and when contrasting the 2019 and 2020 levels during the same period. The decreases are mainly attributed to the containment measures against the spread of COVID-19, which caused sharp decreases in traffic and industrial activities, correlating well with the results of the recent investigation. 1 J a n 8 J a n 1 5 -J a n 2 2 -J a n 2 9 -J a n 0 5 -F e b 1 2 -F e b 1 9 -F e b 2 6 -F e b 0 4 -M a r 1 1 -M a r 1 8 -M a r 2 5 -M a r 0 1 -A p r 8 A p r i l 1 5 A p r i l 2 2 A p r o l 2 9 A p r i l 0 6 -M a y 1 3 -M a y 2 0 -M a y 2 7 -M a y The variability in ambient PM 10 , PM 2.5 , and NO 2 concentrations with meteorological parameters makes the comparison straightforward in this study. However, an in-depth investigation of the effects of different meteorological parameters during different times a year is urgently needed for a more detailed analysis, which is beyond the scope of this study. Moreover, air pollution should be part of an integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection, and prevention of epidemic spreads but in a long-term and chronic perspective because adopting mitigation actions during a viral outbreak could be of limited use (Zara 2020; Zoran et al. 2020) . (Table 1) . As the number of cars decreased during the lockdown, PM concentrations decreased significantly (p ˃ 0.05), and the correlation coefficients were 0.57 and 0.62 for PM 10 and PM 2.5 , respectively ( Table 1) .The effects of variability of wind direction and speed (e.g., wind gusts) should also be considered. However, our limited dataset did not allow us to investigate these additional variables. Our results contradicted those of Csavina et al. (2014) , who found a weak correlation between PM 10 and wind speed and relative humidity. However, they found a stronger correlation between PM 10 and relative humidity when data were parsed out for high wind speeds but did not observe temperature dependence. Moreover, the dependence of PM 10 on wind speed and relative humidity is complex and nonlinear (Csavina et al. 2014) .The decrease in PM and NO 2 concentrations is mainly attributed to the containment measures against the spread of COVID-19, which caused a sharp decrease in traffic and industrial activities. Emission regulations should be more stringent to improve air quality permanently. However, lockdown and social distancing are not the best solutions to improve air quality and fight COVID-19, although they helped in lowering concentrations of air pollutants significantly, and consequently improved air quality. Moreover, they are temporary solutions; therefore, new innovative and permanent solutions should be suggested, which warrants further investigation. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of temporary lockdowns on global air quality and climate and the gradual return to pre-lockdown periods. Lockdowns and social distancing are the best solution to fight COVID-19 but should not be the best technique to improve air quality. Therefore, other solutions should be searched for enhancing air quality. Moreover, model studies are urgently needed to separate the effects of enforced health measures from other contributing factors.Authors' contributions Mostafa El-Sheekh shared a collection of data and authored and finalized the manuscript.

The countries in Africa with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. 2 The current pandemic has resulted in a health crisis that has seriously impacted human lives and the world economy. 3 Unfortunately, the amount of time required to curtail the spread of the virus and return back to normalcy is uncertain. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a group of 17 interconnected goals with 169 targets designed to serve as a road map to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. At this unprecedented time, SDG 3-good health and well-being-has justifiably been on the top of the priority list of all governments, thus raising the concern that some SDGs are being neglected or sacrificed to achieve control of the pandemic. According to global health experts, the current health crisis will be given the highest priority until a lasting solution in the form of a readily available vaccine becomes available. 4, 5 The SDGs were inaugurated in 2015 by the United Nations (UN), but almost all countries in Africa are lagging behind in the race to achieve the goals by 2030. 6 Economic stagnation in Africa, coupled with the current global recession caused by COVID-19, is predicted to lead to COVID-19's impacts being more vicious and long term than those of the 2008-2009 global economic crisis. 7 Although the UN is optimistic with its plan to ""defeat the virus and build a better world,"" 8 these negative impacts will seriously threaten the actualization of the UN SDGs, in most African countries. Thus, the UN strategic plan calls for global solidarity and innovative, inclusive, decisive, and coordinated actions by industrialized countries, which entails technical and financial support for poor and vulnerable regions. 8 As a way forward, the UN approved an appeal to raise 2 billion United States dollar (USD) to help in the battle against COVID-19. 9 This move has been described as absolutely necessary as the current pandemic may lead to a ""famine of biblical proportions."" 10 This study examines how the pandemic will threaten the implementation of the SDGs in Africa. It also highlights the SDGs most directly threatened by COVID-19 and for which areas urgent attention is most needed.The main socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 on African countries are still unclear, 11 and the literature evaluating them is still limited. Few studies that have evaluated the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 in Africa have focused on specific sectors such as health care, 12 tourism, 13 mining, 14 or the economy. 3, 15 It is estimated that the economic stagnation caused by COVID-19 will push 420-580 million people into poverty, consequently elevating global poverty for the first time since 1990. 16 In view of this, global leaders are encouraged to commit to an economic recovery initiative that will support high-risk economies and their vulnerable communities. 17 A recent article, 18 which focused on the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on four African countries (Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, and Uganda), reported that an estimated 258 million people, making up 80% of the population of the four countries, have lost their source of livelihood because of COVID-19. Coupled with the food insecurity that existed even before the pandemic, it is predictable that this pandemic will push more populations below the poverty line, a phenomenon perceived as a threat to the targets of SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 8, and SDG 10 ( Table 1) .The financial market in Africa was badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries such as South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya recorded declines in all share indexes after the first coronavirus case was announced in each country. 11 South Africa and Kenya witnessed 80% and 55% fall, respectively, in tourism following the onset of COVID-19. 19 ,20 A significant drop in oil price heavily impacted some oil export-dependent countries including Nigeria and Angola. 15 Because the estimated oil price of USD 57 per barrel was no longer sustainable because of COVID-19, Nigeria revised its budgets downward to USD 30 per barrel. Countries such as Zambia and Angola are considering debt restructuring because the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio, which was about 70% in these countries in 2018, has increased. 11 The pandemic also took a sociological toll on vulnerable populations in Africa, particularly the elderly, people in impoverished homes, and persons with disabilities. Refugees, migrants, and internally displaced persons suffered disproportionately because of lack of running water and limited employment opportunities. 21 It is forecasted that failure to address these problems through affordable social policy will amplify social exclusion, inequality, and unemployment in Africa. 3, 15, 22 These problems are a clear threat to achieving the existing SDG targets (Table 1) .The UN SDGs were established based on the three main concepts of sustainability, which are economic, social, and environmental. 23 However, unlike the Millennium Development Goals, which were focused on battling poverty in developing countries over 15 years (2000-2015) , the SDGs are considered universally applicable to all societies around the world. The commitment to implement the SDGs within 15 years (2015-2030) has been unanimously accepted by all nations. Before COVID-19, African countries were considered to be lagging behind in the quest to achieve the SDG targets, and clearly, this pandemic will endanger the little progress made so far. Highly threatened SDGs and SDG target(s) in Africa are listed in Table 1 .It is increasingly likely that all the 169 SDG targets will not be accomplished within the targeted 15 years (2015-2030). Analysts believe that two-thirds of the 169 targets are under threat because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 4,23,24 Threats on SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 2 (zero hunger) are not the only perceived threats from COVID-19 to the social aspects of sustainability in Africa. Lessons from our past pandemics shine a spotlight on the significant impact a pandemic can leave psychologically, 25 without doubt exacerbated by future uncertainty and socioeconomic inequalities in Africa. Hundreds of millions of people, especially in developing and least-developed nations, have no health insurance, no unemployment insurance, and no income security. 26 Undoubtedly, these poor living conditions will be amplified by the pandemic, a situation seen as a major blow to the main goals of sustainable development, which are inclusiveness and leaving no one behind. 27 Sustainable development goal 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 10 (reduced inequality) are unequivocally threatened by COVID-19 because of diversion of funds and priorities accorded to SDG 3. Such diversion of funds and priority was demonstrated on March 3, 2020, when the World Bank apportioned 12 billion USD emergency funding to help developing and least developed countries in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to reinforce their healthcare systems against the pandemic. 28 The shocking lack of resilience in this system, 29, 30 due to underinvestment in healthcare systems in Africa, is now widely acknowledged. Nonetheless, further addressing these healthcare shortcomings may directly and indirectly endanger the global investments needed to implement and actualize other SDGs. Meanwhile, industrialized countries can be expected to prioritize investments into their own economic recoveries and national emergency programs, 31,32 threatening a target of SDG 17, which directs developed countries to commit at least 0.7% of gross national income as aid for developing and 0.2% as aid for least-developed nations. Moving forward, global solidarity and shared responsibility will be instrumental in ensuring we recover from losses and regain momentum toward achieving the SDGs in the post-pandemic era. 33 Globalization and progressive economies are perceived as the backbone that will help guarantee the success of the SDGs 23 ; sadly, these assumptions are now in shambles owing to the current pandemic. The global economy, expected to grow by at least 5% in 2020, is currently in recession, 16 and developed nations are reluctant to extend financial support to less industrialized countries because they are also struggling to support their own citizens. The world is predicted to face more challenges in the next decade. These challenges range from more pandemics to continued ecosystem degradation, wildfires, floods, storms, and drought, which are considered as consequences of climate change. 23 In Africa, a weak healthcare sector continues to struggle with malaria, AIDS, tuberculosis, dengue, and other tropical diseases. These looming challenges will further impact the SDGs because these global stressors will lead to the diversion of more funds from their realization. Therefore, current circumstances urge us to reconsider the resilience of the SDGs in the face of such global stressors.Economic progress and the social well-being of millions of people in Africa have been badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and without a solution in the form of a readily available vaccine, economic activities and implementation of SDGs will continue to be held back. Therefore, African nations should bring into play the lessons learned from this unprecedented crisis and use these lessons as guides for building a more resilient society, capable of withstanding future global stressors that may hinder the realization of the SDGs. It should be acknowledged that the efforts of charitable and philanthropic organizations have played a huge role in combating the difficult times brought on by the pandemic. Moving forward, we need to replicate these efforts in our commitment to achieve the existing SDG targets in Africa during the post-COVID-19 era.With 10 years remaining in the 15-year life span of the SDGs, their further implementation must not be delayed, despite recent socioeconomic stresses. Governments in Africa should develop policies that are affordable and capable of achieving SDG targets. 21 Furthermore, as we continue to emphasize the need to implement policies to achieve the SDGs, it is also imperative to understand the power of shared responsibility, which involves extending responsibility from governments to the global community, the private sector, humanitarian and philanthropic organizations, and civil society. 33 Although the road ahead may seem uncertain, we envision that a few years from now, the catastrophe caused by this pandemic will be remembered as a positive turning point, after which we showed resilience and came back stronger.","Nigeria","first author","2020-12-15",12

Since the time of declaration, the virus continues a public health emergency of international concern. 1 The COVID-19 virus continues to spread around the world. Currently millions of people are affected and hundreds of thousands have died from the coronavirus all over the world. The spread of the disease in Africa is also increasing. 2 With limited number of tests in Ethiopia the Ministry of Health report showed that the COVID-19 pandemic is becoming a big threat and the virus is at the community level. 3 Currently in Ethiopia, tens of thousands of people and hundreds of individuals are affected and have died from COVID-19, respectively. 4 The impact of the virus has been imposed on different sectors like education, economy. and tourism, which leads to a societal, political and economic crisis. 5 COVID-19 poses unprecedented intimidations to global human well-being, and high uncertainty associated with the novelty of COVID-19, many health-care providers rely on different health information sources. [6] [7] [8] During this time, information is inevitable and important, and having knowledge on pertinent information is crucial for health-care providers in order to deliver sustainable and quality health services to their clients. [9] [10] [11] [12] This can be achieved only if the health-care providers have a sustainable access to latest and outdated health related information. 13, 14 Especially in the time of coronavirus, where the nature of the disease and its transmission is not well investigated, and the cure for the disease is not still discovered, seeking information and knowledge sharing are very important to combat the coronavirus disease. 8, 15 Since the introduction of digital solutions, the landscape of information has changed drastically in health systems. 6, 7, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] This approach helps care providers in seeking information, which is a purposive searching of information, in order to satisfy their information need. 9, 10, 21, 22 People in the health systems are using different kinds of electronic information sources besides to the traditional approaches like printed brochures, magazines, and newspapers, colleagues, and family members. The need for information by health-care providers is escalating with the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic around the globe. 23 Care providers are in need of different kinds of information on the diagnosis, treatment, and medical procedures that are perceived helpful for COVID-19 pandemic control. [23] [24] [25] Social media channels were distinguished as the most important information sources on coronavirus disease, and the other most significant sources of information were digital libraries and publishers' repositories. 8, 15, 16, 26, 27 Besides the abovementioned information sources, television was reported as one of the main sources of information about coronavirus. 28 Prevention and control methods, mode of transmission and strategies for early recognition of COVID-19 were the most searched information by health professionals. 20, [28] [29] [30] Studies showed that people's information seeking and knowledge sharing practice reaches increased heights during emergencies. Since different infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Asian bird flu have emerged, and the rate of bioterrorism has increased the need for health information and knowledge sharing practice by the care providers is getting higher and higher. 23, [31] [32] [33] [34] The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the health-care providers' need of information and information-seeking behavior drastically. 15, [35] [36] [37] Even though there are limited studies conducted on the informationseeking behavior in other domains, 10, 11, 38 the study conducted on health professionals' information seeking on the COVID-19 pandemic in the case of low-resource setting teaching hospitals is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to answer this evidence gap by assessing the information-seeking practice of the care providers.This study was conducted using an institutional based cross-sectional study design at the University of Gondar teaching and referral hospital from July 10 to July 30, 2020. The University of Gondar Hospital is found in Gondar city, one of the major cities located on the Ethiopia-Sudan border. The area is an investment corridor with hundreds of thousands of laborers, who are engaged in farming. The laborers lives in camps in groups. The hospital has converted many of its facilities into COVID-19 health centers. The hospital has been serving as a quarantine and treatment center for the North-West of Ethiopia. The hospital has more than six decades of teaching, research, health service delivery, and community service experience for the North-West of Ethiopia. The average patient visits per day in the hospital outpatient department for the last year was 300. Currently the hospital has around 600 beds in the main wards of the hospital: internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, surgical, and pediatric wards.All health-care providers who were working at the University of Gondar Teaching and Referral Hospital were the source population for this study. A finite population correction formula with a single population proportion 39 was used to compute the final sample size with the assumptions of 95%CI, 5% margin of error, 10% nonresponse rate and a proportion of 50% for information seeking on COVID-19 pandemic, since there is no a prior research conducted on this. With a nonresponse rate of 27 (10%), the final sample size was considered as 300. To select the participants, we used a systematic random submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2020:13 sampling technique using a list from the human resource department of the hospital.The questionnaire was categorized into three parts. The first one was about the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, such as age, gender, educational status, working experience, and profession. The second and the third categories were about the technical-related variables and the information-seeking related questions, respectively. COVID-19 information seeking was measured using a question derived from a previous research. 15 The respondents, were asked during the past one month, have you ever sought information about COVID-19 PURPOSELY from different sources (Internet, Books, Radio/Television, Newspapers/ magazines, Family and/or Friends)?The data collection process was conducted using an online survey. Reason for seeking information on COVID-19 were assessed using five options (""first reason"", ""second reason"", ""third reason"", ""fourth reason"", ""never""). In addition, health professionals' trust in different information sources about COVID-19 were scaled as ""a lot"", ""some"", ""a little"", ""not at all"".The data from the respondents were analyzed using SPSS software version 20. The frequency and percentile were used to describe the sociodemographic characteristics of respondents. The association between the dependent and independent variables or the statistically significant difference between the segments of a dependent variable with the dependent variable was presented in chi-squared test results. A P-value of ≤0.05 was considered significant.The ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the ethical review board of the University of Gondar. The consent form to the respondents was attached to the front page of the questionnaire with the question to the participants about their willingness to be part of the study. All participants provided informed consent, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Due attention was given to not personalize any of the participant's information during data analysis, presentation, and interpretation. Moreover, all the tools used for this research were appropriately acknowledged.Out of the 300 participants, 291 (97%) respondent's questionnaires were found valid and ready for analysis. From the total respondents 78 (26.8%) of them were female and 243 (83.5%) of them were degree holders. More than 84% of the respondents were nurses and medical doctors. The mean age of the respondents was 28.9 years with standard deviation of ±4.9 years (Table 1) .Half of the respondents 147 (50.5%) and 146 (50.2%) had computer access at their workplace and took computer training, respectively. Out of the 291 respondents, around 70% of them were using the internet for COVID-19 information ( Table 2) .All respondents were asked for their reason for seeking information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Information This finding indicated that 113 (33.8%), 100 (34.4%) and 144 (49.5%) of the respondents first reason for seeking information on COVID-19 were to search for information about the diagnosis, treatment, and for global and local case reports, respectively. Besides, 137 (47.1%) and 145 (49.8%) of the respondents first reason for searching for information on COVID-19 was to find updates on the mode of transmission and prevention methods, respectively. Out of the total 291 respondents 17 (5.8%) of them had never sought information on COVID-19 global and local case reports (Table 3) .This study finding indicated that around 60% of the respondents had a lot of trust in information disseminated by the WHO website. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health (EMOH) and CDC websites were also among the highly trusted sources of information by care providers with 137 (47.2%) and 141 (48.5%) respondents, respectively. Out of the 291 respondents, 78 (26.9%) of them had a little trust in information from religious organizations (Table 4 ).From the 291 respondents, 207 (71.1%) of them had an information-seeking behavior on COVID-19 pandemic. Out of them 155 (74.9%) and 176 (85.0%) with information seeking behavior on the pandemic were male participants and degree holders, respectively. Out of the 207 respondents, with positive information-seeking behavior, 170 (82.1%) of them used the internet for COVID-19 information seeking ( Table 5 ).The chi-squared association result showed that many variables had significant associations with information seeking behavior on COVID-19 pandemic. Age (χ 2 =10.6, P=0.011), profession (χ 2 =12.6, P=0.013), respondents working unit (χ 2 =33.6, P<0.001) and using the internet for COVID-19 information (χ 2 =46.9, P<0.001) were significantly associated with the dependent variable. The chisquared result for sex (χ 2 =1.032, P=1.032) and educational status (χ 2 =1.20, P=0.541) were found insignificant ( Table 5 ).This study attempts to investigate health professional's information seeking behavior, in the case of COVID-19 pandemic. The finding from this study will serve to identify the health-care providers' possible media sources and their practice in information seeking. The survey result will give a direction for policy makers and ministries to select appropriate information sources to disseminate information related to pandemics like COVID-19. This finding will influence the care providers' engagement in disease control behavior. Besides, the associations of different independent variables with the outcome variable, information seeking practice are discussed hereunder.Information acquisition practice on COVID-19 pandemic by the participants was found moderate, 207 (71.1%) of 291participants. The reason for this high finding could be due to the pandemic's nature and the care providers' high information need. [6] [7] [8] The respondents reported they are using different types of platforms for COVID-19 information seeking. Social media (like Facebook and Twitter), WHO website, CDC website, Ethiopian Ministry of Health website, newspaper and magazine, and family members were among the main sources as elucidated in Table 4 .According to the result, the credibility of the information sources were varied. The participants found the WHO and the Ministry of Health websites were highly trusted sources. The possible reason for having a high trust in information disseminated by the WHO and EMOH could be due to the misinformation about COVID-19 from social media sources. 16, 20 COVID-19 related information from religious organizations and family members were less likely to be trusted by the respondents. Their reason for information acquisition on COVID-19 pandemic was mainly to seek information related to diagnosis methods, transmission ways, global and local case and death reports, and for updates on prevention methods. The main reason for searching information about COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment procedure by the care providers could be due to unclear clinical characteristics of the disease. 23, 24, 40 It was found that 151/207 (72.9%) of the respondents had internet access at their workplace. One hundred and seventy out of 207 (82.1%) of the respondents used the internet for COVID-19 information acquisition. Relative to the technical infrastructure of the low resource settings the respondents were found with a better access to internet and digital devices. The findings of this study also suggest that health professionals still rely on traditional media (eg newspapers and magazines, religious organizations and family members) for COVID-19 information seeking, despite the fact that trust in traditional sources was low. The reason for doubting information from traditional media by the care providers could be due to high misinformation.Top major facilitating factors for information acquisition on COVID-19 pandemic by health professionals were age (χ 2 =10.6, P=0.011), profession (χ 2 =12.7, P=0.013), respondent's working unit (χ 2 =33.7, P<0.01). Besides, 15 Therefore, an emphasis on technology-based information sources could positively affect the health professionals' commitment and engagement on combating the COVID-19 pandemic.In conclusion, 71.1% of the respondents had an information seeking behavior on the COVID-19 pandemic. ICT infrastructures like computer access, computer training and internet access at their workplace with frequent internet use were significant with information seeking on the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, the information disseminated from WHO and Ethiopian Ministry of Health (EMOH) were found among the most highly trusted information sources on COVID-19. Therefore, to better disseminate the useful information regarding COVID-19 to health-care providers the trusted WHO and EMOH websites are recommended. This study assesses the care providers' information seeking behavior about COVID-19 information that advocates information dissemination using reliable sources and digital platforms for enabling health professionals to combat COVID-19 pandemic with other supportive stakeholders.The major limitation of this study was the small sample size, which had conducted in one teaching and referral hospital. However, the organizational nature of the public hospitals in Ethiopia are similar. ","Ethiopia","first author","2020-12-16",12

The COVID-19 pandemic also offers an opportunity to promote tobacco cessation and strengthening tobacco control policy implementation by recognizing the role of tobacco use in exacerbating COVID-19 health outcomes.covid-19; tobacco policy; tobacco use By 31 October 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had affected over 45 million people and caused 1 million deaths globally. 1 The risk of severe morbidity and death has been shown to be higher among males, older people and those with underlying non-communicable disease conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and cancer. 2 Tobacco use is a major risk factor for the development of many of the underlying disease conditions such as cancers, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as diabetes. 3 In addition, exposure to tobacco smoke and nicotine affects lung development and impairs the body's immune response to viral infection. 4 The causative agent of COVID-19 is the Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) which enters the body through the nose, mouth and upper respiratory tract. On the other hand, exposure to tobacco smoke leads to inflammation of the mucosal tissues in the upper respiratory tract. 5 Tobacco use has thus been identified as a risk factor for critical/ mortal disease progression among patients with COVID-19. 2 The association between tobacco use and COVID-19 is such that there is an increased risk of COVID-19 infection due to a suppressed immune system as well as the exacerbation of symptoms and disease severity among COVID-19 patients with noncommunicable diseases and a history of tobacco use. In Uganda, the 2013 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) reported that more than 2.5 million people were current tobacco users while over 4.5 million people had been exposed to tobacco smoke. 6 By 31 October 2020, Uganda had recorded >10,00 cumulative confirmed cases and >100 deaths 1 due to COVID-19. It is thus critical for the COVID-19 public health response to be cognizant of the influence of tobacco use and tobacco smoke exposure. We conducted a study to explore how efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda have been integrated with tobacco control policies and interventions. Findings from this study provide evidence to inform policy decisions about the public health response in general, and tobacco control interventions in particular, in the context of infectious diseases like COVID-19. Recommendations from the study are relevant for Uganda in particular, other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa such as Tanzania 7-9 and other low and middle income countries with similar tobacco control frameworks and tobacco use profiles.This was a mixed method study with data collected in three ways. First, we conducted a desk-based mapping of 'grey' literature data sources (i.e. data that were not included in peer reviewed journals, such as government reports, online print press and Twitter) on COVID-19 and tobacco. Delivery of the desk-based mapping was guided by a protocol which is included as a supplementary file. In summary our data search was web-based via a Google search using the ""All"" and ""News"" tab with the search terms 'COVID-19', 'smoking', 'smokeless tobacco', and 'tobacco industry'. Websites of the Uganda Government, Uganda Ministry of Health, WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), and WHO Country Office for Uganda were also reviewed for published information related to tobacco and COVID-19. Websites of non-governmental organizations involved in tobacco control activities in Uganda such as the Center for Tobacco Control in Africa, AMREF Health Africa, African Tobacco Control Alliance, Tobacco Atlas, Tobacco Control Uganda and the Uganda Health Communication Alliance were also reviewed for information relevant to the objectives of the study. The social media accounts of the Uganda Ministry of Health, Uganda Government, WHO Uganda, Tobacco Control Uganda and the Uganda Health Communication Alliance were also reviewed for information related to tobacco use and COVID-19. The desk-based mapping search was conducted thrice. Initially on 15 May 2020, we searched for data sources published between the date the WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (30 January 2020) and 1 June 2020. The second search was conducted on 22 June 2020 and the final search on 1 July 2020. A total of 136 online and offline data sources were identified of which 107 (78.7%) were eligible for data extraction. As per the protocol, data sources were screened to assess whether they met the eligibility criteria, with data extraction recorded using Microsoft excel. The majority of data sources from came from the Twitter accounts of Tobacco Control Uganda and the Uganda Health Communication Alliance and mostly took the form of advice or information sharing. For example, advising tobacco users of their potentially higher risk from COVID-19, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on tobacco control and the role of the tobacco industry in response to COVID-19.Next, we consulted with key stakeholders involved in non-communicable diseases control in general and tobacco control in particular. For ease of completion there were offered given the option to take part via an online survey or telephone interview. Each mode of data collection collected the same level of detail, but as would be expected telephone interviews gave more flexibility to expand on answers and, in some cases, provided greater depth of detail. Stakeholders who had attended previous non-communicable diseases control engagements such as development of national policies and strategic action plans, were invited to participate in the survey. Stakeholder consultation covered issues to do with the relationship between COVID-19 and tobacco use, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the policy response to tobacco control and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on development of tobacco control policy. The qualitative data and open ended response from the survey were analysed using a systematic step-by-step review of the data and identification of themes related to the study topic. Descriptive analysis was conducted for survey findings and are presented as proportions. The online stakeholder consultation involved invitations to 61 participants of whom 33 (54%) took part via the online survey while 5 (8.2%) opted for telephone interviews. The institutional affiliations of the respondents were civil society (n=14, 36.8%), government (n=12, 31.6%), research/ academic institutions (n=7, 18.4%) and others (n=5, 13.2%).As noted above, the first stage of analysis looked at each strand of the study separately. We then triangulated findings to generate the key findings from the study. These are now presented, with recommendations for future policy also discussed.Six out of ten survey respondents (n=20, 61%) agreed that the relationship between COVID-19 and tobacco use had been discussed in policy contexts or social media particularly Twitter, Facebook, Instagram which suggests an awareness of COVID-19 and tobacco use among social media users. Results from the mapping also highlighted the importance of social media for conveying information about COVID-19 and tobacco with the main source of data being the Twitter accounts of Tobacco Control Uganda (TC Uganda) and the Uganda Health Communication Alliance (UHCA). The use of social media to disseminate public health messages has been shown to increase knowledge and attitudes 10 and may offer a unique opportunity for the promotion of anti-tobacco messages. 11 This could be especially relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where physical distancing is integral to the control of transmission. However, there was also the view that this issue had received limited attention:""Generally, in my own observation, there is very limited focus/discussion on tobacco use and COVID 19."" (Interviewee)Public information on COVID-19 and tobacco largely focused on the vulnerability of tobacco users to COVID-19 and their potentially higher risk of contracting COVID-19. The mapping identified multiple Tweets and re-tweets from TC Uganda and the UHCA advising the public that the hand to mouth contact involved in tobacco use could aid the spread of COVID-19. The UHCA also tweeted that both active and passive tobacco users are at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19.Respondents expressed a view that revenue to support the health sector and tobacco control could be generated by reviewing the current tobacco taxation policy and were generally in favour of a tax increase to replace the revenue lost to COVID-19. For example, nearly two thirds (n=20, 65%) of survey respondents expected a tobacco tax increase to address health and wider policy impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.""The country is looking for ways to get more revenue and tobacco taxation has been identified as a potential area. Once taxes go high, the prices [for tobacco products] will also increase and thus reduced use among the poor and the young""The Ministry of Health could achieve this by working with CSOs to advocate for the taxation of tobacco products to reduce consumption and generate revenue to support investments in public health. Although the COVID-19 interventions to interrupt transmission are expected to gravely affect global and national economies, 12 tobacco taxation as a public health policy has the potential to generate revenue and reduce overall tobacco use by preventing and delaying initiation among young people and promoting cessation and lowering consumption among those who use. 13Four out of 10 survey respondents (n=13, 41%) and all stakeholders interviewed by telephone (n=5, 100%) thought that the tobacco industry had engaged in new corporate social responsibility activities, marketing or had sought to influence the policy response to COVID-19. Respondents reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had given the tobacco industry an opportunity to participate at national and district levels by donating US $65,000 to the National COVID-19 task force. Respondents also noted that the industry had made claims that nicotine had protective factors against COVID-19. The mapping identified several tweets from the Uganda Health Communication Alliance and Tobacco Control Uganda refuting the claim.""The Tobacco industry donated funds to COVID-19 response fund for Uganda. It even got a presidential mention as recognition for the 'act of good will'.Elsewhere, an analysis of social media data from the United States between January and May 2020 revealed that the tobacco industry had made deliberate efforts to promote messages such as the tobacco industry supporting the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and disputing the association between tobacco use and COVID-19. 14 Ministry of Health and civil society partners should provide the public with information dissociating the tobacco industry with the COVID-19 response and remind leadership and management of public institutions to reject donations from the tobacco industry as guided by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and stipulated in the 2015 Uganda Tobacco Control Act. 15The main type of COVID-19 advice was to stop smoking or using tobacco products, which was mostly provided by the Ministry of Health and civil society officials. This provides an opportunity to promote tobacco use cessation in Uganda. However, survey findings suggest that respondents did not see a change in the level of interest in tobacco use cessation among users, with 26 (82%) reporting no change or saying that they did not know. Tobacco control efforts should leverage the fight against COVID-19 and push for reductions in tobacco use and promote tobacco use cessation by emphasizing the effects of the two conditions on the lungs and the additional mortality risk among COVID-19 patients who are current or former tobacco users compared to those that have never used tobacco. Preliminary research has demonstrated that even 4 weeks of tobacco use cessation could reduce the risk of adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 such as intubation. 16 Tobacco control messages should thus be disseminated along with social distancing and sanitation and hygiene messages for the prevention of COVID-19.Respondents were hopeful that the COVID-19 pandemic offered an opportunity to strengthen tobacco control policy implementation:""I think it's the best time to strengthen and implement the tobacco control policies. The effects of COVID-19 are immense on tobacco users and this should be put forward""However, there was also the view that tobacco control had been neglected due to the pandemic. Respondents were aware that COVID-19 would have negative implications for the tobacco control policy agenda in Uganda, such as reduced funding, heightened tobacco industry influence and possible amendments to the Tobacco Control Act.Survey and interview respondents highlighted that the following information would be helpful in the formulation of tobacco control policy in the context of COVID-19:Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected tobacco consumption.A better understanding of the relationship between tobacco use and COVID-19 (i.e. medical effects, disease progression, recovery time, mortality and transmission)Assessment of tobacco industry interference during COVID-19 pandemicAn evaluation of the economic cost of COVID-19 on tobacco control programmesTobacco use results in pre-mature mortality and morbidity globally to an extent that far exceeds that of COVID-19. Global deaths from direct tobacco use account for 7 million people per year. 17 While tobacco use in Uganda is lower than in many other countries, it is imperative that national governments attend to their responsibility to prevent premature deaths from tobacco, and the associated morbidity by developing and implementing policies that reduce and prevent tobacco use. This is particularly important at the current time when tobacco use can, from existing evidence, affect COVID-19 disease severity. Countries need to integrate interventions and messages to avert communicable and non-communicable disease risks at the current time for the overall health and wellbeing of their populations.This project was supported by a grant from the UK Global Challenges Research Fund, grant number MR/ P027946/2 with additional funding from the University of Edinburgh's Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) allocation.","Uganda","abstract","2020-12-08",12

It was reported that the industry accounted for about 90% of foreign earnings and 70% of government's revenue in 2017. In less than a decade, the industry has faced two global meltdowns of crude oil price which puts the economy of the country in a chaotic condition. One was the fall in oil price in 2015 due to the breakthrough in the production of shale oil, and the other is the current and ongoing global pandemic situation caused by coronavirus disease that also led to the fall in crude oil price. To minimize the effects of these challenges, it is desirable to key in to the local content initiatives of the government which encourages usage of local materials that are abound in the country so as to reduce the unit technical cost (UTC) for producing a barrel of oil in Nigeria. Also, with this initiative, the economy of the country would improve and there would be tremendous reduction in importation of foreign materials that are been used in the industry. This will also encourage indigenous company to thrive as a result of the reduction in the cost of producing a barrel of oil.In 2010, the government of Nigeria signed the local content act into law to encourage the usage of Nigerian natural resources in the country (Afolabi et al. 2017) . Nigeria is blessed with abundant natural resources, and some of them can be harnessed and used in the oil and gas industry. One of the areas of the industry where these resources can be used is drilling operations. Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) in 2010 estimated that Nigeria consumed about 200,000 metric ton of bentonite clay for drilling operations, and most of them were imported into the country. Bentonite is used for the formulation of drilling fluid to provide the primary mud rheological property needed for drilling operations. One of the major functions of drilling fluid is to lift cuttings from the wellbore to the surface during oil and gas drilling operations (Adams 1985; Darley and George 1988) .Successful drilling operations are highly dependent on the properties and performance of drilling fluid (Darley and George 1988) . This function of drilling fluid is tied to the rheological behavior of the fluid. Water-based drilling fluid is one of the most commonly used types, and it comprises a mixture of water, bentonite clay and additive (Aghamelu and Okogbue 2015; Baba Hamed and Belhadri 2009; Darley and George 1988; Jain and Mahto 2015; Mahto and Sharma 2004; Meng et al. 2012; Salawudeen et al. 2016; Wilfred and Akinade 2016) .Nigeria has a huge reserve of bentonite clay that is abound in the country, and it is reported that a substantial amount of these resources is found in every region of the country (Afolabi et al. 2017 ). It will be of great value to our economy and indigenous companies if these local bentonite clay resources can be used for drilling operations in the country. Though the type of bentonite found in most part of the country is calcium-based and potassium-based which has challenges of not providing the necessary rheological properties (Afolabi et al. 2017; Darley and George 1988) .Bentonite clay exists in the northeastern part of Nigeria, notably Yobe, Borno, Adamawa and Taraba states, with a probable reserve of over 700 million tonnes (Afolabi et al. 2017; Agwu et al. 2015) . Also, over 90 million tonnes have been reported to have been found in some areas in Edo state, notably Ekpoma-Igunebon road, Afuze, Ovibiokhuan and Okpebho (RMRDC 2010) . A probable reserve of clay of over 4 billion tons has been estimated to be found in the Niger Delta region. Oyawoye and Hirst (1964) discovered that montmorillonite clay was also present in the middle belt region of Nigeria. Their studies of younger granite at Ropp showed that a montmorillonite mineral occurred in the marginal facies of biotite-granite that are in the younger granite ring complex at Ropp, Plateau State. The deposit of bentonite clay in this location has not been investigated for use during operations.Most of the bentonite clay deposits found in the country do not possess the rheological properties stipulated by the American Petroleum Institute (API). They have poor swelling capacity compared to the imported sodium-based bentonite clay (Agwu et al. 2015; Arabi et al 2017 Arabi et al , 2018 Dewu et al. 2011) . API stipulates that the minimum viscosity requirement for usage of any bentonite clay should be 30 cP at 600 rpm (API 1993) . Most bentonite clay studied in the country falls short of this requirement. A lot of researches have been conducted on the improvement to Nigerian bentonite clay for oil and gas drilling operations. It was observed that the approach used did not improve the mud viscosity much except in cases where viscosifiers were added to the mud (Agwu et al. 2016; Apugo-Nwosu et al. 2011; Arabi et al. 2017 Arabi et al. , 2018 Arinkoola et al. 2019; Falode et al. 2007; Omole et al. 1989) . Hence, the industry still relies on imported bentonite clay.This research therefore considered the partial to total replacement of imported bentonite clay (IBC) by investigating the rheological impact and economic implication of mixing imported bentonite clay with Nigerian bentonite clay. This is aimed at providing a template to oil companies and oil and gas producing countries to partially or totally substitute imported bentonite clay with locally sourced bentonite clay during drilling operations. The study also provides the economic basis for embarking on gradual replacement of IBC with local bentonite clay.Rheological properties affect all drilling fluid functions and enable estimation of flow regimes, frictional pressure losses, equivalent circulating and surge and swab pressure which are parameters that affect hole cleaning efficiency (Guo and Liu 2011) . Rheology of drilling mud is described by properties such as viscosity, yield point and gel strength.Viscosity is a measure of the ability of fluids to resist flow. It is expressed mathematically as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate. As provided in Eq. 1, the viscosity is the ratio of shear stress to shear rate for a Newtonian fluid:(1) Viscosity = Shear stress, Shear rate,̇ Drilling fluids are non-Newtonian, and hence, there is no single viscosity value at various shear rates. Non-Newtonian fluids are either shear rate or shear-time dependent. Non-Newtonian fluids are grouped into pseudo-plastics and dilatant. Pseudo-plastic fluid exhibits decreasing apparent viscosity with increasing shear rates, and dilatants have their apparent viscosity increasing with increasing shear rate. Shear-timedependent non-Newtonian fluids are rheopectic if the apparent viscosity of the fluid increases with time after shear rate is increased to a new constant value. Drilling fluids are described as thixotropic if the apparent viscosity decreases when shear rate is increased to a new value that is constant. Generally, drilling fluids are pseudo-plastic and thixotropic.Drilling fluids will only flow when subjected to certain load stress called yield point (Maxey 2007) . Yield point is the stress required to start fluid movement. It is caused by electrical charges located close to the surface of the particles in the mud (Sadek et al. 2011) . Sami (2016) stated that gel strength is a function of interparticle forces of drilling mud and the shear stress measured at low shear rate. Gel strength and yield stress both are a measure of the same interparticle forces of a fluid as determined by the yield value. However, unlike yield point, gel strength is measured under static condition.Plastic viscosity is a measure of the internal resistance to fluid flow due to the amount, type and size of solids present in the fluid. Accumulations of drilled solids, additions of barite and presence of chemical contaminants in drilling mud increase the plastic viscosity. The dilution of drilling mud with water, effective use of solids control equipment and flow line flocculation decrease the plastic viscosity (Sadek et al. 2011) . The plastic viscosity is calculated as the difference between the 600 rpm dial reading and the 300 rpm dial reading of the viscometer. The apparent viscosity is also a rheological parameter, and it is calculated by dividing the dial reading of the viscometer at 600 rpm by 2 (Bourgoyne et al. 1991) . The apparent viscosity gives the measure of that part of resistance to flow caused by mechanical friction between solids in the mud, solids and liquids and the shearing layers of the mud itself.The following materials and apparatus were used to achieve the objectives of this research work: imported bentonite clay, local bentonite clay, distilled water, spatula and measuring cylinders. While the equipment used includes: variable mud mixer (Ofite, Model 9B), viscometer (Ofite, Model 800), pH meter (OAKTON, Model pH Tester 10), oven (U-Test GENO, DT104A), jaw crusher (Retsch, BB 50), weigh balance (OHAUS, Model AX124) and mud balance (Ofite).The local bentonite clay used for this research was collected from Ropp, Plateau State, Nigeria. The raw clay sample was dried in the oven at a temperature of 70 °C for 12 h. The dried clay sample was crushed using a jaw crusher and sieved with 200 API mesh size to obtain fine particles of the clay (API 2010; Magzoub et al. 2017 ).One laboratory barrel of water-based mud was prepared by mixing 22 g of RBC with 350 ml of distilled water. Six other samples of one laboratory barrel of water-based mud were prepared by varying the percentage of RBC in the clay composite as shown in Table 1 . The drilling mud samples prepared were characterized using API standard testing procedures for mud property determination (API 2010). The properties of the mud determined include mud rheological properties and mud pH. It was observed that after the samples were prepared, the viscosity of all the mud samples was not up to API standard. Hence, all the mud samples were beneficiated using polyacrylamide cellulose (PAC). It was seen that with addition of 0.5 g of PAC, most of the mud samples met API standard in terms of drilling mud viscosity.The economic assumptions made for the cost of materials used for the drilling fluid formulation considered are shown Table 3 shows the volumetric specification for the amount of drilling fluid used for modeling the economics of the clay blend per field barrel and well basis. The cost of using any of the beneficiated clay samples (drilling mud plus PAC) for drilling operations was determined using the economic assumptions stated in Table 2 . This was done on a one laboratory barrel, field barrel and well basis to see the amount of money saved for using any of mud samples prepared as a replacement of IBC. The data used for estimating the cost of IBC and amount of bentonite clay used to drill a well were obtained from a drilling program used to drill a well in Agbatu field in the onshore Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The well depth was 5900 ft TVD, and the cost of drilling the well was about $10 million. The cost of bentonite clay used to drill the well was $10,650, and it accounted for about 0.11% of the entire cost of the well. The cost of any of the clay blends on a ton basis was also determined. This was used to estimate the cost of using any of the clay blends based on a Nation's consumption capacity. Figure 1 shows the effect of substituting IBC with RBC on the mud viscosity at 600 rpm. API stipulates a minimum viscosity requirement for any clay that will be used for drilling operations. It states that the clay must be able to yield a viscosity of 30 cP at 600 rpm. Initially, the viscosity of RBC was 5 cP but upon blending it with IBC, it increased to 7.5, 10, 10.5, 16.5 cP when 40%, 50%, 60% and 80% of IBC were used, respectively. The maximum increment in the viscosity values was about 230%, which was when 80% of IBC was used. But still the value of the viscosity obtained was not up to API standard, and it was also less than the viscosity of sample G (27 cP) which was prepared with 100%IBC. When the samples were beneficiated using PAC, the viscosity of the mud increased beyond API standard. Though for sample A and sample B, it was increased beyond API standard when 1 g of PAC was added to it. The viscosity values obtained for sample A and sample B were 32 and 45 cP, while for the other mud samples, upon adding 0.5 g of PAC, the viscosity of the mud increased beyond API standard. The viscosity values for sample C to sample F increased to 37, 45, 52.5 and 81 cP, respectively. It is seen that blending RBC with IBC had impact on the mud viscosity but could not improve it to API standard. But addition of PAC to the mud samples was able to raise the mud viscosity to API standard. Table 4 shows the impact of blending RBC with IBC on the apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity and yield point of the mud samples formulated, while Table 5 shows the impact of blending RBC with IBC on the gel strength, consistency factor and consistency index of the mud samples. It is seen that blending RBC with IBC improved the rheological parameters of the mud. The 10-s and 10-min gel strength increased from 0.5 to 9.5 1b/100 ft 2 and 0.5 to 15 1b/100 ft 2 , respectively, when blends of 80%IBC and 20%RBC were used. Also, the apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity and yield point also increased with increment in the percentage of IBC. This increment in the rheological properties was as a result of blending RBC with IBC. IBC is a sodium-based bentonite clay with good swelling capacity. Hence, blending the RBC with IBC led to an improvement in the rheological parameters. The consistency factor was also increased from 0.03 to 1.52. The consistency index which indicates the flow behavior of the mud shows that the mud still behaves like a non-Newtonian fluid. Addition of PAC to the mud samples shows a great improvement in the rheological parameters. PAC was added to the mud samples to ensure that the mud rheological parameters meet up with API standard. Addition of 0.5 g of PAC increased the 10-s gel strength for sample A from 0.5 to 1.0 1b/100 ft 2 and from 3 to 40 1b/100 ft 2 for sample F. The yield point increased from 1.0 to 5.0 1b/100 ft 2 for sample A and from 9.5 to 50.0 1b/100 ft 2 for sample F. The increment in the yield point is beyond API standard as API requires a maximum of 30 1b/100 ft 2 for the yield point. But for sample E, addition of 0.5 g of PAC to the mud sample increased the yield point of the mud from 3.5 to 29.5 1b/100 ft 2 , which is in the range of API standard. The plastic viscosity of the mud at this point was increased from 3 to 11.5 cP. It was increased beyond the maximum value set by API (8-10 cP). Samples A with addition of 1 g of PAC increased the plastic viscosity from 2.0 to 9.0 cP, while sample C with addition of 0.5 g of PAC increased the plastic viscosity from 2.5 cP to 10 cP which is in the range of API standard. Figures 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6 and 7 show the impact of the substitution process on the shear stress/shear rate relationship of the various mud samples considered. The mud samples prepared with 100%RBC had a very low shear stress relationship indicating a poor viscous nature of the fluid as seen in Fig. 2 . But upon blending RBC with IBC using the blending ratio in Table 1 , it is seen that the shear stress behavior of the mud reduced initially for sample B when 80%RBC was blended with 20%IBC and increased as the percentage of IBC increases. This is shown in Fig. 8 . Figure 8 shows the shear stress/shear rate relationship of all the mud samples prepared without the addition of PAC. Blending RBC with IBC was able to increase the shear stress/shear rate relationship making the fluid to behave like a Bingham plastic fluid. Also beneficiating the mud samples prepared with PAC was able to improve the shear stress/shear rate relationship greatly. Blending RBC with IBC had a slight impact on the mud pH. The pH of the mud prepared with 100%RBC (sample A) was 7.0, while that prepared with 100%IBC (sample G) was 8.0. The pH of sample F was 7.5 which was as a result of the high percentage of IBC present in the mud. It was observed that addition of PAC did not alter the mud pH ( Table 6 ).The economic analysis of partial to total substitution of IBC with RBC at different consumption rates is discussed in this section. Table 7 shows the cost of each blend of clay with and without PAC per laboratory barrel. The costs of sample A, sample D, sample F and sample G without PAC per laboratory barrel were $0.0055, $0.0106, $0.0136 and $0.0156, respectively. Addition of PAC to the mud samples increased the cost of one laboratory barrel of each sample by $0.0022 and $0.0044 when 0.5 g and 1.0 g of PAC were added to the mud samples. The cost of sample F with 0.5 g of PAC per laboratory barrel was higher than the cost of sample G which is 100%IBC. This shows that addition of PAC for sample F increases the cost of the clay blend beyond the cost when 100% of IBC was used. Table 8 shows the cost of each blend of clay per field barrel. Similar observation was made as addition of PAC to the mud samples also increased the cost of the clay blend. As the percentage of IBC increases, the cost of the clay blend also increases. This is because IBC is more expensive than RBC. Hence, the higher the percentage of IBC in the mud sample, the higher the cost of the clay blend. On a field barrel basis, the costs of sample A, sample D, sample F and sample G without PAC were $2.50, $4.80, $6.12 and $7.10.The economic impact of partial to total substitution of IBC with RBC on a well basis is shown in Table 9 . It is seen that the costs of using sample A, sample D, sample F without PAC to drill the well were $3750, $7200 and $9270 and with 0.5 g of PAC were $5250, $8700 and $10,770. The cost of imported bentonite clay used to drill the well in Agbatu field was $10,650. It is observed also that the cost of sample F with 0.5 g of PAC was higher than the cost of sample G, which means more money will be spent for usage of such clay blend which is not desirable. But for usage of sample A to sample E with PAC, a company can save about 12% to 36% of the cost of bentonite clay used to drill a well. This can be seen in Fig. 9 . Figure 9 shows the percentage of cost saved per usage of any of the blends of clay. It is also seen that blending RBC with IBC alone could make a company save about 13% to 51% of the cost of bentonite. The blend of clay without PAC could be used to drill shallow sections of the well, and as the depth increases, the use of PAC becomes inevitable in most cases. Table 10 shows the cost of using any of the clay blends with and without PAC on a ton basis. The cost of a ton of sample A (100%RBC) was $250 and sample G (100%IBC) was $710. The costs of a ton of sample C, sample E and sample F without PAC were $434, $526 and $618, while with 0.5 g of PAC, the costs were $534, $626 and $718. The cost of sample F with PAC is undesirable as it is more expensive than sample G (100%IBC). The cost of using any of the clay blends as shown in Table 10 can be used to determine the cost implication of substituting IBC with RBC based on a Nation's consumption capacity. In 2010, RMRDC estimated that Nigeria consumed 200,000 metric tonnes of bentonite clay. Using any of the acceptable clay blends could have saved the country about $17,040,000 to $51,120,000.Blending RBC with IBC had an impact on the rheological behavior of the mud. The viscosity at 600 rpm of the mud prepared with 100%RBC was 5 cP, and it was improved to 17.5 cP. The viscosity values for all the blends of clay obtained were not up to API standard. But upon blending it with PAC, the viscosity of the mud met with API standard.Also, addition of PAC to the different mud samples increased other rheological parameters of the mud making some of the blends of clay suitable for drilling operations as they were able to meet up with API standard.The economic analysis reveals that an oil company or oil and gas nation could save 12 to 36% of the cost of bentonite clay used for drilling operations at different rates of consumption. Also, it was seen that using sample F which consists of 80%IBC and 20%RBC with PAC is undesirable as the cost of the sample exceeds the cost of using 100% imported bentonite clay (sample G).Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank African Development Bank for funding this research work.Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

The virus's fast transmission worldwide and a large number of confirmed cases made the World Health Organization (WHO) declare COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (2) . As of October 11, 2020 , the virus has spread to 235 different countries, infected more than 37 million people, and caused more than one million deaths (https://covid19.who.int/). It should be noted that mortality from SARS-CoV-2 differs considerably by geographic region. In Morocco, the first case of COVID-19 was identified on March 02. Since then, the number of infections and the number of deaths has been increasing continuously; by October 11, 2020 , the Moroccan ministry of Health announced 149,841 confirmed cases, including 2,572 deaths.SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, encoding four structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16), and five accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8) (3, 4) . Among these, two genes are considered to be the most important targets for candidate vaccines: the S protein, which is responsible for the binding to host cells membrane receptors (ACE2) via its receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also called nsp12) which is a key part of the virus replication/transcription machinery (5) (6) (7) .It is known that the mutation rate of the RNA virus contributes to viral adaptation, creating a balance between the integrity of genetic information and the variability of the genome, thus allowing viruses to evade the host's immune system and develop drug resistance (8, 9) . Indeed, recent studies have reported specific genotypes at particular geographic locations and that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time shows a mechanism of co-accumulation of mutations that could potentially affect the spread and the severity of this virus (OYW).At the time of writing, genetic variants, their impact, and distribution along the viral genome of Moroccan strains are poorly documented. Few studies investigating the genetic characteristics have been done so far. The analysis of 20 Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes suggested that the epidemic spread in Morocco did not show a predominant SARSCoV-2 route and took origin from multiple and unrelated sources (8) . In this study, we investigated the level of diversity of 48 strains of SARS-CoV-2 that were collected in Morocco between mid-March and the end of May 2020, including nine new strains. The potential source of these strains was also predicted by comparison to other genomes from six continents.Thirty-nine Moroccan genomes were collected from the GISAID database (http://gisaid.org) (10) .Also, nine genomes were sequenced in-house recently to build a dataset counting 48 Moroccan genomes.The nine genomes' sequencing was achieved by the routine workflow on the MinION Mk1B Nanopore platform using the R9.4.1 flowcell. The viral RNA was extracted from nine clinical samples, and the cDNA was synthesized using a kit (Roche) with random hexamers. Genome enrichment was done by Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB), following the manufacturer's specifications, using a set of primers designed by the ARTIC network (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) that target overlapping regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The PCR products were purified by adding an equal volume of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).The sequencing was performed according to the eight-hour routine workflow, and amplicons were repaired with NEBNext FFPE Repair Mix (NEB), followed by the DNA ends preparation using NEBNext End repair/ dA-tailing Module (NEB) before adding native barcodes and sequencing adapters supplied in the EXP-NBD104/114 kit (Nanopore) to the DNA ends. After priming the flow cell, 60 ng DNA per sample was pooled with a final volume of 65 uL. Following the ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) protocol, the sequencing was performed using the MinION Mk1B device.The gupplyplex and minion scripts of the ARTIC Network bioinformatics protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html) were used for reads Preprocessing and Consensus Building for nanopore sequencing. Gupplyplex (default parameters) was used for quality control and filtering of reads (--min-length 400 --max-length 700) followed by MinION pipeline (default parameters) to perform the sequences mapping, primers trimming, variations calling, and consensus assembly building.A set of 39 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from the GISAID database (http://www.gisaid.org/) and added to the nine newly sequenced genomes (10)( Table 1 ).The reads generated by MinION Nanopore-Oxford of the nine isolates were mapped to the reference sequence genome Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 using BWA-MEM v0.7.17-r1188 (11) with default parameters, while the data downloaded from the GISAID database were mapped using Minimap v2.12-r847 (12) The BAM files were sorted using SAMtools (13) and were subsequently used to call the genetic variants in variant call format (VCF) by BCFtools (13) . The final call set of the 48 genomes was annotated, and their impact was predicted using SnpEff v 4.3t (14) . First, the SnpEff databases were built locally using annotations of the reference genome NC_045512.2 obtained in the GFF format from the NCBI database. Then, the SnpEff database was used to annotate SNPs and with putative functional effects according to the categories defined in the SnpEff manual (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html) . The variants were also evaluated for functional consequences using the SIFT algorithm (34). The SIFT prediction is given as a Tolerance Index score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, which is the normalized probability that the amino acid change is tolerated. SIFT scores less than or equal to 0.05 are predicted by the algorithm to be intolerant or deleterious amino acid substitutions, while scores greater than 0.05 are considered tolerant.In order to determine the source(s) of strains circulating in morocco, we performed a multiple sequence alignment using Muscle v 3.8 (15) The generated (.fasta) file was converted to a (.meg) file using a home-made script. Using the dnasp5 tool (17), we generated the file (.rdf), compatible with the NETWORK Package, which allowed the network's tracing linking the 48 genomes' haplotypes, using the MJ (Median Joining).In order to estimate genealogical relationships of haplotype groups, the phylogenetic networks were inferred by PopART package v1.7.2 (18)using the TCS method and MSN, respectively.To identify and study the genetic variants of the SARS-COV-2 genomes from Morocco, 48 genomes were collected from mid-March to the end of May; including nine strains sequenced in the present study (Supplementary Material , Table S1 ). 94.9% to 99.

We systematically performed the analysis predicting the deleterious effect of missense mutations in two genomes or more. Functional evaluation based on the SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) algorithm broke the tolerance index score of 15 missense mutations (found in two genomes or more), revealing its deleterious effect ( Table 1) . To estimate the number of introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Morocco, an analysis of the haplotype network was carried out using the 48 strains. Our results showed that these strains were grouped into five distinct clades, harboring 28 haplotypes from which three were dominant ( Figure   2 ). Current samples have shown three major haplotypes harboring the majority of strains, H2 (11 strains), H4 (5 strains), H5 (4 strains), followed by H17, H21, and H1, indicating the predominance of H2 among Moroccan strains.In Figure 3 , the haplotypes are distributed in potential haplotype groups. Specifically, 43, 16, 47, and 88 haplotypes may be sub-haplotypes of primary ancestral haplotypes H1, H89, H25, and H59.Three of the 194 haplotypes that were found in Moroccan isolates were Moroccan-specific. The majority of Moroccan sequences were associated with haplotype group H25. The haplotype groups' distribution patterns differed in various geographic regions, with a few countries/territory specific. The 25 haplotypes harbored mainly strains from Asia, North American, and Africa, respectively, and are considered the ancestral strains. The number of haplotypes increased over time as new variants were continuously acquired in haplotype group 2, harboring the second biggest haplotype, including strains from Europe, Morocco, Asia, Africa, and South America, which originated 17 Moroccan haplotypes. H89 contained mainly strain from Asia, Africa, and Europe and give birth to five haplotypes from North America and Morocco. Lastly, group 4, which contains mostly strains from Asia, harbored fewer strains from Morocco.The phylogenetic analysis was carried out using 272 genomes from different countries belonging to the six continents (Supplementary Material ; Table S3 ) to study the possible origin of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Morocco. According to the GISAID nomenclature (Figure 3) , our results revealed seven main clades: the ""L"" clade mainly contained genomes from Asia, while the other clades contained genomes belonging to different geographical areas. We observed that all Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 strains belonged to three close clades ""G, GH, and GR,"" harboring all the D614G mutation. These clades are also subdivided into several subclades. Overall, Moroccan strains were closely related to those from different continents, indicating different infection sources.The monitoring of genetic variants plays a significant role in orienting the therapeutic approach for the development of candidate vaccines to limit the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (19) , as there is currently no proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2.To date, the genetic diversity of strains of SARS-CoV-2 from Morocco is poorly documented. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of genetic variants of forty-eight Moroccan strains, including nine newly sequenced, to provide new information on genetic diversity and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Morocco.Genetic diversity could potentially increase the physical shape of the viral population and make it difficult to fight, or the opposite, make the virus weaker, which could be translated with a loss of its virulence and a decrease in the number of critical cases (20) . Compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 reference sequence, Moroccan strains harbored 4 to 15 genetic variants per strain, of which 1 to 11 involve a change of amino acids. These results are consistent with the mutation rate previously reported in SASR-CoV-2 from different geographic areas (21) (22) (23) (24) , reporting a low frequency of recurrent mutations in thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (21) . In total, 108 variant sites have been identified, of which only 36% are present in two or more genomes. This result correlates with previous studies that SARS-CoV-2 evolved and diversified mainly by a random genetic drift, which plays a dominant role in propagating single mutations (25) (26) (27) .The mutations were distributed along the virus genome. The ORF1ab polyprotein region, known to be express 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16), had several mutations that could affect their activity (3) . Three non-synonymous deleterious mutations were found in the RdRp region (also called nsp12), a key part of the replication/transcription machinery, and which is proposed as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit viral infection (28, 29) . Likewise, a deleterious mutation has been predicted in the NSP3 protein, In addition, two deleterious mutations have been observed in ORF3a, an accessory protein that makes it possible to regulate the interferon signaling pathway and the production of cytokines (30) , and the structural N protein that plays a crucial function in the virus genome by regulating RNA transcription and modulating biological processes in infected cells.RNA viruses acquire mutations readily, most of which are deleterious, and viruses carrying such mutations are eliminated. If a mutation reaches a high frequency, the mutation is expected to provide a selective advantage to the virus, usually manifested by a higher transmission efficiency.Three of these deleterious mutations (T5020I-nsp3, G204R-N, Q57H-ORF3a) have been previously reported (N-P) as hotspot mutations a large population belonging to different geographical areas.Five non-synonymous mutations were common within at least two genomes, among them, D614G (in S protein) and Q57H (in OR3a). The D614G mutation is proximal to the S1 cleavage domain of advanced glycoprotein (31) and was of great interest due to their predominance in the six continents (32, 33) . Alouane et al. (21) showed that this mutation appeared for the first time on January 24, 2020, in the Asian region (China); after a week, it was also observed in Europe (Germany). The Q57H mutation was taken away end of February in Africa (Senegal), Europe (France and Belgium), and North America (the USA and Canada). Likewise, our previous study (21) showed that D614G had no impact on the two-dimensional and three-dimensional advanced glycoprotein structures.Furthermore, four of these five mutations (D614G, Q57H, T265I, and T5020I) have been considered hotspot mutations in a large population (21, 22) . With this in mind, we believe that this will not present a serious issue for vaccine development and that a universal candidate vaccine for all circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 may be possible.It should be noted that our predicted deleterious variants in protein structure lack experimental validation. Further exploration would be needed to confirm their potential effects further.Our results of the haplotype network of Moroccan strains revealed five diverse clades with 28 haplotypes, indicating different infection sources. Besides the haplotype network, the phylogenetic analysis using a set of 273 strains representing the six continents revealed seven main clades. The most important clade contained approximately three-quarters of all the strains. All SARS-CoV-2 strains from North Africa harboring the D614G mutation belonged to this clade, except for three Tunisian strains. Interestingly, the Moroccan and Tunisian strains were closely related to those from Asia, Europe, South, and North America, which could indicate different sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these two countries.The results of this study provide valuable information on the diversity and impact of genetic T a i w a n / 6 2 ","Morocco","abstract","2020-12-05",12

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been estimated at over 185 million infected patients and causes about 1 million deaths per year over the world. The common clinical approaches of the HCV treatments that have been discovered and approved so far include combined dosages of interferon-chemotherapy (pegylated Interferon-α plus ribavirin drug) and herbal compounds (active phytochemical derivatives including polyines, flavonoids, alkaloids, thiophenes and terpenoids) (Foster, 2004; Kamal et al., 2004; Ravikumar et al., 2011) . Nowadays, other viruses like COVID-19 coronavirus are generating a global pandemic worldwide with more the 24 million infected people and more than 800.000 of human deaths.The research gate is accessible always for discovering new strategies and materials to develop antiviral drugs, not only derived from chemical synthesis and biological resources, but also from geological materials (i.e., minerals). Kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 ) is an abundant and inexpensive geomaterial that exhibits hydrated aluminum dioctahedral 1:1 phyllosilicate character widely used in pharmaceutical and biomedicinal applications as excipient and active therapeutic agent (Awad et al., 2017) . Previous work of in vitro trial for testing the inhibitory effect of kaolin minerals, as active therapeutic agent against HCV, was attempted, observing a promising antiviral activity with non-cytotoxic effect on the replicon cell line in the use of this mineral for introducing new anti-HCV derivative compounds (Ali et al., 2014) . However, the pathway and mechanism of this inhibitory action is still not understood.In the recent decade, many authors have paid attention to molecular structure and functions of the viral capsid proteins, because most of which are effectively being considered as antiviral targets. Particularly, the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of the structural envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 play a direct role in heterodimerization that is essential for the formation of the viral envelope, hepatocyte receptor binding, entry and fusion of the virus with the cell. These TMDs consist (Beeck et al., 2000) ; (b) Model protein-fragment neutralized by chloride anion and optimized with CVFFH; and (c) protein-fragment within a box of an aqueous medium of 626 water molecules optimized. (Beeck et al., 2000) . b Integrated values from the MD simulation of hydrated protein.of two stretches of hydrophobic residues separated by a short segment containing at least one fully conserved charged residue. Hence, it is highly expected that deletion or replacement of these charged residues lead to alter all the functions of the TMDs of E1 and E2 (Selby et al., 1994; Michalak et al., 1997; Beeck et al., 2000; Cocquerel et al., 2000; Voisset and Dubuisson, 2004; Moradpour et al., 2005) . At molecular level, the polypeptides can have charged groups. The negative net charge that appears on the protein molecule arises from carboxylate groups (COO − ) of the amino acids (e.g., aspartate ASP and glutamate GLU), while the positive net charge carried by the protein molecule is resulted from the amino groups (NH + 3 ) of the basic amino acids (e.g., lysine LYS, arginine ARG and histidine HIS). Accordingly, the positive net charge on the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the HCV glycoprotein E1 molecule is owing to the positive charge basic lysine (LYS) residue Ciczora et al., 2005; Bohidar, 2015) .In the layered structure of kaolinite fundamental particle (diameter < 1 μm and thickness < 100 nm), each layer is simply composed of two sheets: a tetrahedral sheet linked by sharing oxygen atoms with an octahedral sheet in the unit cell. Hence, it exhibits two surfaces along the basal plane: siloxane and aluminol (001) surfaces. The charge on these basal planes is predominately polarizable (nega- (110) and (010) edges is pH-dependent amphoteric due to the protonation/deprotonation of hydroxyl groups, where the edges carry a positive charge at low pH and become negative as the pH increases (Armstrong and Clarke, 1971) . Recently, kaolinite has been subjected to some useful physical and chemical treatments by modifying its surface and structural properties in a way of enhancing its surface activity and interaction with organics and biomolecules by means of altering charge, porosity and increasing surface area in possible novel active derivatives (Lagaly, 2006; Hu et al., 2013) .Hence, this work sheds light on the application of functionalizing kaolinite and its surface modified derivatives at molecular and nanoscale levels as a novel biophysical antiviral agent. The present study applies methods based on atomistic force fields for molecular modeling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to study the potentiality of interaction between protein segment TMD (350-370) of HCV envelope glycoprotein E1 and kaolinite surfaces. Our main aim of this work is to come to predict the behavior of phyllosilicate nanomaterials targeted as anti-HCV agent or kaolinite/protein vaccine, and the extension of this application to other viruses, like COVID-19 coronavirus.The experimental molecular structure of the whole envelope E1 glycoprotein of HCV was not available in the structural databases. Then, only the molecular structure of the TMD fragment (350-370 amino acid units) of this E1 envelope was taken from experimental NMR studies (Beeck et al., 2000) (PDB Code: 1EMZ) (Fig. 1a) . This structure was a positively charged peptide. The kaolinite crystal structure was taken from the experimental neutron powder diffraction and Rietveld refinement (Bish, 1993) (Fig. S1 in Supplementary material).Atomistic calculations based on empirical interatomic potentials forcefields (FF) were performed for the optimizations and total potential energy calculations of the present molecular structures by using Materials Studio™ package (BIOVIA, 2018) . Universal FF (UFF) and Interface FF (we named CVFFH in this work), were used with periodic boundary conditions (Heinz et al., 2006; Heinz and Ramezani-Dakhel, 2016) . The Ewald summation method was applied for the non-bonding interactions. There are several FF that work well for protein modeling, such as, AMBER, CHARMM, and some others (Tarasova et al., 2017; BIOVIA, 2018) . However, it is difficult to find a FF that describes properly mineral and protein structures simultaneously. CVFFH has described well mineral structures and also organic molecules and their interactions with phyllosilicates in previous works (Martos-Villa et al., 2013 . This is useful for exploring organics/mineral adsorption complexes (Sainz-Díaz et al., 2011) . In the present work, molecular dynamics simulations were performed under NVT ensemble at several temperatures (310 K and 400 K) with steps of 1 fs. Several simulations times were used from 100 ps and up to 10 ns. No significant changes were observed after 10 ps of equilibrium time. The average accuracy of these MD simulations is around 0.4%. The use of high temperature was only for enhancing the mobility of the protein and water molecules over the mineral surface to avoid local energy minima. This allowed all peptides of the protein fragment to interact freely with kaolinite surfaces and so, we will be able to study how different peptide residues interact with kaolinite surfaces. Other structural changes, as conformational changes, can occur with static optimization and molecular dynamic conditions. These results were estimated analyzing the radial distribution function (RDF) between O and H atoms.The protein fragment was positively charged and then was neutralized by adding a chloride anion near of an ammonium residue and successfully optimized within a periodical box of 50 × 50 × 50 Å 3 . The optimization energies of the kaolinite unit cell and protein fragment structure were calculated after assigning the atomic charges using the Q Eq method (Rappe and Goddard, 1991) . The measured dimensions of the chloride-neutralized protein fragment structure were 12.57 × 30.12 Å 2 . Then, a (6 × 6 × 1) supercell of kaolinite was used for the adsorption offering an area of 16 nm 2 in the ab-plane of 30.43 × 52.41 Å 2 . This surface was big enough to avoid intermolecular M.E. Awad, et al. Applied Clay Science 199 (2020) 105865 interactions with proteins of vicinal cells during its adsorption in a periodical model. Therefore, the mineral supercell was composed of 1224 atoms distributed within the composition Al 144 Si 144 O 360 (OH) 288 . A free space of 50 Å along the c axis was applied for representing an external surface without interactions between surfaces. Several orientations of the protein-fragment/kaolinite system were optimized. The interaction energy, E, was calculated by the formula:where E kaol+prot is the energy of the adsorption complex of kaolinite with protein-fragment neutralized with chloride; E kaol is the energy of the optimized kaolinite 6x6x1 supercell; and E prot is the energy value of the optimized chloride-neutralized protein.In order to estimate the adsorption affinity and simulate conformational changes of protein/kaolinite interactions in aqueous medium conditions, a cell box of 626 water molecules was generated with a density of 1 g.cm −3 . The size of this water box was chosen taking into account the protein dimensions. Then, the chloride-neutralized protein segment was surrounded by 626 water molecules forming a wet protein model with the kaolinite surface (kaol + prot + wat626). The box with the same number of water molecules was optimized separately (wat626). Hence, the interaction energy of the wet system was obtained by the equation:. The SPC water model was included in the FF, since this model has yielded good results in previous works in protein-water systems (Tarasova et al., 2017) and in the interaction or organics on silicate surfaces (Borrego-Sánchez et al., 2016) .The CVFFH reproduces the experimental lattice cell parameters of the crystal structure of kaolinite better than the Universal FF (Table 1) . Therefore, the CVFFH was chosen to perform the rest of calculations in this work.The molecular structure of the protein fragment was composed of 311 atoms forming 21 amino acids corresponding to the peptide sequence:[LYS-ALA-TRP-ASN-GLY-VAL-MET-SER-PHE-TYR-ALA-ILE-GLY-ALA-LEU-VAL-GLY-TRP-HIS-ALA-GLY]. These amino acids are mainly nonpolar, except histidine (HIS), tyrosine (TYR), serine (SER) and asparagine (ASN) that are polar and neutral. The positively charged residue in this sequence was the N-terminal glycine (GLY) with one ammonium group. In this work, the glycine ammonium group was neutralized with a chloride anion (right part of Fig. 1b) for the present calculations. The carboxylate terminal was negatively charged in a zwitterionic form and belongs to a terminal lysine (LYS) (left side of Fig. 1a) .The protein-segment ( Fig. 1a) was taken from the experimental structure determined by NMR technique in aqueous solution (Beeck et al., 2000) . The chloride neutralized-protein segment was optimized with CVFFH in aqueous medium (with 626 water molecules) conditions ( Fig. 1b) showed conformational changes with respect to the proteinfragment molecular structure optimized in vacuum. A clear volume contraction was observed during the optimization with an inwards folding of the protein (Fig. 1b) , whereas the experimental cationic form is more extended (Fig. 1a) . Similar effect was observed experimentally in other proteins as Cytochrome C (Castellini et al., 2009 ). This behavior can be due to the differences in the local environment with the neutralization with chloride. This hydration is favorable with a exothermic hydration energy of the protein-segment of −572.65 kcal/mol. Nevertheless, a certain volume contraction was observed where the protein adopts a zig-zag folding from the positive ammonium terminal group (right zone in Fig. 1c ) to the carboxylate terminal group (left hand in Fig. 1c) .The hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions between O and H atoms are important for the intramolecular interactions in the proteinfragment. The radial distribution function (RDF) analysis of the intramolecular O…H distances showed a clear peak of the OeH bond at the interval 0.926-0.992 Å in the optimized structure in vacuum, similar to the optimized with water and consistent with the values in the experimental structure (0.948-0.990 Å). The closest intramolecular O…H interactions from the molecular dynamics runs of the proteinfragment/water are close to that of the experimental ones except for the peak at 1.77 Å, supporting the use of this FF for protein ( Table 2) .The complex of protein-fragment with water molecules hydrating the protein was equilibrated with MD simulations. The range of the d (OeH) bond length in the integration profile of the MD simulations (100 ps) of the hydrated protein was, d(OeH) = 0.907-1.111 Å (Fig. 2a, first narrow peak) . The integrated RDF profile for the nonbonding intramolecular O…H distances (Fig. 2a) shows broad peaks with a qualitatively similar pattern to the equilibrated models and experimental one with hydrogen bonds at 1.77 and 1.83 Å in the experimental and calculated structures (Table 2) , respectively, and intense peaks around 2.45-2.8 Å and 3.1 Å. The main peaks of the RDF profiles for the intramolecular non-bonding O···H distances (Fig. 2a) of the hydrated protein were similar to those from the experimental structure (Table 2 , first column). This is because the experimental structure has been extracted from NMR analysis in aqueous solution in a similar media that in the MD simulations (Beeck et al., 2000) . On the other hand, the intermolecular interactions between the water H atoms and the protein-fragment O atoms in the hydrated structure were shorter than the intramolecular interactions (Fig. 2) . In the protein/ water intermolecular interactions, the RDF profiles (Fig. 2b,c) showed that the distance between the closest protein-H and water-O atoms, d (H prot …O w ), were represented by peaks at 1.71, and 1.83 Å (Table 2) , but the proportion was the lowest (Fig. 2b) . The most intense peaks were in the zone of 2.2-3.1 Å. This profile indicated that the shortest distances below 2.0 Å have very low population being less probable in consequence. This is consistent with the profile of the initial optimized structure, but with few strong interactions with distances smaller than 2.0 Å. On the other hand, in the intermolecular non-bonding distances between the protein-fragment O atoms and the water H atoms, d (O prot …H w ) (Fig. 2c) , short distances were detected after MD simulations at 1.55, 1.69, and 2.05 Å (Fig. 2c) . The d(O prot …H w ) distances were shorter than the d(H prot …O w ) ones, indicating that the protein is more likely to be an acceptor of hydrogen bonds from water molecules.Significant and potential fragments of HCV capsid proteins could be isolated and loaded on phyllosilicate surface through an albuminous medium for such trial testing as vaccines and for enhancing the immune response. For the adsorption of protein on the kaolinite surface, the most stable surface was considered, the (001) basal one. Two possible (001) surfaces of kaolinite were considered: i) the surface covered with hydroxyl groups of the aluminol groups; and ii) the siloxane surface. In addition, at least two possible orientations of the protein with respect to the mineral surface can be considered for the adsorption process: i) the prot-A, upon which some alkyl groups, some heterocycles, and the M.E. Awad, et al. Applied Clay Science 199 (2020) 105865 terminal ammonium group of glycine neutralized with chloride oriented to the mineral surface; and ii) prot-B, upon which the terminal carboxylate group of the lysine residue, the thioether and phenyl groups oriented to mineral surface (Fig. 1) . The protein-fragment was previously stabilized with the presence of 626 water molecules and after placed on the surfaces of the supercell of kaolinite. The whole model has 2161 atoms each. All possible combinations of these surfaces and orientations of the protein-fragment were optimized as adsorption complexes before and after the MD simulations. In all cases the adsorption processes were exothermic (Table 3) . After these optimizations and before the MD simulation some differences in the interaction energy between orientations prot-A and prot-B of the protein-fragment were observed, being more exothermic after the MD simulations. This happened in both kaolinite surfaces. Besides, the adsorption was much more favorable with the aluminol surface than in the siloxane surface, as it was expected owing to the interactions between hydroxyl groups of kaolinite and the polar groups of protein-fragment. The most exothermic adsorption was on the aluminol surface and the prot-B orientation of the protein-fragment (Table 3) .The presence of water is important for a more realistic scenario. Therefore, this work is focused on the protein-mineral interaction in wet conditions. Nevertheless, the analysis of the interaction of this protein fragment and kaolinite surfaces along with MD simulations in dry conditions were described and discussed in the Supplementary material section for comparison.In the aluminol surface, the water molecules were closer to surface than in the siloxane surfaces (Fig. 3) . The protein configurations were similar on aluminol surface that on siloxane surface. In all cases the protein structures were different to those observed in hydrated state without kaolinite (see later). The protein was not in direct contact with the mineral surface. In general, a layer of water molecules was localized between protein and kaolinite surface. A certain interaction between the indole H atom of tryptophan and the basal tetrahedral O siloxane atoms of kaolinite was observed at 3.75 Å.After the MD simulations, the water molecules were more strongly interacting with the aluminol surface than the siloxane surface. However, water molecules tended to be clustered as a globular form in all surfaces. This effect seems to be more clear in the siloxane surface than in the aluminol surface, due probably to the hydrophobic affinity of the siloxane surface, whereas protein adsorbate is closer to the aluminol surface (Fig. 4) .The MD simulations (100 ps) of the hydrated systems showed average peak positions on the RDF profiles of the O···H intramolecular and intermolecular interactions of the calculated 626 water molecules with all the hydrated kaolinite and protein surface orientations (Fig. 5) . Notice, the average O···H peak positions on RDF profile of the present simulated water molecules (Fig. 5a) were in good agreement with the previously reported liquid water SPC/E model and the experimental data obtained with neutron diffraction (Soper and Phillips, 1986; Mark and Nilsson, 2001) . The RDF profile integrated from MD sampling of the intermolecular O···H interactions between the H atoms of prot-B and the kaolinite siloxane surface O atoms in the MD simulations showed peak positions for H···O distances at 2.07, 2.21, 2.44, 2.52, and 2.6 Å (Fig. 5b) , the last two peaks being the most intense. This indicated hydrogen bonds between protein and kaolinite siloxane surface. The average closest distances of the hydrated protein-fragment intramolecular O···/-H interactions on the RDF profile (Fig. 5c ) exhibited identical peak positions with all the orientations on kaolinite surfaces. The OeH bond lengths are described by the intense peak at 0.98 Å;M.E. Awad, et al. Applied Clay Science 199 (2020) 105865 whereas, intramolecular hydrogen bonds are observed at 2.08, 2.52, 2.84, and 3.11 Å. This RDF profile shows some differences with that observed without kaolinite surface (Fig. 2a) indicating that the configuration of the protein is different. These changes could suggest a certain denaturalization of the protein owing to the surface effect (Yu et al., 2000) , however no clear evidence can be concluded with these results and further investigations in this way should be performed. The RDF profiles of the intermolecular interactions between the protein-fragment H-atoms and water O atoms were similar for all protein orientations on kaolinite surfaces. The first peak position was broad and prominent at 1.82 Å (Fig. 5d) . However, the maximum peaks appear at longer distances than 2.7 Å, whereas in the MD simulation of wet protein-fragment without kaolinite maximum peaks at shorter distances (2.2-2.6 Å) were observed (Fig. 2b) . The water H atoms interacted with the O atoms of the protein-fragment in presence of kaolinite surfaces showing H/O RDF profiles with low populations at short distances (1.6-2.2 Å, Fig. 5e ). However, the protein-fragment O atoms interacted with the H atoms of the water molecules adsorbed on the kaolinite aluminol surface exhibiting a very intensive and distinguished H/O RDF peak at 2.18 Å (Fig. 5f) .The water molecules on the kaolinite surfaces show a different behavior for each mineral surface. The RDF profile of the aluminol surface H atoms with the water O atoms (Fig. 5g) shows short non-bonding distances at 1,6-2.0 Å, corresponding to the H bonds at similar distances that in the first coordination sphere of liquid water (Fig. 5a) . However, the RDF profile of the siloxane surface O atoms with the water H atoms shows a low density of H bonds at 1.5-2.2 Å and the main density correspond to longer distances (Fig. 5h) . This indicates the hydrophilia of kaolinite aluminol surface with respect to the more hydrophobia of the siloxane surface.In spite of the whole protein-fragment was completely hydrated and surrounded by water molecules, this model could be considered limited because the amount of water does not cover completely the interlayer space between mineral surfaces, provoking a solid-liquid-air interphase. Hence this model was extended filling the whole interlayer space with disordered water molecules. The total amount of water was 2400 water molecules per protein fragment. This model (8730 atoms) was optimized obtaining a similar structure than above model. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed at 310 K with 1 fs steps during 0.7 ns. The final structure (Fig. 6a ) was similar to previous ones with a layer of water between protein and mineral surface (see Supplementary Video 1 in Supplementary material). The RDF between C atoms of protein-fragment and H atoms of the aluminol surface showed low intensity peaks at 2.5-4.5 Å, corresponding mainly to the tryptophan residue (Fig. 6b) . Although there is enough water medium space in the upper part of the model, the protein-fragment was maintained close to the aluminol surface, indicating an affinity to the mineral surface. The calculated adsorption energy was −10.31 kcal/mol corroborating this affinity. This is consistent with previous experimental (Lambert, 2008; Docoslis et al., 2001) and theoretical (Patwardhan et al., 2012) works on adsorption of peptides with silicate surfaces. Longer MD simulations were performed with this model up to 10 ns. The structure of the adsorption complex samples was different to the former one after 0.7 ns. The protein conformation changed completely in a more compact form with a certain zone close to the mineral surface. With this long MD simulation, a certain flexibility of the mineral layer is observed (Fig. 6c) . The RDF integrated on the sampling frames along the simulations showed different profiles with respect to the previous shorter simulations. The RDF profile of the water O atoms with respect to the aluminol surface H atoms shows strong H bond interactions at 1.8-2.5 Å (Fig. 6d) . The RDF profile of the carbonyl O atoms of protein with respect to the surface H atoms shows a certain group close to the surface at H bond distances 1.7-2.8 Å (Fig. 6e) . The atomic density profile along the 001 direction on the interlayer space showed that the protein (O and N atoms protein profiles) remains close to one surface not in the middle of the interlayer space and close to the aluminol M.E. Awad, et al. Applied Clay Science 199 (2020) 105865 (caption on next page) M.E. Awad, et al. Applied Clay Science 199 (2020) 105865 surface instead of the siloxane surface. Water molecules are more concentrated close to the mineral surfaces, being much more close to the aluminol surface than to the siloxane one. A short-range ordering of the water molecule is observed being more random in the middle of the interlayer space. As observed in the concentration profiles, certain carbonyl groups approach very close to the aluminol surface indicating that some carbonyl groups do not form only collinear H bonds, but several H bonds with surrounding surface H atoms allow being closer to the surface (Fig. 6f) . Recent experimental results of zeta potential titration of kaolinite have shown dissociation of the kaolinite surface at neutral pH (Jacquet et al., 2018) . Then, at neutral pH some OH groups of kaolinite can be dissociated. This situation can be described with a model were some OH groups of the aluminol surface of kaolinite were deprotonated remaining a negatively charged surface. The original form of the protein fragment was protonated. Then, the protein fragment can be adsorbed as a cation in this scenario on the negatively charged mineral surface. These models were optimized as a static model obtaining adsorption energy of −77.18 kcal/mol. Some Lewis acid-base interactions with electrostatic forces can be also be present in these conditions.On the other hand, the adsorption can be produced by cation exchange with the kaolinite surface negatively charged neutralized with the presence of a Na + cation and the protein cation with a chloride anion. With both systems, the adsorption complex will have the protein cation adsorbed on the kaolinite anion and the solvated Na + and Cl − ions out of the adsorption process. These models were also optimized . 7) obtaining higher adsorption energy (−147.56 kcal/mol) than the previous one. Both cases indicate that the effect of pH at neutral aqueous media favors the adsorption of this protein fragment on the mineral surface. Such conditions could be mainly considered experimentally in case of design applications and development in biomedicine where the normal human blood pH is tightly regulated between 7.35 and 7.45 and the plasma could be neutralized in some critical therapeutic conditions by buffering systems, also for possible application in the design of viral-adsorbent agents for treatment of water contaminated by human viruses.This work introduces a new modeling and mechanism that can help for the understanding of the experimental behavior and improve the applicability and development of kaolinite as antiviral agent. The present study sheds light on the possible interactions between the viral capsid proteins and phyllosilicate surfaces. This work was focused only on the most critical fragment for the fixation of virus to human cell receptors. Further studies on the whole protein structure and the glycoxy moiety should be done in future. The molecular dynamics simulations and calculations indicated that the presence of kaolinite surfaces changes the conformations of the main protein segment TMD M.E. Awad, et al. Applied Clay Science 199 (2020) 105865 (350-370) of HCV envelope glycoprotein E1. This is likely to be adsorbed on the kaolinite surfaces favorably with an exothermic process. The intermolecular interactions were mainly hydrogen bonds and electrostatic ones. The hydration effect was critical for the conformation of protein and for the adsorption of the protein fragment on kaolinite surfaces. In a system saturated with water, the protein was completely solvated by water and remains attracted to the mineral surface. This adsorption was more favorable to be with the hydrophilic aluminol (001) surface than with the siloxane surface. Longer MD simulations corroborate the strong interactions with H bonds of the protein with the aluminol mineral surface. The adsorption affinity becomes more favorable at neutral pH media, where some OH groups of the kaolinite were partially dissociated. Therefore, targeted kaolinite nanoparticles can interact with the charged residues in the transmembrane domains of hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoproteins leading to molecular conformational changes and alter dysfunctions of the TMDs causing viral inhibition. This study can predict that the kaolinite can be considered in an exploratory research for a therapeutic treatment against HCV. The computational results could be considered as initial stage for evaluating limitations and take previous conclusion to go to a long-term project, intending to further trials on antiviral therapeutic, including the COVID-19 coronavirus, or treatment of human virus-contaminated water strategies based on mineral surface properties. Besides, this kind of interactions can be also produced in any prebiotic reaction pathway on the mineral surfaces in early Earth.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2020.105865.None.

[1] [2] [3] The pandemic presents an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that has impacted health systems and disrupted the livelihood and overall well-being of people globally. 4, 5 Although the number of COVID-19 cases in Africa is currently lower than that of other regions of the world, these numbers are increasing gradually. 1 As of November 14, 2020, 1,965,485 cases and 47,134 deaths have been reported in the African region. 6 The pandemic has made evident weaknesses in responding to public health emergencies such as COVID-19, on the continent. 1 Although African governments and other stakeholders continue to make efforts to contain the pandemic, there is more to be done to put the pandemic to an end. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact human rights and exacerbates inequalities and disparities that are already in existence. Despite the efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic on the continent, the marginalized and underrepresented groups have been reported to be left behind and discriminated against in the course of the COVID-19 responses. 7, 8 Creating equitable access to mainstream healthcare services and ensuring inclusive health responses serve as a means of addressing health inequities and disparities. In this article, we argue on the need for inclusive health response to public health emergencies in Africa using COVID-19 as a case example.The concept of inclusive health focuses on good health and well-being for everyone; and this entails health services that are equitable, affordable, and efficacious. 9 This concept also resonates with a rights-based approach to health including political, social, economic, scientific, and cultural actions that are geared toward advancing the cause of good health and well-being for all. 9 With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is increasingly important to ensure an inclusive health approach to health emergencies on the continent. It is now evident that it is not all about achieving ""health for all"" but an ""inclusive approach"" in meeting the health needs and responding to public health emergencies. 9 In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health emergencies, health responses need to be genuinely empowering so that vulnerable, underrepresented, and marginalized ""voices"" are included in social discourse, policy, and the health response. Although most health policy documents may refer to ""all people,"" ""for all,"" ""all citizens,"" or ""everybody,"" they often end up privileging ""some"" over ""all."" 9 Vulnerable and marginalized populations usually have greater healthcare needs than others and are therefore more vulnerable to the impact of low-quality, inaccessible healthcare services as well as noninclusive uniform public health responses than others. 8 In addressing public health issues, it is important to make it clear that no one is more important than the other, and the response efforts must not leave behind the most disadvantaged groups. The impact of public health response needs to be viewed from the lens of how it will affect the marginalized group and what can be done to prevent any form of inequity. Right to health is a human right, so the approach to responding to health emergencies needs to be able to ensure that right to equitable health is not infringed on and the outcome of the response should not weigh negatively on the vulnerable groups. It is also worthy to note that if public health responses exclude the marginalized ""voices,"" there is a potential threat of reversal in any hardwon progress and efforts in addressing such public health crisis. 7, 8 This highlights the need for African governments, national health authorities, and other stakeholders to lead the path in ensuring inclusive responses to public health emergencies.Sex workers in some African countries (e.g., Nigeria, Uganda, and Botswana) are excluded from the government's safety nets in response to COVID-19. 7 This forced some sex workers back to work amid the lockdown imposed by the national health authorities in the early days of the pandemic. Lockdown policies in many African countries and globally have significantly affected access to antiretroviral drugs and care services among people living with HIV. People living with disabilities have also been significantly affected by uniform response activities in many African countries. 10 According to a rapid virtual audit of pandemic-related press briefings and press conferences issued by governments and international organizations, only 54% of sub-Saharan African countries have a sign language interpreter present in COVID-19 press briefings and conferences. 11 COVID-19 has already caused interruptions in vaccination schedules in many African countries, further putting many children at risk of vaccine-preventable Prison-based harm reduction services Ensure that the right to health among inmates is not infringed on Access to condoms and PPE Direct investment to enable African prisons to cope with public health emergencies Structures that allow for physical distancing and proper ventilation Access to clean water and soap COVID-19 testing diseases. It has also weakened public health responses to ailments such as malaria and meningitis outbreaks and reduced access to maternal and reproductive health services, further discriminately affecting at-risk groups. COVID-19 also highlights the vulnerability of healthcare professionals to the impact of public health emergencies and how they can be discriminately affected. This vulnerability is compounded by limited access to protective equipment and stigmatization, which impacts on their mental health, as reported in some African countries. 5 Some researchers have also reported how people who use drugs are left out of the COVID-19 responses in some African countries, for example, Kenya and Nigeria, with the potential threat of affecting HIV response and access to healthcare services among this group. 8, 12 COVID-19 has also been reported to exacerbate long-standing problems in Africa's prisons and how precautionary measures, such as handwashing and physical distancing to reduce disease transmission among the inmates, are challenging to observe because of poor infrastructure. 13 A report from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, the regions with consistently high maternal and neonatal mortality rates, also revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has grossly affected antenatal care services. 14 The disruption of these services, if not addressed, may affect the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 Target 1, which aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. The noted disruption in healthcare services in Africa is also affecting older adults with chronic diseases in the region. 15 Access to healthcare services among people living with chronic diseases, 16 people with lower socioeconomic status, homeless people, migrants, minorities, and other vulnerable groups is discriminately affected before the pandemic, and the urgent need to address the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this challenge.Although some efforts have been made in Africa toward ensuring an inclusive response, more efforts still need to be carried out. For instance, Ethiopia is translating COVID-19 health information into local languages 17 and the country plans to make communication materials accessible to those with seeing, learning, and hearing difficulties, as well as people living with mental illness. 10 It has also been reported that South Africa has granted $10.6 million aid to assist small, medium, and microenterprises, with people living with disabilities and women prioritized. 10 In Nigeria, a faith-based organization is helping with sign language interpretation of COVID-19 health information. 10 Africa's response to public health emergencies needs to recognize that for every marginalized/vulnerable group, it is important that any health intervention designed to meet their needs must be carried out in a way that surmounts any barriers to accessing health care.For Africa's public health response to be more inclusive, there is a need to be more strategic and proactive in reaching out to specific groups to identify and address their peculiar needs (Table 1 ). An inclusive health approach needs action and not just mere inclusion in policy documents. The approach will not only foster solidarity, health equity, and effective community response to public health interventions and emergencies, it is also in line with the sixth element of the Universal Health Coverage movement-""Move Together""which involves setting up diverse multi-stakeholder strategies aimed at engaging and involving everyone without discrimination. The significance of an inclusive, dynamic, multistakeholder response remains critical in the context of COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. A commitment to an inclusive health response implies that response activities will be compassionate and sensitive to all. The aftermath of a noninclusive public health response is expensive. For instance, if marginalized or vulnerable groups with poor access to healthcare services experience COVID-19-related symptoms, they may delay or even forgo being tested and may consequently turn to medical care only in late stages, resulting in worse outcomes. This may put their families at risk, facilitating community spread of the virus. Furthermore, African governments need to start devising means and strategies to ensure inclusive access to COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. 18 CONCLUSION Africa's COVID-19 and other health emergencies response strategies must be inclusive of marginalized and vulnerable groups to ensure they maintain respect for dignity, human rights, and fundamental freedoms and avoid widening already existing health and social disparities. This reinforces the need to ensure full participation of the communities affected and relevant civil society organizations in preparedness and response planning, including maintaining the commitment to universal health coverage and ensuring that the most disadvantaged groups are not forgotten amid the urgent need to respond to any public health emergencies. Strengthening the healthcare systems of African countries through increased political will, increased funding to health care, collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders, and effective leadership remains essential in ensuring inclusive responses to health emergencies.","Nigeria","first author","2020-12-15",12

[5] [6] [7] Antenatal care helps to reduce the occurrence of maternal morbidity and mortality by providing information about danger signs, health promotion, birth preparedness, and care for pregnancy complications. 5 Even though the WHO recommends a minimum of four ANC visita for pregnant women, the maternal mortality during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy still remains high in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. 5, 8 Studies conducted in different countries reported that maternal age, number of living children, educational status, place of residence, occupation, religion, socio-economic status, and previous obstetric history were factors significantly associated with the use of antenatal care service. 5,-8-10 The COVID-19 pandemic is posing considerable challenges for countries to maintain the provision of high quality, essential maternal and newborn health services. 11 Pregnant women and mothers with newborns may experience difficulties accessing services due to transport disruptions and lockdown measures or be reluctant to come to health facilities due to fear of infection. 11 Thus, a modest decline of 10% in coverage of pregnancy related and newborn health-care services were reported due to pandemics. This would result in 28,000 maternal deaths. 12 A recent study done in the US reported that ANC coverage reductions of 39.3-51.9%, due to the pandemic, would result in 56,700 additional maternal deaths. 12 In addition, disruption of maternity services and diversion of resources away from essential pregnancy care, because of prioritizing the COVID-19 response, increased risks of maternal morbidity and mortality. 13 Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in pregnant women were found to be increased during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 14 The indirect effects of COVID-19 at the population level, as a result of social restrictions, lockdown, and reorganization of health systems, has been evident in even well-resourced countries such as Singapore. 15 In low-income countries, the impact of containment and preparedness policies on maternal and newborn health could be more pronounced. Even before the emergence of COVID-19, high-quality and timely maternal health-care services were unavailable, inaccessible, or unaffordable for millions of women. Now, restrictions on travel and gatherings, health facilities with limited infection prevention supplies and unreliable infection control practices, and disrupted community health worker routines threaten to exacerbate limited access to care and negatively impact women's health. 16 Evidence from similar health emergencies, most notably the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, has shown that such mitigating measures as well as the disease itself could have a detrimental impact on women and girls. The Ebola outbreak led to a 75% increase in maternal mortality in West Africa. This evidence suggests that COVID-19 will have a similar effect on women and girls. 17 To the best of the investigators knowledge, there is no published research exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antenatal care utilization among pregnant women in the country including our study setting. This is not only in Ethiopia, as very little is known about it in sub-Saharan African countries.In order to fill this information gap in the scientific literature and in response to the limited evidence in the country, this study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antenatal care utilization among pregnant women attending public facilities in Northeast Ethiopia. Therefore, the result of this study will be beneficial to design strategies for prioritizing maternal healthcare, even with the COVID-19 pandemic period.The study was conducted in health facilities found in northeast Ethiopia, which is from south Wollo zone and Oromia special zone. The area is found in Amara national regional state, which is located 401 Km from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. According to the 2019/2020 data obtained from zonal administration, the total population is 216,384, and 115,114 of them are females. In the area there are four private and two governmental hospitals, eight health centers, and there are a number of private clinics and pharmacies. 18 The submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of Women's Health 2020:12 financial coverage of ANC services in Ethiopia is cost free, covered by state.A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women who attended ANC in the selected health facilities from February 25 to August 30, 2020.The source population was all pregnant women who attended ANC in the selected health facilities, and all pregnant women who attended ANC in the selected health facilities during the data collection period was considered as our study population. Accordingly, a total of 389 pregnant women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the study.The sample size for prevalence of the study was determined using a single population proportion formula based on the following assumptions; level of confidence to be 95%, 5% margin of error, and taking the proportion of ANC utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic period as 50% since there was no previous study:where Z=1.96, d=5%, P=50%, and Q=50% By adding a 5% non-response rate, the sample size was 403.Sample size for factors influencing ANC utilization was calculated using a double population proportion with the assumption of 95% level of confidence, 80% power d=permitted error 5%, P1 (percentage of outcome in unexposed group), ratio of exposed and unexposed group (1) and OR from previous literatures 5, 19 by using Epi-info version 7 software. Thus, the sample size for this study was 403 obtained from a single population proportion formula.We have selected three hospitals purposively, ie, Dessie referral hospital, Kemise General Hospital, and Akasta General Hospital based on the number of catchment population and patient flow. Lists of pregnant women who came for ANC visit were extracted from the ANC registration log book in each Hospital.The proportional size allocation was made from each selected public health facility based on the average number of ANC users in the most recent quarterly report of each health facility (157 participants from Dessie referral hospital, 113 participants from Akasta hospital, and 119 participants from Kemise general hospital). Study participants at each health facility were selected using a simple random sampling technique until the required sample size at each health facility was obtained.The outcome variable of the study was antenatal care utilization. Independent variables of the study were socio-demographic, socio-cultural, facility-related, and obstetric factors). Antenatal care utilization was defined as at least three antenatal care visits, consumed 90+ Iron and Folic Acid tablets, and two or more tetanus toxoid injections taken. Accordingly, if the pregnant women received the entire recommended antenatal care they wer coded as 1; if care was not received, they were coded as zero (0). 20Data was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire which was developed after reviewing relevant literatures. 1, 7, 12, 13, 19 The questionnaire comprised of socio-demographic, socio-cultural, and health facilityelated questions (supplementary material). About six BSc nurse data collectors and three public health officer supervisors were recruited in the data collection. To assure data quality, 2 days of training was given for data collectors and supervisors. In addition, a pretest was done on 10% of the sample at Woldia General Hospital before data collection. Furthermore, there was close day-to-day supervision of data collectors in the data collection process. Finally, it was checked for completeness and consistency.All data was checked for inconsistencies, missing values, and incompleteness, then entered into Epi-data version 3.1 software and exported to STATA version 14 for further analysis. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and proportions, were computed and presented in the form of text and tables. The binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with Antenatal International Journal of Women's Health 2020:12 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress care utilization for the meaningful interpretation of results. Enter method was used to select candidate variables having a P-value of <0.2 in the bi-variable analysis and entered to the multivariable analysis for controlling the possible confounders. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI was estimated to show the strength of association. Finally, a P-value of <0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables significantly associated with antenatal care utilization. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test was performed.Ethical clearance was released from the ethical review committee of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Wollo University. An official letter was obtained from the Amhara Public Health Institute, Dessie Branch, which in turn wrote a letter for each health facility to get permission. The purpose of the study was explained to the study participants, and verbal consent was also obtained from each of them. Verbal informed consent was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Wollo University, and this study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The participants under the age of 18 years were approved by the ethics committee to provide informed consent on their own behalf. Confidentiality of the responses was ensured throughout the research process.In this study, from the total of 403 pregnant women planned, 389 fully responded, giving a response rate of 96.52%. Of these, 215 (55.3%) respondents were in the age group of 25-34 years. The mean (standard deviation) age was 26 (4.4) years.The majority of respondents (370, 95.1%) were married. In addition, 214 (55%) had completed secondary school and above and 67.4% of them were housewives in occupation ( Table 1) .The study revealed that 216 (55.5%) respondents missed or were late to start ANC services during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Of these, 23 (5.9%) were due to deploying of maternal workers to COVID-19. The majority of respondents (122, 56.48%) reported it was due to fear of COVID-19 infection, followed by interruption and diversion of maternal services to COVID-19 (72, 33.33%).Similarly, 66 (17%) of the respondents reported they did not attend due to the stay at home principle and 28 (7.2%) reported it was due to costly transportation during the lockdown period.From the total 389 pregnant women included in the study, 140 (29.3%) who attended the obstetric outpatient clinics fully utilized the antenatal care services.This result shows that most of the women (359, 92.3%) received iron supplementation for ≥3 months and 383 (98.5%) of them were supplemented with folic acid. Regarding ANC visit the highest proportion (149, 38.3%) of women had two visits only (Table 2) . Among factors considered in the study women's age, residence, education status, history of stillbirth, interruption, and diversion of maternity services to COVID-19 response, fear of COVD-19 infection, and transport inaccessibility were major predictors for antenatal care utilization. Multivariable analysis revealed that mothers aged ≥35 years were 12-times more likely to utilize ANC services than mothers aged ≤24 years (AOR=11.79, 95% CI=1.18-117.8). Mothers whose age was in the range of 25-34 years had increases of nearly 8-fold in ANC utilization as compared to mothers having age ≤24 years (AOR=7.55, 95% CI=3. 29-17.31) .The result of this study also revealed that urban resident mothers were 9-times more likely to utilize ANC services than mothers who were from rural areas (AOR=9.13, 95% CI=1. 28-65.31) .Similarly, mothers who had no formal education were 79% less likely to utilize ANC services than those mothers who had secondary and above education (AOR=0.21, 95% CI=0.05-0.96). Respondents who had no history of stillbirth before recent pregnancy were 99.3% less likely to utilize ANC service than those who had a history of stillbirth before the recent pregnancy (AOR=0.007, 95% CI=0.001-0.12).The result also revealed that interruption and diversion of maternal health-care services due to COVID-19 response reduces full service utilization by 32% (AOR=0.68, 95% CI=0.14-0.74). Transport accessibility increases the utilization of the ANC service by four unit folds as compared to those respondents who had no access to transportation (AOR=4.15, 95% CI=1.04-16.54). Similarly, fear of COVID-19 infection reduces full service utilization by 87% (AOR=0.13, 95% CI=0.06-0.31) ( Table 3 ).The result of this study revealed that 29.3% of pregnant women fully received the recommended antenatal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic.This finding was lower than in studies done in India (45%), 20 Nepal (87%), 21 Nigeria (81.5%), 22 and Kenya (52%). 23 The result was also lower than local studies done in Ethiopia: Eastern Hararge (38.2%), 24 Holeta town (66%), 9 Ethiopia (32.5%), 25 and Debre Tabor town (35.3%). 5 The observed difference might be due to sociocultural and awareness differences, variations in sociodemographic characteristics, and the difference in study period (previous studies were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic period, unlike the current study). Since in the pandemic period the antenatal care service utilization was found to be low this might be due to movement restrictions, fear of infection, and economic pressure, greater disruptions to health systems due to workforce and supply chain issues and the repurposing of health workers.Our study showed that the age of respondents was positively and significantly associated with antenatal care service utilization. This finding was supported by studies done in Debre tabor, 5 in hadya zone, southern Ethiopia, 26 and Nigeria. 11 This might be, as the age of the mother increases; they might have a better knowledge, understanding, and experience of pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications, which in turn increases the utilization of antenatal care services.The result of this study also showed that mothers who have secondary education and above were more likely to utilize ANC services than mothers who have no formal education. Previous studies done in developing countries had found that higher educational level was highly associated with better antenatal care service utilization. 5,11,-26-28 This might be explained as women having better educational status are capable of identifying danger signs and easily understand the bad consequence of not attending antenatal care services. This finding also revealed that urban residency was found to be significantly associated with the utilization of antenatal care. This finding was supported by studies done in Ethiopia using Mini DHS 2019. 10, 17 This might be because pregnant women living in urban areas may have better access to health facilities and better awareness about the importance of ANC utilization.A statistically significant association was also obtained between history of still birth and antenatal care service utilization. Mothers who had experienced stillbirth before were more likely to fully utilize ANC service than mothers who had not encountered it before. This finding was in line with another study done in Ethiopia. 6, 26 The possible explanation for this might be because those who faced still birth knew the risks associated with it; as a result they might fully utilize antenatal care in order to prevent it and to have a good pregnancy outcome.Fear of COVID-19 infection was also found to be significantly associated with an 87% reduction in full ANC service utilization. Consistent to this in Bnei Brak, a city in Israel, one of the significant issues faced in maternal care was fear. Many women were anxious about contracting the coronavirus and feared going to prenatal checks, with some pregnant women staying away from the services altogether. 29 This might be due to low awareness creation from the responsible body, and the preventive principles of COVID-19 might not be practiced properly. Fear of physical proximity may also limit or alter care provision. In addition, the fear of spreading the disease may lead health workers to deny mothers the service. Pregnant women have been reported to have experienced increased anxiety as a result of COVID-19. 30, 31 Similarly, a survey conducted in Italy among 100 pregnant women showed there was a fear of visiting hospitals for childbirth because they were scared of being infected themselves or feared vertical transmission. 32 This study also showed that lack of transport accessibility increases the risk of not utilizing ANC services fully. Similarly, in Nepal, cases have been reported where, due to a lack of transportation, women developed complications on the way to the hospital and died at the health facility before receiving proper care. 33 This might be because stay-at-home orders lead to greater lost income, reduced purchasing power, and the inability to pay for services doubling the cost of public, which in turn limit utilization of ANC services. This finding also revealed that interruption and diversion of maternal health-care service reduces full service utilization by 32%. Similarly, studies conducted during the pandemic in the Asia pacific region reported the service utilization would decrease to half. 34 Consistently, in the US, some facilities have converted maternity wards to COVID-19 units, in order to accommodate the increasing number of COVID-19 patients. 35 In India and Nepal the pandemic also has exposed shortfalls in the health system, with the majority of health facilities being ill equipped to deal with the pandemic. [35] [36] [37] The situation is harsher in developing countries due to the lack of proper infrastructure and resources. 37 This might be due to health system collapse or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic, workforce reduction, access reduction, and also some health facility restricted number of ANC visits due to fear of the pregnant women contracting coronavirus.The cross-sectional nature of this survey research was one of the main limitations of this study. Thus, unadjusted for temporal trends and no follow-up were also the limitations of the study. Furthermore, this study was not supplemented with the quantitative method of data collection.The findings of this study showed the pandemic reduced the utilization of antenatal care services among pregnant women in the study area. Thus, the age of the mother, residency, educational status, history of still birth, interruption, and diversion of maternity health-care service, fear of COVID-19 pandemic, and transport inaccessibility were significant factors which contributed to the low antenatal care service utilization of pregnant women.Thus, efforts to enhancing maternal health services should be recommended. Various IEC (Information, Education and Communication) materials will be produced to raise awareness regarding the protection of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also better to start phone-in services to help with transportation to pregnant women. In addition, virtual consultation with obstetricians will be provided via telemedicine services, to women seeking maternal health services.COVID-19 has caused disruption of health services on the global scale, including MHS (maternal health services).Due to this pandemic, women are facing more barriers to accessing maternal healthcare, including restrictions, transport challenges, anxiety, and fear over possibly being exposed to coronavirus. This study demonstrates addressing the identified factors would help to design appropriate strategies to improve MHS utilization during the pandemic. Effective preventive and clinical strategies are needed to control COVID-19 infection among pregnant women. Governments also need to make sure that women can access basic information to protect the health of themselves and their babies. Additionally, arrangements should be made for assuring proper means of transportation and availability of MHS (maternal health services) during lockdown.The International Journal of Women's Health is an international, peerreviewed open-access journal publishing original research, reports, editorials, reviews and commentaries on all aspects of women's healthcare including gynecology, obstetrics, and breast cancer.

The urgent need to offer guidance for policy and measurement using updated data to save Ivory Coast's economy motivated the present study. With increased research and funding, new pathological conditions have been characterized to help people to understand the disease. According to Ayinde et al. [1] and Mayo Clinic [2] , the symptoms of the disease are fever, dry cough and tiredness, difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain, pressure and loss of speech or movement, headache, pains, debility, sore throat, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, loss of taste or smell, a rash on the skin and discoloration of fingers or toes. Recent findings have shown that type 1 diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, liver disease, chronic lung diseases, brain and nervous system disorders, weakened immune system from bone marrow transplant, human immunodeficiency virus and some medications may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 illness [2] . The first outbreak of the novel disease was recorded in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China in late December 2019 and was precisely reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019 [3] . At short duration of 30 days, the infection rate was alarming in China and have spread to other countries of the world including Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Vietnam, Germany, United States and Singapore [1, 4, 5] . The WHO pronounced COVID-19 a disease of international concern on January 31, 2020 [6] and a pandemic on March 11, 2020 because of the alarming spread and severity in the world [7] . According to WHO global situation reports of September 19, 2020 (10:35 am CEST) there have been 30, 295, 744 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 947,933 deaths and more than 19.6 million patients have recovered. The COVID-19 has now been reported in at least 188 countries (with different degrees of spread, death and recovery), culminating in global calamity [8] .In Ivory Coast, the first COVID-19 confirmed case was reported on March 11, 2020 by the Ministry of Public Health and Hygiene of Ivory Coast when a forty-five-year-old Ivorian man who returned from Italy the week prior and presented himself to public health authorities after developing symptoms [9] . This made Ivory Coast the eighth country in sub-Saharan Africa and the twelfth country in Africa to have a confirmed case of COVID-19. This occurred after many suspected cases (including an Ivorian student who came back from China) were negative after tests were carried out between January and March 2020 [10] . According to Bone [9] , due to the confirmed case, health authorities immediately began to trace contacts the man had before testing positive. His wife tested positive for COVID-19 the next day, making the total number of cases, two. Few days later (March 14, 2020), authorities published three additional confirmed cases and they were all Ivorian citizens, and two had traveled abroad (to Italy and France) in recent weeks. The third case was a health worker who had not travelled out of Ivory Coast in recent times, raising fears that community transmission was going on in the country. This unexpected development alarmed citizens and forced many concerned groups into action. Result of this concern was the chronological pronouncement of lockdown policies by the Government of the country. This became necessary to ensure that COVID-19 does not overwhelm the country's health systems, economics, politics and stability.The lockdown policies strengthened surveillance in the country, controlled borders, restricted internal travels and movement, shutdown schools, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, cinemas and other places of entertainment, prohibited gatherings of more than 50 people and enforced use of hand sanitizers and wearing of face masks. The plot of Ivory Coast confirmed, recovered and death cases for the first 173 days is shown in Fig. 1 and Ivory Coast proportion of active, discharged and death cases for the first 173 days is shown in Fig. 2 .It was believed that social distance and sanitary measures would limit the spread of COVID-19 [9, 10] . Despite these restrictions, the virus has continued to infect people, spread and caused varying degrees of health and economic problems in the country. Following increased pressure from citizens and an understanding of the disease phenomenon, recently, some of the lockdown policies were relaxed.The COVID-19 is a novel disease that has not been entirely understood. There is a need to monitor/forecast important parameters of the pandemic. At the early stage of the pandemic, the unavailability of data made prognosis a difficult task [1] . In the light of data availability and urgency to identify efficient models to predict the epidemic and adopt measures that limit the spread, the present investigation sought to model the reported daily cumulative confirmed, discharged and death COVID-19 cases using twenty-five statistical model estimators to identify a highperformance/best model for utilization in forecast making.Ndolane [16] proposed a stochastic model to predict the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, Sha et al. [17] also proposed a model. They developed a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model with binomial distributions to study the transmission of the disease. Their simulation result shows that the total confirmed cases will reach the peak around the end of February 2020 though the reported confirmed cases violated it as the number of confirmed cases continued to increase after the end of February 2020 and spread to different countries including Ivory Coast. Abdon [18] used Italy's COVID-19 data as a guide to develop a new fractal-fractional differential operators taking into account the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from dead bodies to humans and the effect of lockdown. The model showed that if lock-down recommendations are observed, the threat of COVID-19 can be reduced to zero within a short period of time. The log-cubic model was proposed to forecast the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, Italy, South Korea and Turkey [19] .We modelled the reported cumulative number of confirmed, discharged and death cases using different regression models so as to select the best model to forecast for future cases. The models considered are Linear Regression Model, Logarithm Regression Model, Inverse Regression Model, Compound Regression Model, S-Curve Regression Model and Growth Regression Model. The simple, quadratic, cubic and quartic form of each of the models was also considered to give twentyfour model estimators.Linear regression Model: The simple form of the model is given as:The Quadratic Regression Model is given as:The Cubic Regression Model is given as:The Quartic Regression Model is given as: The Logarithm Quadratic Regression Model is given as:The Logarithm Cubic Regression Model is given as:The Logarithm Quartic Regression Model is given as:Inverse regression Model: The simple form of the model is given as:The Inverse Quadratic Regression Model is given as:The Inverse Cubic Regression Model is given as:The Inverse Quartic Regression Model is given as:Compound regression Model: The simple form of the model is given as:Taking the ln of both sides givesFollowing the same technique, the Quadratic, Cubic and Quartic forms are respectively given as:Inverse regression Model: The simple form of the model is given as:Taking the ln of both sides givesFollowing the same technique, the Quadratic, Cubic and Quartic forms are respectively given as:Growth regression Model: The simple form of the model is given as:Taking the ln of both sides gives usFollowing the same technique, the Quadratic, Cubic and Quartic forms are respectively given as: where y t is the confirmed, discharged and death COVID-19 cases x t is the time β 0 , β 1 , β 2 , β 3 and β 4 are the regression coefficients of the models.The regression coefficients were estimated using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method which minimizes the residual sum of squares. The efficiency of each of the models depends on the estimate of the regression coefficients. The OLS method depends on the normality and autocorrelation assumptions. The errors of the model are to follow a normal distribution and must be independent of each other. In a case when these assumptions are violated, OLS will not provide efficient estimates of the regression coefficients and most of the regression coefficients will be insignificant. This has made many researchers to develop other models such as Cochrane Orcutt [11] , Least Absolute Deviation [12] , etc. to solve the problem of OLS. The Runs test and Durbin Watson test developed by Durbin [13] were employed to test for the autocorrelation assumption while the Shapiro Wilk test developed by Shapiro and Wilk [14] was used to test for the normality assumption.The ARIMA model developed by Box and Jenkins [15] was also considered (the 25th model) and compared with the other linear models already stated to select the best model to forecast for future COVID-19 cases. The ARIMA model is applied when the data show evidence of non-stationarity, where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the ""integrated"" part of the model) can be applied one or more times to eliminate the non-stationarity. The AR part of ARIMA indicates that the evolving variable of interest is regressed on its own lagged (i.e., prior) values. The MA part indicates that the regression error is actually a linear combination of error terms whose values occurred contemporaneously and at various times in the past. The I (for ""integrated"") indicates that the data values have been replaced with the difference between their values and the previous values (and this differencing process may have been performed more than once). The purpose of each of these features is to make the model fit the data as well as possible. The ARIMA models are generally denoted ARIMA (p, d, q) where parameters p, d, and q are non-negative integers, p is the order (number of time lags) of the autoregressive model, d is the degree of differencing (the number of times the data have had past values subtracted), and q is the order of the moving-average model. Given a time series data y t , the Auto Regressive (AR) model is one where y t depends only on its own lags. That is, y t is a function of the ""lags of y t "". The AR model is given below:In a Moving Average (MA) model, the time series data y t , depends only on the lagged forecast errors. The MA model is given below:where the error terms are the errors of the AR models of the respective lags. The errors ε t and ε t− 1 are the errors from the following equations:The ARIMA model is the combination of the AR and MA model (Eqs. (28) and (29) respectively) that have been differenced to make it stationary. The ARIMA model is given as:Predicted y t = Constant + linear combination lags of y (up to p lags) + linear combination of lagged forecast errors (up to q lags)Steps in choosing an ARIMA modelFinding the order of differencing (d) in the ARIMA (p, d, q) modelThe purpose of differencing is to make the time series stationary. The right order of differencing is the minimum differencing required to get a time series to be stationary. We test for stationarity using the graphical method and the Augmented Dickey Fuller test.Finding the order of the AR term (p) in the ARIMA (p, d, q) model The next step is to identify if there is an AR term and the order it follows. We find out the order ""p"" of the AR model by inspecting the Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plot.The PACF is the correlation between the series and its lag, after excluding the contributions from the intermediate lags. It conveys the pure correlation between a lag and the series making it possible to know if the lag is needed in the AR term or not.The order of the AR term is equal to the number of lags that crosses the significance limit in the PACF plot.Finding the order of the MA term (q) in the ARIMA (p, d, q) model The next step is to identify the number of MA terms using the ACF plot just as we looked at the PACF plot. Try the chosen model and use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to search for a better model. Check the residuals for the chosen model by plotting the ACF of the residuals, and doing a test of the residuals if they are white noise. Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate the forecasts.The R-squared and RMSE were used to select the best among the various models considered in forecasting future confirmed, recovered and death COVID-19 cases.The quartic form was preferred for all the regression models based on their R-squared and RMSE except for the logarithm and compound models that preferred the simple form as shown in Table 1 .The linear model was the best among the different regression models as it has the lowest RMSE and the highest R-squared. The Runs and Shapiro-Wilk tests showed that the errors of all the models failed to satisfy the autocorrelation and normality assumptions. The coefficients of the preferred model are given in Table 2 . The problem of nonconformity to the OLS assumptions led us to use the Cochrane Orcutt, Least Absolute Deviation and ARIMA to address the problem to get better estimates as shown in Table 2 .The Cochrane Orcutt and Least Absolute Deviation models did not solve the assumption problem and still performed less than the preferred OLS model. The ARIMA model with order (8,2,10) was selected as the best model among all the models considered. It explains 99.98% of the variation in the confirmed COVID-19 cases. The model was used to forecast for July and August 2020 (testing set) and compared with the true values. The results were similar to the true values of the confirmed COVID-19 cases as reported in appendix A with a 90% R-squared value (about 90% of the variation in the forecasted confirmed COVID-19 cases is explained by the model). The ARIMA (8,2,10) model was further used to forecast for October 2020 to February 2021. It is expected that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the end of October 2020 to February 2021 will be 41,521, 49,378, 57,493, 65,606 and 72,936 respectively as shown in Fig. 3 . The expected number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is alarming. There is a need for serious tactical and robust approach to control the spread of COVID-19 in the country.The quartic form was also preferred for all the regression models in the discharged COVID-19 cases based on their highest R-squared and least RMSE except for the logarithm and compound models that preferred the simple form as shown in Table 3 .The Linear regression model was the most preferred model though the Growth and Compound models performed well. The Runs test and the Shapiro-Wilk tests showed that all the models failed to satisfy both the normality and autocorrelation assumptions except for the linear model that the errors followed a normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk Pvalue > 0.05). The failure of the autocorrelation assumption in the most preferred model made us to consider the Cochrane Orcutt, Least Absolute Deviation and ARIMA models to address the problem. The estimate of the regression coefficients for all the models are shown in Table 4 .The Cochrane Orcutt and Least Absolute Deviation models did not solve the assumption problem and still performed less than the preferred OLS model. The ARIMA model with order (2,2,3) was selected as the best model among all the models being considered. It explains 99.92% of Note: (i) + implies that other forms of the model were not considered because of multicollinearity.(ii) Bold implies the most preferred model. Fig. 4 . The expected number of discharged COVID-19 cases is encouraging. If the existing measures for taking care of COVID-19 patients are maintained and improved upon, the spread of COVID-19 in the country will be controlled.After using the OLS method on the six regression models, the quartic and simple form were preferred for all the regression models in the death COVID-19 cases based on their highest R-squared and least RMSE. Three of the models -Linear, Inverse and S-Curvepreferred the quartic form while the other three models preferred the simple form as shown in Table 5 . The Linear regression model was the most preferred model though the Growth and Compound models performed well. The Runs test and the Shapiro-Wilk tests showed that all the models failed to satisfy both the normality and autocorrelation assumptions except for the linear model that satisfied the normality assumption (Shapiro-Wilk P-value > 0.05). The most preferred model had autocorrelated errors like the other models and this made us to consider the Cochrane Orcutt, Least Absolute Deviation and ARIMA models to address the problem. The estimate of the regression coefficients for all the models are shown in Table 6 .The Cochrane Orcutt and Least Absolute Deviation models solved the assumption problem but some of their regression coefficients were not significant (P-value > 0.05). The ARIMA model with order (4,2,1) was selected as the best model among all the models being considered. It explains 99.73% of the variation in the death COVID-19 cases. The model was used to forecast for July and August 2020 (testing set) and compared with the true values. The results were similar to the true values of the death COVID-19 cases as reported in appendix C with a 96% R-squared value (about 96% of the variation in the forecasted death COVID-19 cases is explained by the model. The ARIMA (4,2,1) model was further used to forecast for October 2020 to February 2021. It is expected that the number of death COVID-19 cases at the end of October 2020 to February 2021 will be 238, 280, 323, 366 and 405 respectively as shown in Fig. 5 . The expected number of death COVID-19 cases is alarming and requires effective measures and planning to avert this incidence.The present study identified a high-performance/best model (ARIMA) and was used to forecast the number of confirmed, discharged and death COVID-19 cases in Ivory Coast for October 2020 to February 2021. The expected numbers of confirmed and deaths COVID-19 cases are alarming. There is need to strictly adhere to the preventive measures already pronounced and as may be updated from time to time. Good planning, tactical and robust approaches with honest interventions are required to control the spread of COVID-19 in the country. The application of useful suggestions from this study (after early warning and risk assessment) will ensure that COVID-19 does not overwhelm the Ivory Coast's health, economic, social and political systems.

[11] [12] [13] Practicing preventive measures such as handwashing with soap and water, wearing of face mask, social distancing, covering of the mouth and nose when coughing, and avoiding touching of the face can prevent transmission of COVID-19 infection. 14 In Ghana, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 12, 2020. 15 As of October 2, 2020, Ghana reported a total of 46,694 cases, with 301 deaths positioning it as the country with the seventh highest number of confirmed cases in Africa and 63rd globally. 4 In response to the global pandemic, the government of Ghana adopted several control strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.Key among these strategies included testing, tracing, and treatment (""3 Ts"") approach; lockdowns in some parts of the country; and ensuring that all Ghanaians practice COVID-19 preventive measures. 16, 17 Despite these measures taken by the government of Ghana to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO observed that Ghana is one of the countries with a substantial increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. 18 As part of measures to control the pandemic in Ghanaian schools, the government of Ghana in June 2020 introduced a phased reopening of schools, commencing with final year students in tertiary institutions, and junior and senior high schools to enable them prepare for their final examination, while ensuring that they observe COVID-19 safety protocols. 19 However, some students tested positive to COVID-19 after returning to school, 20 which raises concern whether schools have implemented COVID-19 safety protocols. Despite the emphasis on students to practice COVID-19 preventive measures while in school, we do not know the factors associated with practicing COVID-19 preventive measures among students in Ghana. Our primary aim was to assess factors associated with the practice of COVID-19 preventive measures among senior high school students in Ghana.Study design, data collection, and study population. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Bawku Municipality in the Upper East Region of Ghana. The Upper East Region is one of 16 regions of Ghana. Data were collected from final year students from four senior high schools in the Bawku Municipality. The municipality, schools, and students were conveniently sampled for the study. The inclusion criteria were students in any of the four selected schools who were aged 18 years and older. Data were collected by administering structured questionnaires to students in selected schools who met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected via selfadministered questionnaires on August 3-7, 2020. The minimum sample size required for the study was estimated based on our assumption that 50% of students observed COVID-19 preventive measures. Using a 5% margin of error with a 95% CI, a minimum sample size of 384 was required. We however approached 631 students, but seven students were ineligible because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 624 students participated and completed the questionnaires. The questionnaire consisted of questions on sociodemographics, knowledge about COVID-19 common symptoms, transmission, and preventive measures against COVID-19.Outcomes. Our primary outcomes of interest included three key COVID-19 preventive measures. The following primary outcomes were measured: wearing of face mask, handwashing with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and social distancing. Wearing of face mask was dichotomized as ""1"" for a student who always or often wears a face mask irrespective of the type of face mask and ""0"" for those who reported wearing the face mask sometimes or not at all. Handwashing with soap and water or hand sanitizing was also dichotomized as ""1"" for a student who always or often washes his/her hands with soap and water or sanitizes the hands with alcohol-based hand sanitizer 14 and ""0"" for students who either do not wash/sanitize their hands or sometimes handwash/sanitize. Social distancing was defined as maintaining at least one meter distance between a student and others. 14 It was dichotomized as ""1"" for students who practiced it always or often and ""0"" for students who did not practice it or practiced it sometimes.Predictor variables. We explored variables of interest that included knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, knowledge of COVID-19 mode of transmission, knowledge on COVID-19 preventive measures, and whether an educational/training program was a source of information about COVID-19.With regard to knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, we compared students who knew one or more symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, dry cough, body aches, tiredness, diarrhea, sore throat, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, and rash on fingers or toes) with students who did not know any of the symptoms.On mode of transmission of COVID-19, we compared students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person with students who reported that this was not a transmission route. A comparison was also made on students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted by touching droplets on surface or objects from an infected person with students who reported that this was not a transmission route. We also compared students who reported that an infected asymptomatic person can transmit the virus with students who reported otherwise. Students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted among adolescents and young adults were also compared with students who reported that transmission was not possible.On knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures, we compared students who reported that avoiding crowdedness in public places can prevent infection with COVID-19 with students who reported that it was not a preventive measure. Students who reported that covering the nose and mouth while coughing can prevent COVID-19 were also compared with students who reported that it was not a preventive measure. We also compared students who reported that avoiding the touching of the eyes, nose, and mouth can prevent infection with COVID-19 with students who reported otherwise. Students who reported that COVID-19 was not deadly and there was no need for preventive measures were compared with students who reported that the virus was deadly.Students who reported they had heard about COVID-19 via an educational or training program were compared with students who did not hear about it through an educational/ training program.Covariates. Covariates included age, gender (male and female), father's level of education (no education, primary education, and secondary or higher education), mother's level of education (no education, primary education, and secondary or higher education), has health insurance (yes or no), place of residence when school is not in session (rural and urban), and program of study (science, arts, business, technical, and home economics/catering/agricultural science). The program of study refers to the course the student is majoring in the school.Data analysis. Data analysis was conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics was used to report the characteristics of the study population. We used three multivariable logistic regression models to assess the relationship between our predictor variables of interest and each of our primary outcomes while controlling simultaneously for all our covariates. We obtained adjusted odds ratio (aOR) estimates for the predictor variables in each of the models. Our study protocol was approved by the Christian Health Association of Ghana Institutional Review Board. We also obtained informed consent from students before data collection as well as observing COVID-19 safety protocols.Study sample. The study population consisted of 624 students aged 18 years and older. The mean age of the study population was 19.9 years, with a SD of 1.48. A majority of the students were males (54.2%). Many of the students had a health insurance (78.5%), and most of them were in the technical program (38.0%), compared with other programs (Table 1 ).An estimated 31.5% (95% CI: 27.8, 35.1) of the students wore a face mask often or always; 49.5% (95% CI: 45.6, 53.5) of the students practiced handwashing or sanitized their hands with alcohol-based sanitizers often/always. The prevalence of social distancing among students was 46.2% (95% CI: 42.3, 50.2; Figure 1 ).The multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person had three times the odds of wearing a face mask compared with students who reported that it was not transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person (aOR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.1, 7.9). The odds of wearing a face mask among students who reported that asymptomatic persons with COVID-19 could transmit the virus was twice the odds of wearing a face mask among students who reported that asymptomatic persons cannot transmit the virus (aOR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2, 3.6). The odds of wearing a face mask among students who reported that COVID-19 was not deadly had a 40% lower odds of wearing a face mask than those who reported that COVID-19 was deadly (aOR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0) ( Table 2 ). The odds of handwashing or hand sanitizing among students in the technical program had a 60% lower odds of practicing handwashing or hand sanitizing than students in the science program (aOR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8). Students who reported that COVID-19 was not deadly had a 40% lower odds of practicing handwashing or hand sanitizing than those who reported that the virus was deadly (aOR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0; Table 2 ).Students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person had 2.1 times the odds of practicing social distancing, compared with students who reported that the virus was not transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person (aOR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.0, 4.5) ( Table 2) .Our analysis found that at least 50% of the students either did not wear a face mask, practice handwashing/hand sanitizing, or practice social distancing often/always. Students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person and students who reported that asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus were positively associated with wearing a face mask. However, students who reported that COVID-19 was not deadly were less likely to wear a face mask than those who reported that the virus was deadly. Similarly, students who reported that COVID-19 was not deadly had a lower odds of practicing handwashing or hand sanitizing. It was also revealed that students in the technical program were also less likely to practice handwashing or hand sanitizing than those in the science program. The study also established that students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth were positively associated with the practice of social distancing.The low prevalence of practice of COVID-19 preventive measures in our study might be due to several possible reasons. Many students might not be well informed about the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Some students might also not be aware of the mode of transmission and the importance of practicing COVID-19 preventive measures. School authorities might also not be enforcing the practice of COVID-19 safety protocols. Schools might also not have adequate hand sanitizers for students or handwashing stations at vantage points on campus. The low prevalence of practice of COVID-19 preventive measures in our study is worrying as this can lead to local outbreaks in schools if a student gets infected. We found that students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person were more likely to wear a face mask than those who reported otherwise. This finding is not surprising as students with knowledge that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person might also be aware of the protective effects offered by face mask against droplets, 21 compared with students who did not know that transmission via droplets was possible. Our findings on the positive association between students who reported that asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus and wearing a face mask might be because students are aware of the recent evidence suggesting that COVID-19 can be transmitted from aOR = adjusted odds ratio. * = significant at P-value < 0.05; ** = significant at P-value < 0.05, but CI includes the null value which is because of the rounding effect; 1 = reference category.FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 PREVENTIVE MEASURES an asymptomatic person. 22 We did also observe that students who reported that COVID-19 was not deadly were less likely to wear a face mask than those who reported that the virus was deadly. This finding reflects the lack of knowledge among some students about mortality associated with COVID-19.Although there is the need to educate students on the importance of wearing a face mask, students need to know that COVID-19 can be fatal.Our study found that students in the technical program were less likely to practice handwashing or hand sanitizing than those in the science program. This finding in our study might be because students in the science program have a better understanding on the importance of handwashing/hand sanitizing in disease prevention than their peers in the technical program. We did also find that students who reported that COVID-19 was not deadly had a lower odds of practicing handwashing or hand sanitizing than those who reported that the virus was deadly. This emphasizes the need for students to understand that COVID-19 can be fatal and the important role handwashing/hand sanitizing plays in COVID-19 prevention. We also found that students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person were more likely to practice social distancing than those who reported that the virus cannot be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person. Students who reported that COVID-19 transmission via droplets was possible practiced social distancing as they might be aware that social distancing reduces the virus transmission by droplets. 23, 24 Our study had some limitations. The cross-sectional design of our study does not allow for causal interpretation of our findings. Another limitation is that our primary outcomes were self-reported and were subject to recall bias. However, we expect recall bias to be similar between exposed and unexposed predictor variables. Our primary outcome, social distancing, was also not objectively measured, and was therefore subject to measurement error. Another limitation of our study was the inability to account for school differences. One other limitation is that the true population of students who practiced any of the COVID-19 preventive measures is likely overestimated in our study as students are obliged to observe COVID-19 safety protocols according to the directive by the government of Ghana. Finally, our study took place in selected schools in one of the 16 regions in Ghana; therefore, our findings might not be generalizable to the entire country. Nonetheless, our findings fill an important gap in the literature and provide relevant information on factors associated with the practice of COVID-19 preventive measures among students in Ghana.This is the first study in Ghana to explore factors associated with practice of COVID-19 preventive measures among senior high schools. Our findings provide guidance to schools on factors that might contribute to ensuring that students of senior high schools in Ghana practice COVID-19 preventive measures. It may also be relevant for COVID-19 health education to be introduced in senior high schools. Our findings may also be relevant to those of senior high schools in lowand middle-income countries contemplating on reopening schools within this pandemic.","Ghana","abstract","2020-12-07",12

Moreover, radiological features of the chest are very important findings that can suggest COVID-19 pneumonia 9 with a high degree of diagnostic accuracy. 10 Interestingly, ground-glass opacities were reported in 87% and 97% of common and severe type patients, respectively. Hence, a chest computed tomography has essential role in diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 infection. 11 A COVID-19 infection has many complications that are considered as independent risk factors for mortality. 12, 13 Other factors can increase the rate of morbidity and mortality, such as a weak healthcare system and non-adherence to restrictive preventive means, including distancing or wearing protective masks. 4 All the factors mentioned above may affect the mortality rate at the national and international levels, and the rates obtained for the United States of America at (6%) 14 and (65.4%), 15 and for Italy at 0.007% and 0.005%, vary considerably. 16 There is a scarcity of published data on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Sudan. 4 To the best of the author's knowledge, there are no published data on the manifestations, mortality rate, and risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in Eastern Sudan. The objective of the present study is to describe the patients' epidemiology and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality for this disease in a hospital in Eastern Sudan.Gadarif State is situated at a mean altitude of 496-m above sea level, has a population of 1,727,401 residents, covers an area of 75,000 km 2 , and lies between latitudes 14 and 16 North and longitudes 33 and 36 East. It is 400 km from the capital of Sudan on the Ethiopian border. Gadarif Hospital is a 170-bed tertiary care facility that serves as a referral center in Gadarif State.A retrospective study was conducted at Gadarif Hospital in Eastern Sudan. Medical files of the patients admitted during the period between April and July 2020 were reviewed. All the files of the adult patients (aged 18 or above), of both sexes, who had a confirmed COVID-19-positive status via laboratory testing using PCR and who were admitted during this period were reviewed. Patients who had negative or equivocal PCR test results or who were suspected cases were excluded from the study. Patients were managed according to the COVID-19 case-management protocols released by the Federal Ministry of Health of the Republic of Sudan during the epidemic. The confirmed cases were classified according to severity, as follows: • Respiratory rate equal to or more than 30 breaths per minute. • Severe respiratory distress. • SPO 2 of less than 90% in room air. • Confusion or drowsiness. • Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm/Hg or diastolic blood pressure of less than 60 mm/Hg.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was classified as new or worsening respiratory symptoms within 1 week of the known clinical insult.• Chest imaging was carried out when the origin of the edema was not fully explained by cardiac failure and the oxygen was less than 90% in room air.Management as early supportive therapy and monitoring:• Supplementary oxygen therapy was given immediately to patients with severe acute respiratory insult (SARI) and respiratory distress, hypoxia, or shock. • Conservative fluid management was in place for patients with SARI when there was no evidence of shock. • An empirical antimicrobial was given to treat all likely pathogens causing SARI.submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2020:13• Systemic corticosteroids were given for the treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS outside of clinical trials unless they were indicated for another reason. • Patients with SARI were monitored for signs of clinical deterioration, and supportive care and intervention were immediately given.Management of hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS:• Recognizing severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when a patient with respiratory distress was failing with standard oxygen therapy. • Endotracheal intubation should be performed by a trained and experienced provider using airborne precautions. • Implementing mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4-8 mL per kg of predicted body weight) and a lower inspiratory pressure of less than 30cmH 2 O. For patients with severe ARDS, prone ventilation for more than 12 h per day is recommended. • Computerized tomography chest scans of COVID- 19 patients reveal areas of consolidation and groundglass opacity with bilateral peripheral involvement in multiple lobes progressing to ""crazy-paving"" patterns and consolidation.In the absence of a vaccine and an effective antiviral chemotherapy, we adopted a local protocol for management in patients based on World Health Organization and ministry of health recommendation. Inpatients were isolated, paracetamol was given to control fever and oxygen supply or mechanical ventilation according the status of the patient. Chloroquine, its derivative hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients to combat the pandemic. Later dexamethasone was added to the protocol to improve the outcome.The data extracted included patients' demographics and initial clinical presentation, symptoms, signs, and the laboratory and radiographic findings.The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software, version 22.0. Normality was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Frequency tables and percentages were generated for all the major variables of interest. Categorical variables were presented as percentages in tables, while comparisons between such variables were done using the Chi-square test. The associations between the variables and mortality were estimated through binary logistic regressions. Covariates (variables) with a P value of less than 0.2 from the binary logistic regression were selected for the construction of multivariate models by considering crude associations between mortality and the covariates. A backward elimination (likelihood ratio, LR) was then performed to adjust the model for covariates. The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The study received ethical approval from the Research Board at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Gadarif, Sudan. The reference number is 2020 ref13. As the data were collected retrospectively, patient consent was not required by the Research Board at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Gadarif, Sudan. Patient data were reserved confidential and used only for research purposes. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Eighty-eight patients were admitted with COVID 19. The median (interquartile) age was 62 (55.00-70.00) years and 72 (81.8%) of them were males.Most of the patients (75%) had a one-week duration of their symptoms. A fever (87.5%), cough (80.68%), and shortness of breath (77.27%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Less frequent symptoms were a sore throat (19.31%), headache (26.14%), chest pain (12.5%), and 3.41% had insomnia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (Table 1) .Following clinical assessments, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found to be normal in most patients, at 92.05% and 89.77%, respectively. An oxygen saturation of less than 90% was seen in 71.59% of patients. Moreover, a higher number of patients with diabetes mellitus died compared to those who did not have diabetes. There was no difference in the rate of hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic kidney disease between the patients who died and those who did not die ( There was no significant difference in the Body Mass Index, tobacco use, marital status, education level, employment, residency, or income between the patients who died and those who survived.The white blood count, blood urea level, D-dimer level, and positive chest radiological findings were significantly higher in patients who died compared with those who did not (Table 3). A D-dimer level on admission that was greater than 2.0µg/mL was detected in 8/33 (24.2%) vs 16/55 (29.1%) patients (P = 0.621). A logistic regression showed that being older (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI = [1.01, 1.10]) and having a lower PO 2 level (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.16]) were associated with mortality (Table 4 ).In this study, a fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, and sore throat were the most common symptoms of a COVID-19 infection. This is consistent with previous studies in different populations, 17,18, These symptoms might reflect the host immune response to viral infection rather than damage to the airway. 19 In the current study, 81.8% of the patients were males. Similar findings have been reported in previous studies. 5, 20 In contrast, some other studies have shown female predominance. 21, 22 The low susceptibility of females to COVID-19 infection has been extrapolated to the differences in innate immunity, steroid hormones, and factors related to sex chromosomes. 23 Moreover, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which is regulated by androgen, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene on the X-chromosome, result in higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing, and they might both play a role in favoring the outcome of COVID-19 infection among females. 24 Likewise, several other genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, including a high number of immune-related genes that regulate the innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. 24 This study documented a general mortality rate of 37.5%, which is higher than the general case fatality rate (6.23%) that was recently reported for Sudan. 4 However, higher mortality rates were also found in North Darfur (31.7%) and Central Darfur (60%) in Sudan. 4 This extreme variation in mortality in Sudan might be related to the lack of hospitals, under-reporting the actual number of cases due to a lack of testing facilities, and could also be attributed to the partial success of the implemented preventive measures by the government. 4 On the other hand, the mortality rate in our study was markedly higher than that reported in different studies across the globe: Italy (0.007%, 0.005%), 15 India (2 to 3%), 25 the United States of America (6%), 13 and France (22.8%). 26 Many explanations have been proposed for the considerable variation in the mortality rate in different parts of the world.One study pointed to a link between the mortality rate and the economic status of countries. High-income countries and the Sub-Saharan region had the highest and the lowest number of COVID-19 deaths, respectively. 27 Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the Oceania region had the least number of cases per million population when compared to high-income countries (63.86 vs 3050.60). 27 The lowest mortality rates were in southern Italy, mainly in Molise (0.007%) and Basilicata (0.005%), and this was explained by these forested areas having immune-protection attributes due to the emission of immuno-modulating bioactive volatile organic compounds and the provision of dietary sources of bioactive compounds. 15 This can also be explained by possible host genetic determinants for COVID-19 infection, which is reflected in the variation in susceptibility, transmission of the disease, and its severity globally. 28 Another factor is related to the different subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 viral strains that might affect the susceptibility, transmission, and the severity of morbidity and mortality. 29, 30 It is worth mentioning that the exacerbation of the multiple disease burden has put further strain on national healthcare systems, especially in developing countries. 4, 31 In the current study, being older (AOR = 1.05) and having a lower PO 2 level (AOR = 1.11) were associated with COVID-19 mortality. Many studies have reported age as a significant risk factor for mortality. There are agerelated changes in this geriatric population, such as changes in lung anatomy and muscle atrophy, which negatively affect their physiological functions, reduce their lung reserves, reduce the airway's ability to clear viruses, and impair the defense barrier function. 32 One previous study reported no significant differences in age in inhospital mortality. 33 Low oxygen saturation at presentation was significantly associated with high mortality. This finding aligns with a similar finding in some clinical studies, where it is considered an independent risk factor for mortality. 11, 34 Severe hypoxemia was associated with considerably higher levels of inflammatory markers, such as higher white blood counts and c reactive protein levels. In addition to acute inflammation of the respiratory system, this can occur in response to a respiratory virus or a secondary bacterial infection. 35 The latter syndrome is due to systemic endothelial injury, which presents clinically as pleural effusions, edema, intra-abdominal hypertension, intravascular fluid depletion, third-space fluid loss, and hypotension. 36 Many efforts are needed in Sudan (besides implementing restrictive preventive measurements) until a vaccine against COVID-19 is available to reduce the morbidities, mortalities, and financial burden.The general mortality rate was 37.5%, and the risk factors that predict increased mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 positive cases included old age and lower PO 2 levels.","Sudan","first author","2020-12-08",12

As Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious, health-care workers suffer from psychological distress because of increased risk of acquiring and potentially transmitting COVID-19 to patients, coworkers, and family members. 2, 3 Psychological distress refers to the presence of a nonspecific negative mental health state composed of multidimensional constructs, such as depression and anxiety. 4, 5 In general term, it is also considered as the result of factors (psychogenic pain, internal conflicts, and external stress) that impair the proper functioning of the individual's daily life but Symptoms of anxiety and depression in persons do not fit the established criteria of psychological distress. 6 However, the condition is a warning flag of a clinical major depressive event for those vulnerable to such events. 7, 8 Psychological distress is a maladaptive response to a stressful situation. It occurs when external events or stressors place demands upon us that we are unable to cope with; As a result, we start to show symptoms of psychological distress. 9 In previous disease outbreaks, A/H1N1 influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many people including health-care workers (HCWs) presented with high levels of psychological distress (18-57%), because of concerns regarding their health and families' health, worries about functional ability and fears of stigmatization. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Current research during the pandemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19), psychological distress among health-care workers is common in developed countries and is a major public health challenge. 2, 15, 16 In Chinese healthcare workers found that >70% reported distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, 17 in New York health-care workers reported 57% acute stress, 48% depressive, and 33% anxiety symptoms, 2 and In Singapore, 14.5% of participants screened positive for anxiety, 8.9% for depression, 6.6% for stress, and 7.7% for clinical concern of PTSD. 15 Furthermore, in a systematic review and meta-analysis done in April 2020, the Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic were 22.8%, 23.2%, and 38.9% for depression, anxiety, and insomnia, respectively. 18 Since March 13, 2020, The Federal Ministry of Health has confirmed a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, currently, the number of infected reach one hundred thousand. And still, now quantitative data about the COVID-19-related psychological distress, coping and associated factors among Ethiopian health-care workers are lacking. This study reports the prevalence of COVID-19-related psychological distress that health-care workers are experiencing, their current coping behaviors, and factors associated with psychological distress among health-care professionals in Dessie referral hospital, Ethiopia.The internet-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 20-July13, 2020 at Dessie town, south Wollo zone, Western Amhara region, Ethiopia. Dessie is a multiethnic city in Northeastern Ethiopia located 401Km away from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. There are two public and three private hospitals, seven public health centers, and more than 24 private clinics. All health professionals working in Governmental Health Institutions of Dessie town were considered as the study populations.Government employee health professionals who were on duty during the pandemic of COVID-19 and have access to the internet to use Facebook, email, and telegram were included.Lack of access to the internet and the inability to complete the online survey were excluded.The sample size was calculated using a single population proportion formula with an assumption of 95% confidence level, marginal of error 5%, and 50% proportion.In which n= [(1.96)2 (0.5) (1-0.5)]/(0.05)2 =385 adding 10% non-response rate; n=423.The questionnaire was created through Google Form and the survey link was shared by e-mail, Telegram, and Facebook, to assess psychological distress during COVID − 19 pandemic. In the online questionnaire, participants were asked to give informed consent for participation by ticking the ""Yes, I Agree"" box, and not the ""No thanks,"" box on the online form. The questionnaire was available online for three weeks, from June 20 to July 13, 2020, still the desired sample size were mate. During the submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2020:13 study period, we followed the completion of questionnaires, observing the date and time of the study end.The questionnaire prepared including questions concerning socio-demographic data; age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, religion, number of families, working department, profession/specialty, presence of chronic disease, history of substance use, working hours, monthly income, social support, resilience level, COVID-19 related knowledge and experience, and finally k-10 for assessment of distress were included in Google form.Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) is a measure of psychological distress. The numbers attached to the participants 10 responses are added up to get the total score on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Scores will range from 10 to 50. The final K10 score was categorized into four levels: People who score under 20 are likely to be well, score 20-24 are likely to have a mild mental disorder, and score 25-29 are likely to have a moderate mental disorder, score 30 and over are likely to have a severe mental disorder. 19 It is validated in Ethiopia among postnatal mothers with sensitivity, specificity, and misclassification rates of 84.2%, 77.8%, and 21.0% at a cut-off point of 6/7, respectively. 18 Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS): Vissoci S. and et al 20 ""The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) captures tendencies to cope with stress adaptively. The scale focuses on the tendency to effectively use coping strategies inflexible, committed ways to actively solve problems despite stressful circumstances"". Five-point scale response, ranging from 1=does not describe me at all to 5=describes me very well and Total sum scores range from 4 to 20. Scores of 4-13 indicate low resilient coping, 14-16 indicate medium resilient coping and 17-20 indicate high resilient coping. 20 Social support was also assessed by the Oslo-3 social support scale, the total SSRS score ranges from 1 to 14 points, with higher scores indicating a higher level of social support. The SSRS has shown good reliability and validity, with Cronbach's α ranging between 0.83 and 0.86. 21The collected data were cleaned, coded, and entered into SPSS version 20. Errors related to inconsistency were verified using cross-tabulation and frequency data. To identify predictors of psychological distress, we classified respondents into those with have psychological distress (K10 score ≥ 21) and those with no/low psychological distress (K10 score ≤ 20). 19 To identify factors influencing psychological distress among respondents, we performed binary logistic regression and multiple logistic regressions. The dependent variables were the dichotomous classification of no/low or have psychological distress. The model was constructed with the following covariates: sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 related knowledge and experience, social support, and history of ever and current substance use.A total of 423 participants were involved in the study with a response rate of 100%. The mean age of respondents was 34.5 years (SD = ±8.45 years). More than half 232 (56.2%) of the respondents were females. A majority, 345 (83.5%) and 262 (63.4%) were Amhara by ethnicity and married in marital status, respectively. The majority of respondents were BSC holders 292 (70.7%) and the Brief resilient coping score shows that 301 (72.9%) were low resilient, 98 (23.7%) moderate and 14 (3.4%) high resilient level of coping (Table 1) . And in terms of social support, 132 (32%), of the participants have low social support levels, 152 (36.8%) and 129 (31.2%) have moderate and high social support levels, respectively. Figure 1 shows the percentage of participants who rated more than 20 in Kessler-10 as having psychological distress were 42% (95% CI, 37%-46.5%). 85.5% of participants reported that concerns about transmitting COVID-19 to family and loved ones were the highly psychological distressing reason they faced.The majority of participants rated the Emotional strain/ physical exhaustion, shortages of personal protective equipment, concerns about infecting family members, shortages of ventilators and other crucial medical equipment, fear of limited access to childcare during increased work hours, and Fear of being able to provide competent medical care if deployed to a new area are as highly distressing reasons they faced (Figure 2 ). Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Figure 3 all respondents have excellent knowledge about COVID-19 regarding; ways of transmission covid-19, as covid-19 is airborne, they know that covid-19 is worldwide/pandemic, and they have information that the current number of infected and death was increasing in the world as well in Ethiopia.The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that being married (AOR = 2.062, 95% CI: (Table 2 ).The current cross-sectional study of levels of psychological distress in health-care workers on duty during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Dessie town is, to our knowledge, the first study in Ethiopia. Almost 42% (95% CI, 37%-46.5%) of health-care workers screened positive for psychological distress; of these 18%, 11%, and 13% were 22 The prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare professionals in this study in line with a study done in china to assess the psychological health status of frontline health-care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). 23 But the prevalence of psychological distress among health-care professionals in this study was lower than the study was done in Spain, which were 80.6% among frontline health-care workers 24 and China among health-care workers exposed to COVID-19 reported as 70%. 17 The difference might be due to the screening tool used (general health questionnaire), high mortality report in Spain than Ethiopia, and study population difference.And also the prevalence of psychological distress among health-care professionals in this study was higher than the study done in china only on frontline Nurse Professional which shows 25% of nurses had psychological distress according to GHQ they used which might be responsible for the difference in addition to the study population difference. 25 In line with previous research, the majority of participants in this study were highly distressed by COVID-19 related Emotional strain/physical exhaustion, shortages of personal protective equipment, concerns about infecting family members, shortages of ventilators and other crucial medical equipment, fear of limited access to childcare during increased work hours, and Fear of being able to provide competent medical care if deployed to a new area. 17, 26, 27 Although all health-care workers on duty during the pandemic of COVID-19 are expected to experiencing distress, being married, being nurses and pharmacies, current substance users, working in emergency and outpatient departments, history of chronic medical illness, brief resilient coping level and social support level were particularly associated with high psychological distress.Consistent with another finding, 28, 29 From sociodemographic variables those who had married have higher odds than non-married (single, divorced, widowed, and separated). This might be due to the fear of infecting family members.The other finding of the current study was significant associations of being nurse and pharmacies as compared to the midwife, physicians, and psychiatric nurse working outpatient only. The different responsibilities of nurses and pharmacies may explain the higher odds of positive psychological distress, as they are spending more time delivering direct patient care in place of patients' families who are not allowed inside the hospital due to transmission concerns during the pandemic.Current finding in line with other finding shows significant association with current substance users and history of one or more chronic medical illness. These might be related that it is frequently reported as a use of the substance and having chronic medical illness during the pandemic increases morbidity and mortality. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Indeed, our findings show that brief resilient coping levels were associated with lower psychological distress; especially those who score medium and high level of brief resilient coping level have a significant negative Have you heard that the number of COVID-19 deaths has increased? association with the odds of psychological distress. This finding was in line with other previous finding done in Switzerland, which was a longitudinal cohort study among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. 35 This shows coping strategies should be used by health-care professionals in facing the highly stressful situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In our study in terms of social support, almost onefourth (32%), of the participants have low social support level. Which we found is risk factor for psychological distress and also it is consistent with other findings. 36, 37 The findings of this study have the following limitations. First, it is only generalizable for situations of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and using cross-sectional design excluded the evaluation of the effects of participant's characteristics on distress levels. Second, since we used online methods the sample was not randomized and this may have affected our results. The third, power of our findings may have been reduced by using questionnaire-based assessment than the clinical interview. Despite these limitations, we are confident the findings of this study reflect the possible psychological distress among health-care professionals during the pandemic of COVID-19.We studied health-care professionals on duty during the pandemic COVID-19 in Dessie, one of the towns of Amhara regions, which have the highest level of infection record of COVID-19. We quantified several sources of distress, ranging DovePress from fears of COVID-19-related variables, psychological distress level, coping levels, and social support levels.The health-care professionals are experiencing a substantial level of psychological distress. In addition to other modifying factors coping levels and social support was a significant predictor of psychological distress among health-care professionals. Coping resilience is important in adapting to and struggling against challenging life events. According to our study, Increased coping resilience is associated with reduced symptoms of psychological distress.These findings should inform the implementation of interventions that increase coping resilience and social support to mitigate the impact of psychological distress among health-care professionals.The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.The research was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) from Wollo University College of medicine and health science before data collection. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-12-15",12

Mass gatherings at religious events, large-scale social occasions, traditional funerals, and wedding ceremonies are standard African cultural practices [19] . These, together with a lack of sufficient knowledge and information about the disease, and poor implementation of the information in practice, contribute to the spread of the coronavirus [20] . In contrast, evidence from countries such as China, Korea, Japan, and Turkey confirms that self-care and social isolation could significantly diminish the spread of infection [21] . If temporary cultural reform is not implemented in Africa, the number of cases and the death toll due to the outbreak will surpass the total global cases and deaths [19, 22] .In contrast to conditions in rich countries in the West, the lives of many Africans are based on the daily routine of obtaining enough food to survive [23, 24] . Subjecting African communities to lockdown at home for extended periods is impossible, as people need to access their fields or otherwise find a way to acquire food. For instance, in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, many have violated the lockdown measures [25] [26] [27] and moved through public spaces like restricted areas in towns and market places in large numbers to search for or collect their daily food, despite such moves being forbidden [28] . While lockdown is intended as a measure to reduce the outbreak of COVID-19 and prevent its transmission in the affluent world, it represents a race against death to survive among many in Africa, where life has become an ""avoidanceavoidance"" conflict situation; be locked in at home and die of starvation, or violate the lockdown regulations to work and collect food and die from the disease. Whatever citizens choose to do, the race is against death, from starvation, or the virus. In Africa, the public perspective about the morbidity and mortality wrought by the disease remains trivial [20] , making it especially difficult to implement preventive mechanisms to stop its spread in most countries [29] . This huge obstacle is compounded by social practices: the impact of traditional greetings; poor sanitation (the injunction to wash hands with soap when clean water is scarce) [30] ; material sharing, such as of door handles, toilets, television remotes, mobile phone, and computer keyboards; the general lack of caution and egotism that has been predicted to double the risk of coronavirus infections in Africa [31] . Evidence from China showed a marked decline in its transmission after material sharing was banned and lockdown and social distancing were implemented [32] , which is impossible in Africa. This is because the majority of Africans live below the poverty line, and millions more are engaged in informal work. In Africa, even if they stay at home, these workers and their families remain exposed to the virus because of overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions that make physical distancing and hygiene nearly impossible. Moreover, most African populations lack access to running water that not only limits the possibilities for handwashing, but also forces women to queue for water, thereby risking themselves and these with whom they come into contact [32] . A community-based and self-care management approach to fight the coronavirus pandemic has been encouraged because of its extensive influence on morbidity and mortality globally, the resulting financial consequences, and the public significance of its prevention [33] . Effective measures against COVID-19 require collaboration among governmental and non-governmental organizations, private agencies, healthcare facilities, and social institutions, such as schools, universities, and religious centers, to mitigate the spread of the virus [34] . If appropriately implemented, such a collaborative effort will enable a healthcare system to cope better with its impact on high-risk individuals and groups as part of the global prevention strategy [35] .Evidence from Africa shows also that the prevalence of the disease is higher among people who travel abroad, gather in large numbers, wash their hands infrequently, have close physical contact with others, and share hand-used materials, all of which increases their opportunities to come into contact with infected people or the virus [36] . Transmission of the coronavirus continues to increase, and its prevalence has spread among all African regions, regardless of their healthcare system and economic level [37, 38] . This has raised the need for further health, social, economic, and political impact analysis studies to assist decision-makers regarding service delivery by indicating the public health requirements that need attention, and by estimating the funding and actions required for appropriate preventative measures. It is, therefore, essential to undertake a wide-ranging analysis when assessing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the health and economic growth of poorly resourced countries, such as those in Africasuch studies not having been reported hitherto. The current evidence focuses mainly on the number of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths; the social, economic, and political impacts remain largely unknown. In this narrative review, we aimed to establish the number of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths; the health crisis's impact on the formal and informal economic sectors; and projections of gross domestic product (GDP) changes in Africa before, during, and potentially after the pandemic, as well as the political and other consequences of preventative measures such as lockdowns.We conducted electronic searches of relevant reports, issued between January and 8 August 2020, extracted from the Google Scholar, PubMed Central, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Also, we searched published and unpublished abstracts, as well as reference lists and tables of contents of relevant journals such as The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, and Nature; and examined African-related global and regional government documents, WHO global and regional reports, as well as updates from regional and local centers of disease control and prevention (RLCDC), and also newspaper commentaries from The Guardian (UK) and The Washington Post (USA).The following search terms were used: ""infectious disease"" AND ""Corona Virus"" AND ""Wuhan, China"" AND ""COVID-19 outbreak"" OR ""COVID-19 Pandemic"" OR ""Prevalence of COVID-19"", AND ""Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)"" AND ""impact of COVID-19"" OR ""economic impact of COVID-19"" OR ""informal economy"" AND ""Gross domestic product"" OR ""GDP"" OR ""health impact of COVID-19"" OR ""social impact of COVID-19"" OR ""political impact of COVID-19"" AND ""fatality due to COVID-19"", AND ""COVID-19 case report"", OR ""COVID-19 death reports"" AND ""social distancing"" AND ""lockdown"".We two authors independently assessed all titles and abstracts of identified studies and applied the following four inclusion criteria to determine if the reports warranted further investigation: (1) did they include African counties? (2) were they published in English? (3) were the contents pertinent to the aim of the study? (4) were they published between January and July 2020? Full-text versions of journal articles or other source documents were obtained of studies that met the inclusion criteria; for those where this was unclear, we reached consensus after a discussion. From the final selection of source documents, we (J.G. and M.K.) independently abstracted data onto standard data forms. The authors of studies with missing data were contacted by email to obtain the data where possible.The pre-pandemic, current, and post-COVID-19 GDP projections for Africa were calculated based on data drawn from the World Economic Outlook database for the continent [39, 40] .Initially, we identified 136 studies using the search criteria ( Fig. 1 ), using Mendeley Desktop reference management to identify duplication and data management. After removing duplications, checking the eligibility of full-text articles, applying exclusion criteria, and screening, 32 papers met the inclusion criteria.Since the first case of COVID-19 in Africa was confirmed in northern Egypt on 15 February 2020, the pandemic and its associated morbidity and mortality have dramatically increased in the five regions of Africa (North Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa, and Southern Africa). As the virus reached the continent only 3 months Fig. 1 The process of screening and selecting data from the literature for the narrative review after having first been reported by the WHO in China, and 1 month after it arrived in northern Italy-subsequently and for a period considered the epicenter of the diseaseit was to be expected that the number of cases would be lower in Africa. As illustrated in Table 1 , as of 8 August 2020, a total of 9.2 million COVID-19 tests had been performed in Africa, with over 1 million cases being confirmed carriers of the virus, over 707,877 people have recovered, and 22,966 deaths being registered.Southern Africa conducted the highest number of tests at 4 million (43% of the total COVID-19 tests conducted), whereas Central Africa did the least 327,007 (4%). Southern Africa also has the highest number of cases over 565,003 (56%), followed by North and West Africa with 171,251 (17%) and 136,952 (13.6%) cases, respectively. The highest death toll was recorded in Southern Africa at 11,424 (48%), followed by North Africa with 7030 (29.3%) deaths. The countries with the highest number of confirmed cases then were South Africa (553,188), Egypt (95,314), Nigeria (46, 140) , Ghana (40, 533) , and Algeria (34, 693) . The six countries with the highest virus-related registered deaths are South Africa (10,210), Egypt (4992), Algeria (1293), Nigeria (942), Sudan (773), and Morocco (480).pandemic Current data show that COVID-19 had a greater impact on countries with more ""developed"" economies than poorer countries on the continent. On the other hand, urban areas had a higher disease burden than rural parts. We reviewed data from The Coronavirus Resource Centre at Johns Hopkins University, displayed in Table 2 , which shows that African countries have case fatality rates ranging from 0.5% in Ghana to 8.1% in Chad, compared to 15.0% for the UK, 14.1% for Italy, and 3.3% in Brazil. These relatively low COVID-19 case fatality rates in Africa could be attributed to inefficient social and healthcare data collection systems, although they are more likely due to the youthfulness of African populations [41] .As much as 80-90% of economic activities in sub-Saharan Africa derive from the informal sector, which in turn contributes up to 40% to the GDP [42, 43] . The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected this economic sector, which involves informal workers and enterprises [42] , in such activities as providing accommodation and food services, manufacturing, wholesale, and the retail trade, including over 500 million farmers who were producing for the urban market. Logistical challenges within supply chains, particularly cross-border and domestic restrictions of movement, may lead to disruptions in the food supply, undermining informal workers' food security. Also, informal produce markets play an essential role in ensuring food security in many countries, both as a source of food and a place for smallholder farmers to sell their goods. Their closure would lead to increased food insecurity and poverty [44] .The overwhelming majority of workers in the informal economy experience a heightened exposure to occupational health and safety risks due to a lack of appropriate protection and an increased likelihood that they will suffer from illness, accidents, or death. COVID-19 adds to these risks. If they fall sick, most workers, including migrants, do not have guaranteed access to medical care and no income security through sickness or employment injury benefits [45] . If they are unable to access health care, the virus would spread more widely, with fatal consequences. If they can access health care, many will incur out-of-pocket costs that will force them to go into debt or to sell their productive assets, plunging them into deeper poverty [45, 46] . Table 3 presents a comparison of projected changes in the gross domestic products (GDP) of various African states before, currently, and after the pandemic has passed. Table 3 illustrates that the GDP for Africa as a whole is anticipated to shrink from growing at 2.4% before the outbreak to declining by 2.4 to 5.1% during its height; some projections show that it will rise to 4.1% thereafter. The GDP of sub-Saharan Africa and the middle-and low-income countries is reported to change by − 1.6%, − 3%, and 1.6% respectively during the COVID-19, with a projected growth of 4.2%, 4.9%, and 4.9% respectively after the pandemic has passed [35, 47] .The health, social, economic, and political impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa are outlined in Table 4 . The consequences for health are overwhelming, adding to the continent's already under-resourced health systems and premature deaths due to such underlying conditions as lower respiratory tract infection, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal Source: The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University 9 August 2020 [41] diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis, which collectively accounted for over 3 million premature deaths in 2016 [47, 48] . In many rich countries, comorbidities complicate the health outcomes of people with COVID-19; in the case of large populations that are undernourished and experience underlying medical conditions, these may put them at increased risk of succumbing to the virus, but this effect is unknown. The poor health service infrastructure on the continent also makes it unlikely that many of those who are infected will be able to receive the care needed at appropriately equipped facilities [24] . The outbreak of the pandemic has greatly affected the social lives of Africans, limiting material sharing, disrupting family lives, and breaking down social cohesion due to social distancing and enforced isolation. Most educational institutions in Africa have been closed. Traditional life in Africa is cohesive and based on mutual dependence that makes social distancing and isolation very difficult. The lockdowns imposed by national governments not only exacerbate existing inequalities but have contributed to the victimization of women with an increase in rape cases [49] , of disabled people and the elderly who are the most economically deprived, vulnerable segment of the population [50] . Moreover, produce markets have been closed, limiting people's access to food sources that have resulted in starvation among vulnerable communities, which were already living below the poverty line (Table 4 ). In some African countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda, lockdowns have resulted in the violation of human rights, the killing of citizens by security forces, and increased traditional crime [28] . This, in turn, has resulted in outbreaks of social unrest, and further impoverishment of communities [51] . Many countries in Africa were already economically compromised by corruption, maladministration, and poor political leadership [39, 47] . Nevertheless, some have shown notable economic growth over the last half-decade, such as Djibouti, Ethiopia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Tanzania [39, 52] . Many countries have high formal unemployment rates, with people relying on small-scale farming and informal trading to make a living. In those countries that have implemented measures such as lockdowns, which have brought economies to a standstill, many thousands of jobs have been lost, resulting in a growing population who have no reliable source of income [40, 52] . At a national level, some features of the economic impact of COVID-19 prevention measures are the suspension of informal economic sectors such as street vendors and small informal shops in townships called spaza shops [43] . Additional consequences are a reduction in per capita income and the trade-in domestic products, a decline in the value of supply chains, and increased pressure on fiscal policies and debt, all of which can lead to financial recessions or depression [39, 40, 52] . The prominent political impacts of COVID-19 depicted in Table 4 show an increase in discrimination against refugees and immigrants; the closing of national borders, preventing the movement of goods and services; a breakdown in formerly close relations among African nations; and the evacuation of citizens to their home countries resulting in distrust among leaders [53] . Also, the implementation of measures like handwashing may not be appropriate for Africa due to a shortage of running water [53] . Moreover, postponement of national elections has resulted in deadly conflict, distrust, and conflict between political opposition parties and the ruling governments in some African countries such as Ethiopia [54] .In this narrative review, we aimed to establish the number of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths, their impact on the informal economic sector as well as projections of gross domestic product (GDP) changes in Africa pre-, during, and post-epidemic. It also aimed to determine the health, social, economic, and political crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak in Africa as well as the implications of the lockdowns imposed to stop its spread in African populations.The pre-COVID-19 healthcare situation on the continent focused mainly on infectious communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, and other health-related issues like maternal and under five-child mortality, and the usual low emphasis on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) [55] . The pre-COVID-19 social factors in Africa are diverse and unifying. For instance, there is a continuous movement of African communities from one region of the continent to the other region legally for visiting, tours, trade, education, meetings, and/or training or through illegal migration by the initiative of human illicit traffic workers. There is also regular mass worshipping in churches, mosques, beaches, and socialization around campfires with some portions of the population visiting nightclubs, music and cinema concerts, mass marketing, social works, wedding, and funeral ceremonies [19] . However, all the above activities changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the government of each African country implemented strategies to protect the life, health, economy, and rights of their respective citizens.Economies pre-COVID-19, specifically regarding informal sectors and formal economies in the African context, are unique. The informal sector, for example, comprises economic activities that circumvent costs and is excluded from the benefits and rights incorporated in laws and administrative rules covering property relationships, commercial licensing, labor contracts, torts, financial credit, and social systems vis-à-vis to the formal economy. Whereas labor laws protect formal economies, COVID-19 exposed the informal sector (the precarious nature of informal work), as evidenced by the absence of contracts or income protection [45] .Last but not the least issue is the pre-COVID-19 political situation of Africa, where 22 countries prepared for national elections [56] . Elections provide avenues for citizens to hold their leaders accountable through either endorsing their legitimacy or replacing them if they have performed abysmally with elections in Africa characterized by fear and panic as it is considered a 'do-or-die' affair [57] . With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are uncertainties as to whether countries will proceed with elections under their respective election calendars. More specifically, there are concerns about how some autocratic leaders may take advantage of this pandemic to prolong their stay by postponing elections to a later date or even indefinitely [57] .Although the pandemic arose in China, the COVID-19 outbreak in Africa with its massive morbidity and mortality in African populations added to the existing threat of infectious and chronic diseases they are already predisposed to [58] . At the time of writing this narrative review, the cases and mortality associated with the virus are higher in the North African region, followed by the Western and Southern African regions [59] . A modeling study in Africa supports the finding of our study depicting that by June 30, 2020, nearly 16.3 million people in Africa will contract COVID-19 with the North African region the most affected area by the virus while the East African region will be the least affected. Collective cases on June 30 are projected to range about 2.9 million in Southern Africa, 2.8 million in Western Africa, and 1.2 million in Central Africa [60, 61] . This variation in caseload and mortality might be due to lower levels of socioeconomic development and are likely to record less and slower transmissions at the early stages of the pandemic than higher levels of socio-economic development [62] [63] [64] [65] .The results of our narrative review depict a greater health crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak in Africa. This could be ascribed to the already existing under-resourced health care systems and premature deaths, HIV/AIDS, lower respiratory tract infections, diarrheal diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis already accounting for over 3 million deaths in Africa in 2016 [66] [67] [68] . While in many developed countries the comorbidities complicate the health outcomes of people with COVID-19, the effect on larger populations who are undernourished and have conditions that may well put them at increased risk of succumbing to the virus is unknown [69] . The limited health service infrastructure also makes it unlikely that many of those who are infected will be able to seek health care at appropriately equipped facilities [25, 70] .The social crisis posed on African populations is devastating, including false news [71] , racism, and discrimination [71, 72] as one of the restraints that block the initial control and management of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This could be ascribed to life in Africa that is cohesive and based on dependence, which makes social distancing and isolation very difficult. The findings of our study indicated that the impact of COVID-19 is very high among vulnerable people, such as women, older people, people with disabilities, and a higher mortality rate among comorbid individuals [5, 73] . Commentary on Israel's minority group by [74] substantiated the finding of our review stating that older people and people with disabilities and comorbidities are marginalized in all circumstances during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Africa. It could also be due to a lower level of resistance in comorbid and older people than young and non-comorbid individuals with the literature affirming the finding of our review indicating that hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and respiratory disease the most prevalent comorbidities [75] .The results of this review showed the closure of food markets, limited access to food sources, which in turn resulted in starvation with many households not being able to access or afford food. Evidence shows that the outbreak of COVID-19 can cause a considerable rise in poverty among vulnerable households, including decreased access to food [26] . This could also be attributed to a loss of income during the lockdown. Investigators corroborate the findings of our review, revealing a disparate understanding and awareness of the African community about the COVID-19 pandemic with the western African countries showing a better level of knowledge about the virus, these could be due to lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak [76] .Many countries in Africa have high formal unemployment rates, a reduced per-capita income, and no reliable source of income with people relying on small-scale farming and informal trading to make a living. In this regard, researchers indicate that many countries in Africa are already economically compromised due to corruption, maladministration, and poor political leadership. At the same time, some have shown considerable economic growth over the last half decades, such as Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Senegal, Guinea, and Tanzania [52, 77] .Despite a few countries showing economic growth, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic poses a looming impact on the already under strained African economy. Researchers corroborated our results, indicating that some features of the economic impact of COVID-19 prevention measures are a decline in the GDP and the value of supply chain and increased pressure on fiscal policies and debt [52, 78] . The results of our review depict a decline in economic growth in Africa of 2.4% pre-COVID-19 in 2019 [39] to between − 2.4 and − 5.1% during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic era (2020) [41, 52] . The lockdown decreased production and increased cost to curve, the pandemic could contribute to this prediction. Supporting the results of our finding, a situational study by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa predicts economic growth of less than − 3.3% for the African region in 2020 [79] . This could be due to the reduction of wide-ranging export African regions share with the rest of the world than within African regions. Substantiating our finding, a study in Kenya predicts a decline in the five sector's contributing to the GDP such as agriculture, tourism, construction, infrastructure development, and manufacturing post-COVID-19 [80] . Moreover, the findings of our review reflected the expectation of a variation of decline in GDP change across African regions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic with a greater GDP loss (− 3%) observed in the middle-income countries, followed by the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa (− 1.6%) during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic [39, 40, 52] . The disparity could be the result of the different states of lockdown and the differences these African regions have in the levels of socio-economic and trade partnership with Europe, China, and America [60, 61] . A study by the World Banking Group depicted that the majority of countries in the African region will show a decline in GDP, which was 2.4% pre-COVID-19, and reduced to − 2.4% during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic period [52, 81] . The decline of GDP is likely to be the result of decreased import and export, job losses due to the lockdown, reduced production of export commodities, and increased debt to address the pandemic [82] .The political impact of COVID-19 is overwhelming as a result of the existing fragile and weak government structure in addition to the stated health, social, and economic impacts [77] . The findings of our narrative review revealed a breakdown in the connection among African nations and the closing of national borders, evacuation of citizens to their home countries that result in mistrust between frontrunners, and execution of actions that may not be suitable for Africa [51, 83] . In this regard, during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, political decisions taken by African leaders were encouraging, possibly due to fear of their under-strained health system, limited quality health facilities, and an under-strained economy [84] . Also, despite African countries' public health emergency system that is constrained, the action taken by African leaders to curve the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak is not only faster but also highly acknowledged; they declared a public health emergency and banned irrelevant public movement, followed by lockdown to minimize the possibility of the disease outbreak in their respective countries [53, 84] . Aligned with the differences in economies, health systems, and lifestyles among western and African populations, the health outcome, social impact, and economic toll in both developed and developing countries remain disparate [85] . This might be the result of the lack of social support, far more people living on or below the poverty line, and the fact that more people are self-employed or not employed in the formal sector in African regions.Most African countries' health care facilities and resources are under stress. If the spread of the pandemic endures for as long as it is predicted, the secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will swiftly become an economic emergency, leading the world towards a recession, severely impacting African countries with limited resources and the most impoverished populations. Moreover, many African countries have implemented WHO-developed COVID-19 management strategies and approaches to deal with the pandemic, such as ""quarantine, social distancing, self-isolation, usage of water, sanitation, and wash hands practices."" However, while these approaches to curb and manage the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak are deemed appropriate and successful in Asian countries such as China and South Korea, the strategies remain challenging, impossible, and unacceptable in African countries due to inequalities, substantial job losses, disparity, and informal economic practices in many African countries. Besides, the lockdown is an obstacle to peace, security, and safety to African countries that are plagued by unrest exhibiting illegal practices such as crime, corruption, and maladministration prolonging the existing poverty, starvation, and inequality.The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to have a long-term impact on the organization of our health systems, of our production, processing and exchange of goods and services, as well as our consumption practices, cultures, and our relationship with life and death. The study we have just evaluated contributes to understanding these changes and their impact. It is the choice of policymakers and other stakeholders to consider these findings in the prevention and response to new epidemics. To successfully address the health, social, economic, and political impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, a united, active, and well-organized public health emergency reaction is required among leaders, governmental and non-governmental organizations. The success of public health emergency readiness and response is substantially based on the superiority and volume of information accessible during the outbreak of the pandemic. Rapid communiqué and distribution of wrathful information are required to prevent and manage the health, social, economic, and political impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure it is a race neither against death nor against starvation for African populations. Therefore, African countries require culturally relevant and indigenous pandemic managing strategies in years to come to make them responsive to pandemics that could affect their economies, and citizens' health and lives.

It gave rise to a global health threat, resulting in an on-going pandemic in many countries and regions of the world. During the last months, it was observed that the virus caused a wide range of clinical manifestations in all age groups. Moreover, it had a negative impact on the affected individual's life in many aspects. It would affect his/her physical as well as the mental health. In addition, it had its adverse effect on the economic and daily life activities due to the unexpected lockdown (Li et al, 2020) .Older adults and people of any age with chronic medical illnesses (CMI) are particularly at increased risk for severe illness and affection of their daily lives (Sanyaolu et al, 2020) .Studies have demonstrated that chronic disease, including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, pulmonary diseases, and diabetes mellitus are considered as risk factors for the disease severity, poor prognosis, and mortality in COVID-19. In China, the overall casefatality rate was elevated among patients with pre-existing CMI: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . However, the definite reasons for the association between these comorbidities and the disease severity and mortality risk of COVID-19 have not been yet identified (Güler & Öztürk, 2020) .The aim of this study was to compare anxiety, depression and coping strategies between patients infected with COVID-19 disease with and without CMI during the peak of COVID-19 disease in Egypt (June-July 2020) (Worldometers.info, 2020) . It was hypothesized that COVID-19 patients without CMI would have lower psychological distress and use active coping styles compared to COVID-19 patients with CMI.1. Psychological distress:The Arabic version of 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (Daradkeh et al, 2001) was used as a screening device for psychological morbidity. It is a self-administered questionnaire that has been used for both population-based studies and health assessment surveys. The scoring method (0-1-2-3) was used to sum up the points to a total score ranging between 0 and 36, with a higher score indicating poorer mental health.The Arabic version of Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS) (Fahmi & Ghali, 1997 ) was used to separate normal participants from those with pathological levels of anxiety. It consisted of 50 true or false questions where an individual answers by reflecting on himself, to determine his/her anxiety level. The true response scores 1 point, so the total score ranges from 0 to 50. Scores from 0-16 denote no anxiety; 17-20 denote mild anxiety; 21-26 denote moderate anxiety; and 27-50 denote severe anxiety.-Coping styles:It was assessed by the Brief-COPE scale, Arabic version (Nawel & Elisabeth, 2015) . It is an abbreviated version of the COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) Inventory. It is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure effective and ineffective ways to cope with a stressful life event. It is one of the best validated and most frequently used measures of coping strategies. The instrument consists of 28 items that measure 14 factors of 2 items each, which correspond to a Likert scale ranged from 0 -3. Total scores on each scale range from 2 (minimum) to 8 (maximum). Higher scores indicate increased utilization of that specific coping strategy. Scores are presented for the two coping styles: (1) avoidant coping, which is characterized by the subscales of denial, substance use, venting, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, and self-blame. Avoidant coping is associated with poorer physical health among those with CMI; and (2) approach coping is characterized by the subscales of active coping, positive reframing, planning, acceptance, seeking emotional support, and seeking informational support. Approach coping is associated with more helpful responses to adversity, including adaptive practical adjustment, better physical health outcomes and more stable emotional responding. Humor and religion items are neither categorized as approach or avoidant strategies.Data was entered and statistically analyzed on the Statistical Package of Social Science Software program, version 25(IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows). Data was presented as, mean, standard deviation, median and percentiles or quantitative variables and frequency and percentage for qualitative ones. Comparison between groups for qualitative variables was performed using Chi square or Fisher's exact tests while for quantitative variables the comparison was conducted using independent sample t-test or Mann Whitney test. Correlation between numerical variables was presented. P values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Patients with underlying CMI were significantly older and had more severe COVID-19 disease presentations. There was no difference between the two groups regarding gender distribution, place of isolation, the occurrence of anxiety or depression during COVID-19 disease or their severity. Forty-one (52.6%) patients with CMI versus 24 (27%) patients without CMI during their COVID-19 disease had anxiety. Thirty-one (36%) patients with CMI developed depression during their COVID-19 disease (5.8% of them had severe depression) versus 29 (27.6%) patients without CMI developed depression during their COVID-19 disease (2.9% of them had severe depression) (Table 1) . Religion, emotional support, use of informational support and acceptance items of the Brief-COPE scale were the most used coping strategies by the study sample.We found no significant difference in the coping strategies between patients with and without CMI except for the use of informational support that was significantly used by patients without CMI (Table 2) . Further statistical analyses to study the coping strategies within each CMI were done (Supplementary tables 1-5). Patients without systemic hypertension showed significant use of approach coping strategies. Patients with chronic pulmonary illnesses showed significant use of avoidant coping. Active coping was significantly used by patients with ischemic heart disease.COVID-19 related anxiety correlated with denial (r= 0.272, P-value 0.001), behavioral disengagement (r= 0.258, P-value 0.001), venting (r= 0.293, P-value <0.001) and self-blaming (r= 0.260, P-value 0.001). The use of avoidant coping strategies showed significant positive correlation with COVID-19 related anxiety (r= 0.285, P-value <0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between the age of the patients with COVID-19 and depression, avoidant coping, and the use of humor. The total score of GHQ-12 showed highly significant positive correlation with depression (r= 0.573, P-value <0.001), anxiety (r= 0.491, P-value <0.001), Denial (r= 0.285, P-value <0.001), behavioral disengagement (r= 0.392, P-value <0.001), venting (r= 0.485, P-value <0.001), self-blaming (r= 0.442, P-value <0.001), the use of avoidant coping strategies (r= 0.447, P-value <0.001) and humor (r= 0.223, P-value 0.003). It also showed negative correlation with emotional support (r= -0.290, P-value <0.001) and the use of informational support (r= -0.166, P-value 0.026). There was a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 related depression and COVID-19 related anxiety disorders, use of informational support (r= 0.162, P-value 0.032) and venting strategies (r= 0.197, P-value 0.009) (Table 4) .The results of the present study emphasized on the difference in the scores of anxiety, depression and coping strategies between patients infected with COVID-19 disease with and without CMI during the peak of COVID-19 disease in Egypt (June-July 2020). Approach or adaptive coping strategies (emotional support, use of informational support and acceptance) and religion were more frequently used than avoidant or mal-adaptive strategies within the study sample, without statistical difference between patients with and without CMI (except for the use of information support item which was significantly used by patients without CMI). This showed that patients with COVID-19 disease tended to overcome their illness by focusing on the religious aspects, seeking emotional support and use of informational support to gain more knowledge about their condition and by accepting it. This might explain why there was no difference in the prevalence of anxiety and depression among patients with and without CMI as the use of several approach coping strategies might have increased the ability of the patients to adapt resulting into less anxiety and depressive symptoms and better psychological health.Umucu and Lee (2020) have also found that the most frequent coping strategies among patients with COVID-19 and chronic conditions in the USA were acceptance and selfdistraction, though their study included largely highly educated participants and they didn't include a comparative group of COVID-19 patients without CMI. It was reported that the more the acceptance coping strategy used by patients with chronic illnesses, the better the quality of life (Elfström, Rydén, Kreuter, Taft, & Sullivan, 2005) .Denial was the most used avoidant coping strategy while substance use was least used by both patients with and without CMI in this study (without any statistical difference between them). This demonstrates that patients had a considerable tendency to deny the reality of the presence of the disease at some point. This was against the finding by Umucu and Lee (2020)among the Greek population and found that acceptance, humor and planning were the most frequent used strategies. Park and colleagues (2020) found that self-distraction, active coping, and seeking emotional support were the most frequent used coping strategies in USA population (including Hispanic and non-Hispanic ethnic groups). Yu and colleagues (2020) found that patients with suspected COVID-19 disease within the Chinese population had less social support, spent long times seeking for information support items and rarely used any coping strategy to deal with their stressor. Dawson and Golijani-Moghaddam (2020) conducted a cross-sectional study in the UK where COVID-19 confirmed cases comprised 18% of their studied population and found that avoidant coping positively correlated with distress and negatively correlated with well-being.As COVID-19 is a seriously evolving pandemic, this study may add the Egyptian experience to the global work of clinicians and researchers for a better understanding of coping strategies used by patients with COVID-19 disease across different cultures and communities.The current pandemic is a need for multidisciplinary research that should involve psychiatric and psychosocial aspects. Coping strategies to COVID-19 disease are different across populations.Understanding COVID-19 related stress and coping strategies in individuals with chronic medical conditions has implications for how individuals might be helped to manage their illness during the current presentation and intervene with the development of serious long-term mental health conditions in the future.","Egypt","abstract","2020-12-24",12

In December, 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and was quickly determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus [1] , namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] . The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China firstly and has been propagated around countries and regions of the world. The contagious COVID-19 devastated normal life around the world. As of November 26 th , 2020, COVID-19 has infected more than 60776978 confirmed cases in the world, has killed more than 1428228 people, and has forced more than 7 billion to stay in their homes [3] . In response to this ongoing public health emergency, an online interactive dashboard has been developed, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualize and track in real time reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in the world [3] .Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less-severe disease, such as the common cold, and others more severe disease such as MERS and SARS. Some transmit easily from person to person, while others do not.According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people.The new coronaviruses lurking around the world are threatening our rules, and the prevalence of fear and panic is increasing. It has also affected the cryptocurrency market [4] [5] .Algeria reported its first COVID-19 case, on February 25 th , 2020. In November 26 th , 2020, Algeria has reported 79110 confirmed cases with 51334 recoveries and 2352 deaths by COVID-19 [6] .Accurate forecasting of COVID-19 case trends is essential for the preparedness of health systems in terms of outbreak management and resource planning.Mathematical and statistical modeling of infectious disease is effective tools that would enable health systems to anticipate future disease trends [8] [9] . Time series models such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) have been widely used to statistically model and forecast infectious disease trends [10] .Data for this study were obtained from March 21 st , 2020 to November 26 th , 2020.The daily Algerian COVID-19 confirmed cases were sourced from The Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform. Daily COVID-19 confirmed cases for neighboring countries were also obtained from the Johns Hopkins University's official website [6] .Average (ARIMA) processes refer to [16] with the following equation:• Determine the first smoothing value and determine the parameter• Determine the second smoothing value ′′ = ′ + (1 − ) −1 ′′• ARIMA Model For Time Series Data ARIMA model is stated as follows:All rights reserved.

This rapid increase of cases has stressed most healthcare systems worldwide and has further made outbreak response and resource planning a challenge. In response, health authorities have attempted to forecast the trend of this pandemic, however this have proven to be difficult as COVID-19 is a novel disease with limited data and knowledge on the disease trends and dynamics [6] . This is especially observed when using ARIMA model to predict disease trends, where ARIMA model require sufficient long time series data to be accurate.this version posted December 20, ; Similarly, studies on COVID-19 conducted in countries such as South Korea, Iran and Italy were able to predict case trends using ARIMA models in similar conditions. In addition as with our findings, a study in Italy also reported a high level of forecast accuracy of 95% in predicting COVID-19 trends using ARIMA models [14-19-20] .The strengths of this study include, firstly, this paper is the first to report the use of ARIMA models to forecast COVID-19 cases and trends in Algeria. Secondly, this was the first attempt to use smoothen case data to improve accuracy as compared to similar studies on ARIMA models for COVID-19 conducted in other countries [20] [21] . Thirdly, we used several independent covariates which provided more accurate signals to develop short-term model predictions for immediate outbreak response. And finally, we also optimized the model training and validation period to provide the highest number of data points to generate the best fit model. All rights reserved.

[4] [5] [6] Since its emergence, the disease has reached 216 countries/territories, infected more than 69 million people, and took 1,488,120 lives globally as of December 03, 2020. 7 In Ethiopia, the disease was first reported on March 13, 2020. 8 Following this, the government of Ethiopia took different measures, such as isolating international passengers, arranging quarantine centers in different sites to follow the suspects, closure of universities and schools, mass disinfection, complete transport lockdown, and the release of prisoners. 9 As per the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) report of December 02, 2020, the total number of cases and deaths were 110, 984 and 1745 respectively. 10 As occurred in high-income countries during the emergence of the outbreak, currently, in Ethiopia the number of cases and related deaths are increasing exponentially compared to those reported before a few months, which is suggestive of community transmission. 9, 11 The pandemic of COVID-19 has put health systems under immense pressure and stretch beyond their capacity, particularly those found in low-income countries are vulnerable. 2, 12 As a result, different community-based interventions such as awareness creation, contact tracing, community level provision of other essential health services and home level management of non-severe COVID-19 cases are designed to reduce the burden of health facilities. These responsibilities are mainly carried out by the community health workforces and key community members because they are trusted members of the community with important links to the facilities, leaders, and organizations that are key contributors to an effective response. 13, 14 Currently, the disease has no cure, and prevention is the only available effective weapon to control it. The recommended methods to prevent the pandemic of COVID-19 include regular and thorough cleaning of hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and clean water, maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 meters, avoiding going to crowded places, and wearing a facemask. 15 Ethiopia is among the countries with a weak health system where the health professional to population ratio is only 0.96 per 1000 populations. This is much lower than the World Health Organization's recommended standards (4.45 per 1000 populations) to meet the sustainable development goal health targets. 16, 17 This implies that if our globe becomes lucky and obtains effective treatment for COVID-19, Ethiopia will still be far away from providing treatment for those who will be in need. As a result, maintaining the recommended prevention methods in the country is the first available option to control the disease.The practice of available prevention methods for COVID-19 in the community should be assessed to design appropriate interventions that can reduce community transmission. However, there is a lack of community-based evidence that discovered how the community is preventing the pandemic of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors associated with the community prevention practices of COVID-19 in three zones of southwest Ethiopia (Kafa, Bench Sheko and West Omo), where peoples are living far away from the center with inadequate infrastructures including health institutions.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Bench Sheko, Kafa, and West Omo zones from May 1 to 31, 2020. These three zones are found at 585 km, 449 km and 708 km from Addis Ababa, Capital of Ethiopia, respectively, to the southwest direction. The Bench-Sheko zone is administratively divided into six woredas (districts) and two town administrations. The Kafa zone is also divided into eleven woredas and two town administrations. Likewise, the West-Omo Zone has seven woredas. The main agro-ecology of these three zones includes dega (cool and humid high lands, which account for 56.7% of the land size), kolla (warm, semi-arid lowlands, which account for 28% of the land size) and weinadega (temperate, cool and sub-humid high lands, which account for 15.3%). Their annual mean temperature ranges from 15.1°C to 27°C, and the annual mean rainfall ranges between 400 mm and 2000 mm. In these zones, there were 7 hospitals, 97 health centres and 565 health posts that provide health services for residents. According The adult population who were 18 years old and above were included in this study. Individuals who were unable to respond due to different medical problems were excluded. The sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula [n ¼, where ""n"" stands for sample size, ""z α/2 "" stands for the reliability coefficient of standard error at the 5% level of significance, which equals to 1.96, ""p"" stands for the proportion of good COVID-19 prevention practice, which was considered as 50% (since there was no previous study at comparable area), and ""d"" stands for the level of standard error tolerated, taken as 5%. The calculated sample was 384.16. After using the design effect of 2 and adding a non-response rate of 10%, the final sample size became 845.A multistage sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. First, ten woredas and town administrations (three from Bench Sheko, three from West Omo and four from Kafa) were selected randomly and included in the study. Likewise, thirty percent of Kebeles (smallest administrative units) were selected from each of the selected woredas and town administrations. Then, the calculated samples were allocated to each of the selected Kebeles proportional to the size of households in the Kebeles. Finally, the households were selected using a systematic random sampling technique, and from each of the selected households, one eligible participant was selected by the lottery method.A pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire (see Additional File 1) adapted from WHO recommendations regarding COVID-19 prevention practices and a previous similar study was used to collect the data. 15, 19, 20 The tool includes the sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants (age, sex, religion, residence, ethnicity, marital status, occupational status, educational status, family size), knowledge questions about COVID-19 (which includes about clinical symptoms, transmission, risk factors, treatment, and vulnerable groups), attitude questions (mainly about the success of the control at an individual and national level, the effectiveness of local treatments such as hot drinks, and the probability of the occurrence of the virus in the locality), practice questions (about risky and positive behaviors practiced recently) and others. The questionnaire was prepared in English and translated to the local language (Amharic) by a language expert. It was also back-translated to English by another expert to ensure its consistency. The Amharic version questionnaire was used to collect the data.To assure the quality of the data, two days of training was given before data collection for data collectors and supervisors about the objective of the study, techniques of data collection, different ethical issues, and care to be taken regarding COVID-19 during data collection. A pretest was performed on 10% of the total sample size in the comparable Kebeles that were not included in the actual study, and some modifications were added to the tool. We have checked the internal validity of the questionnaires used in this study using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). The knowledge, attitude and practice questionnaires were checked separately and the calculated r were significantly higher than the critical value (r=0.069 with the degree of freedom=801 and two sided α=0.05) which suggests the validity of each items. The minimum calculated r for the knowledge, attitude and practice items were 0.153 (p<0.001), 0.285 (p<0.001) and 0.424 (p<0.001) respectively. Data were collected by thirty diploma nurses, and the overall collection process was supervised by ten BSc nurses. The supervisors checked each filled questionnaire for completeness during the data collection.The outcome variable of this study was the practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. The independent variables were sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, residence, ethnicity, marital status, occupational status, educational status, family size), knowledge about COVID-19, attitude toward COVID-19 prevention methods, intention to seek care and perceived mortality.The participants were asked 14 knowledge questions, 9 attitude questions, and 8 practice questions. Participants who scored at least the mean score of the above questions for each category were considered to have good knowledge, a positive attitude, and good practice.Data were entered into Epi data manager version 4.0.2.101 and exported to Statistical Packages for Social Science (SPSS) version 20 for analysis. Data were cleaned to check for outliers and miscoded variables. Furthermore, negatively worded items were reverse scored. Data were presented as tables and proportions (percentages). Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between the independent variables and an outcome International Journal of General Medicine 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress variable. The outcome variable (prevention practice) was categorized in to good practice (coded as 1) and poor practice (coded as 0). The odds ratio (OR) with its respective 95% confidence interval (CI) and the p-value was used to measure the strength of the association. In the bivariable analysis, variables with p-values <0.25 were considered as candidates for a multivariable analysis. The final significance was declared at a p-value <0.05.In this study, out of the 845 total samples, 803 fully participated, resulting in a response rate of 95%. Among the total study participants, more than half were males (57.8%), Orthodox Tewahido religion followers (56.4%), and found in the age category of 18-30 years old (52.8%).Similarly, approximately one-third of the respondents had Kafa ethnicity (31.1%) and single marital status (32.1%). Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of the study participants had urban residence (67.7%), good knowledge about COVID-19 (64.6%), and a positive attitude toward COVID-19 (66%). [ Table 1 ]Approximately two-thirds (64.7%) of the respondents had a history of going to crowded places. However, only approximately one-third (30.3%) of the total study participants had a history of wearing a mask when leaving home. The majority (68.1%) of the study participants had a history of covering their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing. Twothirds of the respondents had a history of maintaining their distance at 2 meters (64.4%) and washing their hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers (64.8%). However, a significant proportion (45.6%) of them had a history of eating raw/uncooked foods. Generally, less than two-thirds (59.4%) of study subjects had a good practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. [ Table 2 ]In bivariable logistic regression, residence, educational status, occupation, marital status, family size, knowledge, attitude, intention to seek care and perceived mortality were statistically significant at p-values less than 0.25. After controlling for confounders, in multivariable logistic regression, residence, knowledge status, attitude status, intention to seek care, and perceived mortality were significantly associated with the COVID-19 prevention practices of the participants at a p-value less than 0.05.Urban residents had more than two (AOR=2.34) times higher odds of good practice compared to rural residents. Similarly, participants who were from the highest family size (more than six) had three (AOR=2.95) times higher odds of good practice than those from the lowest (one to three) family size. Good knowledge status (AOR=1.74) and positive attitude (AOR=1.86) had a positive influence on COVID-19 prevention practices compared to their counterparts (poor knowledge and negative attitude, respectively). Furthermore, respondents who had the intention to seek care for COVID-19 symptoms had 73% (AOR=1.73) increased odds of good practice than those who had no intention. Lastly, individuals who had a perception of COVID-19-related death had double (AOR=2.20) odds of good practice than those who had no such perception. [ Table 3 ]This study revealed that approximately two-thirds (64.7%) of the respondents had a history of going to a crowded place, which is comparable to the finding of the study conducted at Jimma University Medical Center (JUMC). 21 However, it is very high compared to the study conducted in China, 19 where only 3.6% visited crowded places. The discrepancy might be due to the differences in socio-economic and demographic characteristics between the two countries. Compared to Chinese, Ethiopians' lower economic status may increase their probability of going to crowded places since there is difficulty in accessing technologies to communicate virtually and to use online businesses. Moreover, the strong social interactions in Ethiopian society may oblige people to go to crowded areas. 22 Since COVID-19 has a higher potential of person-to-person transmission, exposure to crowded places is risky behavior and should be discouraged.One of the important findings in this study is that only one-third (30.3%) of the study participants had a history of wearing a protective mask when leaving home. This is very low compared to the finding from China, 19 and it is also contrary to the WHO recommendations. 21 This figure is very frustrating in the case of Ethiopia, where the community transmission of COVID-19 is more likely. 9, 11 An additional finding that magnifies the problem of COVID-19 prevention practice is that a significant proportion submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of General Medicine 2020:13 (35.6%) of people did not maintain appropriate physical distance. As a result, efforts should be made to encourage the public to use a protective mask and maintain appropriate physical distance as per the WHO recommendations.Our findings show that only three of five participants had good COVID-19 prevention practices. This is very low compared to the Iranian finding, 23 and the discrepancy might be attributable to the differences in socio-economic statuses and attention given by the community. The better socio-economic status of Iranians may enable them to access different inputs required to prevent COVID-19. The increased number of cases and deaths in Iran could also bring more attention to prevent COVID-19 among Iranians compared to Ethiopians. 24, 25 This finding is highly public health important for Ethiopia, which was grouped as among vulnerable African countries to This is because the provision of important health services to COVID-19 patients requires expensive resources, and in Ethiopia, the majority of the health services are substandard mainly due to resource scarcity. 16, 17 For instance, Ethiopia had 557 mechanical ventilators and 570 intensive care unit (ICU) beds for a population of 110 million. 9 Thus, a major emphasis on prevention is mandatory, and sustainable intervention should be made to increase its implementation. In this study, participants from urban residents had more than two times higher odds of practice than those from rural residents. This might be because urban residents had better access to COVID-19-related information and resources needed to prevent COVID-19, such as alcohol-based sanitizers, soap, water, and protective masks. In addition, the rural community may not obtain adequate information regarding COVID-19 due to limited access to phone and/or internet, which is common for the rural community of Ethiopia. 9 One of the opportunities during the era of COVID-19 is an increased time for discussion and interaction among family members. 27 This opportunity enables the parents to implement different innovations to protect themselves and their family members from the pandemic of COVID-19 and its impacts such as mental health problems. 28 In our study higher family size (more than six) had three times higher odds of practice compared to those with lower family size. Members of an increased family size probably bring information related to COVID-19 prevention from different sources and discuss it, which could enable them to change it into practice.Participants with good knowledge status about COVID-19 had more than one and a half times higher odds of practice compared to those with poor knowledge status. This is also supported by the previous finding where knowledge and practice were associated with direct proportionality. 19 Most of the time, it is straightforward that having knowledge enables people to practice what they know. People who have good knowledge about the disease, its severity, transmission methods, and prevention methods can value their lives and take appropriate measures.Likewise, individuals with a positive attitude regarding the success of COVID-19 prevention methods had 86% increased odds of good practice compared to those with a negative attitude. It is obvious that when people rely on the success of prevention methods, their interest in applying these methods will be high. Therefore, the information should be disseminated continuously to increase the trust of the community in prevention methods and to avoid their concentration on fake news that discourages preventive behaviors.In our study, respondents who perceived that COVID-19 can lead to death, had two times higher odds of good practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 compared to their counterparts. People in the world prefer to live long on the earth and invest to alleviate the risk of death as much as possible. Educating the community about the severe outcome of the COVID-19 could benefit them to have appropriate prevention behaviors. However, this should be done in a manner that will not bring an exaggerated panic to the community.This is the self-reported practice of COVID-19 prevention methods, and there may be the probability of social desirability bias. Since we have used a cross-sectional study design it may be difficult to establish the temporal relationship between the outcome variable and some of the independent variables. Lastly, the findings can be generalizable to the comparable settings in Ethiopia; but to the other parts, this should be done with cautions.The proportion of individuals who had good COVID-19 prevention practices was inadequate in our study area. Moreover, the practice of wearing a protective mask and maintaining recommended physical distance is very low, and these all need immediate interventions. It was also demonstrated that urban residents had good practice compared to rural residents. This gap should be addressed by educating rural dwellers and availing important inputs for COVID-19 prevention methods, keeping in mind that 79% of Ethiopians are living in rural areas with weak transportation and communication links. 9 The respondents had moderate knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, which had a positive influence on good practice. Thus, it is also important to center the interventions on updating the knowledge and attitude of respondents. This can also enhance the community's perceived mortality, which was recognized as a significant predictor of good practice.Overall, for such highly infectious disease prevention should be a priority intervention, and the prevention practice of the community in our study area needs further effort. The datasets used during the current study are available with authors and can be obtained from the corresponding author on reasonable request.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the ethical review committee of the health science college of Mizan Tepi University, and the approval letter with a reference number HSC/0032/20 was obtained. In addition, the support letter was obtained from Mizan Tepi University and given to the zonal administrations of Kafa, Bench-Sheko and West Omo zones. Then permission letter was obtained from local authorities (each zonal administrations) to conduct the study in the selected Kebeles of each zones. The study participants were briefed about the purpose of the study, their right to participate or not, and the quitting of participation at any point of time during the data collection. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The possible prevention methods of COVID-19 (wearing a protective facemask and keeping at least 2 meters of physical distance) were implemented during data collection. The data were collected anonymously and kept confidential.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-12-18",12

It outperforms significantly the traditional molecular dynamics based methodologies, such as for example MM/GBSA and empirical solutions like FoldX and etc. and often precisely predicts the free energy differences between the mutations with a RMSE of about only1.2 kcal/mol [10] [11] . It has been also shown that the better sampling approaches lead to much better results and most importantly for more than 90% correct predictions of the effect; i.e. whether the effect will be positive or negative after certain ligand or protein substitutions [12] . To calculate the differences in the free energy of binding for each complex in this study we employed the Desmond FEP/REST approach described in details previously [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Initially, the default sampling protocol was applied with the number of lambda (λ) windows either 12 or 24, in dependence of the mutation charge. An equilibration and 5 ns-long replica exchange solute tempering (REST) simulations in a muVT ensemble was further conducted. Only the mutated atoms was included in the REST ""hot region"" region. OPLS3e force field was used for the all simulations [13] . A set of N501 mutations for which experimental data is available was selected to validate the calculations. The experimental structure of the S1 RBD-hACE2 complex (pdb: 6M0J) was used as a starting point. After the solvation with SPC waters the complex consisted of over 102 000 atoms. For the study of S1 RBD interactions with the neutralizing antibody STE90-C11 selected from COVID-19 patients [14] , which was well tolerated to the known mutations, we use the very recently published X-ray structure with a PDB access number of 7B3O. For the FEP calculations with double N501Y/K417N mutations we used as a starting point the energy minimized most representative frame of the N501Y FEP simulation. Table 1 presents the results from FEP calculations. As one can see the energy convergences in some cases were not so good for both the Bennett and the cycle closure (CC) approaches (see Figures 1A) . In fact, the error of the calculated ΔΔGCC predictions, during the first 5 ns, suffered from much larger standard deviations. The convergence is indeed a very important issue during the FEP calculations. Hence, we are extended the FEP calculations to 20 ns-long REST sampling and obtained a good convergence (see Table 1 and Figure 1D ). Another set of simulations are currently undergoing in our lab performed by our own developed sampling protocol [12] . In the particular case, before the REST procedure we use an equilibration of each λ for 50 ns and then run 20 ns-long REST simulations. The cycle closure calculations for protein-protein selectivity have been not studied well, thus, to avoid any confusions in the interpretations we used only the Bennett values to make our conclusions herein. Moreover, during the initial phase of our study the K417N mutation was not reported yet and it is a difficult to obtain the ΔΔGCC values for the S1 RBD-STE90-C11 complex at this stage. The better sampling protocols could make the free energies more precise and improve the CC ΔΔG values, however, it is not likely to change qualitatively the results present here; i.e. whether one mutation can results either in an increase or decrease in the interactions. This conclusion is also based on our experience with such type of simulations with both the ligand-protein complexes and protein mutations [12, [15] [16] .The main results of the FEP study were:1) We observed significant decrease of the binding between S1 RBD and STE90-C11 antibody by ΔΔG of 3.78 kcal/mol. This is a significant value and the observed convergence was good ( Table 1 and Figures  1B and 1E) . The binding energy of the antibody can be roughly estimated based on the published value of IC50=0.56nM in a plaque-based live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay [14] . This is equivalent to ΔG value of about -12.7 kcal/mol (ΔG=RTln (IC50). Thus, our calculations predict that the N501Y mutant will produce a decrease of the binding into ΔG = -8.92 kcal/mol or 293 nM. This is about 161 times lower than the wild type. The value from extended 15 ns-long FEP simulation was similar: 3.48 kcal/mol.2) Initially, we detected an increase of the binding between S1 RBD and human ACE2 by ΔΔG value of only -0.5 kcal/mol after 5 ns of FEP calculations. However, considering the decreasing free energy trend of the complex leg (see Figure 1C ; it decreased by about 1 kcal/mol only for the last 2 ns of the FEP simulations) and 500 ns-long classical MD simulation we expected this value to be much more significant after extension of the REST sampling to 15 ns. This hypothesis was confirmed and we obtained a ΔΔG value of -1.75 kcal/mol from the extended simulation and it will eventually go down a bit more because the convergence is still not perfect ( Figure 1F) . In support to our data are also the in vivo studies of N501Y on mice [3] .3) The addition of K417N mutation led to a dramatic decrease of the STE90-C11 antibody binding to virus's S1 RBD. The default FEP sampling protocol calculated a ΔΔG value of 5.74 kcal/mol. In the case when both N501Y and K417N mutations are present at the same time this value further increased to 8.61 kcal/mol but this simulation was not well converged and after its extension to 15 ns we obtained a valued of 5.83 kcal/mol. Thus, it seems that the effect of these mutations is not additive and only the K417N mutation can abolish the interaction with STE90-C11 antibody. These results also suggest that even the well tolerated to mutations antibodies eventually would be resisted to this variant of SARS-Cov-2.4) The K417N mutation also increases the S1 RBD binding to ACE2 by -0.39 kcal/mol. The convergence after 5 ns of FEP/REST simulations was better than in the N501Y case but we expect a further decrease in the ΔΔG value after the 15 ns extension. Thus, both the N501Y and K417N mutations enhanced the RBD binding to ACE2.These results can be considered as a trustful because reproduced well the experimental data [ref. 17, see Fig 4A] . For instance, for the N501D mutation we calculated a ΔΔG value of 3.54 kcal/mol meaning that it greatly reduces the S1 RBD binding to ACE2, in accordance to the experimentally observed change of over 100 times. In contrary, the N501T mutation transformed the S1 RBD to a better binder (ΔΔG = -1.69 kcal/mol), in an excellent agreement with the experimental data. Additional sets of calculations for other mutations, such as for example the transformation of N501D to N501Y (ΔΔG = -4.32 kcal/mol), were also performed in order the CC ΔΔG predictions to be obtained. The latter residue substitution provides an additional support that the N501Y mutation increases significantly the binding. In conclusion, it is evident from both the experimental data and FEP study here that the binding of the spike S1 RBD to hACE2 is highly sensitive to the N501 mutations and even the substitutions with small residues, such as N501T, seems to alter the structure of the complex. Based on the all FEP calculations it is also evident that at least 15-20 ns -long FEP/REST simulations for protein selectivity are required for systems with more than 100 000 atoms.Further, we identified the conformational changes in the N501Y mutated S1 RBD-ACE2 complex. In particular, we compared the most representative structures after 5 ns of FEP simulation for the wild type and the average structure obtained by 500 ns-long classical MD simulation (Figure 2A) . As one can see, the mutated S1 RBD rotates by about 20 degree. In a result, the RBD can approach deeper into the center of the binding site with ACE2 and the distance between Cα atoms of Tyr501 and Lys352 decreased by about 1.0 Å. The position of the surface residues was also changed. The Tyr501 makes a stable H-bond with the crucial for the ACE2 binding residue Lys353 (Figure 2B ) but the longer 500 ns-long MD simulation showed that this bond is not so pronounced and mainly the hydrophobic and π-π stacking of Tyr501 increase the binding strength. The Leu455 was in a much closer position to ACE2 interacting with the surface helix residues. A conformational change of other residues were also detected as such for example Thr500, Tyr505, Tyr449, Tyr453, Gln493 and other. These simulations explain also why the G502 and L455 mutations are so sensitive to the ACE2 interactions.Recently we identified a set of ACE2 allosteric modulators which bind to ACE2 but did not produce any significant reduction in the virus replication (unpublished results). We targeted into the binding site located inside ACE2 which is close to the virus's S1 RBD (see Figure 2B ). Thus, it seems that the virus can act in a different way, as such for example entry mediation by Neuropilin-1 [18] or other processes are also possible. To our best knowledge there are no other similar ACE2 binders developed up to the moment which are able to reduce the virus replication, not only the interactions with S1 RBD. However, it is reasonable to expect that the action of such type of inhibitors will be not affected greatly by the virus's RBD mutations.As we shown by FEP calculations the reduction of the S1-RBD binding to STE90-C11 was well pronounced. Thus, we also studied the structural changes due to the N501Y mutation based on most represented structure from the FEP MD ensemble. Two equivalent antibodies can bind to the virus's spike S1-RBD. Thus, the N501Y mutation can affect the binding by both via direct interactions with only one of them and also to produce a change in the interactions between the individual STE90-C11 units. One of the obvious alters detected was the disruption of the formed by Gln498 H-bond with Ser30. This is also valid for Thr500 -Ser30 hydrogen bond and in general the hydrophobic interactions in this part of the S1 RBD binding surface (see Figure 3) . Indeed, the Asn501-Ser30 and Gly502-Gly28 H-bonds were also removed. The Tyr501 did not provided any significant interactions with the antibody. The Tyr58 located in the second chain of the antibody dramatically changed its conformation leaving the central point of the binding to the antibody without any stable hydrophobic stabilization and also disrupting the hydrogen bond network formed by Ser56 of the antibody. These changes were introduced because of the Tyr501 stabilization role on the conformation of Arg403 and Arg408. Tyr58-Thr415 and Ser56-Asp420 H-bonds were also altered by the conformation of Tyr58. All of these conformational changes were not observed during the wild type simulation. These data should be further confirmed by long term MD simulations which are underway in our lab and more details would be revealed.The mechanism of action of K417N mutation is also clear (see Figure 3) . After the disruption of the aftermentioned interactions of S1 RBD with STE90-C11, and in particular the conformational change of Tyr58, the Lys417 occupied the same area making a strong hydrogen bond with Asp101. The cancellation of this H-Bond by the asparagine mutation and the other established interactions of Lys417 are an obvious reason for the further decrease in the binding. More MD simulations would be helpful to reveal the additive mechanism of action of N501Y and K417N mutations. The same is valid also for the description of the S1 RBD -ACE2 interactions. Based on the 500 ns-long MD simulation of N501Y mutant we can conclude the Lys417 seems have a compensatory mechanism of action increasing the free energy by 1.6 kcal/mol, as shown per our FEP calculations. It has an important role in the binding and can create a strong H-bonds with Asp30 and His34. However, this is not the real case when both N501Y and K417N mutations are present at the same time and their effect on the S1 RBD conformational changes and S1 RBD-ACE2 binding remains to be revealed.","South Africa","abstract","2020-12-31",12

Moreover, insomnia was significantly higher in single (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.09, P-value = 0.027), divorced/widowed/separated(AOR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.08, 11.29, P-value = 0.032), unemployed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.22, 7.03, P-value = 0.001), blind (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.42, 6.35, P-value = 0.001), and deaf (AOR = 10.2, 95% CI: 4.52, 35.33, P-value = 0.002) participants.Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were highly prevalent among individuals with a disability during the COVID-19 period. Multiple sociodemographic and disability-related factors were associated with this high psychopathology. Attention has to be given by the government and other stakeholders to intervene in psychopathology and its associated factors.As can be seen from history, different viral diseases happened in the past 20 years in the world. [1] [2] [3] . The coronavirus is now becoming a serious public health emergency since December 2019 [4] . Symptoms of the Coronavirus infection include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, myalgia, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. Individuals with a history of underlying diseases are more likely to be infected with the virus and would experience worse outcomes [5] . Severe cases of the disease can lead to heart, and respiratory failure, acute respiratory syndrome, or even death [6] .Multiple studies showed that such public health emergencies are accompanied by psychopathologies [7, 8] . The coronavirus disease(COVID- 19) had also been known to cause great mental health problems in the infected patients, and health care workers, families, children, students, patients with mental illness, and even workers [9] [10] [11] .As of February 2020, IASC (Inter-agency standing committee) Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings developed a guideline. This guideline explained society in general and people with disabilities, in particular, are in fear of being socially excluded/placed in quarantine. The reason for this could be the disease, feeling powerless in protecting loved ones and fear of losing loved ones due to the virus, refusal to care for unaccompanied or separated minors due to fear of infection, because parents or caregivers have been taken into quarantine [12] .A systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among the general population during the COVID-19 revealed that 29.6% of participants had stress, 31.9% had anxiety and 33.7% had depression [13] . Another review and meta-analysis on the mental health impact of COVID-19 on health care professionals reported that anxiety, depression, and anxiety, was prevalent in 23�2%, 22�8%, and 38�9% of the study participants respectively [14] . Multiple earlier studies reported the prevalence of generalized anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms among the general population during the COVID-19 period were 35.1%, and 20.1% in China [15] , 23.6% and 45.1% in turkey [16] , 65% and 69% in Pennsylvania [17] .Earlier research revealed that attending COVID-19 news frequently [18] , misinformation, and fabricated reports about COVID-19 [19] , and frequent media exposure may cause distress. Uncertainty regarding one's health, treatment care, follow-up of patients, and inefficiency increases the vulnerability to the psychological effects of COVID-19 [15, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] (Fig 1) .As researchers of the current study, we investigators know that people living with disabilities are subjected to different forms of mental and psychosocial problems in times of emergencies like the COVID-19, and the way they cope with these problems might not be adaptive. Therefore, assessment of the mental and psycho-social needs of people living with a disability during the COVID-19 pandemic will be important in delivering appropriate messages thereby equipping them with updated information, decreasing the risk of infection, and finally improving the mental and psychosocial health of people living with disability in Dessie town.Before the beginning of the study, the ethical committee of the college of medicine and health science of Wollo University reviewed the ethical concerns of the study and approved it with a letter (CMHS-360/013/12). The participants were given an informed consent sheet before the start of the interview and signed it they were volunteers to proceed in the study. After that, participants who signed the informed consent were interviewed by data collectors and were also having a full right to exit from the interview at any time they want. During the process of interviewing participants, personal identifiers were not used to keep the confidentiality of the collected data.This cross-sectional survey was done from July 15/2020 to July 30/2020. The study was done in disability association centers in Dessie town. The town is centered in the South Wollo zone of the Amhara region to the North East of Ethiopia. This town is located 401 km far from Addis Ababa; the capital city of Ethiopia and has 18 Kebeles and 350,000 inhabitants based on the latest statistics from the region [30] . There are seven associations of disabled individuals in the town (disability association for individuals living with blindness, disability association for individuals living with hearing impairment, disability association for individuals with mobility limitation, disability association for individuals who are victims of leprosy, disability association for individuals with intellectual disability, disability association for female disabled individuals and disability association for geriatric individuals). More than 1800 individuals with the above types of disability are members of the associations as per the data from the federation for disability in the town.The sample size for the study was determined using the single population proportion formula and taking the following considerations. 1) The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and insomnia as 50% due to the absence of earlier studies on depression, anxiety, and insomnia in individuals living with disabilities in Ethiopia during the covid-19 pandemic.Besides, the Zα⁄2-value of 1.96 was used at a 95% Confidence interval and a margin of error of 5%. Finally, a non-response rate of 10% was considered to give a total of 423 people with disabilities planned to be included in the study.The study was done with a purposive sampling technique to recruit participants from individuals living with various types of disability (blindness, deafness, mobility limitation, and victims of leprosy).The target populations for the current study were individuals living with various disability types as described above and who are members of the disability association in Dessie town whereas people with disabilities and members of the disability association who avail themselves during the study were considered as the study population. Among the planned 423 participants, we recruited a total of 401 individuals living with disabilities with a complete and consistent response. The remaining participants were excluded from the analysis due to a variety of quality limitations. This makes the response rate of the study to be 94.8.The study recruits only individuals living with a disability and members of disability associations whose age was 18 years and older. However, people with intellectual disability and preexisting known depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and sleep disturbance were not invited.The sociodemographic characteristics studied and incorporated in the final analysis were age in years (< 25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54 and � 55), sex (female/male), marital status(married, single and divorced/widowed/separated), ethnicity (Amhara, Oromo, Tigray, and others), religion (orthodox, Muslim, protestant and others), occupation classified as a governmentemployed, farmer, merchant, housewife, laborer and unemployed, educational status (noneducated, primary school, secondary school, college and above), with whom the individual is living classified as living alone, with family and within a common compound. Besides, clinical variables like concerns of being infected with COVID-19 and risk of infecting others (high, moderate, low and none), and associating the symptoms of other illnesses with the symptoms of COVID-19 (high, moderate, low and none) was measured. Further to this the presence or absence of pre-existing chronic medical illness and type of disability (blindness, deafness, mobility limitation, and victims of leprosy) were evaluated.The knowledge of participants regarding the COVID-19 transmission and epidemiology had been weighed based on the individual response to the specified questions. Besides, substancerelated factors such as ever use of substances and current use of substances was measured.Depression among participants during the COVID-19 pandemic period was screened using the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which consisted of 9-questions adapted to assess the level of depressive symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic as ranging from 0(""not at all"") to 3 (""nearly every day""). The sum score of these 9 elements varies from 0 to 27 with a score from 0-4 representing the absence of depression whereas a summed score of 5-9 representing mild depression. A score of 10-14 and 15-19 also defines moderate and moderately severe depression whereas a score higher than 19 represents severe depression. This screening tool was validated in Ethiopia [31] for the screening of depression and major depressive disorder will be diagnosed with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% at a cut-off point 10 and above [32] .Anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was screened using the general anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) which is a brief 7 item anxiety screening tool developed by Spitzer et al. [33] to assess the presence of GAD in a primary care population. This assessment scale was adapted to evaluate the presence of anxiety in individuals living with a disability. The 7 items are scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) with an overall GAD-7 scale score ranging from 0 to twenty-one. The scale presents a rapid, efficient, reliable, and valid method for detecting the presence of a common anxiety disorder. A score 0-4 represents minimal anxiety, a score of 5-9: mild anxiety, a score of 10-14: moderate Anxiety, and a score greater than 15: severe Anxiety. A cut-off point at a score of 10 and above on the GAD-7 scale had been defined as GAD with a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 82% respectively [33] .The presence or absence of sleep disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated with the insomnia severity index [34] . This scale consisted of seven elements that assess the presence of insomnia due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first three elements (difficulty of falling asleep, the difficulty of staying asleep, problems of waking up too early) assess the severity of insomnia from 0 (none), to 1(mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), and 4(very severe).The 4 th element assesses ""how the individual was satisfied/dissatisfied with his/her current sleep pattern"" and scored from 0 (very satisfied) to 4(very dissatisfied). The 5 th item asses ""how noticeable to others do the individual think of his/her sleep problem in terms of impairing quality of life"" and rages from 0 (not at all noticeable) to 4 (very much noticeable). The 6 th element describes ""how worried/distressed was the individual about his/her current sleep problem"" and scored from 0 (not at all worried to 4 (very much worried). The final item assesses the extent of interference of sleep problem to the individual daily functioning and varies from 0 (not at all interfering) to 4 (very much interfering). Overall the sum of the 7 items ranges 0-28 with scores of 0-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-28 representing no clinically significant insomnia, sub-threshold insomnia, clinical insomnia of moderate severity, and clinical insomnia of severe severity.Coping of disabled individuals to the psychopathologic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed using the brief resilient coping scale developed by Sinclair. G., & Wallston, K. A. in 2004 [35] . The scale consisted of four questions (I look for creative ways to alter for difficult situations, Regardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it, I actively look for ways to replace the losses I encounter in life and I believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with difficult situations). Each of the four items is scored from 1 (does not describe me at all) to 5 (describe me very well). The overall score, therefore, ranges from 4-20 with a score of 4-13 points, 14-16 points, and 17-20 points representing low resilient copers, medium resilient copers, and high resilient copers respectively.The initial step in the study process was the translation of the English version of questionnaires by both psychiatry and language experts together. The next step was the training of three Bachelor of Science level data collectors on the content and components of data collection tools, ethical issues to be maintained during data collection, the physical distancing, and the use of appropriate respirators during data collection. Then after obtaining ethical clearance from the respected body, a pre-test was done 7 days before the main study at kombolcha town, which is located 15 kilometers far from the study area. After that the data collection for the main study was implemented from July 15/2020 to July 30/2020 using a questionnaire comprised of 1) socio-demographic variables 2) substance use variables 3) the insomnia severity index 4) the patient health questionnaire-9 5) Generalized anxiety disorder-7 6) knowledge regarding transmission and epidemiology of COVID-19 and 7) brief resilient coping scale. During this study period, continuous supervision was conveyed by two Master of Science in mental health professional specialists and timely corrections and support were given to data collectors. Furthermore, the collected questionnaire was checked for clarity and completeness daily and feedback for the next day work was given appropriately. Participants obtained to have serious psychopathology were linked to a nearby psychiatric service center for further management.After data was entered into EPI-DATA 3.1, it was exported to a statistical software package for social science SPSS V.20 for Windows for analysis. Descriptive statistics like mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe continuous data whereas numbers and percentages were employed to describe categorical variables. A binary logistic regression method was used to identify the related factors for the psychopathologies. Furthermore, an odds ratio with its 95%CI was driven to show association strength, and a P-value <0.05 was declared as statistically significant. Model fitness in the multi-variable binary logistic regression was assured with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goddess of fit test and multi-Collinearity diagnosis was done with a standard error.Four hundred twenty-three questionnaires were collected from participants but only four hundred three were found to be complete which makes the response rate to be 95.27%. All participants' sociodemographic data is indicated in The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety among the study participants was 186 (46.2%) and 194(48.1%) respectively at a cut of points of 10 and above on both the PHQ-9 depression scale and the GAD-7 anxiety scale. Considering severity, 33%, 26.1%, 18.9%, and 1.2% of study subjects were found to have mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression respectively (Fig 2) . On the other hand, 33%, 40.2%, and 7.9% of participants had mild, moderate, and severe anxiety (Fig 3) . Participants who were not educated have a higher proportion of depression (57.9%) than participants who were a diploma and above (37.2%). Females have a relatively higher prevalence of anxiety (53%) than males (44.8%) however this was not valid statistically (P-value = 0.25). widowed/divorced and separated individuals had a higher proportion of depression (67.4% VS 41%), anxiety (58.5% VS 41.5%) than married participants. Considering the type of disability, depression was highest; 64 (86.5%) in victims of leprosy, and this was also supported statistically (AOR = 9.2; 95% CI: 4.93, 21.21), anxiety was highest in individuals with deafness; 80 (86%). This was also significant statistically (AOR = 8.2; 95% CI: 4.52, 19.43%). Insomnia was found in 280 (71%) of study participants. However, its severity varies and 232 (57.6%), 48 (11.9%), and 6 (1.1%) of participants had sub-threshold, moderate, and severe insomnia respectively (Fig  4) . Regarding coping, 45.7%, 37.5%, and 16.9% of participants were low, moderate, and high resilient copers respectively. Detailed information on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and coping are shown in Table 3 below. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, COVID-19, disabilities, EthiopiaWe used the binary logistic regression analysis method to identify the associated factors for anxiety, depression and insomnia. Independent variables with p-value <0.025 in the bi-variate analysis for anxiety, depression and insomnia were fitted to the multivariate logistic regression. At the multivariate analysis we used p-value <0.05 to identify associated factor for the outcome variables.The result of final model revealed that individuals with disability who were divorced/widowed/separated were significantly more likely to have depression (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.28-8.92, P-value = 0.006) than married counterparts. Depression was also significantly associated with educational status (non-educated) (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.90, P-value = 0.001), and unemployment (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.32, 5.11, P-value = 0.005) as well as being a daily laborer (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.20, 4.89, P-value = 0.014).Generalized anxiety disorder was significantly higher in young age (<40 years) (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.98, P-value = 0.02). Moreover, anxiety was significantly higher in single (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.24, 5.3, P-value = 0.011) and widowed/divorced/separated (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.78, P-value = 0.032) participants than married ones. Besides, anxiety was higher in preparatory school completed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.59, 5.46, P-value = 0.001), daily laborer (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.21, 5.23, P-value = 0.003), unemployed (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.17, 4.78, P-value = 0.005) and individual with deafness (AOR = 8.2, 95% CI: 4.52, 19.43, P-value = 0.00) at a significant level.Moreover, insomnia was significantly higher in single (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.09, Pvalue = 0.027), divorced/widowed/separated(AOR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.08, 11.29, P-value = 0.032), Table 4 .Per the knowledge of researchers of the current study, this work is the first study that assessed the mental and psychological impact of COVID-19 on individuals living with disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic, with its rapid transmission rate, and the high fatality rate has intensified anxiety among the global population, leading to psychological and mental disorders in the global community. Moreover, stereotyping and discrimination are rampant in these populations at this period [36, 37] .It is therefore essential to study and distinguish the mental and psychological states of individuals in this unprecedented, perplexing, and critical time. Earlier evidence suggests that suicidal thoughts, psychosis, anxiety, trauma, and panic attacks are common in this time [18, 38] . Other evidence also suggested that COVID-19 had a high degree of psychological outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms [21, 22, 26] due to its rapid transmission, its high mortality rate, and concerns about the future [39] . Anxiety had also an impact on the body's immune system and so that intensifying the risk of contracting the virus [18] . Therefore, the result obtained from this study on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and coping style of people living with a disability will be significant evidence to policymakers and program planners' to initiate a recommendation for early initiation of interventions. Furthermore, clinicians, further researchers, and administrative bodies will use the evidence generated from the current study as a baseline for further investigation.This result of this study revealed that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in individuals with a disability in response to the pandemic is 46.2%, 48.1%, and 71% respectively, and found that single, divorced/widowed/separated, non-educated, daily labor and unemployed participants, deafness and leprosy victim types of disability were more severely affected.This study revealed that the young age group (<40 years) increases the risk of anxiety in participants. Individuals who were less than 40 years of age were 1.7 times more likely to have anxiety than older age groups (�40 years). The reason for this could be individuals in the young age group are more troubled over the future impacts and economic encounters due to the pandemic, since they are the most productive forces in the society [15, 20, 21] . Moreover, the higher rate of exposure to social media concerning the transmission, and case fatality rate might increase the stress and anxiety [40] .Marital status was found to be significantly associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia in the present study. Individuals with a disability who were divorced/widowed/separated and single were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety, and insomnia than married counterparts. Single participants are emotionally more damaged by stress full experience than the married participants [41] that would heathen the depression and anxiety. In the present study individuals with a low level of education were significantly at a higher level of depression and anxiety than individuals with a higher level of education. This was, however, in contradiction to a study finding in earlier studies. Studies in Iran and china revealed that individuals at a higher level of education were more increasingly vulnerable to anxiety and depression to the impacts of COVID-19 [20, 26] . The level of self-awareness of one's own perceived health in individuals with a high level of education could be the cause [42] . Also, the high number of significant networks in these individuals will cause anxiety and depression [20, 22, 43] .Unemployment is a risk factor for depression and anxiety. In the present study too, individuals who were unemployed and daily laborer were more likely affected by depression, anxiety, and insomnia than the government employed. This was consistent with multiple earlier evidence [44] [45] [46] . Disappointed hope and financial problems which are the daily hassles of unemployment, might have a role in this association [47] .Although not the case in the present study, epidemiological evidence revealed that women are more vulnerable to anxiety and depression than men [48] . The high vulnerability to stress and post-traumatic stress disorder in women could be responsible for this [20, 49] . This was supported by a recent study on the prevalence of depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic [19, 20, 23, 26] . Moreover, the presence of a comorbid medical illness was not found to be significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia in the present study. This was, however, in opposition to the result of a study on the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 in Italy [29] that obtained a significant correlation between medical illness and anxiety/depression. The high sense of vulnerability to COVID-19 in individuals with earlier medical and psychiatric illness could be responsible for this [50] .This study revealed that depression, anxiety, and insomnia were highly prevalent in individuals living with a disability during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also found that single, divorced/widowed/separated, non-educated, daily labor and unemployed participants, deafness, and leprosy victim types of disability were more severely affected by depression and insomnia. This implies the need for recognition of this target population for psychosocial support and interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the above mentioned socio-demographic profiles need to be considered during the designing and implementation of psychosocial interventions. Furthermore, binding procedures and guidelines have also to be developed and used.The major implication of this study is the high occurrence of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, insomnia, and identification of the degree of coping among individuals living with ","Ethiopia","first author","2020-12-30",12

The importance of homemade plant-based foods and beverages as community responses to COVID-19","In many cultures, homemade plant-based beverages and foods represent a crucial part of the folk medical repertoires on which communities rely for treating minor, infectious, and chronic diseases [1] . These folk remedies are embedded within a broader framework of Traditional/Local Environmental Knowledge (TEK/LEK) systems, which are defined as coevolving conglomerates of knowledge, beliefs, and practices that are transmitted mainly, albeit not exclusively, verbally [2] . Moreover, Nina Etkin introduced the pioneering concept of ""edible medicines"" [3] to describe those domestic foods that are used to improve the general health of community members, i.e., preparations that adhere to the aesthetics of taste, appearance, and smell (and thus producing pleasure) but simultaneously function as remedies. In spite of a huge interest in folk remedies by ethnopharmacology over five decades [4] , robust evaluations of common folk edible medicines retained within local communities are still lacking, since pharmacological research has been primarily directed at plant remedies traditionally prescribed or recommended by healers and other alternative medicine professionals and has neglected or overlooked domestic food medicines.There exists an emerging literature consisting of reviews and commentaries on promising dietary and herbal remedies for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] [8] , but the relevance of this information compared to the plant remedies that local communities are actually using remains unclear, and participatory approaches in conducting ethnobiological field studies during the current pandemic are lacking [9] . In this editorial, we aim to fill that gap by providing perspectives from different countries as case studies, as well as a preliminary (baseline) inventory of plant remedies recorded during the first phase of the pandemic. The provision of health care via food at the household level is a crucial issue for public health, since homemade foods represent the primary health care remedies that communities rely on in times of crisis.The two main objectives of the rapid preliminary inquiry presented in this editorial consisted of (1) documenting popular plant food medicines (homemade, plant-based healing foods, and beverages) and (2) to impressionistically assess changes in their consumption or intake, during the COVID-19 pandemic.During the first phase of the pandemic (December 2019-August 2020), the authors used rapid-response preliminary inquiry and participant observation, conducting at least 10 interviews (mainly through remote and online inquiry) based on convenience sampling (reaching out to their social contacts, including those living in local communities) and often following the snowball method in the area in which they live, or where they normally conduct field studies. Five large urban (metropolitan) areas that were heavily affected during the first phase of the COVID-19 health crisis (Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York, and Rio de Janeiro), and twelve rural areas or other countries that were initially less affected by the pandemic (Appalachia, Jamaica, Bolivia, Romania,Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Georgia, Turkey, Pakistan, Cambodia, and South Africa), were included in this study. Study participants were asked to describe (1) homemade plant foods and beverages that they had used during COVID-19, for preventing infection and/or for treating symptoms, and (2) changes in the consumption of specific plant foods in response to COVID-19. Further details on the methodology are presented in Additional file 1. The inquiry represented a preliminary appraisal that will inform more systematic (broader and deeper) future research. In addition, in order to better understand the role of social media, the data of the Polish, Lithuanian, and Belarusian case studies was obtained from discussion threads on social media and Internet news portals (Additional file 2). Since the number of people (or Internet posts) in our sample varied by country, city, or region, we introduced the relative importance (RI) value (calculated as the percentage of people or internet posts mentioning a specific plant in every case study) and tallied RI values to quantify the cross-regional relative importance of individual plant taxa.Botanical identification of plants was based on the authors' expertise with the correspondence between local and scientific names in their regions, and scientific names follow The Plant List [10] , while family assignments follow the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) IV [11] . Organisms other than plants were mentioned by some participants (including fungi, algae, and animal products), but we mostly report on plants.The motivation for this editorial was to obtain a rapid first impression of community responses around the world, which represents valuable baseline data for future studies and continued in-depth research. This is especially important since TEK/LEK systems are known to actively respond to epidemiological trends, and therefore, plant pharmacopoeias are likely to change as the pandemic continues to unfold. A weakness of this approach is the lack of comprehensive field work, which represents the gold standard in ethnobotany, including the ability to build community rapport about the topic of research, conduct in-person interviews, pre-test survey questionnaires, and collect voucher specimens for botanical identification. Although institutional ethics review was not obtained for this initiative because of time constraints (rapid appraisal), the upheaval of administrations around the world, and barriers to conduct field work, the authors adhered to the ethics guidelines set out by their professional societies and followed Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC). The 17 case studies were summarized briefly, which limited the depth of information. However, all recorded plant taxa are provided in Additional file 3. The strength of this study is that insights into community-based responses to this global health crisis are urgently needed, underexplored, and underrepresented in the literature. The diversity of case studies represented in this paper shows a rich overview of how communities across the globe are actively managing their health in real time and coping during this crisis, using plants and their TEK/LEK systems.The following paragraphs represent 17 case studies that briefly summarize perspectives of community responses to COVID-19 with homemade plant foods, beverages, and teas around the world. The name of each region, city, or country is followed by the initials of the author in brackets. Scientific names of all reported plant species, in addition to the ones reported in the text, can be found in Additional file 3.Wuhan was the endemic center of COVID-19. At the end of December 2019, the local health agency released information to the media that suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was observed in the city. Because many Chinese people remember the 2002 SARS outbreak, some over-the-counter (OTC) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) ran quickly out of stock in drug stores. This included the famous extraction of banlangen roots (Isatis tinctoria L. or Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze), a first-response remedy to virus infections for many Chinese people. Once banlangen and similar OTCs became unavailable, many people tried other foods and drinks, including hot tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze). The theory of TCM prescribes heat to fight viruses, so people who did not like tea drank hot water instead. Other dietary interventions included soup of ginger and pear (Pyrus spp.), pear with rock sugar, ginger with coca-cola, or soup made with beef, lamb, steak, or fish. Many people also considered porridge important, made with yam (Dioscorea oppositifolia L.), longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.), date (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), or wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L.). The national administration of TCM and its branches released different versions of TCM formulas for treating COVID-19. By law, these TCM formulas should be prescribed by doctors. Because COVID-19 treatment is limited to specialized free hospitals in Wuhan, these TCMs were provided to patients through government-contracted companies. At the end of January 2020, Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital, released two specific TCM formulas for preventing COVID-19. None of our interview respondents had prepared such tea formulas themselves; however, a Wuhan company claimed to have made over 3 million bags of the drink, and sent it to city hospitals and communities, based on a local news report.During the lockdown, there was a regular consumption of foods associated with perceived beneficial effects, such as fruits and vegetables, brown rice, spelt (Triticum spelta L.), legumes, and spices, including cinnamon and ginger, hemp, and extra-virgin olive oils, as well as almond milk. At the same time, an increase in the consumption of some specific fresh fruits (especially citrus fruits and strawberries), broccoli, leafy vegetables (e.g., Spinacia oleracea L.), onions, and bell peppers, as well as hot herbal teas, was observed. Moreover, we noticed the introduction of some superfoods into the diet, such as spirulina (Arthrospira platensis Gomont), Manuka honey, matcha tea (Camellia sinensis), and echinacea (Echinacea sp.), particularly among the youngest community members. It seems that changes in food consumption habits adopted to face COVID-19 were mainly based on suggestions offered by professionals (e.g., pharmacists, herbalists, and social workers in the public health service) and also by information available on the web or received via WhatsApp.As in several metropolises, the pandemic has had grave consequences in Madrid, with nearly everybody having close friends and relatives that were severely or mildly affected, many of them treated in hospitals but most at home. Doctors made their diagnosis over the phone and mainly recommended paracetamol. It seems that the pandemic reinforced trends in the consumption of herbal teas and healthy plant-based foods. Most people interviewed (10/13) had taken home remedies to prevent or cure coronavirus symptoms, primarily those that they normally use when they are suffering from cough or throat problems, including homemade orange and lemon juice, tea of ginger and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), and sucking on dried ginger. Remedies for enhancing immune defenses, such as garlic, lemon juice, apple vinegar, and herbal teas (e.g., green tea, nettle, dandelion) were also taken. Loss of appetite was commonly reported, and improving the quality of food was mentioned as very important. People also increased their intake of healthy foods, such as fruits, mixed and colorful salads, other vegetables, and legumes. Most people stated that they had learned these remedies from close relatives, as well as from teachers, books, and magazines. Health authorities promoted healthy diets rich in fruits, legumes, and vegetables, using olive oil and consuming nuts daily. Such diets, as well as those that increase defenses and are rich in antioxidants (e.g., lemon, oregano, salvia, licorice), were encouraged by the Internet and WhatsApp messages. However, newspapers and other websites also discouraged treatments that they considered fake news (e.g., claims that drinking hot beverages or lemon juice kills the virus).Half of the top ten countries of origin of New York City's (NYC) immigrant population are Caribbean. Data from NYC's Health Department tells the grim tale of COVID-19 for this population, by showing that NYC neighborhoods with the highest percentage of COVIDpositive residents included heavily populated Caribbean sections of the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. Around mid-April 2020, 1 month into NYC's closure, a former research assistant reached out via email with the observation that many people in her community, namely New Yorkers hailing from the Dominican Republic, had resorted to using thyme for self-care in response to this new virus. Ingested as an infusion, used culinarily, or applied as a body oil, information about the use of thyme for COVID-19 was readily communicated among family and friends through WhatsApp. During the first peak of the pandemic (spring 2020), a botánica (shop selling Caribbean remedies for health and wellbeing) in the Bronx reported selling much greater volumes online of eucalyptus, chamomile, and anamú (Petiveria alliacea L.), to treat COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, fever, and trouble breathing, together with other plants that allegedly ease anxiety. In an 8-min home video shared on Facebook, a Jamaican-American woman demonstrated how to make ""Corona-shots"" by blending common Caribbean kitchen ingredients (turmeric, lemon, ginger, onion, garlic, cayenne pepper, apple cider vinegar, and honey). These examples show how plant knowledge has found its way to effective and rapid audio-visual transmission pathways (phone, internet, printed media) during this health crisis, fostering community resilience and agency.The general population lacked appropriate information about COVID-19, and the negligence of the government made the situation very dangerous. In the period of confinement, it was crucial for inhabitants to envision alternatives in order to keep the mind healthy and also to strengthen their physical and emotional well-being. In addition to respiratory symptoms caused by COVID-19, locals suffered often from anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia. We could observe that plants sought after were those most commonly used in the treatment of a regular flu. Lavender was used in the form of tea or for steam inhalations, as a decongestant and sedative; lemongrass, erva cidreira (Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E.Br. ex Britton & P.Wilson), pitanga (Eugenia uniflora L.), garlic, and ginger have been used in the form of tea and were often associated with the ubiquitous lemon. Chamomile and passion fruit were utilized against insomnia and anxiety, while guaco (Mikania cordifolia (L. f.) Willd.) was widely used in the form of syrups, as well as inhame (taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) tubers, which were eaten (cooked or raw) to increase immune defenses.Participants acknowledged over 60 taxa (including plants, fungi, animals, and bacteria) used in response to the pandemic, 29 of which are native to the Appalachian region. Many of the cited uses originated with indigenous communities, while other uses were introduced later through different folkways or popular media. These uses of plants (and fungi) mainly fell into three general categories: (1) consumed to stimulate the immune system (such as native reishi mushrooms (Ganoderma spp.), (2) used as a specific antiviral (such as elderberry, Sambucus spp.), and (3) ingested for general health (vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial compounds, or for microbiome enhancement) to strengthen and protect the body during the pandemic (such as wild-collected ramps, Allium trichoccum Aiton). One recurring theme from participants was ""going back to the traditional ways,"" whether that was directly stated or implied based on the items and behaviors they cited. Some explained that they and many others who retained the ""old ways"" felt a deeper value and appreciation for these traditions, and people would come to them more frequently for information during the pandemic. Some of the older generation even paired with the younger to create social media platforms, online video channels, and community-organizing efforts in direct response to these increased needs and inquiries. This may exemplify the principle of ""dormant ethnobotany,"" whereby enduring ethnobiological traditions-like a seed bank of knowledge-experience a greater re-emergence, catalyzed by the need to sustain life, well-being, and livelihoods. This emphasizes the importance of documenting traditional ethnobiological knowledge and protecting biological and cultural diversity in responsible ways.Until early August 2020, Jamaica had less than 1000 confirmed COVID-19 infections and 13 associated fatalities, the majority occurring in urban areas (surrounding the capital and a call center in a neighboring parish), while fewer cases had been recorded in rural areas. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, there were more preliminary reports of COVID-19 plant remedies from urban than rural Jamaicans. Rapid inquiry tallied 31 species reported by 17 Jamaicans to prevent COVID-19, of which most plants (23) were common Caribbean foods used as seasonings, vegetables, homemade fruit juices, or hot beverages (teas), the most popular being ginger, sour or Seville orange, garlic, lime, turmeric, and bissy (kola nut, Cola acuminata (P.Beauv.) Schott & Endl.). Cultural explanations for preventing COVID-19 infection emphasized plant remedies that were already known by Jamaicans to (1) treat the common cold, flu, or fever (known as virus remedies); (2) ""boost the immune system;"" (3) ""fight inflammation;"" (4) ""warm up the body;"" (5) ""remove toxins;"" (6) prevent blood clotting; (7) provide vitamins (especially vitamin C); or (8) In the countryside, the Andean population widely believes that a traditional diet based on chuño (freeze dried potato) and kaya (freeze dried Oxalis tuberosa Molina) provides immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the population in the lowlands, where the incidence of COVID-19 is highest, does not make any links between the benefits of traditional foods and the prevention and treatment of the virus. Although there are policies that recognize the importance of traditional medicine, none include food. For the prevention of COVID-19, the Ministry for ""traditional"" medicine has widely promoted in the media the consumption of herbal teas or the inhalation of steam from preparations of introduced species like chamomile, cypress (Cupressus sargentii Jeps.), lemongrass, and eucalyptus. Teas of native species, especially Achyrocline alata (Kunth) DC., have also been employed. Steam mixtures of these species are being used in ""disinfection chambers"" at the entrances of public markets, demonstrating great ignorance of the correct application of these species for the prevention of COVID-19. The consumption of onions, garlic, citrus fruits, ginger, and turmeric to strengthen the immune system during the pandemic has recently been promoted in many social networks.In rural Romania, the intensity of security and sanitary measures imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been inversely related to the degree of isolation of rural communities. Moreover, many city inhabitants spent the COVID-19 ""lockdown"" in isolated rural areas. The media has had a large influence on social awareness of the pandemic's effects, and people have started to reshape their daily habits related to domestic (plant-based) food medicines by increasing their consumption, especially of herbal teas and healthy plant-based foods perceived to counteract the respiratory symptoms of flu or to enhance immunity. Different species of wild thyme and mint, as well as the buds of European silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) or pine (Pinus spp.) have been used in teas, syrups, or as extracts mixed with honey or propolis tinctures to treat or prevent common respiratory symptoms of any flu. Furthermore, sea buckthorn (Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A.Nelson) stored in honey is usually consumed in the morning before any meal. Garlic, onion, shallot, garden parsley, stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.), fat hen (Chenopodium album L.), sorrel (Rumex acetosa L.), and ramsons (Allium ursinum L.) are normally consumed in high amounts in spring, either raw in salads or in soups (garden parsley in juices or smoothies), and they are considered healthy foods with a role in preventing colds and enhancing immunity.Based on Google Trends searches, we saw a fairly high surge of interest in information about homemade remedies against the coronavirus starting around February 2020. This has declined since an initial peak in April as lockdowns have eased, but still remained popular in July and early August 2020. Around mid-February 2020, study participants started to actively create discussion threads on Facebook groups, sharing all kinds of treatments and preventive measures for COVID-19. At the same time, propaganda in social media by ""COVID deniers"" was quite popular in the study area as well. During the outbreak, participants shared more recipes for medicinal plants than healthy plant-based foods used in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. This is due to the common availability of medicinal plants and because print and digital sources play a major role in transmitting ethnomedical knowledge. Plants that were commonly mentioned include licorice, black elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.), and nettle (Urtica dioica L.).Compared to Poland and Belarus, the most diverse pattern of using food as medicine was documented in Lithuania. Since the announcement of the official lockdown, Internet discussion increased about herbal remedies and medicinal foods that can be used for cough and fever, linking these symptoms with COVID-19. In pandemic news discussion forums, people mostly shared ways on how to boost the immune system. During the pandemic, professional herbalists played a key role in popularizing traditional antiviral remedies, creating an aura of therapeutic credibility around homemade plantbased foods and beverages. They actively promoted the use of plants and honeybee products for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. The most frequently reported species were garlic, nettle, and Tropaeolum majus L.Health discussions around ""miracle cures"" and prevention of the coronavirus through medicinal foods have been drawing on traditional narratives of danger and local ethnomedical knowledge. In Belarus, no official lockdown was announced. State-owned media provided scarce news coverage and limited promotion of plant food medicines compared to Poland and Lithuania. Yet, the effectiveness of promoting lemon and ginger in official media discourse increased their demand and price in the spring of 2020. On the other hand, local community members preferred the remedies of the Soviet pharmacopoeia in this crisis situation. Therefore, based on our observations, people were forced to return to their former experience of preventing acute respiratory infections with homemade plant-based foods and beverages. The most important use-subcategories reported were raw vegetables, berry compotes, alcoholic beverages, honeybee products, and fungi, especially chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus (Fr.) Pilát), which is often perceived as a plant in folk categorization.Although a cradle for crop wild relatives, the shift from ancient cultivars to modern high-yielding crops such as maize and potato, and the educational indoctrination of the population that eroded traditional knowledge under Soviet occupation, have profoundly changed the concept of local medicine in Georgia. Self-medication during COVID-19 has been largely based on Central European herbal remedies that had previously been promoted during Soviet times. Food plant use in response to SARS-CoV-2 was restricted to syrups and teas prepared from well-known species like onion, chili, chamomile, radish, coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara L.), Koch's pine (Pinus kochiana Klotzsch ex K. Koch), rose, and elecampane (Inula helenium L.). In rare cases, teas (regarded as food) made from wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.), Pyrethrum parthenifolium Willd., Salvia verticillata L., Rhododendron caucasicum Pall., Rubus spp., Sambucus ebulus L., and Viburnum opulus L. have been used to alleviate flu symptoms and fever.Using edible plants as a means of healing goes hand in hand with the belief that healing comes from nature and that what is wild is healthier. In Eastern Turkey, some edible plants, such as Anchusa spp., and Allium spp., which are collected in the spring, are consumed both as a food and for medicinal purposes (to increase immune defenses). In particular, local people drink herbal tea prepared with the fruits of Rosa canina L. to treat or prevent common respiratory symptoms and increase immune defenses, and drink a cold beverage made with the roots of licorice as an immune stimulant. The use of linden (Tilia spp.) and Malvaceae (Alcea and Althaea spp.) was also recorded in cases of possible COVID-19 symptoms (shortness of breath and cough). Our observations show that mint, oregano, thyme, and Thymbra spp., which are generally consumed as spices in the study area, have also been used in herbal teas to treat or prevent common respiratory symptoms of any flu, and that mint species have been used as incense as well. In addition, Salvia multicaulis Vahl was recorded as an herbal tea for respiratory diseases. Finally, the fruits of Celtis tournefortii Lam. were fried, crushed and powdered, and prepared in a mixture with honey or molasses, which is eaten to boost the immune system.Pashtuns in this area live in close contact with nature and have thus utilized plants and other natural products during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was experienced, observed, and heard that not only the use of certain vegetables and fruits considered beneficial increased significantly during the pandemic, i.e., lemon, banana, ginger, garlic, onion, cucumber, apple, peach, cherry, plum, apricot, and date, but that their demand and prices increased in the market as well. Certain spices, like turmeric, nigella, senna (Cassia angustifolia Vahl), and licorice, went out of stock in certain markets for a while, despite continuous supply during lockdowns. People believe that some of these are immune boosters, while other plants are considered bronchodilators. A few individuals reported using an interesting mixture of powdered almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, nigella, poppy seeds, and the resin of Dalbergia sissoo DC., mixed with brown sugar. Some interviewees also reported drinking various herbal teas, especially one prepared with the fruit epicarp of poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) alone, or in combination with ginger, before going to bed.Cambodians have been vigilant in their efforts to minimize potential virus transmission, despite having low numbers of COVID-19 cases nation-wide in comparison to other Southeast Asian nations. As of the beginning of August 2020, 243 cases were recorded and no people have died. Eighty-nine percent of COVID-19 cases were foreign nationals visiting Cambodia or Khmer nationals returning from abroad. Drawing from various sources such as Facebook, YouTube, and word-ofmouth from peers, Cambodians have been re-orienting their diets to include more diverse foods typically designated as immune-boosting and having a humoral ""hot"" quality within Traditional Khmer Medicine. According to various interviewees from rural villages in Siem Reap Province, foods which have been circulated as a prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 include ginger (most common), garlic, chili (Capsicum annuum, ""bird's eye""), salt, lemon, hard-boiled eggs, dried salted fish, and rice porridge. While some of these foods have been incorporated into other dishes, many of them have been consumed as teas. High interest in ginger during the pandemic has caused spikes in its pricing at local market stands and corner shops. As one Cambodian woman explained, ""it [ginger] is normally 4000 riels (1 USD), but now the price has gone up almost five-fold during the pandemic…very expensive!"".All individuals interviewed in Alice, South Africa, perceived the importance of recreational and herbal teas, which were considered ""healthy"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of used plant species were prepared as recreational teas. Rooibos (Aspalanthus linearis (Burm.f.) R. Dahlgren) was the herbal tea mentioned by all participants, while regular tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze), and tea of Lippia javanica (Burm.f.) Spreng., Cyclopia spp., Fadogia ancylantha Schweinf., and ginger were cited by nearly half of all interviewees. Herbal teas were regarded as an important category of hot beverage that was essential during the COVID-19 outbreak, being consumed for their sedative or stimulant effects, and also for their pleasant flavor or aroma.Additional file 3 provides a detailed overview of 193 plant taxa from 69 families used in the 17 selected countries, regions, or cities. Thirty-seven taxa had a cumulative relative importance (RI) equal to, or higher than, 0.5. Of these taxa, eighteen were used in at least three regions. Combining these two criteria (RI value and number of regions) highlights the ten most important taxa used as home-remedies during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic across all 17 case studies (Table  1) .Since the onset of the COVID-19 health crisis, many communities around the world seem to have gone back to relying on their domestic remedies while public health services collapsed, as happened, sadly, in the municipal areas of Lombardy and Milan, Madrid, and New York City.Our preliminary assessment shows that the pandemic has widely reinforced the relevance and use of medicinal plants and healthy foods as home remedies, even in large cities, whereby local traditions and ""imported"" practices based on the use of ""new"" plant remedies can hybridize and coexist. For example, in Spain, turmeric and ginger did not exist in the traditional local pharmacopoeias, but these ""imported"" remedies now coexist with indigenous plants that have been locally cultivated or gathered with a long history of use, such as lemon and thyme.The different types of domestic preparations that community members reported to prevent or treat COVID-19 are those that were formerly known to cope with the flu The RI (relative importance) value was calculated as the proportion of people (or Internet posts for Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland) mentioning a plant species in each case study (by country, city, or region). The cumulative RI value represents the sum over all case studies and other respiratory illnesses or symptoms, including the following:Folk remedies and foods specifically aimed at preventing illnesses; Folk remedies and foods for strengthening the body, a health strategy that has been described until a few decades ago as ""the reconstitution effect"", or more recently in the modern narrative as ""boosting the immune system""; Folk remedies directly used for alleviating respiratory symptoms.Our case studies from around the world highlight the following important findings:Plant-based domestic teas, other beverages, and foods ""of the past"" (known as folk or traditional medicines) represent the initial community health response in times of uncertainty, and when public health services are under pressure;The consumption of certain plant foods (most notably garlic and ginger, but also onion, lemon, and turmeric) has remarkably increased in response to COVID-19; Some homemade remedies have been popularized via the Internet and social media, notably (but not exclusively) among younger community members. Therefore, these pathways of information dissemination, and sources of sharing of ideas at the community level, warrant further study as a platform for the targeted transmission of information supporting community health; Health behavior responses such as these are relevant, not only because they involve bioactive ""phytochemicals,"" but, more importantly, because they foster social cohesion, agency, and resilience, or a sense of belonging, hereby positively impacting mental and social well-being, which is a crucial part of health according to the WHO definition [12]; These folk responses need to be urgently evaluated within the context of the pandemic, not only for their possible bioactivity and pharmacological properties (as immunomodulators, anti-flu, and cough-relieving agents), but foremost for their diverse cultural meanings and importance; In order to maintain resilience in times of crises, communities need to stay properly informed by government agencies, their public spokespeople, and the media, who should collaborate closely with the scientific community to communicate new information about these food medicines in clear, evidence-based, and unambiguous ways.","South Africa","abstract","2020-12-09",12

Indeed, the disease is unleashing an unforetold devastation on social, economic and political lives of many Nations which will take a long time to resolve.The virus attacks the respiratory tract system of the host. Genetic analysis by sequencing indicates that the virus is a betacoronavirus closely linked to the SARS virus [1] . As at now, there is no known specific, effective, proven and pharmacological treatment for COVID-19. However, scientists are working hard to find antivirals specific to the virus. It must be emphasized that the long-term strategy to combat COVID-19 would be to develop a vaccine. This may take some time, as the vaccine must be rigorously tested and its safety confirmed through clinical trials before routine use in humans. In the meantime, drugs for the management of the symptoms of the disease are urgently needed.Many different treatment options have been proposed including the use of drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol and remdesivir among others [2] . These drugs are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety in the treatment of the COVID-19. With regard to chloroquine, in vitro studies indicate that the drug is effective in reducing viral replication in infections including the SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV) and MERS-CoV [3] [4] [5] .Although largely undocumented, it is speculated that substantial amount of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are already being used unofficially as prophylaxis or for the treatment of the symptoms associated with COVID-19. This situation could have a dire consequences on management of malaria, as chloroquine-resistant parasites may increase, with a possible cross resistance to amodiaquine. This article, therefore, seeks to discuss the possible effect of the increased indiscriminate use of the drug on malaria management with some artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as well as intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) containing amodiaquine as partner drug and give an advice. Hydroxychloroquine is generally used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis in addition to malaria. It is known to regulate the activity of the immune system, which may be overly active in some conditions. It does so by modifying the underlying disease process, rather than treating the symptoms.In the immediate past, chloroquine was the firstline drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in disease endemic areas of the world and also used for the treatment of extra-intestinal amebiasis. However, towards the end of the 20th century, the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, developed serious resistance to chloroquine.Due to the reported widespread parasite resistance to the drug, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended its replacement with the ACTs as the first antimalarial drug of choice. This led to the dwindling use of chloroquine. Currently, chloroquine is used for mono-therapy of malaria only in countries such as Honduras where there are no reported parasite resistance to the drug.Resistance to chloroquine is associated with specific genetic point mutation at various codons in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene [6] [7] [8] and is modulated by mutations in the P. falciparum multidrug resistance locus 1 (pfmdr1) [7] . Substitution of adenylate with cytidylate at position 76 of pfcrt gene which changes lysine to threonine (K76 to T76) is a single molecular marker that strongly correlates with chloroquine drug resistance in P. falciparum [9, 10] . The mutations in codons 76 (pfcrt, K76T) and 86 (pfmdr1, N86Y) are therefore important regarding parasite resistance to chloroquine [8, 11] . It has also been reported that other mutations at different codons of the pfcrt gene are associated with chloroquine resistance [9, 11, 12] . Drug pressure driven by high chloroquine usage in an area is a major determinant of selection and spread of chloroquine-resistant genes among P. falciparum population [10, 11] .Interestingly, disuse of chloroquine as the firstline antimalarial drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in certain endemic areas resulted in the re-appearance of strains of parasites sensitive to the drug [13] [14] [15] . This situation gives hope that sooner than later, chloroquine, which is one of the safe and cheapest antimalarial drugs, may be re-considered in a combination-therapy rather than in monotherapeutic use in the management of malaria.Since the onset and spread of COVID-19, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been touted as a possible cure or chemoprevention of the novel disease. The rationale for the choice of these drugs against COVID-19 is based on the reported increased in the endosomal pH which inhibits fusion of the SARS-CoV-2 and the host cell membranes [16] . In vitro, 'both drugs block the transport of SARS-CoV-2 from early endosomes to endolysosomes, which may be required for release of the viral genome' [17] .Reports touting chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as potential treatment for COVID-19 mostly carried out by the international press have led to a dramatic increase in demand and supply of the drugs. Chloroquine, which has been banned in many malaria endemic countries, and hydroxychloroquine have suddenly surfaced and it is being use as treatment or prophylaxis against COVID-19.It is important to state that, lately, the publicity given to these drugs for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of COVID-19 has dwindled due to the reported side effect and efficacy of the drugs in the management of COVID-19. The FDA has released a report indicating serious problems with the treatment of COVID-19 with these drugs. Heart rhythm problems, blood system disorders and kidney injuries among others have been reported to be associated with hospitalized patients treated with the drugs [18] . In his media briefing on COVID-19 on 25 May 2020, the WHO Director-General announced the suspension of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from Solidarity trial because of their safety and efficacy concerns [19] . The WHO decision was based on reports from ongoing clinical trials. However from news reports globally, this announcement seemed not to have abated the demand and use of the drug for the management of COVID-19, especially in economically poor settings where most of the burden of malaria happens to situate and the fear of contracting COVID-19 is likely to be high.The usual chloroquine dose for the treatment of malaria for an adult weighing least 60 kg is: 1 g salt (600 mg base) orally as an initial dose, followed by 500 mg salt (300 mg base) orally after 6-8 h, then 500 mg salt (300 mg base) orally once a day on the next 2 consecutive days.Treatment or chemoprophylaxis regime using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 varies. Usually, the adult dose used against the disease is 1 g salt (600 mg base) orally on Day 1, followed by 500 mg salt (300 mg base) orally once a day for a total duration of 4-7 days depending on clinical evaluation.It is obvious from these dose regimes that quite a substantial amount of the drug is used in the management of COVID-19. It is speculated that, in some places, very high doses of chloroquine and its derivative are used indiscriminately for chemoprevention and treatment of COVID-19. Such practices must be discouraged through intense and sustained education as continuation may lead possibly to serious health implications.It is important to state that the reason for the choice of ACTs to treat malaria is to slow down the development of resistance to the antimalarial drugs involved [21] . The principle behind the combination is that, the fast-acting drug, which is the artemisinin, quickly reduces the parasite load whilst the slow acting, partner antimalarial, gradually mob up the residue parasites [22] . The potency of the ACTs is therefore dependent on the efficacy of both the artemisinin component and the partner drug. Therefore, reduced susceptibility of parasites to the partner drugs in the ACTs can potentiate the development of resistance to the artemisinin with time. Amodiaquine is a partner drug in one of the ACTs (artesunate-amodiaquine, AS-AQ). This combination is one of the most popular choice of ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria because of cost and ease of administration. Amodiaquine is also a partner in combined drugs used in the management of malaria in interventional preventive measures, recommended for specific high-risk groups in areas of high malaria transmission. For instance, in 2013, WHO recommended the use of amodiaquine in combination with sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine (SP-AQ) for seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) in children at high risk areas. SMC is defined as 'the intermittent administration of full treatment courses of an antimalarial medicine during the malaria season to prevent malarial illness with the objective of maintaining therapeutic antimalarial drug concentrations in the blood throughout the period of greatest malarial risk'. This intervention has been shown to be effective, cost-effective, safe and feasible for preventing malaria among children younger than 5 years of age in areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission.Amodiaquine is also used in combination with SP for intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) in some disease endemic countries. IPTp reduces maternal malaria episodes, placental, maternal and foetal anaemia, parasitaemia, low birth weight and neonatal mortality.Increased use of chloroquine to manage COVID-19 is likely to trigger the development and emergence of strains of malaria parasites resistant to chloroquine. In addition to the mechanism of parasites resistance to chloroquine described above, there could be subsequent selection of additional changes in genes regulating P. falciparum response to chloroquine [23, 24] . Such situations will favour crossresistance between chloroquine and amodiaquine, which is part of some ACTs and IPT in many disease endemic areas [23] [24] [25] .It can therefore be conjuncture that the indiscriminate and escalated use of chloroquine or it analogies to manage COVID-19 may impact negatively on amodiaquine efficacy due to structural similarities. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and amodiaquine are all derivatives of the drug classified as 4-aminoquinoline. 4-Aminoquinoline have an amino group at 4position of the quinoline moiety. Amodiaquine differ from chloroquine by only a side chain (Fig. 1) . Therefore, the possibility of cross resistance between chloroquine or its derivatives and amodiaquine is very high.Indeed, there are numerous reports in literature indicating cross resistance between chloroquine and amodiaquine. Various in vitro parasite sensitivity assays attest to this: work carried out in India by AnupKumar, et al. [26] , in Philippines by Smrkovski, et al. [27] , in Senegal by Diawara, et al. [28] , and in Colombia by Fall, et al. [29] , in South America by Young [30] and in Gabon by Pradines, et al. [31] .It must however be noted that a significant positive correlation suggesting in vitro cross-resistance may not necessarily be predictive of cross-resistance in vivo. Nevertheless, information on in vitro crossresistance of one compound to an existing antimalarial is important as it becomes a potential indicator of future resistance: a marker or an early warning sign of an emerging parasite resistance, especially when chemical structures of the compounds involved are similar.Therefore, as the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine increases, the possibility of amodiaquine losing it current potency due to the aforementioned phenomenon is eminent.Such an occurrence may lead to increased failure of the AS-AQ combination and a more serious consequences on the IPT used for pregnant women and children (SP-AQ), especially in areas where the efficacy of SP is already weakened. Again, under such circumstances, the planned future use of chloroquine in the management of malaria in the manner previously described [32] is likely to be jeopardized.All put together, it must be said that the escalated use of chloroquine and its derivatives to manage COVID-19 is likely to be problematic for the control of malaria using some of the existing control drugs schemes. Measures must therefore be put in place to monitor and control the use of chloroquine and its derivatives to manage COVID-19 to avert these expectancies. There is the need to continuously monitor the efficacy of amodiaquine in disease endemic settings where it is used.It is quite worrying, as the increased use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to manage COVID-19 disease will lead to increased drug pressure and consequently the selection of drug-resistant parasite, as happened in the era preceding the introduction of the ACTs. Resistant strains of the malaria parasites to chloroquine or derivatives with cross-resistance to amodiaquine are likely to appear due to increased drug pressure as a consequence of the escalated use of the drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or it derivative to manage COVID-19 must therefore be strictly controlled. Education of the general populace on the issues associated with the use of the drugs must be done. There is also the need to constantly monitor the efficacy of amodiaquine in disease endemic countries.","Ghana","first author","2020-12-27",12
