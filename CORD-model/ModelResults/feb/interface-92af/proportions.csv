Sforcin [12] reported the safety profile of the propolis as a nontoxic compound to humans or mammals with DL50 ranged from 2 to 7.3 g/kg in mice; however for humans DL50 reached 1.4 mg/kg (∼70 mg/day).Novelty impeded in the present work is that propolis samples from different Egyptian geographical areas were collected and comparative chemical composition was conducted through analytical and chromatographic methods with concomitant to the anti-COVID-19 activity. Propolis samples were examined using scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM-6390LV (USA). Each sample was oven dried (105˚C/45 min), then coated with metallic gold ions and stored in plastic boxes, which were sealed with parafilm (PARAFILM 1M) to prevent moisture absorption and left at room temperature for 24 h. The samples were then analyzed at different magnifications (Voltage 12 kV, Working Distance 12 mm, Spot size 44, Vacuum Mode HV) [13] .Propolis samples were chopped into small pieces and extracted (20% w/v) by maceration with ethanol (99.9%) for 7 days in the dark with continuous stirring followed by sonification for one hour at 70 • C [14] then filtered through a Whatman filter paper No. 1 and the extracts were stored in a dark jar at 4 • C for further analysis.Qualitative method Standard procedures were used to determine the presence or absence of different secondary metabolites of propolis ethanolic extracts such as phenolic compounds, terpenoids, steroids, flavonoids, tannins and glycosides [15] .Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of different propolis samples About 2 mg of the propolis ethanolic extract was dissolved in 20 μl dry pyridine, then 30 μl N,0bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) were added. The mixture was heated at 80 • C for 20 min and diluted with 100 μl pyridine then each sample was analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Compounds identification was done using computer search user-generated reference libraries, incorporating mass spectra (Wiley 138 and Nist 98 libraries) [16] .In the current study, molecular docking was performed to predict the binding affinity of the test compounds toward the target enzymes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Spike protein S1 and main protease (3CLpro, or 3-chymotrypsin-like protease). This study could describe mode of binding of screened compounds to the active site of target macromolecules and type of interactions of different conformations. The scoring function (S) could compute the binding energy to select orientations with the lowest energy state. It also could be used as indicator of relative strength of interactions with the active site [17] .Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software was utilized in all the docking experiments, with the x-ray crystal structures of the docking targets; optimized SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 7BTF), SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein S1 (PDB ID: 6VW1) and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6Y2G) models were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) website.Molecular docking results are often validated using a training set of experimental ligand-protein complexes, and the accuracy of these docking programs is mainly dependent on the used training set [18] . Due to the lack of known ligands, it is important to ensure that the used software is able to replicate the binding mode of a known experimental inhibitor for the studied enzymes. Although neither an effective antiviral drug nor a vaccine against COVID-19 is currently available, several reports have indicated that RdRp inhibitors (remdesivir), influenza glycoproteins inhibitors (umifenovir), in addition to HIV-1 protease inhibitors (lopinavir) have the potential for designing active SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors [19, 20] . In the attempt to have reference values (positive control), remdesivir, umifenovir and lopinavir antiviral drugs were considered as comparative standards for the molecular docking.Propolis used in the present study was collected from different geographic areas namely: Alexandria, Tanta and Menoufia. Alexandria and Menoufia propolis were dark brown while Tanta propolis was light brown. Propolis classification showed variations according to the botanical origin due to the difference in the dominant pollen grains [21] . Pollen grain analysis was investigated according to Temizer et al. [21] , which revealed the relatedness of Alexandria propolis to the family Cyperaceae (that was occasionally found in Tanta propolis) while that of Tanta and Menoufia were related to the family Asteraceae.Scanning electron microscopic analysis of the propolis samples under test ( Figure 1A -C) showed 3D structures and morphological features of the propolis samples. It was revealed that no foreign materials were detected and wrinkled surfaces covered with wax layers were observed. Table 1 . Qualitative chemical analysis of the propolis samples.GlycosidesThe qualitative chemical analysis for the tested propolis samples showed variations among the samples that were geographically different. Steroids were not detected in all the tested samples. In the present study a detailed investigation on the composition of the Egyptian propolis collected from specific areas was analyzed (Table 1) .On referring the results of the present work to the data base with the corresponding acquisition time (Figures 2A-C), 26 compounds have been identified. It was revealed that the common detected components in the tested extracts were heptacosane, octacosanol and pinocembrin that were in average concentrations except for that of Menoufia and Alexandria propolis, respectively ( Table 2 ). The presence of unusual substances such as sterol precursors and some alcohols may be due to the different geographic areas of propolis in Egypt.Anti-COVID-19 activity using molecular docking In the current study, molecular docking was performed to predict the binding affinity of the test compounds toward the target enzymes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, spike protein S1 and main protease ( Table 3) . Results of the docking studies showed that most compounds possessed promising binding scores, in addition to excellent binding manner with the active site of target macromolecules in comparison to the reference antiviral drugs remdesivir, lopinavir and umifenovir. The binding interactions of test compounds were investigated to study their modes of binding and orientations related to their antiviral activity.Considering RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibition screening, interestingly, octacosane, heptacosane, hexadecaneperoxoic acid, 1,1-dimethyl-3-[(1-oxohexadecyl) oxy] propyl ester, oxalic acid, dodecyl 2-phenylethyl ester, octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate and octacosanol possessed remarkable binding scores higher than the reference remdesivir. While, heneicosane, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester, octadecane, 3-ethyl-5-(2-ethylbutyl) and Pregn-5-en-20one, 11-(acetyloxy)-3,14-dihydroxy-12-(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxobutoxy)-, (3β,11α,12β,14β) showed significant binding scores which are quite similar to remdesivir ( Table 3 ). The binding site of RdRp was explored computationally, which provides some insights in the discovery of antiviral drugs. The interaction of RdRp with the reference drug remdesivir showed hydrogen bond interaction with Glu167, Asp618, Lys621 and Lys798 ( Figure 3A ). Docking results for octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate declared that this compound is well oriented inside the enzyme pockets and showed hydrogen bond interaction with Lys798 ( Figure 3B ).Results of spike protein inhibition screening indicated that most compounds exhibited significant binding scores similar to those exhibited by the reference drug umifenovir. n-hexadecanoic acid, heneicosane, octacosane, heptacosane, hexadecaneperoxoic acid, 1,1-dimethyl-3-[(1-oxohexadecyl)oxy]propyl ester, oxalic acid, dodecyl 2-phenylethyl ester, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester, octacosanol, octadecane, octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate and 3-ethyl-5-(2-ethylbutyl) showed the best scoring results (higher than Umifenovir). While, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester, pinostrobin chalcone, trans-13-octadecenoic acid, estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one, 3- hydroxy-2-methoxy, pregn-5-en-20-one, 11-(acetyloxy)-3,14-dihydroxy-12-(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxobutoxy)-, (3β,11α,12β,14β) and cyclohexamine, N-n-butyl-1-[2-thionaphthenyl] possessed comparable binding scores to umifenovir. The interaction of spike protein S1 with the reference drug Arbidol R (umifenovir) revealed hydrogen bond interaction with Phe456, in addition to hydrophobic interaction with Lys458 and Asn481 ( Figure 4A ). Docking results for octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate showed hydrogen bond interaction with Asp420, in addition to H-arene interaction with Tyr505 ( Figure 4B ).Regarding main protease enzyme, octacosane, hexadecaneperoxoic acid, octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate and 1,1-dimethyl-3-[(1-oxohexadecyl)oxy] propyl ester showed the highest binding scores and good binding profile in comparison to the reference drugs lopinavir.The interaction of 3CLpro with the reference drug KALETRA R (lopinavir) displayed hydrogen bond interaction with Glu166 and hydrophobic interaction with Thr26 and Asn142 ( Figure 5A ). Docking results for octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate revealed hydrogen bond interaction with Met49 ( Figure 5B ).In the present study, Egyptian propolis samples were analyzed and investigated for their anti-COVID-19 activity using molecular docking. Pollen grain analysis was investigated according to Temizer et al. [22] which revealed that the family Cyperaceae was dominant in Alexandria propolis while family Asteraceae was dominant in Tanta and Menoufia propolis samples. Scanning electron microscope analysis of propolis samples revealed that all the propolis samples have a putative gel like morphology. Rahim et al. [23] stated that the propolis samples with a homogenized flat topography (with intervals of flaking out and crumpled-like surface topography) may act as building blocks of the hive. Further chemical analysis was applied on the propolis samples, which revealed that the presence of tannins, phenols and steroids varies among the samples which prove that the propolis composition differs according to the correspondence area and the environmental conditions including flora [24] . GC/MS analysis revealed that acids were the main component in the propolis samples. Hegazi et al. [24] reported that the characteristic groups Table 3 . The binding scores of test compounds toward three protein targets (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, spike protein S1 and main protease) from 2019-nCoV. of poplar propolis were aliphatic, aromatic acids, aromatic acid esters and flavonoids and it was characterized by the presence of some triterpenoids. Ibrahim et al. [25] found that 11 phenolic compounds in propolis samples that were collected from Abees Apiculture Unit, Agricultural Research Farm, University of Alexandria, Alexandria.The phenolic compounds were identified as pinostrobin; izalpinin; tectochrysin; pinocembrin; galangin; chrysin; quercetin-3,3 -di-O-methyl ether; kaempferol-3-O-methyl ether; quercetin-3,7-di-O-methyl ether; isoferulic acid; and galangin-5-O-methyl ether that were not detected in Alexandria propolis (collected from newly reclaimed lands) that was investigated in the present study ( Figure 2A & Table 2 ) which confirmed the relatedness between the chemical constituents, the botanical origin and the seasonal variations.In the current study, molecular docking was performed to predict the binding affinity [26] of the propolis compounds toward RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, spike protein S1 and main protease ( Table 3 ). Most of the tested fractions showed promising binding scores in relation to the reference antiviral drugs namely: remdesivir, lopinavir and umifenovir. In a trial to investigate the binding interactions of the tested fractions; the modes of binding and orientations were investigated in relation to their antiviral activity. Octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate showed hydrogen bond interaction with Lys798, Asp420 and Met49, in addition to H-arene interaction with Tyr505 inside RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, spike protein S1 and main protease enzymes pockets, respectively.Data from the present study concluded that Egyptian propolis samples proved to have variable chemical composition according to the botanical origin and geographical distribution. Menoufia propolis reported high anti-COVID-19activity in relation to the tested BSAA and it is recommended as a promising candidate in the combat against the pandemic COVID-19.• The present study aimed to investigate the prospective anti-COVID-19 activity of Egyptian propolis.• Propolis samples were collected from different Egyptian geographic areas.• Qualitative and quantitative propolis analyses were evaluated. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry proved the presence of octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate (4.2%). • Computational modeling of propolis fractions was evaluated in relation to some known antiviral drugs namely: remdesivir, lopinavir and umifenovir. • Most of the tested compounds showed a promising binding score.• Docking analyses declared that octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate is well oriented inside the enzyme pockets and showed hydrogen bond interaction with Lys798, in addition to excellent binding manner with the active site of the target macromolecules (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Spike protein S1 and main protease) in relation to some broad-spectrum antiviral agents. • Menoufia propolis could be recommended as a promising candidate in the combat against the pandemic COVID-19.Financial & competing interests disclosure","Egypt","first author","2021-02-01",2

Making the identification and prioritization of individuals most at risk a critical challenge.The pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and the associated respiratory failure are still unclear, but the higher mortality is consistently tied to older age and being male. Further, people with underlying health conditions are more likely to develop severe COVID-19, including hypertension, diabetes, being obese, and cardiovascular disease [1] . Biological factors that determine susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and severity of COVID-19 are yet to be fully understood. Many studies have implicated that the ABO blood type is a potential risk for various diseases such as cancer, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and venous thromboembolism [2, 3] . The ABO blood grouping may influence the susceptibility of COVID-19 and the severity of the disease [4] . The aim of the study is to study if there is a relationship between the ABO groups and COVID-19 (susceptibility and severity).The study was conducted on 507 COVID-19-confirmed patients admitted in the King Fahd Hospital Almadina Almonoura, KSA, and approved with ethics approval and consent to participate of King Fahd Hospital-Medina, KSA. The written consent from the patients was taken; 401 patients (79%) were admitted in isolation wards while 106 patients (21%) in the ICU, with a mean age ± SD of 54.6 ± 9 with a male to female ratio of 303 (59.7%) and 204 (40.3%), respectively, from the 15 April 2020 to 30 July 2020.All patients underwent the following: Inclusion criteria:-Any COVID-19 patient agrees to participate in the study Exclusion criteria:-The age of COVID-19 patient is less than 18 years. Mild low risk 280 (76.5%) 6 (40%) 9 (50%) 3 An analysis, using SPSS version 12, was performed with respect to the main study aim. Descriptive characteristics for participants are expressed as means and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, and number and percentage for categorical variables. We used the independent sample test to show the significant difference between the continuous variable and the chi-square test for the categorical variables. The level of significance was accepted at p ≤ 0.05.In Table 1 In Table 2 , there were no significant differences between blood group A and blood group O regarding the age of the patients, male/female, and BMI of the patients [(54.3 ± 9, 55.3 ± 7), (58/42%, 67/33%), (24.7 ± 6, 24.9 ± 8), respectively]. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding smoking index (mild, moderate, and heavy: 34.9/35%, 24.4/22.6%, 16.8/16.5%, respectively) while there was a significant increase in The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) has spread rapidly across the globe and has caused over 1,130,000 confirmed infections and over 62,000 deaths worldwide as of 5 April 2020 [6] . A number of risk factors for COVID-19 infection morbidity and mortality are known, including age, sex, and a number of chronic conditions and laboratory findings [1] . Biological factors that determine susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and severity of COVID-19 are yet to be fully understood. The ABO blood grouping may influence the susceptibility of COVID-19 and severity of the disease [7] . In this study, we found that ABO blood groups have different association risks for the infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19. Specifically, blood group A was associated with an increased risk than blood group O. These findings are consistent with similar risk patterns of ABO blood groups for other coronavirus infections found in previous studies. For example, Cheng et al. reported that the SARS-CoV infection susceptibility in Hong Kong was differentiated by the ABO blood group systems [4] . The authors found that compared with non-O blood group hospital staff, blood group O hospital staff had a lower chance of getting infected. Many studies try to explain, and one study concluded that people with blood group O are able to recognize certain proteins as foreign and that may extend to proteins on virus surfaces so less likely to get a disease [8] . Another one found that anti-A antibodies inhibit binds of glycosylated SARS-COV S protein-expressing cells to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cell surface, so these antibodies may block the interaction between the virus and its receptors thereby providing protection [9] .The activity of ACE2 in blood group B is much higher than in blood group O [10] which leads to catching the virus too much that may explain why critical patient and mortality was higher in blood group B than blood group O.There was a link between blood group A and increase susceptibility of thromboembolism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, recurrent urinary tract infections from E. coli, and H. pylori that can cause ulcers, stomach cancer, and heart diseases [11] so that another cause to explain why high mortality of COVID-19 in blood group A. Lastly there may be other mechanisms underlying why COVID-19 kills some people and spares others. HLAs represent just one in our immune system machinery, though, so their relative influence over COVID-19 infection remains unclear [12] , noted that specific combinations of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, which train immune cells to recognize germs, may be protective against SARS-CoV-2, while other combinations leave the body open to attack. Their analysis identified six HLA types with a high capacity to bind different SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences and three with a low capacity to do so. Specifically, a HLA type known as HLA-B*46:01 had the lowest predicted capacity to bind to bits of SARS-CoV-2 and associated with severe cases of infection. This speculation will need direct studies to prove it.We believe that further longitudinal multi-center studies are highly needed to evaluate the clinical impact of those ABO groups in a single or multivariate analysis as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients.In this study, there was an association between the ABO blood group and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Specifically, people with blood group A have a higher susceptibility and severity whereas people with blood group O have a lower one.People with blood group A:1) Might need strengthened personal protection to reduce the chance of infection. And if infection was caught, might need to close observation and aggressive treatment. 2) It might be helpful to introduce ABO blood typing in the management of COVID-19 infection.

Thus, focusing on improving the workflow of RT-PCR is very essential as it ensures high sensitivity and specificity in clinical settings.One of the most successful attempts in improving diagnostic testing was reported in South Korea. South Korea increased its testing capacity by recruiting domestic companies to provide testing kits, which have shortened the supply leading time drastically [12] . This approach is applicable in countries with biomedical resources and specialized factories, however, many countries either don't have these advancements in the biomedical field or cannot afford the cost.Direct PCR amplification from samples is a technique that could be useful in the current phase of the pandemic. Direct amplification can tremendously shorten (TAT) time and reduce testing costs by eliminating the extraction phase of the samples handling workflow. Moreover, this kind of method reduces the sample handling time which will decrease the probability of contamination across the samples. This method has shown previously promising results in bacterial culture, human cells and plants [13, 14] . Considering the current pandemic, the use of direct RT-PCR offers an interesting solution for laboratories with limited supplies and reagents.In our current study, we provide an alternative method that provides diagnostic results without the need for the RNA extraction step or any additives. This protocol is useful in laboratories with limited resources and infrequent supplies. The direct RT-PCR uses samples stored in VTM directly into the RT-PCR reaction. In our study we evaluated our assay, by comparing it to the nationally validated method in Saudi Arabia, to determine its sensitivity and specificity. Overall, we aim to deliver a cost-effective method for laboratories with supply challenges and that are overwhelmed with mass population samples.Specimens were selected from the diagnostic laboratories at the Saudi Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (SCDC). 185 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs (124 COVID-19 positives and 64 negatives) stored at -80 • C in 2 ml of VTM (Vicell, Spain) were tested by both the indirect RT-PCR method and the direct RT-PCR method. Samples included in our study were collected from regional laboratories across Saudi Arabia. To draw a fair evaluation for our methodology, we choose samples with variation in their cycle threshold (Ct) values.Initially, we aimed to evaluate the appropriate sample volume input in the RT-PCR and the effect of the heating step on the direct technique. Nine samples with Ct values ranged from 18 to 28 selected randomly. A total of 3, 5 and 10 μl of each sample were added respectively to 10 μl of master mix. Also, 40 previously positive samples with different Ct values ranging from 18 to 36 were selected randomly. Aliquots of 100 μl from each VTM were heated in a water bath at 60 • C for 15 min. Then a 3 μl of heat-treated samples and a 3 μl without heating were subjected directly to RT-PCR.For the indirect RT-PCR test, RNA was extracted on the 96 MagNA Pure instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small volume isolation Kit. The extraction protocol was done following the manufacture protocol using 200-μl sample input and producing 50-μl of RNA output. The RNA was then used in one-step RT-PCR, using LightMix R Modular RNA master mix (Roche, Cat. No. 06754155001) with E gene LightMix R as a target (Roche, Cat:53077696) to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, a final reaction volume of 15 μl containing; 5.5 μl of DNAse/RNAse free Water, 0.5 μl of Reagent mix including probes and primers, 4.0 μl of Roche Master Mix, 0.1 μl of RT enzymes and 10 μl of RNA template (samples or control). The RT-PCR reaction was performed on the Light Cycler 480 II instrument (Roche) following the recommended cycling conditions: reverse transcription at 55 • C for 5 min and denatured at 95 • C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of PCR at 95 • C for 5 s, 60 • C for 15 s and 72 • C for 15 s, and then cooled at for 40 • C for 30 s. Samples and control templates (positive and negative) were run in triplicate wells, the Ct value reported was the average of the three wells. A Ct value above 40 was considered a negative result. Direct RT-PCR For our developed protocol, samples that were stored in VTM were vortexed for a minute and 3 μl were then directly used into the RT-PCR LightMix R reaction at the same conditions stated in the indirect RT-PCR method using the LightMix R gene assay.For statistical analysis, data were collected and analyzed using SAS software, version 9.4 and Prism, Version 8.4. Sensitivity and specificity statistical measures were used to compare the indirect RT-PCR results with the direct RT-PCR assay. Tables for the qualitative results were analyzed by agreement confidence intervals, McNamara's test and T Paired test. Boxplots and correlation graphs were used to show the distribution of Ct values between these two methods. All p-values reported are two-sided and were considered to be statistically significant at alpha <0.05.The results of the direct RT-PCR compared with the indirect RT-PCR method as a qualitative test is summarized in Table 1 . Overall the agreement between the direct method and the indirect method was 72% (p < 0.0001), which is considered a moderate-high agreement. The developed direct RT-PCR method reported a sensitivity of 79.34% and specificity of 100%, furthermore, the probability of the negative likelihood was estimated to be 0.20.In the case of the Ct obtained by both methods, quantitative analysis showed late Ct values detected in the direct RT-PCR method compared with the indirect RT-PCR method. The Ct values distribution by methods of detection are shown in Figure 1 , overall lower Ct values were shown in the indirect RT-PCR, which is expected, and the change between the methods was significant (t = 5.93; p < 0.0001). The median Ct value reported in the indirect RT-PCR method was 25 and the median Ct value for the direct RT-PCR method was around 30. The mean of the change obtained in the form of Ct values was 5, which is considered high with 95% confidence intervals of (3.4-6.74). The levels of the Ct values by classification show a lower agreement as shown in Table 2 . The correlation for the cycle threshold for the samples tested by both methods is shown in Figure 2 . The correlation between both methods by Ct values shows a moderate correlation with R 2 = 0.755 (p < 0.0001). This correlation was shown to be the strongest for low Ct value positive samples.For the pilot experiment, adding 3 μl of nine samples showed a better S-shape and steep-slope amplification curve, which are indications of a healthy reaction. The presence of sample inhibitors impedes the RT-PCR reaction and interferes with efficiency, therefore, results in a lower curve slope [15] , and Ct value although the difference in mean Ct value reported was not significant (Supplementary Materials 1.1) . For the heating procedure, 17 samples out of 40 COVID-19 samples showed no significant difference either on Ct value or amplification curve shape. A total 23 sample results showed no amplification curve since their Ct values were >33, therefore we proceeded without the heating step ( Supplementary Materials 1.2 ).Overall, our study indicates that the use of direct RT-PCR provides concordance testing results compared with the indirect RT-PCR method. The developed detection assay had a 79% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These results indicate that direct RT-PCR can be a reliable method in difficult times when the extraction step is not applicable. However, the test showed high false-negative rates in samples with late Ct values. Lower Ct values were reported in the indirect method, which is expected, and the change in Ct values was significant between these two methods (t = 5.93; p < 0.0001). The median Ct value reported by the indirect method was 25 and the median Ct value for the direct method was 30. The Ct values distribution by the two methods shows that in the early Ct value positive samples high agreement was detected, however in samples with late Ct most of the results were negative. Furthermore, in positive samples, a moderate correlation was observed which indicates that although Ct values were significantly different, the two assays were correlated together. The direct RT-PCR method provided good specificity, but its sensitivity is still lacking, however, in times of need, the usage of this test can be useful in terms of TAT and emergency conditions such as lack of supply and pandemic high demand for testing. Direct RT-PCR was validated in a preprint during the COVID-19 pandemic [16] . Investigators reported a high sensitivity of 93% and used samples without VTM, in our study we got less sensitivity which could indicate a PCR inhibition. Another study from Washington University also used a similar method starting with preheating the samples before the RT-PCR, their assay was able to detect 92% of the positive samples [17] . Both studies reported higher sensitivity results for the indirect method than ours; however, both studies used samples with lower Ct values. In our study, sample Ct values were ranged from 14 to 35 to avoid bias. High CT (>33) samples mostly give negative results with direct RT-PCR, which affects the sensitivity value significantly.The Ct value gives an estimate of the amount of target nucleic acid and correlates inversely with viral load, a high Ct value indicates low viral load and vice versa [18] . Higher volume inputs did not improve sensitivity, as with direct RT-PCR the higher the VTM volume the higher the chance of introducing inhibitors as found also in another study [19] . Furthermore, the use of commercial VTMs affects SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza PCR detection as shown in one study [20] . In our direct method, we introduced the VTM components directly into the master mix, which may partially inhibit or interfere with the RT-PCR and cause a delay in Ct values especially samples with low viral load (Ct > 33), which have affected our assay sensitivity.The direct RT-PCR in the application of DNA viral detection has shown promising results in hepatitis B and Mycoplasma organisms [21, 22] . Other studies using direct RT-PCR on detecting viral RNA suggested that the use of PCR enhancers could lead to early RNAase release, which compromises the RNA integrity [23] . PCR inhibition is the leading cause of reporting low testing sensitivity in various fluids, in which some are reported as resistant to heat and demand the extraction step with sample dilution to eliminate the inhibition [24, 25] .The main advantages of using this assay are: shortening the diagnostic test time from 2.5 to 1.5 h, increasing the cost-effectiveness, minimizing hands-on labor, which decreases the probability of contamination, and coping with extraction reagent supply challenges [26] . The importance of our work rises in the time of limited supplies, however, the direct assay can be improved by using adjusted lysis reagent and validating the different types of VTMs as they play an important role in introducing PCR inhibitors. In another recent study to assess direct RT-PCR, they found that by using specific types of VTM and controlled inactivation of the virus, the direct RT-PCR is a viable option [18] . For future work, we aim to assess the different types of VTMs and lysis buffers to improve the sensitivity of our assay.The main limitation of our study is shortage of resources, because of the current time it is hard for many laboratories worldwide to research diagnostic testing. Resources and labors were scarce with high priority for diagnostic testing. The majority of the samples received at the public health laboratories were mostly positive, which could potentially bias the results, but we pooled a sufficient number of negative samples to use in our study. Another limitation of our study is that we used a single gene target to detect the virus, which could have played a role in our high false-negative rate.We were able to perform and evaluate a direct and simple RT-PCR test that does not require extraction or step during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis. The direct RT-PCR approach delivered sufficient results with good concordance with the gold indirect test. Direct RT-PCR could be a valuable solution to identify COVID-19 suspects, although with a lower Ct value, in a shorter time. Therefore, the indirect RT-PCR test could be reserved for individuals with an initial negative result. Our finding provides a simple solution to overcome the RNA extraction supply shortage.• In our study, we proposed the use of direct real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), this test does not require extraction or preheating step, which saves a lot of cost, labor, processing time and provides a solution for supply shortage. • The direct RT-PCR assay was validated by comparing it to the nationally validated method in Saudi Arabia, to determine its sensitivity and specificity. • A total of 185 nasopharyngeal samples stored in validate viral transport media were used for the validation. Both of the indirect RT-PCR protocol, which is based on RNA extraction, and the direct RT-PCR were evaluated on commercially validated SARS-CoV-2 kit targeting E gene. • Overall, the agreement between the direct method and the indirect method was 72% (p < 0.0001), which is considered a moderate agreement. • The developed direct RT-PCR method reported a sensitivity of 79.34% and specificity of 100%.• The test showed high false-negative rates in samples with late cycle threshold (Ct) values. Lower Ct values were reported in the indirect method, which is expected, and the change in Ct values was significant between these two methods (t = 5.93, p < 0.0001). • The correlation between both methods by Ct values shows a moderate correlation with R 2 = 0.755 (p < 0.0001).• The main limitations of our study were resources-shortage, sample selection and RT-PCR target.• Future work should be done to improve the assay sensitivity and validate viral transport media that provide the best results, thus limit the effect of PCR inhibitors. • This direct RT-PCR approach can be utilized as a qualitative diagnostic tool for emergency SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in countries with limited resources.To view the supplementary data that accompany this paper please visit the journal website at: www.futuremedicine.com/doi/sup pl/10.2217/fvl-2020-0187Author contributions T Alaifan is the principal investigator of this study.

The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel corona virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] [2] [3] .COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] .Dry cough and fever are the classical symptoms of COVID-19, and the diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Chest imaging with classical high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings of basal and peripheral ground-glass patches with or without consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, organizing pneumonia pattern, crazy paving pattern, and vascular engorgement may be also noted [4, 5] .There is an increasing incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal distention in COVID-19 cases; these symptoms are associated with positive laboratory results including abnormal coagulation profile and D-dimer levels [6, 7] .Although the imaging findings in HRCT of COVID 19 patients were discussed and helped in understanding the thoracic disease course and potential complications, there are-to our knowledge-few articles about the GI imaging findings of COVID-19 [8] .The aim was to evaluate the abnormal GI imaging findings in confirmed COVID-19 patients to help to understand the potential abdominal course and complications of the disease.Within a 3-month duration, 100 COVID-19 patients presented with GI signs and symptoms and/or abnormal laboratory tests were subjected to dedicated CT examinations, 30 patients presented with abnormal GI imaging findings were retrospectively included in this study.Approval for this study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of our medical institute. All study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki regarding research involving human subjects. Written consent was waived.Confirmed COVID-19 patients who presented with abdominal signs and symptoms were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were confirmed COVID-19 patients without abdominal manifestations and confirmed COVID-19 patients with history of previous GI disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease).The following are infection control precautions:A dedicated CT machine was used for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Wearing a mask is obligatory for the transported patients.Droplet-type precautions are used. The staff should wear N95 mask, eye-protective devices (face shield), gowns, and gloves. Covering the machine during the examination Proper cleaning after the examination Thirty-five abdominal and pelvic MDCT examinations for 30 patients were performed with a 128-slice helical CT scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition Edge Single Source Dual Energy 128 slices Helical CT scanner). Firstly, unenhanced scans were performed in all cases. The scan parameters were 120 kV, 120 Quality Ref.MAs, 300 effective mAs, collimation 16 × 1.5 mm, gantry rotation time 0.5 s, pitch 0.65, feed/rotation 6.0 mm, scan range from the 2 cm above the diaphragm (for assessment of lower chest) to symphysis pubis, and scan time 9-10 s. Secondly, an enhanced scan in the arterial and venous phases was performed in all cases after injection of 100 cc of iodinated contrast medium (Omnipaque 350 mgI/ml at a flow rate 3.5 ml/s). The scan is tailored according to the clinical scenario (We added oral preparations and rectal water enema if indicated).All MDCT images were sent to Picture Archiving and Communicating System (GE Centricity eRadCockpit workstation). The reconstructions of MDCT images of volume at 0.625-to 1.25-mm slice thickness. All imaging data were retrospectively reviewed by three radiologists in consensus.To decrease the subjective judgment, the following definitions were respected: bowel mural thickening (exceeding 3-mm single wall thickness), fluid-filled bowel (bowel segments are filled with fluid in spite of fasting and absent oral or rectal preparation), and active bleeding (when there is unequivocal extravasation of contrast within the bowel lumen).Continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages.Thirty-five abdominal CT imaging studies were done for 30 confirmed COVID 19 patients showing positive GI imaging findings, 21 of them were males (70%), and 9 were females (30%). Twenty-one patients were admitted to the ICU (70%), and 9 patients were isolated in the medical ward (30%). The oldest patient was about 74 years old, and the youngest patient was 20 years old. The patients were distributed in Table 1 according to age; the largest group was (more than 50 to 60 years group) included 14 patients (46.6%); the mean age was 57.7 ± 13.70 years, and the age range was 54 years ( Table 1) .The most frequent indication for MDCT examinations was abdominal distention (n: 19/35, 54%), the second most frequent indication for MDCT examinations include GIT bleeding (7/35, 20%)-four examinations done for the assessment of lower GIT bleeding and three examinations done for assessment of upper GIT bleeding. Three examinations were done for the assessment of vomiting and diarrhea; one examination was done in searching for septic focus in the clinical scenario of unexplained systemic signs of inflammation.We classified the sample into four categories. Group A is the ischemic group. The most frequent finding in MDCT examinations was ischemic bowel changes (n: 10/30, 33.33%) and all implicating the small bowel loops with imaging features of mural thickening and segmental poor enhancement (Fig. 1) ; six of the patients in this group were associated with other thromboembolic findings, four with pulmonary embolism, and two with splenic infarction. One patient showed positive pneumatosis intestinalis (Fig. 2) . Group B (the inflammatory group) was the second most common (n: 9/30, 30%) with three patients showing rectosigmoid inflammatory changes (Fig. 3 ) and six patients with small bowel inflammatory changes (Fig. 4) with the imaging features of mucosal enhancement, submucosal edema forming mural stratification with positive water halo sign. The third group is the bleeding group (Group C) with GIT bleeding noted in six patients (6/30, 20%) and distributed between gastric origin in three patients (Fig. 5 ) and colonic origin in three patients. Active contrast extravasation was noted in three patients (Fig. 6 ) reflecting active bleeding, while three patients showed no active extravasation at the time of examination with indirect signs of bleeding manifested by intraluminal blood clots noted in one patient. Fluid-filled bowel (Group D) was noted in five patients (Fig. 7) (5/30, 16.6%). Fluid-filled bowel segments in examinations without oral or rectal preparation were considered pathological notably in the clinical setting of diarrhea (Table 2 ).To the best of our knowledge, there are few publications on GI imaging features of COVID-19 patients; there is an increasing incidence of GIT symptoms matching with increased number of the confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide.The most common indications for dedicated CT abdominal imaging studies in our study was abdominal distention, while abdominal pain was the most common COVID-19 abdominal imaging study indication in Bhayan et al.'s study-the first paper-to our knowledge, discussed the abdominal imaging features of COVID-19 [9] . In our study, male to female ratio was 2.3:1; ICU patient to non-ICU patient ratio was 2.3:1, while in Bahayan et al.'s study [9] , male to female ratio was 1.4:1, and ICU to non-ICU patient ratio was 0.5:1By binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptors, SARS-COV2 virus invades the alveolar epithelial cells [10] ; these receptors are found also in vascular endothelial cells, enterocytes, and other organs like the kidney and the heart leading to potential direct invasion of the virus to the enterocytes and vascular supply to the bowel loops explaining the potential inflammatory bowel changes and ischemic bowel changes.The indirect effect through abnormal immune response caused by cytokine release can occur also; imaging findings are variable according to the severity of the inflammation mediated by cytokine release (e.g., cytokine storm syndrome) [11] .Systemic coagulopathy is common in COVID-19 critically ill patients [12, 13] . Tang et al. [12] stated that besides the risk of thrombosis, there is also an increased risk of bleeding; this can be attributed to thrombocytopenia/thrombocytosis imbalance and disorders of the coagulation system. This can explain the ischemic bowel findings and GIT bleeding noted in our study. Two COVID-19 patients only showed major hemorrhagic abnormalities in Conti et al.'s published study [13] .The authors advice dealing with COVID-19 as a systemic disease due to the aforementioned mechanisms with either possible direct invasion on the ACE 2 receptor-rich cells and/or harmful systemic immunemediated response to SARS-COV 2 infection. There were few limitations in this study: there was a small number of the patient population; the study was a single-center retrospective study; and pathologic correlation was not available for many included patients.COVID-19 should be evaluated as a systemic disease with extrapulmonary highlights. GI imaging should be considered for COVID-19 patients with related suspicious symptoms. Ischemic GI complications were the most common GI findings. ","Egypt","first author","2021-02-10",2

This virus which is believed to have been originally circulating in wild animals has a similar transmission route with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus . It is a respiratory illness with clinical symptoms such as cold, throat infection, cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing (Huang et al. 2020) . The outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported on 31 December 2019, in Wuhan, China (WHO 2020). The virus spread rapidly throughout China and within 1 month, and several other countries, including Italy the United States, Germany, and United Kingdom reported their first cases (Giovanetti et al. 2020; CDC 2020; Rothe et al. 2020) . The rapid outbreak and development of the epidemic is contributed to the disease characterization of its long incubation period, high infectivity, and difficulty in detection (Franch-Pardo et al. 2020) . In Africa, the first reported case was in Egypt on 25 February 2020. Since then, the outbreak has spread across the continent (Rasheed et al. 2020) . Namibia reported its first case on the 14 March 2020 and by the end of June 2020, the total number of confirmed cases remained below 300. However, it started to increase exponentially from the beginning of July. By the end of July 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 2052 (Worldometer 2020) .As the curve increases exponentially for the number of confirmed cases, Namibia and any other African counties are in worries of possible overwhelming situation in the health care system. The World Health organization (WHO) (WHO 2020) released guidelines to be used to slow down transmission and manage confirmed cases such as case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, physical distancing, hygiene measures, and improving the health care system. Due to the rapid and continuous spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, several countries or regions all over the world have been forced to take emergency measures such as closing cities, stopping production, suspending school classes, and restricting population movement, causing great harm to economic development and residents' health (An and Jia, 2020) . Namibia enforced lockdown of cities from March 2020 and cascaded further control measures guidelines to its region. However, from May 2020 started to relax some measure stage by stage to save its economy (Republic of Namibia 2020). It has now emerged that the epicenter of in Namibia shifted to Erongo Region with more that 50% of the current confirmed cases (Worldometer 2020) . Understanding future dynamics of the disease is important for public health planning and readiness.Several multidisciplinary studies on the epidemic spread have been done and achieved fruitful research results, which are of great guiding significance for the prevention and control of the epidemic (Franch-Pardo et al. 2020) . A comprehensive review by Franch-Pardo et al. (2020) highlighted the importance of health geography in examining health policy interventions, control, and mapping/tracking through projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends. To achieve this, geographic information systems (GIS) are currently recognized as a set of strategic and analytic tools for analyzing the spread and management strategy to allocate resources for diseases in both developed and developing countries (Wondim et al. 2017) . Geography disciplines offer synthetic approach to the interplay between the biophysical and human variables (Turner 2002) , and hence, the spatial and temporal changes of the COVID-19 epidemic spread are therefore a scientific problem to study (Xie et al. 2020) .The COVID-19 pandemic have a spatial dimension that lead to understanding the transmission phenomenon as geographical and potentially mappable, and hence the need to include the ability to cross variables of different kinds to interpret the COVID-19 phenomenon, its spatial analysis and spatiotemporal dimensions, its geographical impact on decision-making and everyday life, and predictive modeling of the evolution of the disease (Franch-Pardo et al. 2020) . For these reasons, the use of geospatial and statistical tools has become particularly relevant with the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Mapping COVID-19 cases will help to understand more about spatial distribution of the disease in their area as well as its temporal occurrence and making forecast of its future burden. Mapping will also be used to locate the areas where outbreaks originate and effectively target high-risk areas for early prevention control. Despite the existence of various challenges of data sources, many countries or regions have published the epidemic spatial models in real time by making use of available data whilst estimating others based on available information (Xie et al. 2020) . Sarfo and Karuppannan (2020) assert that geospatial technique is a tool for best practices in fighting COVID-19. In their study, they employed geospatial technologies in Ghana to model trends and mobility patterns. The results forecasted future spread through to the middle parts and then the northern parts. Another study by Ekumah et al. (2020) used a mixture of multivariate statistical and geospatial analyses to investigate the risk of COVID-19 infection in relation to the association of household family structure is associated with in-house access to basic needs in Sub-Saharan Africa (SAA). They used geo-maps to show how high spatial heterogeneity in terms of in-house access to basic needs in SSA. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there is little work done on geospatial research for COVID-19 in Africa despite evidence of its application in most parts of the world. This study therefore uses geospatial technologies to model current and future situations of COVID-19 in Namibia.This study was carried out in Namibia (Fig. 1) . Namibia is part of the Southern African countries and has a land area of 825.419 km 2 . Namibia is surrounded by Angola and Zambezi to the North, Zimbabwe in the Northeast, South Africa to the south, and Botswana to the east and the Atlantic Ocean in the western direction with a heterogeneous population of about 2.4 million.There are 14 administrative regions in Namibia, with the capital town being Windhoek. Khomas and Ohangwena are the most populous regions. Transport systems, i.e., Harbors, airports, roads, and railways, including the center of each regions of Namibia are shown in the Fig. 1 .To generate a risk mapping which might help in COVID-19 fight of Namibia, data on COVID-19 confirmed cases, population density, and spatial interaction index were collected to prepare different thematic maps. The population density and Namibian road network data were obtained from the Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA), National Spatial Data Infrastructure website (http://geofi nd.nsa.org.na/about ). Data on COVID-19 confirmed cases were obtained from Namibia Health Ministry COVID-19 dashboard (https ://namib ia.unfpa .org/en/event s/healt h-minis try-launc hes-covid -19dashb oard). On the other hand, the spatial interaction index was generated from a road network data using ARCGIS Pro.After having prepared all the necessary thematic map layers, each thematic layer based on their relative influence on the spread of COVID-19 was ranked and weighted using AHP pair-wise comparison matrix. Finally, all these prepared thematic layers were integrated using a weighted overlay tool in ArcGIS window to generate the COVID-19 risk assessment and map of the study area. COVID-19 response modeling was analyzed using ArcGIS Pro COVID-19 modeling toolbox, the COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) V1.1.5 tool. This tool leverages SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) modeling to assist hospitals, cities, and regions with capacity planning around COVID-19 by providing estimates of daily new admissions and current inpatient hospitalizations (census), ICU admissions, and patients requiring ventilation (COVID-19 response CHIME Model v1.1.5 manual, 2020). The CHIME tool predicts SIR a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of 365 days; however, short-period projections are recommended (COVID-19 response CHIME Model v1.1.5 manual, 2020). In this study, 60 and 90 day projection with and without social distancing was made to analyze the COVID-19 response which might be used by all responsible organizations for a better control of the disease and resource management.The tool uses parameters that describe the healthcare system or region being analyzed as well as the spread and contact input information for the disease. Spread and contact input information can be specified either as fields in the Input Feature Class or as constant values (COVID-19 response CHIME Model v1.1.5 manual, 2020). All data to run the model were obtained from the Namibia ministry of health website (https ://mfl.mhss.gov.na/locat ion-manag er/ locat ions) and tangible information on media briefing by the ministry of health.The model consists of individuals who are susceptible (S), infected (I), or recovered (R).The epidemic proceeds via a growth and decline process. This is the core model of infectious disease spread and has been in use in epidemiology for many years. The dynamics are given by the following three equations (Weisstein 2019):The modelʼs parameters, β and γ, determine the severity of the epidemic. β can be interpreted as the effective contactrate: β = τ × c which is the transmissibility τ multiplied by the average number of people exposed c. The transmissibility is the basic virulence of the pathogen. The number of people exposed, c, is the parameter that can be changed through social distancing. γ is the inverse of the mean recovery time, in days. i.e., if γ = 1/14, then the average infection will clear in 14 days.An important descriptive parameter is the basic reproduction number, or R0. This represents the average number of people who will be infected by any given infected person. When R0 is greater than 1, it means that a disease will grow. A higher R0 implies more rapid transmission and a more rapid growth of the epidemic. It is defined as R0 = β/γ. R0 is larger when the pathogen is more infectious people are infectious for longer periods of time the number susceptible people is higher. A doubling time of 6 days and a recovery time of 14.0 days imply an R0 of 2.71 (Weisstein 2019) .After the beginning of the outbreak, actions to reduce social contact will lower the parameter c. If this happens at time t, then the effective reproduction rate is Rt, which will be lower than R0 (Weisstein 2019).Multi-criteria decision analysis using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) is the most common and well-known GIS-based method for delineating risk zones. This method helps to integrate all thematic maps. A total of three different thematic layers were considered for this study. These three thematic layers are supposed to control the factor of COVID19 spread in the area. The association of these influencing factors is weighted according to their reaction for COVID19 spread and expert opinion. A parameter with a high weight illustrates a layer with high impact and a parameter with a low weight illustrates a small impact. The weights of each parameter were assigned according to Saaty's scale (1-9) of relative importance value shown in Table 1 (Satty 1995) . As per the classification, weights are assigned to the thematic layers based on their importance. Accordingly, all the thematic layers have been compared with each other in a pairwise comparison matrix:where A is a pair-wise comparison matrix of alternatives A i , i = 1, 2, 3, … n with respect to criteria K.The sub-classes of thematic layers were re-classified using natural break classification method in the GIS platform for assigning weight. The sub-classes of each thematic layer rank were allocated on a scale of 0-9, according to their relative influence on the groundwater development.For calculating the consistency ratio (CR) (Eq. 4), the following steps are adopted: (1) Principal Eigenvalue (ʎ) was computed by Eigenvector technique and (2) Consistency Index (CI) was calculated from the equation given below:where n is the number of factors used in the analysis.Consistency ratio is defined as CR = CI RCI , where RCI = random consistency index value, whose values were obtained from the Saaty's standard (Table 2 ).Saaty has opined that CR of 0.10 or less is acceptable to continue the analysis. If the consistency value is greater than 0.10, then there is a need to revise the judgment to locate causes of inconsistency and correct it accordingly. If the CR value is 0, it means that there is a perfect level of consistency in the pair-wise comparison. The threshold value is not exceeding above 0.1, which means that the judgments matrix is reasonably consistent.Because of their practical prediction performance, trend analysis using spatial interaction index have been preferred for a few decades (Fotheringham and Webber 1980; Champion et al. 1998; Smith et al. 2001) . Economy, job opportunity, orindustrial structures of a region influence the regional population and its movement (Rogers 2008) . Fundamentally, properties of a region attract population, and its influence is in inverse proportion to the distance. The condition of the regional industry decides the tendency of inter-regional migration, and its amount is determined by the population. It is based on an assumption that people are willing to move to well-structured regions for jobs, market, visit, etc. Those features experience spatial interactions and the terms in the introduced model are modified to reflect them. The conventional gravity model is composed of the populations of interacting regions, distance, and a constant that decides the strength of the interaction (Smith et al. 2001) . The typical form is expressed as:where I ij is the interaction from origin i to destination j; m i and m j are, respectively, the population functions of regions i and j; d ij is the distance between regions i and j; and G ij is a constant determined through statistics of movement from region i to j.In this study, the spatial interaction layer was created from road connectivity. To create the spatial interaction layer from the road network, the road network was created using ARC-GIS. The spatial interaction index in ARCGIS platform was created using the following procedure.1. The feature to point tool was used to create point's administrative boundary polygons of Namibia (Fig. 2 ). 2. Network spatial weights tool setting the Input Feature Class for Namibia administrative points was generated and providing a network data set. The driving distances for each point to every other point were computed. Inverse for the conceptualization of spatial relationships parameter and do not Row Standardize option was selected (Fig. 2) . 3. The convert spatial weights matrix to table tool to export the inverse distances to a simple table was used (Fig. 2) . 4. Summary statistics to sum the inverse distance weights associated with each administrative boundary was runned (Fig. 2) . 5. Join Field to add the summed weights back to the administrative boundaries and alter field to give the joined field an appropriate name such as spatial interactive index was used (Fig. 2) .(5) The produced spatial interaction index (Fig. 2) was incorporated in to AHP analysis together with other factors to predict the risk zones. The risk zones in this study can be interpreted only as areas with high transmission of COVID-19 and the number of affected population is high in comparisons to the other regions of the country.In the following sections, the results of the analysis are presented for each of the three factors controlling COVID-19 and thereby the risk assessment and mapping. Results on modeling and projections of COVID-19 using CHIME V1.1.5 tool for 60 and 90 days with no social distancing and 30% social distancing are also presented.There are 14 administrative regions in Namibia, with the capital town being Windhoek. Khomas and Ohangwena are the most populous regions, while Karas and Omaheke are least densely populated of the 14 regions of Namibia (Table 3) .The population density thematic map was created after forecasting the 2016 population census of Namibia using population growth rate of 1.19%. The population density data are re-classified in to six groups in the ArcGIS Pro platform for overlay analysis (Fig. 3) .Geographically, the spread of the pandemic in Namibia has spatial connotations. From the Table 3 , Khomas Region Fig. 2 Steps followed to create the spatial interaction index layer of Namibia greatly affected and recorded higher figures next to the hotspot Erongo region. Erongo and Khomas regions have accumulated 88.07% and 8.03% of the total COVID-19 cases in Namibia. The third highest hit region makes up just 1.38% of the confirmed cases. Comparing population distribution and COVID-19 cases (Table 3; Fig. 3) , current information's shows that there is no a direct link in infection trends and the regional level of Namibia's population distribution; this might be because of the lockdown measures. Data on confirmed cases were then prepared and re-classified in ArcGIS platform for overlay analysis (Fig. 3) .Population movement triggers transmissions of COVID-19. In this study, Namibian mobility index on the four stages of lockdown was analyzed using Google mobility data (https ://www.googl e.com/covid 19/mobil ity/). Google calculate these insights based on data from users who have opted-in to Location history for their Google Account, so the data represent a sample of Google users. Google Calculate changes for Groceries & pharmacy, Retail & recreation, Transit stations, and Parks categories using the baseline as the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3-Feb 6, 2020. Google mobility index revealed that the average social distancing in the country was 45, 21, 15, and 10% for stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, and stage 4 lockdowns, respectively (Fig. 4) . The stage 4 lockdown period is proposed to be extended up to 17 September 2020, but stage 4 mobility change map (Fig. 4) was processed using Google mobility index data till 8 May 2020.For the COVID-19 risk analysis, the spatial interaction layer of Namibia (Fig. 4) was produced from road connectivity data using ARCGIS Pro. The calculated interaction index then re-classified into six groups for overlay analysis.All the three thematic maps or layers (Fig. 3) were prepared in the re-classified raster format and were given the normalized weight (Fig. 5) in accordance with transmissions of COVID-19. Similarly, each thematic layer's classes were given the normalized rank or weight. Then, overlay analysis was carried out using the weight vectors (Fig. 5) using AHP.Risk mapping is a dimensionless quantity computed considering the weights for each layer and sub-classes in each thematic layer. After the overlay process has been completed, the COVID-19 risk zone map for Namibia was classified as highest risk, higher risk, high risk, low risk, lower risk, and lowest risk (Fig. 6) . Risk zone designated as highest is mostly found in the Erongo Region which stretches from the Central Plateau across to the Central Namibian coast in the west, and with the Ugab River being the northern border, the higher COVID-19 risk zone is distributed along Khomas region which include the capital Windhoek.High-and low-risk regions are Karas and Otjozonedjupa, respectively. Results also indicate that the lower risk COVID-19 regions are Hardap, Kunene, Oshana, Omusati, Oshikoto, Ohangwana, and Kavango East, and lowest COVID-19 risk areas are Kavango West and Omaheke (Fig. 6 ).The tempo and trend of COVID-19 were modeled using ArcGIS Pro COVID-19 modeling toolbox; the COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) V1.1.5 tool. The modeling was based on mobility dynamics, current COVID-19 cases, population dynamics and the rate of SARS-CoV2 infection, Number of Currently Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients, Social Distancing % (Reduction in Social Contact), Hospitalization % (Total Infections), ICU Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) V1.1.5 tool. Different scenarios are analyzed and projected for the next 60 and 90 days from the starting date 08 May 2020 with in lock down periods in Namibia. After lockdown ends on 17/ September 2020, the observed data of 18 September 2020 were used for the next 3-month projections after lockdown ends in Namibia. The metrics explained the maximum difference between projected needs and available resources, including the maximum difference as a total and as a percent, the day, and date in which the highest difference occurred, and the amount of days in which total projected needs exceeded available resources. The Fig. 3 Population density, confirmed cases, and spatial interaction index for COVID-19 overlay analysis to produce risk mapping model was processed in four different scenarios to analyze the spread and effect of COVID-19; (1) projection with no social distancing for next 60 and 90 days and (2) projection with 30% social distancing for next 60 and 90 days. The effectiveness of social distancing interventions to delay or flatten the Epidemic Curve of Coronavirus Disease in Namibia is modeled. Social distancing reduced by 30%.The CHIME model result on transmission of COVID-19 with no social distancing interventions shows a peak curve on new daily admission, daily hospital census, and new hospitalizations for each region of Namibia (Fig. 7) . The peak new daily admission will be occurred after 45 days from the starting date (08/05/2020) of modeling (Fig. 6a) . The model result shows about 1524 new peak COVID-19 admissions (Fig. 7a) . Out of the new peak admissions, about 400 admissions required ICU and about 200 admissions needed ventilation (Fig. 7a) .The total daily hospital census projections including patients before the modeling period (Fig. 7d) indicate about 10,000 total cases after 50 days of modeling; 3200 ICU admissions and 2100 ventilated admissions.Khomas region shows high peak about 365 new hospitalizations on 2 September, if no social distance intervention applied (Fig. 7a, c) ; this is because of the high population density in the region. All other regions have also their peaks on the month of September. The second populous region, Ohangwena, has about 234 newly admission on September 17. The model result reveled that if no social distancing interventions applied, the most populous regions will have the highest COVID-19 cases and high number of COVID-19 cases recorded (Figs. 6c, 7a) .Comparing Figs. 7 and 8, reducing peoples contact rates by 30% flatten the curve. The new daily admissions and the total daily hospital census projection reduced by 50%. The findings of the model are to be viewed with caution. Hospitalization increases in our model are likely to occur later if measures are lifted or social distance is decreased from 30% without further action, such as widespread testing, self-isolation of infected individuals, and contact tracing. As with any model, the impact of the interventions may be overestimated by our assumptions. However, quantifying the short-term effects of an intervention is vital to help decisionmakers estimate the immediate number of resources needed and plan for future interventions.Similar to the 60-day model projections above, the 90-day projection also shows high-peak COVID-19 admissions and COVID-19 cases in Namibia with no social distancing interventions scenario (Fig. 9) . The model result depicts that newly hospitalization census of each region of Namibia is associated with the number of population (Fig. 9a, c) . Khomas region will have the highest peak, about 2500 new admissions during early September. Most of the other regions of Namibia will have their peak during late September (Fig. 9c) .The new daily admissions and total daily hospitalized have their peaks after 50 days of projection. Model shows about 1512 new daily hospitalization of which 386 are ICU admissions and about 213 ventilated admissions.The effect of 30% social distancing intervention on 90-day COVID-19 response is shown in Fig. 9 . Reducing peoples contact rates by 30% flattens the curve (Fig. 10 ) in comparison to not applying social distancing measures (Fig. 9 ).Since March 2020, 13,134 people have been placed in to mandatory quarantine facilities around the Namibia (Table 4 ). In Namibia the fourth stage of lockdown ends on Regional-based COVID-19 risk zones of Namibia, and IDW interpolation based on the 08 May 2020 confirmed cases. The risk zones in this study can be interpreted only as areas with high transmission of COVID-19 and high number of affected population is in comparisons to the other regions of the country Fig. 8 a Hospitalized census, b change in Hospitalized census over date per region, c new daily admission projection, and d daily hospital census projection in Namibia for next 60 days with no 30% social distancing 17 September 2020. 90-Day projection was made using the observed data of 18 September 2020 (Fig. 11) .The 90-day projection reveled Khomas region will have the highest peak, about 4300 new admissions during end of September (Fig. 10b) . The projection shows different peak values for each regions due to difference in the no of population and mobility index (Fig. 11b) .New daily hospitalized census projection result shows about 7843 new daily hospitalization of which 2301 are ICU admissions and about 2061 Ventilated admissions (Fig. 11d) . More than 1810 new daily admission was also observed (Fig. 11c) .Result findings of this research correlate with an increasing number of publications assessing the impacts of COVID-19 interventions. Several researchers have studied how social distancing measures could have influenced the epidemic (Prem et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Kraemer et al. 2020) . Others have investigated the effect of similar measures elsewhere and concluded that social distancing interventions alone will not be able to control the pandemic (Flaxman et al. 2020; Tuite et al. 2020 ). In this study, an attempt was made to develop a spatial model for demarcating the COVID-19 risk zones in Namibia making use of three thematic layers. These were population distribution, current COVID-19 confirmed cases, and spatial interaction index. The COVID-19 risk zones' mapping was produced by integrating these thematic layers in ArcGIS overlay analysis. The identified COVID-19 risk zones in Namibia are highest, higher, high, low, lower, and lowest. Risk zone designated as highest is mostly found in the Erongo Region, the higher COVID-19 risk zone is distributed along Khomas region which include the capital Windhoek, and the high-and low-risk regions are Karas and Otjozonedjupa, respectively. The lower risk COVID-19 regions are Hardap, Kunene, Oshana, Omusati, Oshikoto, Ohangwana, and Kavango East, and lowest COVID-19 risk areas are Kavango West and Omaheke region.Different scenarios are analyzed and projected for the 60 and 90 days from the starting date 08 May 2020 within Fig. 11 a Hospitalized census, b new daily admission projection, c change in hospitalized census over date per region, and d daily hospital census projection in Namibia for next 90 days from 18 September 2020 lockdown periods in Namibia. After lockdown ends on 17 September 2020, the observed data of 18 September 2020 were used for the next 3-month projections. The CHIME model result on response of COVID-19 was analyzed with and without social distancing intervention for the next 60 and 90 days starting from 08 May 2020. The 60-and 90-day modeling result without social distancing interventions shows a peak curve on new daily admission, daily hospital census, and new hospitalizations for each region of Namibia. The peak new daily admission occurred after 45 days from the starting date of modeling for 60-day projection. The 60-day projection model result shows about 1524 new COVID-19 admissions, about 400 admissions required ICU, and about 200 admissions needed ventilation.The 60-day model output shows that Khomas region has high peak in September over the other regions; this might be due to the high population density in the area. All other regions have also their peaks on the month of September lately. The second populous region, Ohangwena, has about 234 newly admission on September 17.The 60-and 90-day model projection with 30% social distancing interventions shows flattening of the peak number of cases and delay to the peak number. In Namibia, the fourth stage of lockdown ends on 17 September 2020. After lockdown ends, 90-day projection was made using the observed data of 18 September 2020/.The 90-day projection reveled Khomas region will have the highest peak, about 4300 new admissions during end of September. The projection shows different peak values for each regions due to difference in the number of population and mobility index.New daily hospitalized census projection result shows about 7843 new daily hospitalization of which 2301 are ICU admissions and about 2061 ventilated admissions. More than 1810 new daily admission was also observed. The research output could help policy-makers to estimate the immediate number of resources needed and plan for future interventions of COVID-19 in Namibia.The worldwide wide spread of COVID-19 peaks the importance of research, stable research infrastructure, and funding for public health emergency, response, and resiliency. Lives are lost, economies falter, and life has radically changed after the pandemic. Ultimate COVID-19 mitigation and crisis resolution are dependent on high-quality research aligned with top priority societal goals that yields trustworthy data and actionable information. While the highest priority goals are treatment and prevention, resource allocation and management require future projections based on the current infection rate.This study generated a risk zone and projected the new daily admission and daily hospitalized census which might help in COVID-19 fight of Namibia. The projection was mad using two observed data (05 May 2020) and (18 September 2020) for the next 90 days to accommodate CHIME tool projection recommendation. CHIME recommend short-period projections. The model tool and the input parameters can be used for future research and the model can be updated with the recent data at any time possible and future studies can be extended.The authors recommended that additional data and recent modern technological knowledge which adapts machine learning might increase the accuracy of the research and it is strongly recommended.","Namibia","abstract","2021-02-17",2

These factors should be harp on consideration for the strategy of isolating infected patients.Coronavirus disease 2019 , SARS-CoV-2, viral shedding, negative conversion, Tunisia Introduction:Since December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China ). On February, the world health organization (WHO) named this emerging disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the responsible agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Lai et al. 2020 ).The current COVID-19 pandemic, is spreading worldwide at an accelerated rate. According to World Health Organization (WHO), as of 14 February 2021, approximately 108,153,741confirmed cases have been estimated globally with surpassing 2 381 295 deaths spanning over 216 countries Dashboard' n.d.) In Tunisia, since March 22, our country has experienced a turning point and general health containment has begun. Tunisia's strategy was based on testing, tracing and isolation as the WHO guidelines.Tunisia's government and health ministry have launched a series of measures to screen, quarantine, diagnose, treat and monitor suspected patients and their close contacts. The lifting of the compulsory confinement of SARS-CoV-2 carrying subjects in a dedicated center was announced on July 14.Tunisia is experiencing a second wave of the pandemic infection rate and COVID-19 is spreading exponentially. Until the 14 th of February, there have been 222 504 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 7 508 deaths ('Tunisia: Dashboard' n.d.).Since the identification of the first cases of COVID-19, numerous studies were released and focused on the epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics and treatment strategies of infected patients in Tunisia. However, there is limited data regarding the potential factors associated with the delay in RNA negative conversion of patients with COVID-19 (Hu et al. 2020 ).The patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in body fluids, secretions, and excreta (Ling et al. 2020 ). All patients with positive viral RNA detection need to be isolated, and only after the relief of symptoms and two successive negative viral nucleic acid results for respiratory specimens, the isolated cases can be discharged (Qi et al. 2020) . The persistence and clearance of viral RNA predictors in different specimens of COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Knowledge has been accumulating in this topic about hospitalized and critically ill patients, while information about patients with mild severity is scarce (Ling et al. 2020; Qi et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) . Although, most COVID-19 patients have mild clinical symptoms (Qi et al. 2020) . Data on viral RNA shedding among patients with mild COVID-19, are of paramount importance to prevent transmission of this disease. Indeed, identifying people likely to be slow shedders is crucial to prolong their isolation, once infected, and avoid the virus spread, especially with the impossibility of confirming negative conversion by two reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests due to the international shortage and increasing cases. Thus, understanding factors associated with prolonged viral clearance among asymptomatic/mild cases is important to tailor prevention strategies.Our study aimed to identify the potential predictors of RNA negative conversion delay among these COVID-19 patients.A cohort study was conducted including patients with confirmed COVID-19 confined in the national COVID-19 center from March to July 2020.National COVID-19 center (Hotel for COVID-19 patients) was located in Monastir governorate. This community facility was designated for isolation of patients with or without symptoms of COVID-19 in Tunisia (from the 24 Tunisian governorates). The Tunisian government allocated asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 cases to dedicated isolation facilities and the remaining individuals with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 to hospitals. The recruitment period spread out from March to 29 th of July, 2020. Exposure to isolation and follow-up for each case ranged from admission to the recovery announcement. A prospective daily data collection was made.Patients over 18 years of age with positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal / throat swabs by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included. All cases progressing to a moderate or severe form requiring hospitalization were excluded for analysis ( Figure 1 were discharged from the containment center.Outcome: Conversion of viral RNA was defined as the duration from the first day of RT-PCR result till the second successively negative RNA SARS-CoV-2 testing, as proposed by previous studies dealing with a similar topic (Hu et al. 2020; Gao and Li 2020) . A SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by testing respiratory specimens based on RT-PCR assays from different agreed institutions including the Monastir university laboratory.Exposure: Patients are required to stay in their hotel rooms during the isolation period. Their meals were served in their rooms. Telephone medical assistance was provided on a daily basis by Monastir preventive medicine department team. A toll-free number is given to each patient for any emergency to be resolved by the containment center staff.Predictors and diagnostic criteria: Initially, demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. A daily phone call was made to collect clinical evolution and provide information on compliance with isolation measures. Patients were also asked if they wore a mask when exposed to index cases and when they had contracted the virus, and whether they lived in a single room or not. The announcement of recovery is made after the 2 nd negative RT PCR, addressed by laboratory in 24 to 48 hours. After recovery, the patients were asked about their degree of implication in respecting hygiene and isolation measures. were discharged based on respiratory samples consecutively negative for RNA testing with an interval of at least one day.Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviation and as medians and interquartile (IQR). Categorical variables were described as frequency and percentage. TheMann-Whitney U test was introduced to compare the differences between two groups for quantitative variables.In our study, negative conversion of viral RNA during the communicable period, as time-toevent data, was the outcome measure and was illustrated with Kaplan-Meier curves. In order to detect the independent factors influencing the duration of RNA negative conversion, univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.The log-rank test was first conducted with demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and virological variables.Multivariate Cox regression model was then performed with the significant factors selected by univariate analysis (p-value less than 0.2) to determine the independent predictors for RNA negative conversion.The association between independent factors and negative conversion was quantified by hazard ratio (HR). As negative conversion of viral RNA is a favorable event, HR value >1 would accelerate virological clearance, whereas HR <1 means the independent predictor would delay negative conversion.A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 21.0). Symptoms such as anosmia, dry cough, and fatigue were reported by 34.4% (75) of cases.Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics of our included patients were represented in Table 1 .The median duration of viral conversion in the current study was 20 days (IQR, 17-32). The shortest and longest durations were nine days and 58 days, respectively. The patient with the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f shortest RNA-viral clearance duration was a 43-year-old male with no comorbidities. As for the longest 58 days duration, the concerned patient was a 62-year-old male with hypertension.No symptoms were reported during RT-PCR positivity for both cases.Kaplan-Meier survival curve representing the overall negative conversion of viral RNA in COVID-19 patients was illustrated in figure 2. By age categories, the median time to viral clearance was described in Table 2 . We evaluated the effect of each factor on negative conversion of COVID-19 patients by Log rank test (figure 3). We found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance was significantly delayed in symptomatic patients (log-rank test, p=0.041; Figure 2C ). The median duration was 24 days J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Moreover, according to our findings, viral RNA negative conversion was significantly faster in patients with dyslipidemia (log-rank test, p=0.016; Figure 2D ), and cases who were wearing face masks when contracting the virus (log-rank test, p=0.003; Figure 2F ). The median time to RNA viral conversion was 18 days (IQR, 16-21) for patients using face masks vs 23 days (IQR, 17-36) for patients who did not wear it.There was no significant difference in duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative conversion according to sex (Figure 2A) , over 60 years age ( Figure 2B ), current smoking, comorbidities and isolation in a single room ( Figure 2E ). Key results: Until now, there has been little studies on the predictors of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA duration. Viral shedding was related to infectivity and transmissibility in influenzae virus infections, which understanding is crucial for the implementation of prevention strategies (Ryoo et al. 2013) . Therefore, it is important to determine the duration of viral shedding and related factors in patients with COVID-19 (Qi et al. 2020 ). Our study showed associations between face-masking, having symptoms and RNA conversion duration.The median time to RNA viral conversion was 18 days (IQR, 16-21) for cases who wore mask when contacting index cases vs 23 days (IQR, 17-36) who did not wear a mask and 24 days (IQR, 18-36) for symptomatic patients vs 20 days (IQR, 16-30) for asymptomatic ones.Interpretation : The median time to viral conversion observed in our cohort was 20 (IQR: 17-32) days from the first positive RT-PCR test, similar to Zhou et al study (Zhou et al. 2020) .Other studies demonstrated a shorter median duration of viral shedding of 9.5 (IQR:6.0-11.0) and 14 (IQR:10-18) days (Hu et al. 2020; Ling et al. 2020) . Another study in Italy reported a longer median duration of viral shedding of 31 (IQR:24-41) days (Mancuso et al. 2020 ).The discrepancies might be attributed to the heterogeneity of patients and disease severity in these studies. Differences may also come from the different starting points of the RNA viral clearance in previous reports. In our study, the definition was in line with other high-quality studies as mentioned in methods section (Hu et al. 2020; Gao and Li 2020) .According to our study, sex difference was not related to the duration of viral shedding.However, a previous study showed that male sex was a predictor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA prolonged clearance . The mechanism of sex-related difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. It might be related to sex hormones which appear to influence the immune system. Females are reported to produce more cellular and humoral immune reactions, and so are more resistant to certain infections (Bouman, Heineman, and Faas 2005) .Smoking rates were not a predictor of a prolonged viral shedding in line with what was reported in a previous study . A Meta-analysis based on 19 peer reviewed papers, demonstrated a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (Patanavanich and Glantz 2020) . Indeed, the adverse effects of smoking on pulmonary immune function is a risk factor for serious outcomes among infected people (Bauer, Morissette, and Stämpfli 2013) . Health care providers should take active measures to slow smoker's trend, and public health campaigns should underline the importance of smoking cessation during the pandemic.Furthermore, the current study does not support diabetes and hypertension as a predisposing factor a late SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance similar to previous studies (Hu et al. 2020; Li et al. n.d.) .Our study showed no increase in time to viral clearance with increasing age. Besides, older age (over 60 years) was not found to be an independent predictive factor of prolonged viral RNA shedding. Similarly, a recent systematic review reported no significant age related differences in the duration of both respiratory tract swab positivity and fecal sample positivity (Morone et al. 2020) . Even though, it was demonstrated that growth age was correlated to a later RT-PCR conversion (Hu et al. 2020; Mori et al. 2020) . COVID-19 is more likely to infect older patients due to the weaker immune system (K. . Indeed, T-cell numbers and functions are highly affected with aging, leading to a less controlled viral replication and host inflammatory responses (Goronzy, Lee, and Weyand 2007) . Besides, agerelated comorbidities may result in prolonged viral shedding among elderly (K. ). However, no significant difference was noted concerning comorbidities in the current study; the effect of age on the RNA viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 still needs further investigation.Interestingly, not wearing masks and having symptoms were associated with a prolonged viral clearance RNA. Virological and epidemiological data, have led to the hypothesis that facial masking may reduce the severity among infected people (Gandhi and Rutherford 2020) . In an outbreak on a closed Argentinian cruise ship, the rate of asymptomatic infection among passengers wearing surgical and N95 masks was 81% compared with 20% without masking (Gandhi, Beyrer, and Goosby 2020) .Masking could reduce administered virus doses leading to less severe manifestations of COVID-19. Long lasting negative conversion RNA might also be proportionate to the viral SARS-CoV-2 inoculum received explaining the association between facial masking and viral shedding in our findings. This perspective puts another advantage to population-wide masking for pandemic control regarding viral inoculum, attenuating severe disease and acceleration SARS-CoV-2 recovery. Enforced population masking is the key strategy now as we await the results of vaccine trials. Therefore, strategic guidance should be established, and enough mask supply should be guaranteed.Developing symptoms was a predictor of prolonged negative RNA conversion. Mild cases were found to have an early clearance in contrast with severe case, in which mean viral load was 60 times higher than that of mild cases, suggesting that higher viral loads might be associated with a longer viral shedding period (Y. ). However and unexpectedly, previous studies reported that viral load of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients was as high as that of symptomatic patients (Lee et al. 2020; Zou et al. 2020) . Our data indicate that patients with symptoms tend to have a prolonged viral clearance which might be a useful marker for assessing disease prognosis.Our study has some limitations. First, we only analyzed RNA in nasal swats and not in patients' excretions such as urine and feces. However, previous studies showed that viral loads in patients' excretions might be higher than respiratory specimens (Li et al. n.d.) .Second there are only qualitative results of RNA detection in this study, but the persistent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not necessarily show persistent shedding of live virus.To date, it is unknown how shedding of viral RNA correlates with shedding of infectious virus needing further studies.Our results highlighted the point that asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 cases will test positive for SARS-COV-2 when released according to the latest WHO recommendation There was no external funding for this articleJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ","Tunisia","first author","2021-02-27",2

The new coronavirus COVID-19 corresponds to a new strain that has not previously been identified in humans. On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 was reclassified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease has spread rapidly from country to country, causing enormous economic damage and many deaths around the world, prompting governments to issue a dramatic decree, ordering the lockdown of entire countries.Since the confirmation of the first case of COVID-19 in Morocco on 2 March 2020 in the city of Casablanca, numerous preventive measures and strategies to control the spread of diseases have been imposed by the Moroccan authorities. In addition, Morocco declared a health emergency during the period from 20 March to 20 April 2020 and gradually extended it until 10 June 2020 in order to control the spread of the disease. In this paper, we report the assessment of the evolution of COVID-19 outbreak in Morocco. Besides shedding light on the dynamics of the pandemic, the practical intent of our analysis is to provide officials with the tendency of COVID-19 spreading, as well as gauge the effects of preventives measures using mathematical tools. Several other papers developed mathematical models for COVID-19 for particular regions in the globe and particular intervals of time, e.g., in [1] a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model to the analysis of data from the Brazilian Department of Health, obtained from 26 February 2020 to 25 March 2020 is proposed to better understand the early evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil; in [2] , a new COVID-19 epidemic model with media coverage and quarantine is constructed on the basis of the total confirmed new cases in the UK from 1 February 2020 to 23 March 2020; arXiv:2102.04260v1 [q-bio.PE] 4 Feb 2021Based on the epidemiological feature of COVID-19 and the several strategies imposed by the government, with different degrees, to fight against this pandemic, we extend the classical SIR model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Morocco. In particular, we divide the population into eight classes, denoted by S, I s , I a , F b , F g , F c , R and M, where S represents the susceptible individuals; I s the symptomatic infected individuals, which have not yet been treated; I a the asymptomatic infected individuals who are infected but do not transmit the disease; F b , F g and F c denote the patients diagnosed, supported by the Moroccan health system and under quarantine, and subdivided into three categories: benign, severe and critical forms, respectively. Finally, R and M are the recovered and fatality classes. This model satisfies the following assumptions:(1) all coefficients involved in the model are positive constants;(2) natural birth and death rate are not factors; (3) true asymptomatic patients will stay asymptomatic until recovery and do not spread the virus; (4) patients who are temporarily asymptomatic are included on symptomatic ones; (5) the second infection is not considered in the model; (6) the Moroccan health system is not overwhelmed.According to the above assumptions and the actual strategies imposed by the Moroccan authorities, the spread of COVID-19 in the population is modeled by the following system of delayed differential equations (DDEs):where t ∈ R + , N represents the total population size and u ∈ [0, 1] denotes the level of the preventive strategies on the susceptible population. The parameter β indicates the transmission rate and ∈ [0, 1] is the proportion for the symptomatic individuals. The parameter α denotes the proportion of the diagnosed symptomatic infected population that moves to the three forms: F b , F g and F c , by the rates γ b , γ g and γ c , respectively. The mean recovery period of these forms are denoted by 1/r b , 1/r g and 1/r c , respectively. The latter forms die also with the rates µ b , µ g and µ c , respectively. Asymptomatic infected population, which are not diagnosed, recover with rate η a and the symptomatic infected ones recover or die with rates η s and µ s , respectively. The time delays τ 1 , τ 2 , τ 3 and τ 4 denote the incubation period, the period of time needed before the charge by the health system, the time required before the death of individuals coming from the compartments I s , F b , F g , and F c , respectively. At each instant of time,population is here assumed to be constant, that is, N(t) ≡ N during the period under study. This assumption is also reinforced by the fact that the Moroccan authorities have closed geographic borders.The initial conditions of system (1) arewhere τ = max{τ 1 , τ 2 , τ 3 , τ 4 }. Let C = C([−τ, 0], R 8 ) be the Banach space of continuous functions from the interval [−τ, 0] into R 8 equipped with the uniform topology. It follows from the theory of functional differential equations [16] that system (1) with initial conditions (ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 3 , ϕ 4 , ϕ 5 , ϕ 6 , ϕ 7 , ϕ 8 ) ∈ C has a unique solution. On the other hand, due to continuous fluctuation in the environment, the parameters of the system are actually not absolute constants and always fluctuate randomly around some average value. Hence, using delayed stochastic differential equations (DSDEs) to model the epidemic provide some additional degree of realism compared to their deterministic counterparts. The parameters β and α play an important role in controlling and preventing COVID-19 spreading and they are not completely known, but subject to some random environmental effects. We introduce randomness into system (1) by applying the technique of parameter perturbation, which has been used by many researchers (see, e.g., [17] [18] [19] ). In agreement, we replace the parameters β and α by β → β + σ 1Ḃ1 (t) and α → α + σ 2Ḃ2 (t), where B 1 (t) and B 2 (t) are independent standard Brownian motions defined on a complete probability space (Ω, F , P) with a filtration {F t } t≥0 satisfying the usual conditions (i.e., it is increasing and right continuous while F 0 contains all P-null sets) and σ i represents the intensity of B i for i = 1, 2. Therefore, we obtain the following model governed by delayed stochastic differential equations:where the coefficients are locally Lipshitz with respect to all the variables, for all t ∈ R + . Let us denote R 8We have the following result. (3), there is a unique solutionto the COVID-19 stochastic model (4) that remains in R 8 + with a probability of one.Proof. Since the coefficients of the stochastic differential equations with several delays (4) are locally Lipschitz continuous, it follows from [20] that for any square integrable initial value x(0) ∈ R 8 + , which is independent of the considered standard Brownian motion B, there exists a unique local solution x(t) on t ∈ [0, τ e ), where τ e is the explosion time. For showing that this solution is global, knowing that the linear growth condition is not verified, we need to prove thatFor each integer k ≥ k 0 , we define the stopping timeDefine the twice differentiable function W on R * 3 + → R + as follows:T with the superscript ""T "" representing transposition, and L is the differential operator of function W defined byThus,We now apply the elementary inequality 2xy ≤ x 2 + y 2 , valid for any x, y ∈ R, by firstly taking x = β (1 − u) and y = S(t) + I s (t) + I a (t) and, secondly,In this way, we easily increase the right-hand side of inequality (5) to obtain thatbetween t 0 and t ∧ τ k and acting the expectation, which eliminates the martingale part, we getEW(x(s)))ds and Gronwall's inequality implies thatFor ω ∈ {τ k ≤ T}, x i (τ k ) equals k or 1 k for some i = 1, 2, 3. Hence,It follows thatLetting k → ∞, we get P(τ e ≤ T) = 0. Since T is arbitrary, we obtain P(τ e = ∞) = 1. By defining the stopping, k for some i = 4, . . . , 8 , and considering the twice differentiable functionW onwe deduce, with the same technique, that all the variables of the system are positive on [0, ∞).The basic reproduction number, as a measure for disease spread in a population, plays an important role in the course and control of an ongoing outbreak [21] . This number is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual. Note that the calculation of the basic reproduction number R 0 does not depend on the variables of the system but depends on its parameters. In addition, the R 0 of our model does not depend on the time delays. For this reason, we use the next-generation matrix approach outlined in [22] to compute R 0 . Precisely, the basic reproduction number R 0 of system (1) is given bywhere ρ is the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix FV −1 withNoting that the classes that are directly involved in the spread of disease are only I s , I a , F b , F g and F c , we can reduce the local stability of system (1) to the local stability ofThe other classes are uncoupled to the equations of system (1) and the total population size N is constant. Then, we can easily obtain the following analytical results:Let E = (I s , I a , F b , F g , F c ) be an arbitrary equilibrium, and consider into system (7), the following change of unknowns:By substituting U i (t), i = 1, 2, . . . , 5, into system (7) and linearizing around the free equilibrium, we get a new system that is equivalent towhere X(t) = (U 1 (t), U 2 (t), U 3 (t), U 4 (t), U 5 (t)) T and A, B, C are the Jacobian matrix of (7) given byThe characteristic equation of system (7) is given by P(λ) = (λ − a 1 (R 0 e −λτ 1 − 1))(λ + η a )(λ + (µ b + r b ))(λ + (µ g + r g ))(λ + (µ c + r c )),whereClearly, the characteristic Equation (10) has the roots λ 1 = −η a , λ 2 = −(µ b + r b ), λ 3 = −(µ g + r g ), λ 4 = −(µ c + r c ) and the root of the equationWe suppose Re(λ) ≥ 0. From (11), we getOn the other hand, we show that (11) has a real positive root when R 0 > 1. Indeed, we putWe have that Φ(0) = −a 1 (R 0 − 1) < 0, lim λ→+∞ Φ(λ) = +∞ and function Φ is continuous on (0, +∞). Consequently, Φ has a positive root and the following result holds. Theorem 2. The disease free equilibrium of system (1), that is, (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) , is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1 and unstable if R 0 > 1.Knowing the value of the deterministic threshold R 0 characterizes the dynamical behavior of system (1) and guarantees persistence or extinction of the disease. Similarly, now we characterize the dynamical behavior of system (4) by a sufficient condition for extinction of the disease.Then,Namely, I s (t) tends to zero exponentially almost surely, that is, the disease dies out with a probability of one.LetTo simplify, we setThen, we getIntegrating both sides of the above inequality between 0 and t, one haswhereWe haveThen,From the large number theorem for martingales [23] , we deduce thatWe also haveThen,We conclude that if β 2 2σ 2 1 − α − (1 − α)(µ s + η s ) < 0, then lim I(t) t→∞ = 0. This completes the proof.Estimating the model parameters poses a big challenge because the COVID-19 situation changes rapidly and from one country to another. The parameters are likely to vary over time as new policies are introduced on a day-to-day basis. For this reason, in order to simulate the COVID-19 models (1) and (4), we consider some parameter values from the literature, while the remaining ones are estimated or fitted.As the transmission rate β is unknown, we carry out the least-square method [10] to estimate this parameter, based on the actual official reported confirmed cases from 2 March to 20 March, 2020 [24] . Through this method, we estimated β as 0.4517 (95%CI, 0.4484-0.455). Since the life expectancy for symptomatic individuals is 21 days on average and the crude mortality ratio is between 3% to 4% [25] , we estimated µ s = 0.01/21 per day and η s = 0.8/21 per day. Furthermore, since the hospitals are not yet saturated and the epidemic situation is under control, we assume that mortality comes mainly from critical forms with a percentage of 40% for an average period of 13.5 days [25] . Then, we choose µ c = 0.4/13.5 per day and r c = 0.6/13.5 per day. According to [26] , the proportion of asymptomatic individuals varies from 20.6% to 39.9% and of symptomatic individuals from 60.1% and 79.4% of the infected population. The progression rates γ b , γ g and γ c , from symptomatic infected individuals to the three forms, are assumed to be 80% of diagnosed cases for benign form, 15% of diagnosed cases for severe form, and 5% of diagnosed cases for critical form, respectively [25] . The incubation period is estimated to be 5.5 days [27, 28] while the time needed before hospitalization is to be 7.5 days [29] [30] [31] . Following a clinical observation related to the situation of COVID-19 in Morocco, an evolution of symptomatic individuals is estimated towards recovery or death after 21 days without any clinical intervention. In the case when clinical intervention is applied, we estimate the evolution of the critical forms towards recovery or death after 13.3 days. The rest of the parameter values are shown in Table 1 . In this section, we present the forecasts of COVID-19 in Morocco related to different strategies implemented by Moroccan authorities.Taking into account the four levels of measures attached to containment, the effectiveness level of the applied Moroccan preventive measures is estimated to be In Figure 1 , we see that the plots and the clinical data are globally homogeneous. In addition, the last daily reported cases in Morocco [32], confirm the biological tendency of our model. Thus, our models are efficient to describe the spread of COVID-19 in Morocco. However, we note that some clinical data are far from the values of the models due to certain foci that appeared in some large areas or at the level of certain industrial areas. We conclude also that the stochastic behavior of COVID-19 presents certain particularities contrary to the deterministic one, namely the magnitude of its peak is higher and the convergence to eradication is faster. On the other hand, the conditions in Theorems 2 and 3 are verified. More precisely, the basic reproduction number R 0 = 0.5230 is less than one from 12 May 2020 and σ 2 1 = 1.0609 > 1.0598 =, which means that the eradication of disease is ensured.To prove the biological importance of delay parameters, we give the graphical results of Figure 2 , which describe the evolution of diagnosed positive cases with and without delays. We observe in Figure 2 , a high impact of delays on the number of diagnosed positive cases, thereby the plot of model (4) without delays (τ i = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is very different to that of the clinical data. Thus, we conclude that delays play an important role in the study of the dynamic behavior of COVID-19 worldwide, especially in Morocco, and allow us to better understand the reality.In Figure 3 , we present the forecast of susceptible, severe forms of deaths and critical forms, from which we deduce that COVID-19 will not attack the total population. In addition, the number of hospitalization beds or artificial respiration apparatus required can be estimated by the number of different clinical forms. Moreover, we see that the number of deaths given by the model is less than those declared in other countries [33] , which shows that Morocco has avoided a dramatic epidemic situation by imposing the described strategies.Finally, we present in Figure 4 , the cumulative diagnosed cases, severe forms, deaths and critical forms 240 days from the start of the pandemic in Morocco. We summarize some important numbers in Table 2 , which gives us some information about the future epidemic situation in Morocco. In this study, we proposed a new deterministic model with delay and its corresponding stochastic model to describe the dynamic behavior of COVID-19 in Morocco. These models provide us with the evolution and prediction of important categories of individuals to be monitored, namely, the positive diagnosed cases, which can help to examine the efficiency of the measures implemented in Morocco, and the different developed forms, which can quantify the capacity of the public health system as well as the number of new deaths. Firstly, we have shown that our models are mathematically and biologically well posed by proving global existence and uniqueness of positive solutions. Secondly, the extinction of the disease was established. By analyzing the characteristic equation, we proved that if R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium of the deterministic model is locally asymptotically stable (Theorem 2). Based on the Lyapunov analysis method, a sufficient condition for the extinction was obtained in the stochastic case (Theorem 3). Thirdly, and since there is a substantial interest in estimating the parameters, we applied the least square method to determine the confidence interval of the transmission rate β as 0.4517 (95%CI, 0.4484-0.455). In addition, the rest of the parameters were either assumed, based on some daily observations, or taken from the available literature. Finally, some numerical simulations were performed to gather information in order to be able to fight against the propagation of the new coronavirus. In 12 May 2020, the basic reproduction number was less than one (R 0 = 0.5230), which means that the epidemic was tending toward eradication, which is conditional on strict compliance with the implemented measures. Currently, the consequences of the measures taken against COVID-19 in Morocco encourage their maintenance to control the spread of the epidemic and quickly move towards extinction.","Morocco","abstract","2021-02-04",2

Vaccines have played a significant role in increasing the life expectancy and reducing the under-five mortality rate in Kenya. The life expectancy at birth was 66.7 years and the under-five mortality rate was 45 per 1,000 live births in 2019 [2] . There has been more than a 50% reduction in under-five mortality rate from 1,869 to 831 deaths per 100,000 from 2000 to 2019 among under-5 year-old children [3] .The World Health Organization (WHO) established the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) in 1974 to improve access to immunisation services worldwide [4] . Kenya launched its EPI program in 1980 to improve and expand immunisation for six priority diseases -diphtheria, measles, polio, tetanus, tuberculosis, and pertussis, and the number of vaccines has since expanded [5] . New Improvements in national immunisation coverage mask differences in coverage between population sub-groups in Kenya. In 2014, there was a 17.7 percentage point difference in DPT3 immunisation coverage between the highest coverage in Central province and the lowest in North Eastern province [9] . With almost 1.5 million children born each year in Kenya, relatively small proportional differences in immunisation coverage between subgroups translates into large absolute numbers of under-immunised and zero-dose children [10] . As a result, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance has identified Kenya as a Tier 1 Priority Country for support in achieving high and equitable immunisation coverage, and has invested more than USD 500 million to strengthen routine and campaign immunisation services in Kenya [11, 12] .The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has collected nationally representative data on population health through more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries [13] . These surveys provide estimates of key indicators that cover population, maternal and child health issues.We used the Kenya DHS 2014 dataset to analyse childhood immunisation coverage and estimate equity outcomes [14] . This is the most recent complete Kenya DHS survey and was conducted from May to October 2014; the 2021 survey is in progress. Sampling was conducted in two stages to achieve representativeness at the national, regional, and county levels. The first stage involved the random sampling of 1,612 enumeration areas from 96,251 areas across Kenya. The second stage involved the random sampling of 25 households from each enumeration area. This resulted in a total sample of 40,300 households.Survey data regarding children, including their immunisation status, was obtained from interviews with the 31,079 eligible women in the sampled households. Data on the immunisation status of children was collected using written immunisation records and, for children where this was not possible, using verbal reports from mothers.Kenya was the first country to launch the pentavalent (DTP-HepB-Hib) vaccine with Gavi support in 2001 [15] . The pentavalent vaccine uptake is recorded and not individual antigens, and thereby DTP coverage is assumed from pentavalent coverage. While the 2014 Kenya DHS data set includes coverage data for first, second, and third doses of DTP, this is based on the coverage of the pentavalent vaccine and thereby used as the measure for the pentavalent vaccine coverage. Also, the coverage metrics for DTP3, HepB3, and Hib3 from the WHO and UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) are similar for Kenya in 2014 [16] .We analysed full immunisation coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Kenya. Full immunisation refers to one dose of BCG, three doses of DTP-HepB-Hib, three doses of polio (excluding the birth dose), one dose of measles, and three doses of pneumococcal vaccines. We did not consider the rotavirus vaccine since it was introduced in Kenya's routine immunization schedule only in July 2014, after surveying had begun.We disaggregated mean coverage by socioeconomic (household wealth, religion, ethnicity), geographic (place of residence, location/region), maternal (age at childbirth, education, marital status, status within household), child (sex of child, birth order), and place of birth. We conducted simple and multivariable logistic regression to assess associations between full immunisation coverage and socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics.Sampling weights were applied to the survey dataset. The survey analysis was conducted using the Stata statistical software [18] and visualisations were generated using the R statistical software [19] .Immunisation status data was collected for 3,965 living children aged 12-23 months in the 2014 Kenya DHS Survey. We excluded data for 22 children who had missing or unknown data across the full recommended course of routine vaccines, and we conducted our analysis using data for 3,943 children with full immunisation status (1-dose BCG, 3-dose DTP-HepB-Hib, 3-dose polio, 1-dose measles, and 3-dose pneumococcal vaccines). The proportions of male and female children were similar at 52% and 48% respectively. Figure 1 shows full immunisation coverage in the eight regions (defunct provinces) of Kenya. Full immunisation coverage ranged from 42% [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] in the North Eastern region to 78%[72-83] in the Central and Eastern regions.Equity impact: Socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics Figure 2 presents the full immunisation coverage in Kenya among children aged 12-23 months disaggregated by socioeconomic (household wealth, religion, ethnicity), geographic (place of residence, region), maternal (maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal marital status, maternal household head status), child (sex of child, birth order), and place of birth characteristics.Children in the Coast, Western, Central, and Eastern regions had at least 74% higher odds of being fully immunised compared to children in the North Eastern region. Further, children in urban areas had 26% lower odds of full immunisation in comparison to children in rural areas. Children in the middle and richer wealth quintile households were 43-57% more likely to have full immunisation coverage in comparison to children in the poorest wealth quintile households. Children who were sixth born or higher had 37% lower odds of full immunisation compared to first-born children.We tested for interaction between maternal age at birth and maternal education, household wealth and maternal age at birth, household wealth and maternal education, and household wealth and place of residence. Full vaccination coverage was higher among children of mothers of age 20 years or older who have at least primary education in comparison to no education, among children living in poorest and richer households (that is first and fourth quintiles by household wealth) with mothers of at least primary education in comparison to no education, and among children living in the wealthier households (that is fourth and fifth quintiles by household wealth) of rural areas in comparison to urban areas.We analysed full immunisation coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Kenya and estimated the inequities in full immunisation coverage associated with socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics using data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey. We found that inequities in full immunisation primarily affect children born into poorer households, born to mothers with no education and with many siblings/children in the same household, and in regions with limited health infrastructure. Belonging to richer versus poorer households, born to an educated versus uneducated mothers, and born in a clinical versus home setting are all associated with higher full immunisation coverage. Children in rural areas and the Rift Valley, Coast, Western, Central, and Eastern regions had higher full immunisation coverage while children who were sixth born or higher had lower full immunisation coverage.Our findings complement the evidence from related cross-sectional studies. Calhoun et al analysed data from Gem, Nyanza province, Kenya in 2003 and found that lower immunisation coverage among children aged 12-23 months was associated with lower maternal income, lower maternal education, and households with an absent parent [20] . Mutua et al analysed data from two slums of Nairobi in 2008 and found that incomplete childhood immunisation was associated with fewer household assets and expenditure, ethnicity, place of delivery, maternal education, and maternal age [21] . Masters et al used data from the 2014 Kenya DHS with a primary focus on the Somali ethnic community and found that childhood immunisation status was associated with wealth and place of birth [22] . Subaiya et al analysed the data from the national measles-rubella immunisation campaign for children aged 9 months to 14 years conducted in 2016 and found that immunisation coverage was strongly associated with children's school attendance, maternal education, and household wealth [23] . Ifedayo et al analysed the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System and inferred that younger maternal age, more previous children, and delivery in hospital were associated with higher immunisation coverage and the strongest detrimental factor was the operational challenge of vaccine stock outs [24] .Children living more than two hours away from health facilities providing immunisation are less likely to be fully immunised and receive DPT3 after controlling for household wealth, mother's highest education level, parity and urban/rural residence [27] . Of Kenya's 47 counties, 29 counties do not meet the national policy target of 90% of the population living within one hour at walking speed of a health facility offering immunisation services [27, 28] . But, we inferred that children living in urban areas were less likely to be immunised than children in rural areas. Similar associations have been found in previous studies, with residents of urban slums, who are typically much poorer than other urban residents, often driving part of the inequities [20, 29] . Residents in urban slums have limited access to employment, water and sanitation, are inadequately served with basic public services such as immunisation and education, and have the worst health and socio-economic outcomes among all social groups in Kenya [30] . Urban slums also tend to have higher rates of population growth compared to non-slum urban areas, which further exacerbates the relative inequities in childhood immunisation coverage.As inferred by the multicollinearity between the defunct provinces and ethnicity, the regional differences in immunisation coverage are closely linked to the distribution of different ethnic groups across Kenya. The Central province has a large proportion of people of Kikuyu ethnicity and children have higher rates of immunisation coverage [31] . The North Eastern province borders Somalia and is home to millions of people of Somali ethnicity who have the lowest immunisation coverage of any ethnic group in Kenya [22] . Migrants from Somalia -whether refugees, asylum seekers, or economic migrants -find it harder and are typically more reluctant to access public services such as immunization services due to discrimination and unfamiliarity with the system [32] . The North Eastern province is also home to the Dadaab refugee camp which houses more than 200,000 Somali refugees and is one of the largest refugee camps in the world [33] . Low immunisation rates in the refugee camp has led to prior outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases [34] .In 2010, Kenya adopted a new constitution that devolved administrative powers, including the responsibility for health and health care, to 47 county governments which are one administrative level below the now-defunct provincial system. This decentralization of power presents a critical opportunity for county governments in provinces with low immunisation coverage to reprioritize and redistribute funds towards improving the availability and accessibility of immunization services, particularly to marginalised populations.Maternal education is a strong predictor of full immunisation coverage and is a consistent finding across related studies in Kenya and other countries [35, 36] .Mothers with at least some education are more aware of the importance of childhood immunisation, either through education or by being exposed to school-based immunization programs themselves [25] .Being born into a family with few other children was associated with full immunisation, and has also been inferred by related studies in Kenya [37, 38] . Parents with fewer children have more time to care for each child and are less likely to need to organize childcare for their other children while they travel to a health facility for immunization.Children born in clinical settings and health facilities in Kenya are more likely to be fully immunised than the children born in home settings, as also observed in related studies [22, 39] . Health workers at clinical facilities are more likely to vaccinate the children with the birth dose of BCG and inform mothers on the recommended immunisation schedule in comparison to traditional birth attendants who support home-deliveries in Kenya [22, 40] . Also, mothers giving birth in clinical settings practice relatively higher health-seeking behaviours, including immunisation for themselves and their children [37] .Coverage for vaccines in the first few months after birth, including BCG at birth and first dose of the pentavalent vaccine, have higher coverage than those administered towards the end of the first year such as the first dose of measles containing vaccine. Thereby, concerted effort is required to keep mothers engaged with health facilities and immunisation services after the first few weeks post-birth. Missed opportunities for vaccination occur when children have contact with health services either directly, or indirectly through attending with family, but do not receive vaccine doses for which they are eligible [41] .They are attributed in part due to knowledge gaps in the routine immunisation schedule and issues in vaccine supply and vaccine-related equipment such as syringes and vaccination record books [42] .We did not include the rotavirus vaccine or the second-dose of measles vaccine in our analysis, as both were introduced after the 2014 Kenya DHS survey -in 2014 and 2015, respectively [43] . Our study is also subject to similar biases associated with DHS surveys, such as measurement bias, recall bias, and social desirability bias which tend to overestimate immunisation coverage. Also, we are unable to infer temporal inferences and causal-effect relationships due to the cross-sectional study design.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine childhood immunisation and led to the suspension of supplementary immunisation activities in many countries including Kenya [44] [45] [46] . Immunisation services have been disrupted in both fixed post and outreach immunisation activities due to health workers being redeployed to the COVID-19 response and parents being unable or unwilling to bring their children into health facilities because of restrictions on movements, economic hardships, or the fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 while attending health facilities, among other reasons [44] . These disruptions to immunisation services are likely to expand the equity gap and this should receive attention as part of efforts to restore health services and provide catch-up vaccination.The inequities in full immunisation coverage are primarily affecting children born into poorer households, to mothers with no education and with many other children, and in provinces with limited health infrastructure. These under-immunised and zero-dose children, who are already at a socioeconomic disadvantage in early life, are more susceptible to infectious diseases which worsens their early childhood development with potential lifelong sequelae or death. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine and campaign immunisation services in 2020, but it also presents an opportunity to tackle the identified inequities as immunisation services are restored to capacity.SA and KA conceptualised the study and SA undertook the analysis and wrote the initial draft. KA and IMOA contributed to the analysis, interpretation of results, and the final drafting of the manuscript.","Kenya","abstract","2021-02-16",2

Background about the concept of quantum computing (Qubits, and quantum gates) and CNNs are presented in Section 3. The hybrid proposed HQCNN model is introduced in detail in Section 4. Section 5 presents the used datasets, performance measures, and the experimental results of the hybrid HQCNN model. Finally, the conclusion of this work and future research are delineated in Section 6.This section provides various works of COVID-19 classification based on CNNs that had recently been presented by researchers. Related works are divided into studies based on CXR images and studies based on CT scans.In [25] , a CNNs model (i.e., VGG19, Xception, MobileNetv2) based on transfer learning is proposed to extract meaningful biomarkers of coronavirus patients. Furthermore, the used dataset is collected with 224 COVID-19, 714 pneumonia (bacterial and viral), and 504 normal CXR images to evaluate the performance of CNNs models on the classification of medical images. The results are reported with 96.78% accuracy, 98.66% sensitivity, and 96.46% specificity. A patch-based technique utilizing statistical analysis with ResNet18 and fully convolutional-DenseNet103 architectures is presented in [26] . Due to the lack of CXR images for COVID-19, this technique is used with a small dataset to classify COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the proposed technique has achieved an accuracy of 88.9% and a precision of 83.4%. In another study [27] , a deep CNNs model is introduced to detect positive patients of COVID-19, called Truncated InceptionNet. The inceptionNetV3 is modified with the Truncated model to deal with limited datasets of COVID-19 to reduce over-fitting. Besides, 162 COVID-19 confirmed cases are added to six several datasets. The proposed model is evaluated with different datasets to test the ability of the Truncated InceptionNet model for predicting positive cases of COVID-19 of each dataset. This model achieved 99.9% accuracy for the fifth dataset with 162 COVID-19,1583 normal, and 4280 pneumonia. The DarkNet technique is presented for COVID-19 classification on CXR images in [28] . This model is predicted COVID-19 cases without using a feature extractor algorithms. The DarkNet model is applied as a classifier for YOLO object detection. This model is used with binary and multi-class COVID-19 classification. The DarkNet model is achieved 98.08%, 95.13%,95.30%, 96.51% for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-measure, respectively. Besides, the model is achieved 87.02% of accuracy for a multi-class dataset. In another work [29] , a hybrid CNN-LSTM model is presented using CNNs and long short-term memory to detect COVID- 19 The previous studies faced inconsistency issues due to a variety of methods, images, a variety of data. A brief comparison of the previous research has been presented in terms of the applied methods, images, data, and classification performance (as shown in Table 1 ). Since chest CXR and CT scans are the second tools to diagnose and detect the COVID-19 pandemic, so the classification of COVID-19 has become a hot area of research. The researchers collected datasets from several resources to train and test the models as shown in Table 1 . There is no a standard dataset due to the shortage of COVID-19 images. Most of the state-of-the-art COVID-19 classification is designed to fit the currently limited images as [26, 27] and to help in early diagnosis for COVID-19 cases. There studies focus on prediction confirmed COVID-19 from COVID-19 and normal datasets such as [28] and another focus on differentiating confirmed COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases [27, 38, 32] . Therefore, the prediction of COVID-19 still needs to further accurate and faster models to assist the radiologists in coming early diagnosis and treatment.In this section, an introduction about some of the concepts quantum computing used in this work like the quantum bit, quantum gates, and architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). If the reader is familiar with these concepts may skip this subsection.Quantum computing relies on postulates and characteristics of quantum mechanics (i.e., quantum bits, interference, superposition, and entanglement) to information processing. Quantum computing gives us the ability to solve complex problems better and faster than classical computing [40, 41] . Qubit is the small unit to process information in a quantum computer like the bit in classical computing. A qubit can also be in one-state, zero-state, or both of states at the same time known as linear superposition. The qubit is a state vector in Hilbert space.Where θ and δ are the probability amplitudes that represented by complex numbers and |θ 2 | + |δ 2 | = 1From the postulates of quantum mechanics, any unitary transformation (unitary matrix) is a quantum gate. Matrix to be unitary, the following condition must be verified:where U † is the conjugate transpose of a matrix U and I is an identity matrix. Quantum gates can be classified based on numbers of qubits: one-qubit gates, two-qubits gates, and multiple-qubits gates [42, 43] . Firstly, from the most popular and widely used gate in one-qubit gates is a Hadamard gate or square-root of NOT gate. The use of the Hadamard gate to present qubits into superposition. Pauli gates also are one-qubit gates. Secondly, two-qubits gates which work on 4x4 unitary matrices. For example, Controlled NOT, and swap gate. Lastly, multiple-qubits gates which work on multiple qubits as 2 n x 2 n unitary matrices such as Toffoli and SWAP gates. Table 2 shows quantum gates with circuit representation, unitary matrix, the number of qubits, and the operation of the gate.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [44] inspired by convolution operation to produce a convolutional (Conv) layer that is the heart of the CNNs. As illustrated in Figure 1 , the basic architecture of CNNs is similar to a multi-layer perceptron starts with the input image and sequence of hidden layers to predict labels over the output layer. The layers of CNNs are explained in detail in Section 4. The CNNs play a critical role in computer vision applications such as image classification [27] , image segmentation [45] , object detection [46] , and signal processing [47] . Various models had been developed based on the concepts of CNNs as ResNet50, and VGG-19.The proposed hybrid quantum-classical CNNs model (HQCNN) aims to improve CNNs classification for medical images and predict COVID-19 and healthy patients in early stages. The main idea of the HQCNN model is based on hybrid computation to enhance the performance of classical learning [48] . The proposed model consists of two parts: first, the quantum part has utilized the quantum Conv layer, which is proposed by Henderson et al. [23] . Second, the classical part with CNNs structure. As shown in Figure 2 , the HQCNN model has one quantum Conv layer, three Conv layers followed by the rectified linear unit activation function, two max-pooling layers, and followed by two fully connected layers. The layers of the model are presented in detail in the following steps. Pauli-X 0 1 1 0 1 Flip quantum bit from state to another.Make π-rotation for quantum bit around the Y-axis.Make π -rotation for quantum bit around the Z-axis. Controlled-Controlled NOT (CC Not) gate. Flip target quantum bit if both control two quantum bits equal one.The proposed HQCNN model has used quantum convolution that is presented by the Maxwell Henderson et al. [23] . Quantum convolution works as small random quantum circuits (RQCs) to calculate convolution operation and can implement on near-term quantum hardware. This circuit has applied with local locations of input images to extract elementary and informative features. The quantum convolution layer consists of three phases: encoding, random quantum circuit, and decoding(as shown in Figure 2 ).Up till now, the encoding data to quantum is a challenge in quantum machine learning (QML) [49] . Several encoding methods have been discussed in [50] . In this work, angle encoding has been used to transform input data into rotation angles of quantum states. The angle rotations gates are the simplest encoding methods to access data into a quantum circuit. In this study, due to needing the single quantum gate for each entry to encode data. These gates are corresponding to encode classical pixel data to a quantum state. Rotation matrices are rotation operators of Pauli-matrices in the form of exponential around X, Y , Z axes (as seen in Table 1 ). Three rotation gates Rx, Ry, Rz are a single quantum bit rotation via angle α around X, Y , and Z axes, respectively. The RY and RX rotation gates can be represented by the following equations.A quantum circuit is a series of quantum unitary operations (or gates) and measurements connected via wires (Qubits). Just like the classical Conv layer, quantum Conv layer composed of quantum kernels apply to the input image. The main idea of quantum convolution utilizing random quantum circuits to split input image into small local locations to extract meaningful features. The advantages of the quantum circuit in quantum convolution works with a few quantum bits and shallow-depth of quantum circuits. The measurement phase is also known as the decoding phase. Decoding is measuring quantum data to transform into classical form. Pauli matrices can use as measurement methods [51] . In the HQCNN model, the Pauli-Z gate is used to the decoding phase (as seen in Table 2 ).Conv layer is the pivotal and significant layer in the feature extraction part of CNN. This layer performs convolution operation on input features with kernels to extract invariant and informative features from images as convoluted features map to the next layer. Convolution operation computes dot products between small local locations of the input image and kernels [28, 52] .Where * is the convolution operation to produce a convoluted feature map, F is the input feature, and K is kernel or filter. Conv layer has been followed by the ReLU function transformation to add activation values into the model network. The function returns 0 for all negative values and returns the maximum value for all positive values. The ReLU function can be defined by the following formula:Where x is an input value. Max-pooling layer has used to reduce computational learning by selection the most important and valuable features. Convoluted feature maps have been divided into small regions based on the stride number. The max-pooling idea has taken the maximum value of each small location to produce pooled feature maps. Before the classification part, flatten is used to link two parts in CNNs by converting the max-pooled feature map into a 1-dimensional array.The Fully Connected (FC) layer is the second part of the CNNs structure. The fully connected layers perform the classification process after the flattening layer by applied weights to predict classes. The dropout layer is used after the FC layer to reduce the overfitting of the model (as shown in Figure 2 ). Figure 3 illustrates the flowchart of the HQCNN model: the proposed HQCNN model has nine layers, one quantum Conv layer, three classical Conv layers with ReLU function, two max-pooling layers, two FC layers with ReLU function, and one output layer is applied with a softmax activation function. The quantum Conv layer is used encoding method with RY rotation gate and decoding with the Pauli-Z gate. The three classical Conv layers are used with 2D CNNs and are combined with the max-pooling layer. Each max-pooling layer is performed with a 2 x 2 kernel size and the stride equal to 2, followed by a dropout layer with a 0.2 dropout rate. The two FC layers are applied with 300 and 100 neurons for the first and second layers, respectively. The total parameters for the HQCNN model are 120,394. Table 3 shows the summary layers of the proposed HQCNN model.This section introduces the used images dataset, the performance measures to evaluate the HQCNN model, and the analysis and discussion of experimental results.The used CXR COVID- 19 Table 4 summarizes the used CXR images in this work. Figure 4 shows samples from the used images. Figure 4 : Samples of used images.The most common measures for evaluating classification models are confusion matrix with measures metrics like accuracy, specificity (or true-negative rate), sensitivity (Recall or true-positive rate), precision, and F1-measure. Accuracy(Acc.) = T P + T N/(T P + T N + F P + F N )Sensitivity(Sns.) = T P/T P + F N (8)Specif icity(Spc.) = T N/T N + F P (9) P recision(P rc.) = T P/T P + F P (10) Figure 5 : Samples of normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia images are processed by random quantum circuit.F alseP ositiveRate = F P/F P + T NReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve identifies as ROC-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) is the method to measure the ability of the classifier to predict the right labels. The ROC is a curve between the true-positive rate (sensitivity) and the false-positive rate (1 − sensitivity). Fbeta-measure is the weighted harmonic average of precision and recall of the HQCNN model.Experimental results have been implemented on Google Colaboratory by using PennyLane and TensorFlow with Keras. PennyLane is a cross-platform Python library for hybrid quantum-classical computation [48] . The main aim of the HQCNN model is to use the concept of the quantum circuit to enhance the performance of the classical CNNs model and the prediction of infected cases of COVID-19 with higher results. RQC works with (2x2) small squares of an input image. Each (2x2) square of the image is encoded into a quantum state by the RY gate. The decoding of the quantum state into classical produces a new four features of a small square. Figure 5 shows samples of normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 images, which are examined by the RQC. The first column shows the input image with 28 x 28 size and divided by 250. The quantum Conv layer assigns a feature map into four channels. The quantum Conv layer is used only as a preprocessing layer to CXR images. The train and test phases will be completed on quantum preprocess data with CNNs layers.At the beginning of the evaluation, the proposed model is evaluated with RY and RX gates to encode data into RQC. RY and RX gates have been used with a different number of shots (500 and 1000). As to be noted from Table 5 , the RY gate (1000 shots) achieved higher results 97.6%, 99.3%, 96.5%, 94.9, and 97% for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-measure, respectively.As shown in Figure 6a , the RY gate (1000 shots) achieved 97.9 % of balanced accuracy. Besides, the RY gate (1000 shots) obtained the largest AUC-ROC with 99.7% closer to 1. The test loss curve of the HQCNN model with RY (1000 shots) continues to reduce until the end of the test phase. The test loss with RY (1000 shots) is 0.07%. In addition, the test loss with RY (500 shots) is 0.09%, the RX achieved 0.9% and 0.1% of test loss for 1000 and 500 shots, respectively (see Figure 7 ). Figure 8 shows the confusion matrix for RY and RX with a different number of shots. The RY (1000 Table 5 The performance of HQCNN model with rotation gates and number of shots on D1. shots) has predicted the highest number of positive cases of COVID-19 (150 of 151 cases), as shown in Figure 8c . Increasing the number of shots will calculate the better estimation of the output statistic of observables (i.e., expectation value and variance).As mentioned above, increasing the number of shots increases the performance of the model. Besides, the encoding method (RY) can be improved the overall results of the model. So, the experimental results will be completed with an encoding angle (RY gate) and 1000 shots. As shown in Table 6 , the performance HQCNN model outperforms CNN and other models. The hybrid proposed model has predicted COVID-19, and normal patients with 98.4% of accuracy, 99.3% of sensitivity, 97.8% of specificity, 96.7% of precision, and 98% of F1-measure. The MLP model outperforms the HQCNN model in measure of sensitivity, it achieved a sensitivity of 100%. Besides, as observed from Figure 9a proposed hybrid model has achieved higher balanced accuracy and Fbeta-measure with 98.6% and 98.4%, respectively. Additionally, The HQCNN model scored the largest AUC of ROC curve with 0.99%(near to 1) compared by various models, as shown in Figure 10a . The confusion matrices of binary D1 is displayed in Figure 11 . The confusion matrix of the HQCNN model, among of 151 COVID-19 images, one patient is misclassified by the HQCNN model. From a total of 234 normal cases, five cases are misclassified by the HQCNN model.Here, Table 7 reports the results of the HQCNN model compared to various models on D2. the HQCNN model achieved 99%, 99.3%, 98.9%, 99.7%, and 97.5% for accuracy, F1-measure, precision, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. Besides, better-balanced accuracy has been achieved with 98.6%, 98% for HQCNN, and CNN+KNN models, respectively as shown in Figure 9b . From Figure 10b , the proposed HQCNN model achieved AUC-ROC score 100% (equal to 1). The HQCNN model distinguished between COVID-19 and pneumonia with higher efficiency. The confusion matrices of D2 have been shown in Figure 12 . From a total of 161 COVID-19 cases, four cases are To further evaluate, the imbalanced multi-class dataset is used to evaluate HQCNN performance. The dataset is combined with normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia images. Figure 13 , The AUC-ROC curve has been exhibited with three normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia classes. It can be noted that the HQCNN distinguished among three classes with higher AUC values 0.97%, 0.99%, and 0.97% for normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia classes. The confusion matrices are shown in Figure 14 . Figure 11 : The confusion matrix of the proposed HQCNN and different models for D1.high 92% sensitivity. The lower sensitivity is achieved with 77% in normal cases. The higher precision is achieved with 100% in pneumonia patients.The limitations of the HQCNN model in this work are:• The size of the COVID-19 image is used with 28x28 pixels which are divided into 4x4 pixel.• The architecture of the HQCNN model is a small to compatible with 4 qubits in the quantum simulator.• The used random quantum circuit works as preprocessing layer for images.• The size of the used images in the training phase is small.In this work, a new hybrid quantum-classical CNNs (HQCNN) model has been proposed for COVID-19 classification with chest radiography images. The aim of the HQCNN model combines the random quantum circuit with CNNs and to enhance the performance. The HQCNN model has been used the random quantum circuit as a quantum convolution layer to compute convolution operation on a quantum device. The HQCNN model has been evaluated on binary and multi-class COVID-19 datasets, it outperformed classical CNNs and various models. It achieved an accuracy of 99% and 88.6%, a sensitivity of 99.3%, and 88.7% for binary, and multi-class datasets, respectively. The future work will be highly focused on using different encoding methods (i.e., amplitude encoding) with further quantum convolutional layers. Also, we will enhance the HQCNN architecture to overcome on limitations of the proposed model. ","Egypt","first author","2021-02-08",2

It is a contagious condition causes acute respiratory syndrome (Chiappetta et al., 2020; Zabetakis et al., 2020) . The first case reported with that disease was a women in local market in Wuhan province, China in December 2019, the scientists believe it's acquired from animals and started spreading between humans (https://africacdc.org/covid-19/). The danger of that disease is the rapid spreading as it's highly contagious and its vigorous symptoms which might lead to death (Schett et al., 2020) . Up till now is available only a supportive treatment as a strategy in the treatment protocol, WHO welcomed the satisfactory results of using dexamethasone as a preliminary treatment for COVID-19 (World Health Organiztion, 2020) as it reduces the risk of mortality in infected patients for its role as anti-inflammatory reducing the immune-system cytokine storm reducing the exaggerated immune response caused by the COVID-19 (Mahmudpour et al., 2020) Inflammation is a biological body response as a result of exposure to stimuli which provokes the immune system to eliminate the harmful stimuli. Prostaglandins are responsible for the generation of any inflammatory response (Mart ınez-S anchez et al., 2020). Prostaglandins biosynthesis is markedly increased in inflamed tissue, arachidonic acid biosynthesis to prostaglandin H2 is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (Lee et al., 2017) . As a result of the human defense mechanism during the inflammation, there is an excessive production of reactive oxygen species by phagocytic leucocytes (Jayawardena et al., 2020) , here appears the role of antioxidants to scavenge the reactive species, these auxiliary process aids tissue repair and healing (Ik et al., 2013) .Plants used medicinally considered as a huge source for constituents with biological various activities. So, it was a substantial importance to seek a plant origin drug that might provide a safer therapy to control the covid-19 symptoms or as a curative treatment. Therefore, three Araucaria species were subjected for the following study to investigate their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential activities. Antiinflammatory activity for that genus was reported before using different techniques, exerting a significant results (Aslam et al., 2013; Elshamy et al., 2020) which was interesting to carry further investigations for the anti-inflammatory activity using different and accurate assay; as the enzyme immunoassay ELISA method which is performed here in the current research comparing three species.It is well known now the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 which suggests a promising effect of anti-inflammatory drugs as adjuvant therapy in COVID-19 patients to suppress the cytokine storm. Furthermore, dexamethasone was recently used to control SARS-CoV-2 progression (World Health Organiztion, 2020) . This information has encouraged us to virtually investigate our compounds to see if any of them could have a potential effect on the new COVID-19 virus possible targets. The active sites of three targets, viral main protease (M pro , 6LU7), nonstructural protein-16 which is a methyl transferase (nsp16, 6W4H) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12, 7BV2) using a published recently high-resolution structure of COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ) (Jin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) allowed the chance for the creation of an inhibitor with an important role affecting the transcription and replication of virus (Aly, 2020) . The importance of Mpro in the life cycle of coronavirus in contrast it is not present as an identical human homologues, introduced Mpro as favoured antiviral targeted drug designed (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) .A. bidwillii, A. cunninghamii and A. heterophylla leaves were collected and shed dried. The plants identity was confirmed at the Department of Flora and Phytotaxonomy, ARC, Cairo, Egypt.The powdered leaves dried in the air of A. bidwillii, A. cunninghamii and A. heterophylla weighing 200 g for each species, was separately extracted with methanol by percolation. methanolic extracts were subjected for evaporation under reduced pressure at 45 C to a constant weight then were subjected to lyophilization and kept in the dark at 4 C until analysis.Analytical grade reagents were purchased and used with no additional purification. Organic solvents: methanol, (Adwic, Nasr Pharma, Egypt), DPPH, standardized extract of Ascorbic acid., (Memphis Co., Egypt). (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical (Sigma Co., USA), COX-1 (human) Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit., by (Caymanchem, USA), Celecoxib (Pfizer Inc., Egypt).Metabolic profiling was performed on methanolic extracts of A. bidwillii, A. heterophylla and A. cunninghamii according to (Sobeh et al., 2017) . HPLC-PDA-MS/MS was carried at Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Germany using a ThermoFinnigan LC system (Thermo Electron Corporation, Austin, TX, USA). A Zorbax Eclipse (XDB-C18), Rapid resolution of 4.6 Â 150 mm, 3.5 mm column was used (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).Operating mass parameters were used in the negative mode. A combination of gradient water and acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% formic acid have been used, through 60 min in 1 mL/min flow rate and 1:1 splitted before the ESI source, acetonitrile was raised from 5% ! 30%. The samples were injected separately using the autosampler. For MS analysis, LCQ-Duo ion trap with a ThermoQuest ESI source has been used. The Xcalibur software was used (Xcalibur TM 2.0.7, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for system controlling.The plant extract ability to quench DPPH free radicals was evaluated by a standard method (Takao et al., 1994) accredited with slight modifications (Kumarasamy et al., 2007) . Methanolic extracts of A. bidwillii, A. cunninghamii and A. heterophylla were dissolved in methanol to accomplish 15 mg/mL concentrations. Dilutions were carried to have the concentrations of 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25 lg/mL. (100 lL each) of the solutions after dilution were added to 3 mL of methanolic solution of DPPH with the concentration of 0.002%. As, the standard ascorbic acid stock solution was dissolved in methanol for achieving a 1.5 mg/mL concentration, dilutions were carried to achieve concentrations 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 lg/mL incubation in the dark for 30 min, the absorbances were observed. The reaction undergoes between the antioxidant and free radical to produce 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazine. The capacity to quench the free radical, DPPH was recorded at the absorbance of 517 nm.The biosynthesis of AA to PGH2 is catalyzed by Cyclooxygenase. PGH2 produces PGF2a, via stannous chloride reduction to be assessed by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) (Pradelles et al., 1985) . This is a competitive method among a PG tracer (PG-acetylcholinesterase conjugate) and PGs for the limited quantity of PG antiserum. The PG tracer amount that can bind to the PG antiserum is indirectly proportional to the amount of PGs in the wells, the PG tracer concentration is kept constant, but PG concentration varies. This complex of antibody-PG conjugate to an antibody (anti-IgG) which was before linked to the well. The buffer and the acetylcholinesterase substrate (Ellman's reagent) poured to the well. The reaction enzymatically produces a yellow colour which is measured via a spectrophotometer in a Microplate special Reader (BioRad, Japan) at 412 nm. The technique to have 100% COX activity was carried out in the presence and absence of DMSO as a solvent control. The inhibitory experiment was carried for extracts at different concentrations starting from 1 ending with 16 lg total phenolic compound/ mL) or of the celecoxib drug as a standard anti-inflammatory. After adding the enzyme, a pre-incubation period was allowed of 10 min before adding the inhibitor and 2 min of incubation in case of AA presence at 37 C. inactivation of COXs by keeping them in water and allowed to boil for 3 min as Enzyme control. 29 PG/mL was the detection limit and the coefficients of variations intra and interassay were 5 and 10%, respectively. The anti-inflammatory activity of the tested extracts was assessed by determining the percent of inhibition of PGE2 produced and the concentration of the test compounds leading to 50% inhibition of the release of PGE2 (IC 50 ) was detected from the curve of concentrationinhibition response by analytical regression.Docking took place in the compounds active sites of the corresponding proteins including COX-1 (1EQG), main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (6LUV7), nsp16 (6W4H) and nsp12 (7BV2). Ligands and proteins were prepared as reported earlier (Ebada et al., 2020) . In short, structures were either drawn or used from the PubChem (www.pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Minimization for Structures via one thousand steps of steepest descent after that a minimization through one thousand steps of gradient conjugate. Available Proteins were used from the protein data bank (www.rcsb.org) then hydrogens were added and merged, water and non-bonded fragments were removed, and Gasteiger charges were calculated. AutoDock vina was used for carrying docking (Trott & Olson, 2010) with a grid box of 25 Â 25 Â 25 Å 3 centered on the internal ligand using exhaustiveness of 16. PyMOL was responsible for generating images (Schrodinger, 2010) .Amber ff14SB force field was used to implement Amber18 to make the ligand-protein complexes in water. The module of antechamber was used to adjust the Gasteiger atomic partial charges (Case et al., 2020) . For preparation of the general Amber GAFF force field and the force field parameters (Wang et al., 2004) , Addition of hydrogen atoms was to target proteins via the tleap program of the AmberTools18 package (Case et al., 2020) . First, the complexes of ligand-protein were each laid in a box with cubical shape with conditions of periodic boundary, TIP3P water as a solvent was included in the box for the MD simulations of MD. (Jorgensen et al., 1983) , Cl À and Na þ ions supplied a salt of 0.10 M concentration. the system was set up, minimization of energy was carried via five hundred steps of steepest descent algorithm and five hundred steps of gradient conjugation method. The essential atoms for complex clustering were fixed by the additional harmonic potential with constant force of 2.0 kcal/mol subjecting the system to the phase of equilibration. Equilibration of the system was performed in three steps: (1) gradual heating of the system using a Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 2.0 ps À1 heated from 0 K to 310 K for 1 ns in NVT ensemble;(2) equilibration of pressure was done at 1.0 bar in NPT for 1 ns ensemble via Berendsen barostat with a 2.0 ps (Case et al., 2020) ; (3) equilibration was achieved at 310 K over 0.5 ns in conditions of constant volume and the complex assembly constraints were eliminated. Once the equilibration was accomplished, the simulations of MD were performed at temperature T ¼ 310 K and p ¼ 1 bar and for 150 ns in NPT ensemble. SHAKE algorithm was used to constrained bonds participating in hydrogen atoms (Ryckaert, 1977) for accomplishing the integration time-step of 2 ps. Calculations of the electrostatic Long-range interactions were made via Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm (Essmann et al., 1995) . Truncations at 8 Å of van der Waals and Coulomb interactions and the calculations of energy values of binding were made with Amber18 (Case et al., 2020) via the MM/GBSA method (Genheden & Ryde, 2015) . 750 snapshots were calculated produced from the final 150 ns of the MD trajectories, by maintaining the snapshots every 0.2 ns. Computations of the energies of the polar solvation in continuum solvent via Poisson-Boltzmann continuum-solvation model with ionic strength of 0.10. The non-polar terms were evaluated via solvent accessible surface areas. Application of the Nmode module in Amber 18 was performed for the calculation of the entropy for the binding free energy (Case et al., 2020) . MD trajectories analysis was carried by the CPPTRAJ module of AmberTools 18 (Case et al., 2020) .Secondary metabolites of crude methanolic extract of A. bidwillii, A. cunninghamii, and A. heterophylla dereplication revealed the annotation of various compounds of different classes. The annotated compounds detect the presence of diverse phenolic acids, biflavonoids and lignans Table 1 and Figure 1 .The concentration inhibiting 50% of the release of PGE2 (IC 50 ) of the extracts under investigation, A.bidwillii, A.cunninghamii and A. heterophylla to examine the extracts anti-inflammatory activity was determined from the curve of concentration-inhibition response through regression analysis. The reported values are the means of three experiments and represented in Table 2 and Figure 2.The DPPH and its % inhibition of methanolic extracts showed IC 50 values 93.32 lg/mL, 53.7 lg/mL and 120.226 lg/mL for A. bidwillii, A. cunninghamii and A. heterophylla respectively. The reference drug used was ascorbic acid which showed 46 lg/ mL Among these results methanolic extract of A. cunninghamii exhibited a potent antioxidant activity than the other extracts followed by A. bidwillii and A. heterophylla extracts. The total results of inhibition percentage as represented in Table 3 , respective to IC 50 values.Absorbance of controlÞ Â 10Standard Deviation (SD) ± means data set of n ¼ 3 was determined through the subsequent equation, whilst the values of IC 50 were calculated from plotting inhibition percentage against concentration, via a non-linear regression algorithm. Presenting data as mean values ± of (n ¼ 3) standard deviation.The plant extracts of A. bidwillii, A. cunninghamii, and A. heterophylla showed anti-inflammatory effects as shown by their ability to inhibit the release of PGE2. The possible inhibitory effect of compounds in the extracts for COX-1 was studied using docking. The docking study was done using 1EQG PDB file which has co-crystalized ibuprofen. To establish the docking procedure, ibuprofen was redocked in its active site and the correct pose was predicted with high accuracy (RMSD of 0.381) and the docking energy was found to be À7.8 kcal/mol ( Figure 3A ). This indicates the validity of docking procedure to predict correct pose. Ibuprofen (and most of the anti-inflammatory non-steroidal drugs, NSAIDS) forms 2 hydrogen bonds with R120 and Y355. The hydrophobic part of ibuprofen extends in a hydrophobic pocket formed around I345, V349, L359, I523. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, on the other hand, do not inhibit COX-1 to the same extent.Although that is the case, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, is known to bind to one of two subunits of COX-1 and the interference of the action of low dose aspirin (Rimon et al., 2010) . Binding site of celecoxib is close but different from that of known NSAIDs such as celecoxib ( Figure 3B ). Celecoxib sulphamoyl moiety forms hydrogen bonds with S516, Q192 and L352 while hydrophobic interactions are seen with V116, L531 and V349. Redocking of celecoxib in COX-1 resulted in an energy of À5.0 kcal/mol. Among the tested compounds lariciresinol glucoside, octadecyl (E)-p-coumarate and p-coumaroylquinic acid showed best docking scores which is comparable or even slightly higher than that of ibuprofen (Table 4 ). All the three compounds can form hydrogen bonds with the same residues similar to ibuprofen including R120 and Y355 as well as multiple hydrophobic interactions. In addition, lariciresinol glucoside and p-coumaroylquinic acid both formed hydrogen bonds with Y385 and p-coumaroylquinic acid has an extra hydrogen bond with S530 which is in close proximity to the binding pocket of celecoxib reported earlier. Proposed binding modes of these three compounds with COX-1 are illustrated in Figure 4 .A recent study has shown that the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone has positive effect in improving survival rate of COVID-19 hospitalized patients as demonstrated by randomized clinical trials (Abdolahi et al., 2020) . This suggests promising effect of anti-inflammatory drugs as adjuvant therapy in COVID-19 patients for challenging the storm of cytokine which is a state of release of excessive of a diverse of inflammatory cytokines. The molecular mechanism of the cytokine storm is still unexplored. We were encouraged to theoretically study possible effect of our identified compounds against multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2. The compounds identified were docked in 3 targets active sites, viral main protease (M pro , 6LU7), non-structural protein-16 which is a methyl transferase (nsp16, 6W4H) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12, 7BV2). Table 4 shows the docking results of tested compounds against the 3 viral targets. In general, bioflavonoids have shown better scores compared to other compounds in all the three targets. Among the three targets, nsp16 was the best target recognized by the tested compounds as can be deduced from docking energies of each compound with the 3 targets (Table 4 ). Three biflavonoids were among the top compounds bound to nsp16 with energies better than S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which is the co-crystalized ligand. These biflavonoids include kayaflavone, amentoflavone and Bilobetin glucoside. A representative example of the binding of kayaflavone and amentoflavone is shown in Figure 5 . Rings A and B of biflavonoids overlapped with the purine ring of the SAM and form similar hydrogen bonds with D6912 and C6913. Other hydrogen bonds are also formed with D6897. The other side of the bioflavonoids extends into the KDKE methyl transferase motif and forms hydrogen bonds with E7001 in case of kayaflavone and with K6968 for amentoflavone. These results suggest possible effect of these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 and worth further investigation.So, the molecular docking data revealed that all selected compounds effectively block the target proteins and that is confirmed by the binding energy values lower compared with those predicted for the molecules used as a positive control in the calculations. However, it is well-known that estimating the binding affinity profiles using molecular docking studies involves a number of approximations, resulting in the Lack of trustworthiness on the capability of scoring functions to produce accurate values of binding free energy (Meng et al., 2011; Salmaso & Moro, 2018) . In this context, the parameters of thermodynamic depending on the MD simulations are much more credible than those predicted from the analysis of the static docking models. contrary of the computational approaches, MD simulation moves each atom individually through the field of the rested atoms showing the flexibility of both the ligand and protein which is more effective than other algorithms (Meng et al., 2011; Salmaso & Moro, 2018) .Nevertheless, analyzed compounds to the target proteins resulted from the post-modeling analysis of the static ligand/ protein structures their data, is confirmed by the MD simulations the high binding affinity. Analysis of the dynamic ligand/ protein models shows that, in both cases of interest, within the MD simulations, these complexes are relatively stable, as proved by the averages of binding free energies and the corresponding standard deviations (Table 5) . With the Given MM/ GBSA method errors of 1-3 kcal/mol (Genheden & Ryde, 2015) , we can propose that the dynamic ligand/protein structures having the averages of binding free energy lower than those calculated for the reference compounds using the same computational protocols (Table 5 ). The exception is compound B' targeting the NSP16-10 protein of SARS-Cov-2 and exhibiting the binding affinity comparable with that obtained for the control molecule SAM (Table 5) .Regarding the observed stability of the dynamic ligand/ protein structures is also an evidence for the data depending on the time of the root-mean square deviations (RMSD) for the atomic positions of the static and dynamic models of the analyzed compounds bounding to the target proteins (Figures 6 and 7) . Analysis of Figures 6 and 7 reveals that these complexes do not support significant structural rearrangements on the MD trajectories, and this is confirmed by the calculated RMSD averages of the dynamic models of molecules A, B, C and A, B, C in the complexes with COX-1 and NSP16-10, respectively. For the ligand/COX-1 complexes, the RMSD mean values and standard deviations, which are 2.48 ± 0.58 Å (compound A), 2.74 ± 0.35 Å (compound B), 2.64 ± 0.37 (compound C), are close to those of 2.34 ± 0.36 Å calculated for the COX-1 inhibitor IBP ( Figure 6 ). In the case of the ligand/NSP16-10 complexes, these averages are 2.94 ± 0.74 Å (compound A'), 2.90 ± 0.33 Å (compound B'), 2.55 ± 0.26 Å (compound C'), and 3.31 ± 0.37 Å (SAM).Comparison of the MD structures between every subsequent dynamic model with the previous one results in the averages of RMSD which are also evidence of the relative stability of the ligand/protein complexes at MD simulations. For the compounds bound to COX-1, these averages equal to 0.77 ± 0.05 Å (compound A), 0.78 ± 0.05 Å (compound B) and 0.78 ± 0.05 Å (compound C) are very close to those calculated for the control molecule IBP (0.76 ± 0.05 Å).

A', B', C' show the mean values of RMSD in the complexes with NSP16-10 which are respectively 0.84 ± 0.06 Å, 0.84 ± 0.06 Å, 0.83 ± 0.06 Å and very close to the SAM/NSP16-10 structure (0.85 ± 0.06 Å).Enthalpy components decomposition of the binding energy to the contributions of individual COX-1 amino acids exposes the residues dominating the ligand/COX-1 interactions in all cases of interest ( Table 6) . Analysis of Table 6 shows that these COX-1 residues are . The data obtained suggest that there are a number of the basic anchoring residues of COX-1 that provide strong attachment of the analyzed compounds at the active site of this protein. This supposition is supported by the values of the data of root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) for residues of COX-1 designating the flexibility of each amino acid throughout the MD simulations ( Figure 8 , Table 7) . Analysis of Table 7 shows that, according to the values of RMSF, the key anchoring residues and Ala-527 of COX-1 their position are restrained on the MD trajectories, in agreement with the data on their contributions into the binding enthalpy ( Table 6) .The data on decomposition of binding energy into the contributions of individual NSP16-10 amino acids are given in Table 8 , and the data on the values of RMSF for the individual residues of this protein are presented in Figure 9 and Table 9 .Intermolecular calculations of hydrogen bonds appeared in the MD trajectories of the ligand/COX-1 complexes indicate (Table 10 ) that the concerned compounds form hydrogen bonds with Arg-120 COX-1 (compound A), Leu-117 COX-1 (compound B), Ala-527 COX-1 and Leu-531 COX-1 (compound C). Notably, as compound C, the control molecule IBP is also involved in hydrogen bonding with Leu-531 COX-1 (Table 10) . Analysis of the dynamic ligand/NSP16-10 models reveals hydrogen bonds between compound A' and Asn-6899 NSP16-10 , compound B' and Lys-6933 NSP16-10 , as well as compound C' and Lys-6930 NSP16-10 , Asp-6931 NSP16-10 , Met-6929 NSP16-10 , and Cys-6913 NSP16-10 . At the same time, the reference compound SAM forms hydrogen bonds with the NSP16-10 residues Thr-4292, Asn-4293, Val-4295 (Table 10) . Among these H-bonds, it should be specially noted hydrogen bonds CÁÁÁAla-527 COX-1 and C'ÁÁÁLys-6930 NSP16-10 demonstrating the relatively high percentage occupancies on the MD trajectories (Table 10) .Thus, the data of molecular modeling indicate that the analyzed compounds show strong attachment to the target proteins. This follows from the calculation of low binding free energy values for the ligand/protein complexes in terms of the scoring functions of molecular docking and molecular dynamics. In both cases, the predicted values of this À0.71 ± 0.91 -a Data for the NSP16-10 residues with the binding enthalpy À0.4 kcal/mol are presented. b The averages of the residue contributions to the binding enthalpy and corresponding standard deviations are given. c The NSP16-10 residues dominating the ligand/protein interaction are highlighted by bold. 3.12 --The NSP16-10 residues presenting the dominant contributors to the ligand/ protein interaction are highlighted by bold. thermodynamic parameter testify to the higher binding affinity of the identified compounds to their targets compared with the reference molecules IBP and SAM.In light of the results of the current investigation, we propose that the extracts of A. bidwillii, A. cunninghamii and A. heterophylla cultivated in Egypt, could be a possible source of potent natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant metabolites. Those activities are of extensive importance as medicated agents for inhibiting and regress the progression of inflammation correlated with oxidative stress-relevant to viral infection and trying to avoid the side effects accompanied by the administration of dexamethasone such as elevated blood pressure, oedema and hyperglycemia. Those results were deduced from the virtual study carried for the structure relationship of LC-MS annotated compounds and the receptor interactions in three different binding sites of proteolytic enzyme in the COVID-19 as all the tested exhibited significant binding stability as observed for the amentoflavone and bilobetin glucoside with significant low binding energy. Our data suggested possible effect of these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 and worth further investigation. Several pathological conditions for instance as processes of inflammation are accompanied with reactive oxygen species generation. Thus, inhibitory activity on COX-1 enzyme of these plant extracts probably due to their capacity to reduce oxidative stress. Finally, we believe that the potential anti-COVID effects of the reported compounds required and worth further investigations.No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors. Donors and acceptors of the hydrogen bonds relating to the ligands are shown first, followed by the corresponding functional groups of the protein amino acids. The protein residues and percentage occupancies of hydrogen bonds are indicated in square brackets.

As we all see the number of cases increasing rapidly, all countries are facing the shortage of resources to detect COVID-19. Here comes the need to available, cheap, automatic COVID-19 detection method. Applying deep Learning models on Chest radiography images (e.g., X-ray or computed tomography (CT) imaging) can help in detecting COVID-19.Currently, real-time reverse transcription poly-merase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the main screening method used for COVID-19 detection [2] . The radiography imaging sensitivity outperforms the usual PCR technique [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Also the X-ray systems are cheaper and more available in hospitals than CT scan systems [8, 9] .The CRIs based detection system have many advantages over usual blood [10] and PCR [2] exams. These techniques are fast and cheap compared to other techniques. Also, many cases can be tested in the same time. Moreover, the availability of radiology imaging systems in hospitals, makes radiography-based detection systems a suitable variant for COVID-19 testing kit shortage.In August 2020, large number of X-rays chest images for healthy and patients suffering from Covid-19 are publicly available, which enable us to examine and identify the possible patterns that may produce automatic diagnosis of COVID-19.Deep Learning (DL), which is a part of machine learning systems, is focused mainly on images' features extraction and classification on automated manner [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In recent years, machine and deep learning have become basic disciplines in artificial intelligence. Hence, DL has become a basic part of automated clinical decision making.In the paper, a new COVIDetection-Net system is proposed which is an automatic detection of COVID-19 infection from CRIs. The system depends on ShuffleNet and SqueezeNet architectures for feature extraction and MSVM for disease detection and classification. The utilized dataset contains 1200 CRIs. It contains chest images for healthy (i.e., Normal), and nonhealthy (patients infected with COVID, Bacterial pneumonia, or Viral pneumonia). Taking into account the experimental results the proposed COVIDetection-Net can serve as an efficient system in COVID-19 detection.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the related work. Section 3 discusses the methods used in the proposed system. Section 4 shows the COVIDetection-Net experimental setup. Sections 5 and 6 present and discuss the COVIDetection-Net results. Finally section 7 outlines the conclusion J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fRecently, many researchers proposed different techniques for COVID-19 detection from CRIs.Most researches focused on DL techniques to detect the COVID19 from CRI of patients. Some of them interested in COVID detection from non-COVID cases (binary classification) [8, 9, 11, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Others concerned with thee-class classification (COVID vs Normal vs pneumonia) [11] , [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . But in fact, fewer focused on COVID19 detection using four-class classification (COVID vs Normal vs Bacterial pneumonia vs Viral pneumonia) [20, 21] . Brunese et al [8] introduced a COVID detection approach based on transfer learning of VGG-16 model. This model used to differentiate between healthy and disease X-ray images with accuracy of 96%.Then, it used for COVID detection from disease X-ray chest dataset with accuracy of 98%.Dipayan Das et. al [9] presented Truncated inception net to detect COVID-19 positive from non-COVID cases using CRIs. Detection accuracy of 99.9% is obtained. Hemdan et al [22] proposed a COVIDX-Net, DL framework, for automatic diagnosing COVID19 in CRIs. Seven-different convolutional neural networks (CNN) model are used in COVIDX-Net. The used DenseNet and VGG-19 provided the same accuracy of 90% for binary classification. Narin et al [23] used 5fold cross validation pre-trained models for coronavirus detection from CRIs. The highest accuracy of 98% is obtained using ResNet50 model. Panwar et al [24] presented DL based method nCOVnet for fast COVID19 detection from x-ray chest images. This method used the VGG net and transfer learning using five-different layers that achieved 97.2% detection accuracy. Sethy et al [11] extracted the deep features from the CRIs using the fully connected layer of the pre-trained models. Then, features matching has been done using SVM classifier.The authors utilized 13 different pre-trained net and the highest classification accuracy of 98.66% was obtained using ResNet50. Singh et. al [25] proposed a (CNN) to classify the chest CT patient's images to COVID-infected or not using multi objective differential evolution (MODE). This approach provided 93.5% accuracy. Tuncer et al [26] presented Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP) features extraction method with iterative ReliefF (IRF) features selection for COVID19 detection from CRIs. An accuracy of 99.69% is achieved using SVM classifier.Apostolopoulos et. al [12] used transfer learning technique for binary and 3-class classification of COVID, normal and pneumonia CRIs. The produced classification accuracies were 97.4% and 92.85% for binary and 3-class classification, respectively when MobileNet v2 is accuracy for XGB and 97.3 for RF classifiers. Tree-class COVID classification method of CRIs was proposed in [14] . The method based on DL and 9-different CNN architectures. The best accuracy was 95% for two models. Ozturk et al [15] presented 5-cross validation DarkCovidNet for binary and 3-class classification of CRIs. The presented method provided accuracy of 98.08% and 87.02% for binary and 3-class cases, respectively. The concatenation network of Xception and ResNet50V2 is presented in [16] for detection of pneumonia and COVID19 from CRIs. The overall accuracy of 91.4% is obtained for the three classes (normal, COVID and pneumonia).Ucar et al [17] proposed COVIDiagnosis-Net for COVID19 diagnosis from CRIs. This approach based on deep Bayes-SqueezeNet that produced overall accuracy of 98.26%. Wang et al [18] introduces DCNN model called COVID-Net to detect COVID cases from CRIs. This model was designed for (normal vs pneumonia vs COVID) classification with overall accuracy of 92.4%.Li et. al [19] demonstrated COVID-Xpert based population screening to detect COVID19 cases from X-ray CRIs. The demonstrated method provided 88.9% classification accuracy.COVID19 detection using 4-class cases from CRIs is presented by Khan et al [20] . The authors presented DCNN model named, CoroNet, based on Xception architecture. The classification accuracy of 89.6% is produced for 4-class cases. Mahmud et al [21] designed CovXNet, CNN based architecture, for COVID19 detection and classification. A stacking algorithm is used for optimization of CovXNet prediction and 90.2% accuracy is obtained for 4class classification.Accordingly, it can be concluded that, many researchers studied the COVID detection and introduced different techniques for this problem. However, the most of them did not provide the This work focused in developing a detection model named COVIDetection-Net based on DL techniques for COVID 19 detection from CRIs using 4-class cases. The prepared dataset and the proposed COVIDetection-Net are explained in details as follow.To evaluate the proposed COVIDetection-Net, our dataset is created using two different publically CRIs databases. Firstly, a collection of CRIs from the Github repository was selected [27] . Then, Kaggle repository of normal and pneumonia CRIs was considered [28] . The tworepository contains an open database of CRIs (chest X-ray or CT images) and is being updated regularly. A total of 1200 CRIs are selected from the Github and Kaggle repositories, in which 300 images are COVID19, 300 images are bacterial pneumonia, 300 images viral pneumonia and 300 images are normal cases. Table 1 summarized the prepared dataset. The samples of the prepared dataset are shown in Fig.1 .Deep networks (CNNs or DL) are useful in machine vision tasks. This made developments in many fields as industry [29] , Agriculture and medical disease diagnosis [8, 9, 11, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The notability of these CNN networks comes from the useful and robust features that extracted from input images. Hence, the deep networks focus on infection detecting in CRIs and classifying these images into COVID-19, normal, bacterial pneumonia or viral pneumonia. Some of the most usable CNN are ResNet [11, 13, 16, 23] , VGG [8, 11, 12, 14] , Xception [16, 20] ,Inception [9, 23] , DesNet [11, 22] , ShuffleNet [29, 30] , and SqueezeNet [17, 31, 32] . These networks pretrained on ImageNet dataset. Shufflenet is a CNN also that outperform many networks in speed and accuracy metrics at the same computation condition [30] . In total, it composed of 172 layers including convolution layer, max pooling layer, three stages each contains a stack of ShuffleNet units, one global average pooling, fully connected layer and the output (softmax) layer. The ShuffleNet architecture is shown in Fig. 2 .SqueezeNet is a CNN that comes forward owing to light design of its network. However, it has better performance than AlexNet, it yields fewer 50× than AlexNet in model size [31, 32] . The performance of the proposed model is depicted in the form of Receiver OperationScore and Accuracy metrics are also used to evaluate the networks performance, which are given as follows..The results of the main 4-class scenario are presented in Table 2. The table compares between the performance of the proposed COVIDetection-Net and the two other models:ShuffleNet and SqueezeNet. The above-mentioned evaluating metrics are the top metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models. The proposed COVIDetection achieved the highest recall, specificity, precision, F1-score and accuracy of 100% for COVID class. While higher performance is obtained of other classes comparatively to SqueezeNet and shuflleNet models as presented in Table 2 . It is indicated that the performance of the two pneumonia classes (bacterial and viral) are lower than other classes, subsequently lower overall accuracy. This accuracy is significantly increased when combining the two pneumonia classes into one pneumonia class. This can be cleared in 3-class scenario of the proposed, SqueezeNet and shuflleNet models as shown in Table 3 . It is clear from the Net provides the highest detection accuracy of 100% of the COVID19 in the three scenarios (i.e.. Additionally, the average recall, specificity, precision, F1-score and accuracy of the proposed 4-class, 3-class and binary COVIDetection-Net are summarized in Table 5 . To evaluate the performance of the proposed COVIDetection-Net, a comparison study between the proposed model and other models are performed as mentioned before in Tables 2, 3,   4 and Fig. 5 . The results prove the superiority (notability) of the proposed COVIDetection-Net.Moreover, our proposed COVIDetection-Net superior other existing state-of-the-art studies that used CRIs in COVID19 detection as given in Table 6 . The performance values of each study are listed in the table for binary, 3-class and 4-class cases in the term of classification accuracy. Table 7 gives performance comparison study of the proposed COVIDetection-Net with CoroNet and CovXNet on 4-class classification case. The CRIs datasets of the proposed model and the two other compared models are selected from the same databases [27, 28] . The CoroNet model [20] is based on Xpection model with a dropout layer and two fully-connected layers Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Ethical approval This article does not contain any studies with human participants performed by any of the authors.Table1 the summary of the prepared dataset.

Low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) are profoundly influenced because of deficient medical equipment and fundamental supplies for victims that result in a disastrous loss of life. 4 As of January 10, 2021, COVID-19 affects over 218 countries and 2 international conveyances; globally, over 90.2 million confirmed cases and 1.9 million demises are informed. In Africa, over 3 million confirmed cases and +72,387 death are reported. 5 After the first case testified on March 13 in Ethiopia, the number of cases and death raised to +127,792 and +1985, respectively. 6 In Africa, the cases and death tolls are still low as compared to the developed nations. 5 In any case, it is accepted that it resembles an ""ice burg"" this low figure is a result of low testing capacity, frail contact tracing, and poor announcing system. 7 Deficiency of hand cleanliness supplies, testing packs, and absence of personal protective equipment (PPE), resistance of the public to the recommended prevention strategies, and poor socioeconomic status are the main barriers to break the transmission of COVID-19 in its infancy stage. 7, 8 Out of ample vaccine trials initiated in different parts of the world some are effective and industrialized countries started to vaccinate their citizens. However, in the context of developing nations like Ethiopia resource is the main barrier to buy the vaccine and distribute to their citizens. Furthermore, highly contagious new strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are reported from England and initiates countries for further lockdown. 9 Thus, still strengthening the preventive measures such as educating the public about the nature of the disease, mode of transmission, avoidance of going to crowded places, physical distancing, hand washing, and wearing of face mask are vital for COIVD-19 prevention. [10] [11] [12] There are great discrepancies in the implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures. 13 A study conducted in Vietnamese people showed that 88.2%, 99.5%, 94.9%, and 97.4% of the participants adhere to the physical distancing rule, wear a face mask, cover mouth and nose during coughing/sneezing, and wash hands regularly with water and soap, respectively. 14 Likewise, Block and colleagues ascribed that only 72%, 67%, 55%, and 65% of African Americans adhere to frequent hand washing, maintain physical distancing, avoid touching face, and wear a mask in public, respectively. 15 COVID-19 preventive measures implementation is very low in Ethiopia. A nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted in Ethiopia suggested that only 24.3% of the respondents were engaged with the recommended preventive measures. That study also demonstrated that only 42% and 53.8% of the respondents were good knowledge and favorable attitudes towards COVID-19 prevention strategies (Negera E, Demissie TM, Tafess K. Inadequate level of knowledge, mixed outlook and poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention guide-line among Ethiopians. bioRxiv; unpublished data; 2020). Another cross-sectional study conducted in northwest Ethiopia suggested that 52.7% of 404 participants had good COVID-19 prevention practice. 16 Being married, high wealth index, good knowledge, being female, old age, better self-care ability, urban residence, high literacy level, government employee, and positive evaluation of the information transmitted by the government are significantly correlated with COVID-19 preventive measures compliance. 13, 17 The government of Ethiopia initially takes basic measures such as obligatory quarantine periods for passengers, gathering restrictions, closures of school and religious places, reducing the number of passengers in public transports, and mandatory wearing of face masks in public places. 18 Also, COVID-19 preventive measures are disseminated through media, cell-phone, and COVID-19 reported daily by the Minister of Health. 6 Moreover, a state of emergency was declared on April 8, 2020, to stop the spread of COVID-19. However, on the ground, all the suggested preventive and control measures are not viably actualized. On the other hand, information about the disease and its preventive measures were not extensively disseminated to the rural communities. To configure appropriate prevention strategies assessing the community's knowledge, attitude and adherence with the suggested COVID-19 preventive measures is certain. Besides, there is a shortage of proof about public compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures, particularly in underprivileged populations. Consequently, this study was aimed to assess public adherence with COVID-19 preventive measures among occupants of Dirashe district, southern Ethiopia.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among occupants of Dirashe district, southern Ethiopia from June 20 to July 5, 2020. Dirashe is situated 550 Km away from the national capital (Addis Ababa) and 336 km from the submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comPatient Preference and Adherence 2021:15 regional capital (Hawassa). It is surrounded by Konso woreda, Weito River, Gamo zone, and Amharo woreda on the south, west, north, and east, respectively. According to the report from the district, an estimated 147,887 people's lives in the Dirashe district.All households in the dirashe district and households in the selected kebeles (smallest administrative units) were considered as the source and study population separately. The list of households and adults in the selected household was the sampling and study unit, respectively. Any household member ≥18 years old was included and individuals who could not convey because of basic ailment were excluded. At the family level, special emphasis was given for household heads (ie, mother/father) but if they were not available during the data collection period any household member ≥18 years old was involved from that particular household.Epi-Info-7 Stat Calc was used to determine the minimum sample required for this study with the accompanying suppositions: 95% level of confidence, 5% precision, 1.5 design effect, 50% proportion (ie, since there was no published evidence at the time of this study initiation), 19 clusters, and 10% non-response rate. Then, the final sample size was 648. There were 19 kebeles (smallest administrative units), 2 urban and 17 rural, in the district. In our study, the kebeles were considered as clusters and they were stratified into an urban and rural cluster. A multistage sampling technique was used to select the participants. All the urban clusters and four rural clusters were selected using simple random sampling. Then, the sample was allocated proportionally based on the number of households in each cluster. At last, households were selected using systematic random sampling ( Figure 1 ).The survey instrument was organized after reviewing previously published literature. 16, [19] [20] [21] The instrument comprises background information, knowledge, attitude, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. Knowledge was measured using 14 items that focused on the clinical presentation of the disease, transmission, and prevention measures. The items were primarily used in the Malaysian study and modified to our context; the internal consistency of the items was checked using the pilot study (Cronbach's alpha (α) = 0.78). COVID-19 prevention practice was measured using yes/no questions; these inquiries mainly focused on the current COVID-19 preventive measures such as regular hand washing, averting of gatherings, handshaking and swarmed places, utilization of liquor/ sanitizer, and so on. Overall, public adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures was assessed using 12 internally consistent and reliable items (α = 0.73).The instrument was prepared in an excel worksheet in two languages (ie, English and Amharic) and changed online to XML using XmlsForm for electronic data collection through Open Data Kit (ODK) collect application. Before the actual data assortment, the tool was pretested among 32 dwellers of Arba Minch town to verify the appropriateness, feasibility, and reliability of the tool.Ten qualified data collectors and three master holder supervisors were recruited. The data collection team received sufficient training about the purpose of the study and the data collection procedure. ODK collect version 1.17.2 application was installed on each data collector's phone. The instrument was also uploaded to each phone and opened using the ODK Collect. Then, data collectors and supervisors received a detailed explanation about how they access the blank forms, save and send the finalized forms. Moreover, the data collectors were informed about all precautions to be followed during data assortment such as during the interview they must keep 6 feet of physical distancing, wear a face mask, and use a sanitizer. Before the commencement of the interview, participants were well-informed about the study and participated in the study based on their willingness. Supervisors were kept in touch with the data collectors to regularly check the process of the data collection till the end of the study.The community's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures was the outcome variable for this study. Background information, knowledge, perception, and attitude were the explanatory variables. Knowledge was categorized into three as poor (≤8 of 14), moderate (9-10 of 14), and good (≥11of 14). 21 Attitude was transformed into a dummy variable of favorable and unfavorable attitude. For each item those who responded (1) strongly disagree, (2) disagree, or (3) neutral were merged into one category and labelled as ""negative attitude"" and those who responded (4) agree or (5) strongly agree were categorized as ""positive attitude"". Overall, attitude was generated from the dummy variables created from the Likert scale items and those participants who had ""positive attitude"" for all the three attitude questions were categorized as ""favorable attitude"" and all else were categorized as ""unfavorable attitude"". 22, 23 Regarding the communities' adherence, those participants who practiced ≥75% of the COVID-19 preventive measures were categorized as ""good adherence"".ODK briefcase was used to export the data from the ODK aggregate to an excel file and analyzed using STATA version 15. Descriptive statistics such as median, mean, and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical variables were computed and presented in text, table, and graphs. The association between the independent and outcome variables was assessed by the bivariate and multivariable analyses using binary logistic regression. Hosmer-Lemeshow and standard error were used to test the model goodness of fit and multicollinearity, respectively. To control all possible confounders; all variables with a P-value <0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in the final model. Crude and adjusted odds ratio with its 95% CI was used to see the relationship between independent variables and community's adherence with COVID-19.Before the initiation of the study, ethical clearance was issued by Arba Minch University, college of medicine and health sciences, Institutional Review Board (IRB) with an ethical clearance number of IRB/407/12. An official letter was written to Dirashe district administrative bodies and permission was secured from each kebele (smallest administrative units) of the district. The study participants were briefed about the insignificant danger related to taking an interest in this study. Also, this study was led as per the Declaration of Helsinki. 24 Besides, before the commencement of the actual data collection written informed consent was secured from the participants. To assure the confidentiality of information, code numbers were utilized all through the investigation. Of the participants, 563 (87.4%) recognized the clinical symptoms of COVID-19, 600 (93.2%) aware that avoiding visiting crowded places is one measure to avert the spread of COVID-19. Likewise, 603 (93.6%) of the participants replied as frequent and proper handwashing is one means to mitigate COVID-19 spread (Table 2) . Overall, 63.51% (95% Figure 2) ; 235 (34.5%) participants scored 11 out of the 14 knowledge questions (Figure 3 ).Among the participants, 412 (64.0%) agreed that COVID-19 will be effectively controlled and 406 (63.0%) were assertive that Ethiopia will a victory over the COVID-19 enemy ( Figure 4) Avoidance of greeting with handshaking, uncooked food, and gatherings with many peoples was implemented by 524 (81.4%), 497 (77.2%), and 450 (69.9%) of the participants, respectively. Wearing masks/any clean cloth (20.5%) and stay at home (22.8%) were the least practiced preventive measures ( Figure 5) . Moreover, none of the participants implement all the recommended COVID-19 preventive and control measures, and a significant number of the participants, 35 (5.4%) did not practice any of the preventive measures so far ( Figure 6 ). Overall, only 12.3% (95%, CI: 9.83, 15.05) of the participants adhered to the existing COVID-19 preventive measures. (Table 3 ).COVID-19 is an ongoing international public health challenge following influenza A, polio, Zika, and Ebola. 26 Although so many trials are commenced since the declaration of the outbreak, still now there is no cure for the disease. Scholars, international and national organizations intensely recommended that adhering to the preventive measures is crucial to mitigate the spread and threats of the virus. 6, 12, 18 Thus, public adherence with the existing COVID-19 prevention strategies is imperative for further improvement.Our study revealed that 63.5% of the participants were knowledgeable about COVID-19. This finding is in agreement with previous studies in Iran (63%), 26 a bi-national study in Egypt and Nigeria (61.6%), 27 and Ethiopia (66.1%). 16 However, it is lower than studies in China (90%), 20 Malaysia (80.5%), 19 Italy (77.4%), 28 Saudi Arabia (81.64%), 29 Nigeria (99.5%) 30 and Sudan (78.2%). 31 This is probably due to the difference in knowledge assessment tool and the cut of point, background characteristics of the participants, awareness creation activities, and channel of information dissemination. So far, in Ethiopia, the majority of the information were disseminated through mass media, mobile, and social media; which is not accessible for rural and underprivileged communities. On the other hand, this result is higher than the study conducted in Jimma, Ethiopia (41.3%). 21 The possible justification is that the study conducted in Jimma was piloted in late March, almost 2 months before the current study. In this period several preventive interventions were done by the national and local governments.This study revealed that 54.5% of participants involved in this study had a favorable attitude toward COVID-19 preventive measures. Our discovery is lower than a binational study documented in Egypt and Nigeria (68.9%). 27 Our study also reported that 70.19%, 76.24%, and 71.27% of the participants had favorable attitudes towards the successful control of COVID-19, confidence that Ethiopia will defeat the disease, and the governmentheld the health crisis well, respectively. These findings are lower than the study conducted in Malaysia. 19 This is possibly because of the difference in background characteristics and level of understanding. Besides, all participants in the Malaysian study were addressed through an online survey which indicates all participants are internet users and access COVID-19 related messages easily. On the contrary, 59% of the participants in our study were rural residences, even majority of the urban residences are not internet users. Hence, information released from the ministry of health through mass media/social media are not easily accessible for the residents in remote areas. We found that only 12.3% of the study participants adhered with the suggested COVID-19 preventive measures although some preventive measures like avoidance of handshaking, eating uncooked food, gatherings, and frequent hand washing were implemented by 81.4%, 77.2%, 69.9%, and 65.8%, respectively. Similar results were reported in Egypt and Nigeria though the figures are much higher than our findings. In that study, only 36% of the participants implement all the recommended measures despite most (96%) practiced self-isolation and physical distancing. 27 This indicates that equal emphasis is not given for all COVID-19 prevention measures recommended by the healthcare providers. Long-lasting commitment and adherence are vital to mitigate the disease spread and minimize its impact. The current findings are also much lower than the study conducted in Iran, where 95.4%, 93%, and 80% of the participants adhered to handwashing with soap and water, avoiding crowded places, clean hands with other disinfectants, respectively. 32 Furthermore, the current finding is lower than a nationwide study conducted in Ethiopia (Negera E, Demissie TM, Tafess K. Inadequate level of knowledge, mixed outlook and poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention guide-line among Ethiopians. bioRxiv; un-refereed preprint, 2020). This is probably due to the study participant's difference, means of data collection, measurement tool, and cut of point used to categorize good/poor practice. Moreover, the studies conducted in Iran and Ethiopia were an online and telephone cross-sectional survey that mainly addresses internet users and educated individuals. In contrast, in our study, three-fifth (59.01%) of the participants were rural residents and relatively low information access and poor level of understanding about the problem.Relative to other prevention strategies, wearing of facemask was the least (20.5%) implemented measure. This is in line with the research report from Malaysia. 19 This is probably because of cost, unavailability/shortage, and lack of knowledge on how to wear facemask or worried with mask-related problems around the face and the respiratory system. The other possible explanation is the fear of stigma; especially in the first few weeks after detection of the disease in Ethiopia the community perceived those who wear a face mask as diseased. Though the development of new behavior needs time, special emphasis on awareness creation activities on how to wear and remove facemask is mandatory for all ordinary citizens. Even those who wear facemask did not utilize it effectively: they put it below their mouth, frequently touch the outer side of the mask, even they handle it in their pocket, and so on. This indicates that the state of emergency declared to stop the spread of the disease is not effectively implemented.Even though our study did not support it, being female and old age were positively linked with good COVID-19 practice in a Saudi Arabian study. 29 A study conducted in China also reported that being female and young age is significantly correlated with COVID-19 preventive measures. 17 Urban residences increase the odds of adherence with COVID-19 preventive measures by ten-fold. A similar result was reported in a study conducted in northwest Ethiopia where rural residence increases the odds of poor COVID-19 practice by three-fold. 17 Likewise, a study conducted in China demonstrated that residents who live in cities strongly adhered to the covid-19 protective measures. 17 This may be due to lack of sufficient and accurate information, level of understanding, absence/shortage of media coverage, negligence, low socio-economic status, and low literacy level.In the current study, participants with favorable attitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures were almost two times higher odds of adhering with the preventive measures as compared to their counterparts. Most of the previous studies are descriptive and no study supports this finding. The possible justification is that good knowledge and a positive attitude are a prerequisite to develop new behavior. Moreover, the majority of the COVID-19 prevention strategies such as avoidance of gatherings and handshaking, wearing of face mask, and stay at home are against the norm of the society. To compile with these preventive measures, the society must clearly understand the disease and develop new behavior. Behavioral change educations are vital to facilitate the engagement of the public to the existing measures unless information released through mass/social media is not reachable for all citizens, particularly for rural residences.The current study found that concern about COVID-19 related stigma increases the odds of COVID-19 prevention practice by two-fold. No previously documented evidence supports this finding. The possible justification is that when an individual is highly concerned about the problem and its consequence; commitment to implement the preventive measures is very high.In general, this study assessed the community's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures among underprivileged communities. In Ethiopia, around 80% of the citizens live in rural areas; majority of the population resides in these areas encountered several health-related problems as a result of poor access to transportation, lack of awareness, and a shortage of well-equipped facilities in the local area. Likewise, COVID-19 awareness creation activities and other preventive measures did not address these remote areas. In Ethiopia, COVID-19 messages are transmitted mainly through mass media, social media, and telecom; all these channels are not suitable for rural communities. Hence, strengthening the existing health extension packages and providing continuous awareness creation in rural communities is imperative to stop the spread of the virus. Besides, the state of emergency declared by the government to mitigate the spread of the disease must be implemented in all corners of the country. Also, previously conducted studies are limited to the educated population (ie, internet users), which are not representative of the general population. Hence, scholars must address underprivileged ones to design appropriate intervention strategies based on their level of understanding.Despite this study has many strengths, it might face the following limitations: social-desirability bias is one of the major limitations that participants might respond to the suggested COVID-19 preventive measure (socially acceptable responses) despite their actual implementation is poor. Besides, the majority of the studies conducted previously report the individual proportion of the COVID-19 preventive measures; which inhibits us to compare our result with these findings. Although the tool used in our study was used by previously published studies, modified in our context, and the reliability was checked using Cronbach's alpha, the tool was not primarily validated. Besides, assessing the cause-effect relationship was not possible due to the cross-sectional nature of the study.Despite the number of COVID-19-confirmed cases and death rates are increasing, community's adherence to the preventive measures is unacceptably very low. Being an urban residence, having a favorable attitude, and concerned about COVID-19-related stigma were significantly associated with good adherence. A strong commitment is anticipated from each citizen to improve the implementation of COVID-19 prevention and control measures. Though information released from the ministry of health and mass media are vital to increase public knowledge about the disease, special emphasis should be given to the underprivileged population groups. Dissemination of teaching aids prepared in local languages and close monitoring are crucial to improve communities compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. ","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-02-03",2

COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency on the 30 th of January, 2020, and a pandemic on the 11 th March, 2020 by the World Health Organization [2] . COVID-19 has wrecked great havoc in many spheres of life, including the educational, health, economic, and agricultural sectors [1, 2] .Although this havoc has been experienced globally, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak has been more severe in low and low middle-income countries. COVID-19 has been rapidly transmitted across 218 countries, and more than 86 million cases and 2 million deaths have been reported as of 9 th January, 2021 [3] . Of the global total, Africa has reported 2,830,462 3,021,769 COVID-19 cases (3.3%) and 72,121 (3.6%) deaths as of the reference period [3] . Although this proportion seems low, the poor-resourced nature of African countries aggravates the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To break the chain of COVID-19 transmission, African countries implemented some public health safety measures (PHSM). The PHSM included social distancing, regular hand hygiene, closure of educational institutions, recommendations on the use of face masks, ban on public events, border closure, and lockdown [1, 2] . Although implemented PHSM helped to keep the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic within limits, notable adverse effects of these PHSM have been experienced in Nigeria, with the agricultural sector suffering great losses during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic [4] . Therefore, adequate preparation is pertinent for the second wave of COVID-19 to ensure that resulting losses are kept to a very minimal level.The African continent is made up of 54 countries that are distributed across the Northern, Southern, Eastern, Central, and Western sub-regions [5] . Nigeria, located in the Western subregion, is the most populated country in Africa with 207 million people as of December, 2020 [5] . In many Nigerian communities, agriculture is frequently practiced both for local food production and a source of income [4] . Because food is a necessity, its demand is less often affected by the decline or increase in the demand for other goods and services. The agricultural sector is responsible for the production and supply of food items. It also provides job opportunities, and a stable source of growth to the national economy [4] . Assessing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the agricultural sector provides adequate information on the disruption of the food supply chain to members of the Nigerian population. Knowledge obtain in this regard would be crucial to expand the national capacity for enhanced preparation for the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food losses in the agricultural value chains in Africa, using Nigeria as a case study.The lockdown measure and restriction of movement during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a shortage of labor for agricultural production [6] . In Nigeria, agricultural labor is operated manually daily due to the unavailability of mechanized farming tools. Annually, periods of peak agricultural activity necessitate high demand for labor, but the lockdown and restriction of movement therefore limited access to farmlands by farmers and laborers [6] . As a result, the available workforce for cultivating farmlands diminished, and agricultural production across the country reduced. The harvesting period of some crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, millet, tomatoes, and cucumber which are highly perishable fall between March and July. However, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f PHSM implemented during this period resulted in a shortage of labor for harvesting crops, spoilage of ready-to-harvest farm produce, and food shortages in the market. These events resulted in increased cost of food items, hunger and subsequently protest by Nigerians [6] .A similar experience was reported in China where the production, distribution, and sales of vegetables and other agricultural products were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [7] . Also, a disruption of the seed supply chain, agrochemicals and fertilizer importation resulted, thus reducing viable seeds, and limiting the yield of agricultural produce [7] . In Nigeria, the markets for perishable food items were unfavorably affected by workplace closure at the processing and packaging departments of food companies [8] . The transportation of these perishable produce to the market were hindered as a result of travel restrictions put in place, and this resulted in an increase wastage of food items [8] . The increasing rate of COVID-19 cases also necessitated shift duties, thus reducing available manpower to ascertain food safety and quality [8] .Household food security is a framework defined by four fundamental dimensions, namely: availability, accessibility, stability, and utility [9] . These four dimensions have been used to describe the measure of food intake per household per day in each country and have been linked to healthy/diseased state [9] . The occurrence of disease or good health is a measure of the adequacy of food nutrients consumed. High levels of animal protein deficit have been reported in Nigeria, however, livestock production rapidly bridges this deficit [4] . This is due to the limited period of growth and regeneration, as well as the presence of large protein portions. More often, livestock bred at the household level play a crucial role in alleviating poverty, enhancing income generation, and assuring food security [4] .The COVID-19 pandemic has however resulted in a reduction of livestock production both at small and large scales [4] . This event primarily stems from the reduced money in circulation during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced earning among many individuals [6] . Thus, the purchase of livestock feeds and drugs seemed unrealistic. For this cause, household savings in the pre-COVID-19 period in Nigeria was expended on basic food items which could assure of survival. For many households, although food items were available at the market, nutrient-rich foods including vegetables were not accessible, and thus could not be utilized for body growth and development [4, 6] . The non-availability of social safety net to cater for stable food supply to the members of the Nigerian population heightened the inadequate food supply during the COVID-19 pandemic [6] . Anecdotal reports from some communities in Nigeria reported an increased proportion of malnourished children and adults during this period; a factor that could increase their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2.Despite the implemented PHSM, keeping domestic and international trades open are crucial to ensuring the delivery of food items to places where they are needed [4] . Measures such as the issuance of a valid COVID-19-negative test result to conveyers of perishable food items from the originating state or country only should be implemented and enforced [1] . The food sector is critical; therefore, COVID-19 tests should be rapidly conducted among food producers.Adequate management such as home-based care should commence for positive COVID-19 cases [1] . Online purchase and home food delivery system should be engaged in to reduce the need for movement in search of food during lockdown. The COVID-19 vaccine distribution process is ongoing; however, workers in the food industry should be prioritized on the vaccination list to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ensure that the food chain is not disrupted amid the COVID-19 pandemic [10] . To achieve this, public-private partnership is key [10] . For food production and processing companies, all-time availability of face masks should be ensured, and social distancing should be practiced as often as possible. To ensure compliance to the afore-mentioned measures, adequate engagement of the Organized Labor groups should be prioritized.The establishment of social safety net is mandatory to ensuring that food insecurity does not result to an increased proportion of lives lost while PHSM are implemented amid the COVID-19 pandemic [2] . To this effect, social protection such as the regular distribution of palliatives and cash transfers during outbreaks of infectious diseases should be integrated into the Nigerian legal framework [2] . Responsible and competent personnel should be appointed to oversee these tasks.The National Bureau of Statistics should be kept up to date on its records to ensure that the estimated population for the social protection scheme is accurate. Many equipment such as silos and barns that are used for storing farm produce are in a poor state in many states in Nigeria. To salvage the impending agricultural loss and wastage during the COVID-19 pandemic, a repair and/or replacement of these storage equipment is pertinent.In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, building resilience of the agricultural system should be accorded top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the existing gaps in the Nigerian agricultural system, food supply chain, and weakness in absorbing shocks resulting from disease outbreaks. To avert the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food losses in the agricultural value chain in Nigeria, much precedence should be placed on adequate stakeholder engagement.Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, logistics for unhindered agricultural trade should be put in place. In addition, policy makers should implement the institutionalization and implementation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of social protection system in Nigeria. To address the financial difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, provision of loans and grants should be commenced in an organized fashion.","Nigeria","abstract","2021-02-05",2

Over (570,000) of HCPs had been infected with COVID-19 globally and more than 20,000 healthcare professionals had died while providing service to save the lives of others. It is now considered a catastrophe on an astonishing scale. Failure of governments to document infection rate and death of healthcare workers are scandals that put HCPs at advanced risk and underestimate the genuine scale of more death. [1] [2] [3] HCPs are in front of fighting the coronavirus pandemic spread which makes them at the greatest risk of contracting the disease. Keeping the working environments safe for healthcare providers and an effective plan for them is crucial in each phase of the pandemic. 4 The first basic characteristic of the pandemic is increasing in demand for HCPs. However, the critical shortage of HCPs can happen at a peak time of the infection or in lifethreatening pandemics because of absenteeism due to illnesses, caring for a family member, or unwilling to work. Because of these reasons, better preparations for the next pandemic require estimates of HCPs' willingness to work and an understanding of factors that influence it. [5] [6] [7] However, the healthcare industry is getting a challenge due to the ongoing scarcity of HCPs.Trained HCPs are a key human resource to prevent, manage, and combat the infection, as the COVID-19 pandemic rises. Though they are a priority in most countries, HCPs have great concerns. For instance, lack of personal protective equipment. In addition, they have great concerns for their safety and about their families since might transmit the infection to their families. 8 For instance, in china HCPs affected during the COVID-19 outbreak were up to 20% of all infected cases. 9 Due to their professional obligations, they must be at their workplaces even if their health is in danger. Nevertheless, they should be kept healthy while they are providing services for patients. 10, 11 The COVID-19 pandemic is causing worldwide panic. HCPs were reported to face a greater amount of stress, anxiety, and burnout. It is an unfamiliar distressing affair for them. 12, 13 The incidence of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and burnout was eminent during and after the outbreak. The incidence of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout was eminent during and after the outbreak. These crises not only have a long-term impact on the minds of healthcare providers but also, hindered the immediate reaction to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. So governments and healthcare leaders must engage to take immediate measures to minimize the hazardous psychological effects of COVD-19 on HCPs. 14 The commonest attributes for the HCPs to be infected were lack of awareness and preparedness during the epidemic, ineffective institutional infection prevention measures, shortage of guidance in infection control rule procedures, irrational use of personal protective equipment (PPE), unavailability of PPE in the facility, performing a high-risk activity such as intubation and nebulization, and exposure to unsuspected COVID-19 patients. These factors forced the healthcare professional to refrain from rendering services during the outbreak. 15 Ethiopia was under a five-month state of emergency earlier to September 2020 to fight the COVD-19 pandemic. The country had also launched project 'the new coronavirus emergency response and health facility readiness. 16 But, the spread of the pandemic was increasing at an alarming rate during those months due to poor preparedness. It is now the leading country in East Africa with the highest number of infected people. Thousands of HCPs have been infected with COVID-19, particularly due to insufficient infrastructure in the quarantine and isolation area. 17 Lack of better infrastructures and healthcare provision with poor health outcomes were common in sub-Saharan African countries including Ethiopia. 18 Evidence from Ethiopia indicated huge numbers of HCPs are requesting their annual leave and bringing medical certificates to be free of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. 16 Types of disaster, worrying about family, and concerns about personal safety were the suggested factors associated with willingness to work during the increment of COVID-19. Lack of PPE and infrastructure will compromise the safety of Healthcare professionals. 16, 19 Generally, understanding the status of HCPs' preparedness, and willingness may have a fundamental role for continuous provision of health service through developing policies and strategies that decrease HCPs' absenteeism, death, and illness during or following COVID-19 pandemic. However, no study was conducted in Southwest Ethiopia on the preparedness and willingness of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19. Therefore, this study is aimed to assess HCPs' willingness and preparedness to work during the COVID-19 in selected hospitals of Southwest Ethiopia.This study was conducted in selected hospitals of Bench-Shako, Kafa Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Regional State (SNNPRS) of Ethiopia. These hospitals are Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital (MTUTH) which is found in Bench-Shako-zone and located about 585 Kilometer (KM) away from Addis Ababa. Gebretsadik Shawo general hospital and Wacha Primary hospitals are also found in the Kafa zone at a distance of 441 and 520 KM from Addis Ababa, respectively, whereas Tepi general hospital is found in the Sheka zone about 611 KM away from Addis Ababa. More than 657 healthcare professionals have been working in the aforementioned hospitals: 223 in MTUTH, 176 in Gebretsadik Shawo hospital, 131 in Wacha hospital and 127 in Tepi hospital. The study was conducted from June 01-30/2020. Until December 19, 2020, the total numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ethiopia were 119,494 and 1846, respectively. But in SNNPRS, 4287 cases and 44 deaths were reported. In July 2020 more than 10 HCPs were infected with COVID-19 while they delivered regular service.Facility based cross-sectional study design was employed.The study populations were HCPs who have been working in MTUTH, Gebretsadik Shawo Hospital, Wacha primary Hospital, and Tepi General Hospital.The study populations were HCPs who have been working in MTUTH, Gebretsadik Shawo Hospital, Wacha primary Hospital and Tepi hospital and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria during the study period.Inclusion Criteria • HCPs that worked in one of the four hospitals (MTUTH, Gebretsadik Shawo hospital, Wacha hospital and Tepi hospital) and worked there for at least 6 months.• HCP who will not want to participate and not available at study area during data collection because of different reasons (Annual vacation, moved for training purpose).The Sample size was calculated by using single population proportion formula based on the following assumptions: 1) since there was no study conducted on the prevalence of preparedness and willingness to work during COVID-19 among healthcare professionals, P-value = 50%. 2) D = 5% the margin of error, 3) Zα/2 = 95% confidence of certainty (1.96) n = [(Zα/2)2 *p (1-p)]/d 2 = 384, 10% nonresponse rate = 39 and the total sample size become = 423. From 423 sampled HCPs, 407 health professionals responded, with a response rate of 96.22%. The total sample size was proportionally divided for each health hospital and a stratified sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The sample was selected from all hospitals based on the number of health professionals. Within each hospital, the sample was taken from each department based on the proportion of their health professionals.The dependent variables were willingness and preparedness to work whereas, the independent variables were age, sex, educational status, occupational status, marital status, qualification, total year of experience, work setting, and experience in the current setting.The questionnaire was first prepared based on national 20 and WHO 21 preparedness guidelines for Management of COVID-19 and after reviewing the previous study conducted on the preparedness of healthcare professionals during Ebola outbreak 22 and COVID-19 pandemic. 23, 24 The questionnaire of the willingness part was also developed after reviewing previous studies conducted for the same purpose. 25 The first draft of the questionnaire was made and subsequently validated in two steps. First, the developed tool was sent to researchers to give their expert opinion with respect to its simplicity, relativity, and importance. Second, a pre-test (pilot) study was conducted on 22 HCPs, 5% of the total sample size at Shenan Gibe hospital which is located nearby our study area. selected for the pre-test study from all healthcare professions. The questionnaire contains three sections: the Sociodemographic characteristics, preparedness and willingness sections. The preparedness section had 28 questions, and responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1, strongly disagree; 2, disagree; 3, neutral; 4, agree; 5, strongly agree). The correct answer for each question will assign with 5 points whereas the answer for incorrect was assigned with one point. The maximum score was 140 (5X28) and the minimum score for the participant was 28 (1x28). The mean score was calculated for all respondents and participants who scored the above mean score were considered as well prepared but those who score below the mean were considered as not prepared.Similarly, the willingness section has 10 questions with a minimum of 10 points (1X10) and a maximum of 50 (5X10). Participants who scored below the mean score were classified as not willing to work but those who score above the mean were classified as willing to work.Twelve data collectors (6 pharmacists, 4 nurses, and 2 midwives) were recruited and trained for two days to collect data from HCPs working in the hospitals (MTUTH, Gebretsadik Shawo hospital, Wacha hospital, and Tepi hospital). A stratified sampling technique was used to collect data. First, healthcare professionals found in every four hospitals were categorized into different departments (Physicians, specialists, health-officer, dentistry, psychiatric nurse, optometrist, pharmacy personnel, laboratory personnel, nurses, and midwives). Second, participants were selected from each department based on the numbers of HCPs found in it. Departments were considered as strata and from each stratum, participants were recruited randomly. This was done to include departments that had a limited number of HCPs to maintain quality of data collection; a pre-test was done on 22 HCPs (5% of total sample size at Shenan Gibe zonal hospital which is located nearby our study area). The training was given for data collectors for 3 days on patient privacy, on the content and clarity of a questionnaire. Data were collected under the close supervision of principal investigators and collected data were daily checked for completeness and consistency. The collected data were checked for completeness and cleaned before data entry.Data were entered into Epi-data manager version 4.0.2 and exported to the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24 for analysis. Categorical variables were expressed in terms of frequencies; percentages and SD. Data for continuous variables were presented by possible continuous measures of central tendency or variation or both. A chi-square test was done to check cell adequacy and factors associated with willingness and preparedness to work. Bivariate analysis was performed to select variables for multivariate analysis. Hence, variables with a p-value <0.25 in the bivariate analysis were taken as candidates for multivariable analysis.Finally, a multivariable logistic model was created to predict independent predictors of poor preparedness and willingness to work during COVID-19. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.From 423 sampled populations, 407 (96.2%) responded to the questionnaire. Out of 407 study participants, 246 (60.4%) were males. The mean and standard deviation for the age of participants was 28.47±5.601 years. Respondents were categorized into five main groups by occupation: Medical Doctors (11.55%), pharmacy personnel (14.50%), Laboratory personnel (12.78%), Midwives (7.62), and Nurses (47.91%). Nearly two-thirds (64.37%) of the respondents were married. Nearly two-thirds (61.4%) of the studied participants are degree holder. A total of 76.9% had been practicing their profession for less than 5 years (SD, 4.26 ±3.82 years). In studied facilities, 81.8% of the respondents had been working in the facility for less than 5 years (SD 3.72 ±3.21 years) ( Table 1) .The majority of the participants (78.9%) were willing to work during COVID-19 infection. Even most of the respondents were prepared to stay in hospital if the COVID-19 infection was increased by 301 (73.96%). Two hundred fifty-five (62.65%) professionals were willing to give care for COVID-19 infected patients ready to submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2021:14 work in a suboptimal environment like lack of food and shelter. Three hundred fifteen health professionals (77.39%) were willing to give care for COVID-19 infected patients. One hundred eighty-five health professionals (45.45%) had no absentee record from work. But some health professionals (40.78%) were not willing to proceed with their current job or seek resignation from their current job and seek others. The mean standard deviation for overall these 10 questions' Likert scale was 36.34 ±6. 64. Generally, more than half of professionals (54.05%) of participants were responded below the mean for 10 Likert scale questions. More than half (54.05%) of Table 2 ). The major motivation of healthcare workers during COVID-19 increment included professional obligation 326 (80.1%), social obligation 150 (36.90%), and compulsion from inistitution102 (25.1%) (Figure 1 ). The major factors that cause worriedness of HCW to work during of COVID-19 outbreak included transmission to the family (35%), Transmission to self (28%), and Transmission to other patients (21%) (Figure 2 ).From a total of 407 study participants, 165 (40.5%) of them had not prepared for the prevention of themselves and patients from COVID-19. About one-third (34.2%) of respondents had agreed as they have PPE and keep themselves safe, 39.6% felt confident and keeps themselves healthy while doing their job and 35.9% were familiar Regarding preparedness in managing routine work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 42.5% of the respondents agreed that If their chief/director becomes ill, they had agreed to identify an individual(s) that will take over the role of running operations and 41.5% of them agreed that as their respective department has developed backup plans for key roles that should be taken during COVID-19. About 42% and 48% of respondents agreed that communication from their institution help them to continue their work safely and communication across teams in their institution was effective during this pandemic, respectively.Half (53%) of study participants agreed their department had performed an estimation of the quantities that would be needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. One-third (39.6%) of pharmacy personnel agreed that as their department has developed plans to monitor the availability of infection prevention supplies, including surgical masks, N95 respirators, and Alcohol-based hand and identified a list of alternative suppliers/wholesalers/distributors for essential medicines, supplies, and medical devices to address shortages. But, 18.7% and 17.9% of respondents disagree as their department had identified opportunities for training programs for staff about all aspects of COVID-19, staffs have access to resources about the use of medications used during management of patients with COVID-19, respectively (Table 3) .Marital status, work setting, professions, total experience, experience in current setting preparedness to work and getting personal protective equipment were factors associated with willingness to work (Table 4) .Age, marital status, work setting, professions, total experience, experience in the current setting, willingness to work and getting personal protective equipment were factors associated with preparedness to work during COVID-19 (Table 5) .Marital status, work setting, work experience, experience in the current working area, preparedness, and lack of PPE were variables entered into Multiple Logistic Regression because their significance level in binary logistic regression was less than 0.25. Factors that independently and significantly predicts not willing to work includes, having many experiences of 6-10 years (AOR=4.04, CI: 1.05-15.58), being divorced from marital status (AOR=7.85, CI: 1.78-34.65) and not prepared to give service during the surge of COVID-19 (Table 6) .Age, Professional status, work setting, work experience, experience in the current working area, not willingness to work and lack of PPE were variables entered into Multiple Logistic Regression because their significance level in binary logistic regression was less than 0. 25 The prominent independent, significant predictor of poor preparedness among health caregiver was lack of personal protective equipment and shortage of other infrastructure at the workplace (AOR=28.1, CI: 13.9-56.67) and not willing to work (Table 7 ).The result of this study had showed that the majority of healthcare professionals (78.9%) were willing to work (volunteer to give service) when a coronavirus infection was increased. This is lower than the finding reported from Nepal (90%). 25 But higher than a study conducted among physicians at the time of the influenza outbreak in which only 50% of physicians available and volunteer to continue to give services during the pandemic. 26 It is additionally high as compared to research conducted at Indian wherever solely 41.8% of the dentists were willing to give urgency services to patients throughout the increment of COVID-19, 3 AlSaif et al conjointly showed 57.4% of medical students were volunteer give service to figure as a part of HCW workforce throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 7 Although it is important just in case of disasters it is troublesome to get a 100% participation of healthcare workers. Previous studies prompt that between 65% and 97% of healthcare workers were volunteers to involve in an exceedingly natural disaster, and between 54% and 86% in respiratory illness pandemic. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] The percentage of HCW who convey volunteers to give service ranged from 31% throughout the influenza outbreak in Hong Kong to 58% of US medical students focusing speculative influenza crisis. 31, 32 Two hundred fifty-five (62.65%) professionals were volunteers to serve for COVID-19 cases even in a suboptimal environment like lack of food and shelter. It is very low as compared to a study conducted in Nepal (72.6%). 25 The finding of this study showed that 185 health professionals (45.45%) had no absentee record response from work. The major motivation of healthcare workers during a COVID-19 increment includes professional obligation 326 (80.1%), social obligation 150 (36.90%) and compulsion from inistitution102 (25.1%). While a study conducted in Japan throughout the H1N1 pandemics indicated that giving safety to doctors, and support to the deceased doctor's family are some of the initiating agents for them to work. 33 It is also lower than the study conducted in Nepal (79.1%) where professional obligation as a motivating factor. The belief in work safety throughout any kind of disaster plays a key role in the volunteer to participate. 27 The major vital barrier that influences HCW temperament to participate throughout the earthquake situation and respiratory disorder pandemic were fear and anxiety. 34 Negligence, not fear of punishment, and seek incentive is more common among well-experienced Healthcare professionals. This will ban them from volunteer willingness to participate in a pandemic. Health caregiver who was divorced always has a psychological problem. This may hinder them from volunteer participation in the crisis.Increasing the hospital's safety and resilience, adequate infection control policy, providing incentives and hazard allowance was the major motivating factor for HCW's willingness to participate. Dissemination of information on workplace safety and continuous supply of PPE during many types of a pandemic is vital. An unsafe workplace could lead to increase absenteeism during external or internal disasters. 34, 35 In this study from a total of 407 study participants, 165 (40.5%) of them had not prepared for prevention of themselves 22 Highly motivated, competent, and well-prepared healthcare providers will cope-up with serious outbreak. Such action will improve community health needs and end up with the best health outcomes. During a crisis, Healthcare professionals are expected to give services both for people suffering from disasters and for their regular patients. Few of them also wanted to care for their dependents. The unexpected decrement in the healthcare work force during a disaster is common because some healthcare providers are not willing to involve in disaster. 36, 37 About one-third of respondents had agreed 34.2% as they have the equipment (PPE) and keep themselves safe, 39.6% as they feel confident and keeps themselves healthy infrastructure and wrong perception amongst community members on the risk of infection source for this virus. 17 Preparedness of HCP before the occurrence of pandemic and disaster can decrease the further burden of the crisis. Additionally, knowing the factors that hinder the willingness to work of HCP during the COVID-19 pandemic can halt human power shortage and increase continuity of service. [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] The use of Telemedicine, increasing hospital safety, adequate infection control policy, incentives, and hazard allowance were the major motivating factor providing continuous service during a crisis. 45 The use of Telemedicine can play an important role for Healthcare professionals including costsaving, diminished travel time and reduced lost-work-time, reduce contact of patient's infection risk and compensate the limited Healthcare professionals so it is better to use Telemedicine during COVID-19 crisis. 46, 47 The selection of study participants depended on their voluntary participation. Several study participants of the responders may give service within the hospitals of the various fields wherever the exposure to vital COVID-19 patients is also limited; so, their reality and perspective concerning COVID-19 may take issue.The healthcare professional's willingness to work during COVID-19 infection increment was low. More than onethird of the study participants were not prepared for giving services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Having more experience and being divorced were the independent predictors of not willing to work. Lack of personal protective equipment was the independent and significant predictor of poor preparedness. Use of Telemedicine, provision of personal protective equipment, increasing hospital safety and adequate infection control policy, as well as the provision of incentives such as hazard allowance, may help to decrease staff absentee and provision of continuous service during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Assigning staffs who have experience more than ten years in the risky wards of the hospitals may also decrease staff absenteeism and increase the provision of continuous service.

Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in 191 countries. By the end of 2020, over 1.7 million deaths had been attributed to COVID-19, i.e., the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (2) . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and classified its spread as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. By comparison, the transmission of other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV) has been much more limited (3, 4) .SARS-CoV-2 has however not spread evenly throughout the world. Europe and the Americas (e.g., USA, Brazil, Mexico) constitute the most affected regions (5) . In these settings, the recorded incidence of the novel coronavirus has often remained high since the first few months of 2020, causing significant excess mortality relative to previous years (6) (7) (8) (9) . Other large outbreaks have been documented, for example in south Asia (10) as well as in Iran (11) . In contrast, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 appears low in African countries, which have recorded fewer than 4% of the global cases and deaths in 2020, despite accounting for more than 15% of the world population (12) .This limited burden of COVID-19 on the African continent contrasts with expectations and projections formulated at the beginning of the pandemic. At that time, there were strong concerns that overcrowding in slum neighborhoods of large cities, limited access to water and sanitation, inadequate human resources for health, and the high-prevalence of multigenerational households might create a particularly fertile ground for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (13, 14) . A model from the WHO regional office for Africa thus projected 37 million symptomatic cases in 2020, requiring high levels of hospitalization and life support throughout the African continent (15) . Whereas some African countries have indeed experienced multiple waves of the pandemic and high levels of excess mortality (e.g., South Africa), most African countries have not reported the predicted levels of strain on healthcare systems, and associated increases in morbidity and mortality (16, 17) .Several theories have been proposed to explain the lower-than-expected burden of in most African countries in 2020. Some theories have emphasized the limited links between the continent and other world regions where SARS-CoV-2 first spread. African countries might thus have experienced a delayed onset of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks due to the low volume of air travel to the region (18) . Urbanization is also more limited in African countries than in other parts of the world (19) . Lower population densities in rural areas limit opportunities for spreading SARS-CoV-2 in large regions of African countries (20) . Other theories have suggested that the transmissibility of the novel coronavirus might be lower on most of the African continent. This might be because of climate factors, since SARS-CoV-2 spreads less efficiently in warm weather (21) . It might also be attributed to (partial) protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses (17, 21) , genetic differences in susceptibility to viruses (22) , or the non-specific effects of some vaccines (e.g., BCG) frequently administered to local populations (23) . Furthermore, youthful age pyramids in African countries leave a smaller proportion of the population at-risk of severe COVID-19 and death compared to populations with an older age structure (20, 24, 25) .In addition, rapid policy responses might have played a key role in limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in African countries. For example, several African countries closed their borders when COVID-19 cases were growing rapidly in China and in Europe. This might have delayed and/or reduced the importation of SARS-CoV-2. Restrictions on schools and gatherings and/or lockdowns might have reduced the scale on which the novel coronavirus could spread during the early phase of the pandemic. In South Africa, a lockdown and its associated travel restrictions might have limited the growth of the epidemic between March and June 2020 (26) .Recent experience with other epidemic diseases (e.g., Ebola, HIV) might have better prepared local health actors for engaging local communities, and implementing required information campaigns, quarantines and contact tracing (27, 28) .Beyond these oft-discussed factors, the limited burden of COVID-19 on the African continent might also be an artifact of incomplete data collection systems (12) . As in other regions of the world, the recording of cases by epidemiological surveillance systems in African countries depends on the extent of testing for SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR. In several countries, the laboratory capacity to conduct such tests was not immediately available at the start of the outbreak and had to be established. In other countries, few reference laboratories had the capacity to carry out RT-PCR tests. These laboratories might have been initially overwhelmed by the volume of tests to be conducted to support pandemic response. Subsequently, the testing capacity has been greatly expanded in several countries, for example by mobilizing GeneXpert machines commonly used to test for tuberculosis (29) . Nonetheless, African countries have so far conducted fewer tests per 1,000 people than elsewhere (30) . The proportion of COVID-19 cases (and deaths) that are not recorded in case-based surveillance systems might thus be larger in African countries than in other parts of the world (12) . Most African countries also lack death registration systems that are sufficiently complete to allow detecting peaks of excess mortality due to the pandemic, even in the absence of extensive testing for SARS-CoV-2 (31) .In this paper, we analyzed data from a panel study conducted in Malawi during the 6 months that followed the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. We used these data to 1) evaluate the potential extent of under-reporting of COVID-19 cases in case-based surveillance systems, and 2) explore the pace at which protective behaviors (e.g., physical distancing, mask use) were adopted in response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2.The potential for a pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 to spread within a population depends on the interactions between features of the virus and the characteristics and behaviors of its (human) hosts. This is summarized in an indicator called the basic reproduction number, ! (41) . It is defined as the number of new infections produced by a single infection in a completely susceptible population. An epidemic has the potential to expand when ! is greater than 1, and it contracts when ! is below 1. ! is often expressed as the product of 3 parameters: (1) the probability that the virus is transmitted when a susceptible individual comes into contact with someone who is infected (transmissibility, noted ); (2) the average rate at which susceptible and infected individuals come into contact (noted ̅ ), and (3) the amount of time infected individuals remain contagious, i.e., they are able to transmit the virus (noted ). We thus have:Controlling a viral outbreak then requires reducing one or several of those parameters, so that ! drops below 1 in a sustained manner.SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted before the appearance, or in the absence, of symptoms (42) (43) (44) (48) , and wearing facial masks to reduce the risk of infection from droplets and other aerosols (49) . Other interventions to reduce the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 may emphasize increasing ventilation of indoor space to limit transmission via aerosols (50) .In African countries, as in other areas of the world, governments and health stakeholders have promoted a mix of behavioral changes, which aim to reduce and ̅ simultaneously.Investigations of the determinants of epidemic dynamics in African countries have however focused on changes in the rate of contact between infected and susceptible individuals ( ̅ ).Malawi is a low-income country located in southeastern Africa, with a population of approximately 18 million. It had an estimated life expectancy of 63.7 years in 2019 (60) . Since the 1980's, it is affected by a large HIV epidemic (61, 62) . In 2015-16, more than 1 in 10 adults had HIV, and among those only 76.8% were aware of their HIV status (63) . Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Malawi had made significant progress towards the achievement of various healthrelated goals, particularly those related to HIV treatment (64, 65) and to the improvement childhood survival (66) . In recent years, the incidence of non-communicable diseases linked to unhealthy behaviors has increased in urban and rural areas (67) (68) (69) .Concurrently, several measures were taken to reduce contact between susceptible and infected individuals in the population. As part of the national disaster declaration at the end of March, schools and universities were closed throughout the country, and attendance of public gatherings was limited to 100 people. A national lockdown was then announced on April 18 th Respondents in the COVID-19 panel had previously participated in a study of the measurement of adult mortality. This ""pre-COVID-19 study"" was completed before the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Malawi. It was nested within the activities of a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) located in Karonga district, in northern Malawi (76, 77) . This is an area bordering Lake Malawi to the east and located within 1.5-hour drive of the Tanzania border. Its economy is predominantly organized around fishing, subsistence farming (e.g., rice, cassava) and smallscale retail activities.In total, we sought to obtain the phone numbers of 1,036 participants in the pre- Due to its sampling frame, and to selective participation in a survey conducted by mobile phone, the sample of the COVID-19 panel is not representative of the population of Malawi, or Karonga district. We thus do not use these data to estimate the prevalence of various symptoms or behaviors in the country at various points during the pandemic. Instead, we use multiple measurements available for each panel participant to a) understand the potential scale of underreporting of COVID-19 in data derived from RT-PCR tests, and b) assess the pace at which study participants adopted protective behaviors against SARS-CoV-2.In each round of the COVID-19 panel, we asked respondents whether they had experienced, during the previous month, a number of symptoms previously reported among COVID-19 cases in clinical studies (11, 80, 81) . These symptoms included, coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, headaches or fatigue. We only included loss of smell/taste (82, 83) in the list of symptoms elicited in rounds 2, 3 and 4 of the COVID-19 panel. Starting in round 3, we asked respondents who reported any symptom possibly related to COVID-19 whether they self-isolated upon experiencing these symptoms.We also asked respondents whether they had ever been tested for SARS-CoV-2. In round 4, we added a description of the sample collection procedure in our question about SARS-CoV-2 testing (i.e., that a long swab was inserted in the patient's nostrils). This description was introduced to help prevent confusion with other COVID-related screening procedures (e.g., temperature checks) widely in Malawi implemented since the start of the pandemic.In each round of data collection, we investigated the behaviors respondents used to reduce the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and/or limit their contacts in the month before the survey. First, to explore changes in ̅ , i.e., the rate of contact between infected and susceptible individuals, we inquired about respondents' living arrangements. We asked respondents how many people resided in their households, and how many rooms their house included. This provided an indicator of the potential for intra-household exposure to/transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Second, to measure contacts outside of the household, we asked respondents whether they had attended various places and events. We drew a list of places where people commonly interact and socialize in Malawi, which included markets, churches and mosques, neighbors or relatives'houses, workplaces, football games or funerals. Then, we asked respondents if they had attended each of these places/events in the past 7 days before the interview.We also asked respondents to list the behaviors they had used to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the past month. This question was adapted from instruments previously administered in COVID-related surveys conducted in high-income countries (84) . During pre-testing and piloting activities, we drew a list of possible answers to this question. This list included behaviors that reduce , e.g., use of facial masks, physical distancing or handwashing, as well as behaviors that reduce ̅ , e.g., avoiding crowded areas. Interviewers did not read this list to respondents. Instead, they let them spontaneously recall their behaviors, and coded their answer using the list of potential behaviors. If a behavior was not included in the list, they coded it as ""other"" and specified the respondent's answer in a follow-up question. Multiple answers were allowed, and after each answer, interviewers were instructed to probe further in a nonspecific manner, by asking respondents whether there was anything else that they did to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.Interviewers let respondents answer spontaneously and they coded their answer using a list of possible reasons. This list included, for example, ""self-protection"", ""to protect others"", ""to meet a requirement (e.g., to enter a building)"" or ""to avoid a fine"". Multiple answers were allowed. After each reason mentioned by a respondent, interviewers were instructed to probe further by asking whether there was an additional reason.Data analysis: we first described the socio-economic characteristics of panel participants who completed all 4 rounds of data collection, including their reported gender, age, marital status, occupation and religion. Second, we analyzed trends in their experience of COVID-related symptoms over time. We classified participants in 3 groups according to their reported experience of symptoms during the course of the study: those without any reported symptoms, those who developed a cough, and those who developed one or more other symptoms previously associated with COVID-19. We then assessed the level of testing for SARS-CoV-2 in our panel sample, and we explored whether testing rates varied across these 3 groups. To measure testing rates, we only considered SARS-CoV-2 testing histories reported during round 4, because we introduced a more precisely worded question during that round. Low testing rates among those with new onset of various COVID-related symptoms constitute an indication of the extent of under-reporting of the SARS-CoV-2 burden in this sample.4.8% in urban areas) and they engaged in activities related to agriculture and fishing at a much higher rate (46.0% vs. 8.6% in urban areas). Crowded households (i.e., with more than 3 people per room) were slightly more common in rural areas. In addition, <1% of respondents reported using residential strategies (e.g., moving to a new house or flat, appendix A2) to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. place of residence, and b) the type of COVID-related symptom experienced. In particular, participants who experienced a cough were more likely to report self-isolating than participants who reported other symptoms (e.g., fever, headaches). Self-isolation was especially high during round 3 among urban participants who had recently been coughing (i.e., 70%).various behaviors that modify the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. In each round, more than 90% of participants reported washing their hands more often (figure 8). In round 1, the next most commonly reported behaviors affecting transmissibility were the use of hand sanitizer among urban respondents and covering up coughs/sneezes among rural residents. In subsequent rounds however, panel participants reported adopting other strategies as their main preventive behaviors. For example, whereas the use of physical distancing was reported by approximately 10% of participants in round 1, it increased to close to 60% in round 2 among participants in urban areas, and to similar levels in round 3 among participants in rural areas.The use of physical distancing then stopped increasing in rural areas in round 4, and even declined among urban participants.The proportion of participants who reported using a mask at any point in the past month remained approximately constant in rounds 3 & 4 of the panel study. However, the frequency of mask use declined markedly between round 3 and 4 ( figure 9 ). In rural areas, the proportions of mask users who reported wearing masks either ""always"" or ""very often"" declined from 71.2% to 39.7%, whereas in urban areas, corresponding figures were 78.9% and 44.7%.The reasons for wearing masks reported by participants also varied between rounds 3 and 4. In round 3, self-protection and protection of others were the most commonly reported reasons for mask use. In round 4, on the other hand, more than 50% of participants also reported wearing a mask due to requirements, either to enter a building or to receive a service (appendix A3). In rural areas, the proportion of mask users who reported wearing a mask to comply with a requirement nearly doubled between rounds 3 and 4. Fewer than 1% of respondents reported wearing a mask because they worried about fines imposed by the Government, because of social pressure or because they were sick or presented symptoms.In this study, we found that the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the country is likely larger than reflected in case-based surveillance datasets that rely on RT-PCR diagnostics.We found that several protective behaviors were adopted widely in our study sample during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi. These included in particular behaviors that reduce the transmissibility of the novel coronavirus. More than half of panel participants reported adopting the recommended practice of physical distancing between rounds 1 & 3.CoV-2 clusters in other contexts (91) . Most respondents have also reduced the consistency of their mask use: whereas in round 3, more than two thirds of mask users reported ""always"" wearing a mask outside of their household, this proportion dropped to <25% in round 4. Mask use appears increasingly sustained by requirements to wear masks to access various buildings and services, rather than by a motivation to protect others. These trends might enhance the likelihood of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the event of new imported cases and/or the emergence of more transmissible viral strains (92) .These findings about the adoption of protective behaviors suffer from several limitations. First, respondents might have over-reported their use of recommended protective measures. For example, a recent study found that, in a sub-county of Kenya, self-reported mask use greatly exceeded the levels of mask use recorded by independent observers (93) . In our study, the extent of such social desirability bias in self-reports of protective behaviors might have varied over time: incentives to report compliance with mask use recommendations might have been higher after the MoH had mandated the use of masks in public and imposed fines on noncompliers. Since this mandate was adopted when confirmed cases were near their peak (i.e., early August), this might have created a spurious temporal association between increasing reported mask use and declining case/symptoms. In our data however, the reported frequency of mask use declined sharply in round 4, at a time when the mandate to wear masks in public was still in place.Notes: The experience of symptoms was ascertained over the course of the panel study, whereas the experience of testing for SARS-CoV-2 was reported in round 4. COVID-related symptoms elicited during the surveys included fever, chest pains, shortness of breath, fatigue, shivering, headache, muscle pain, runny nose, sore throat, cough and wheezing. Notes: the data plotted in this graph were collected from a series of questions asking respondents whether they had attended the places listed on the y-axis in the past 7 days prior to the survey. The point estimates are labeled by their round number on the plot. The places that appear on the y-axis are ordered according to their attendance in urban areas in round 1. Notes: the data plotted in this graph were collected from a question asking respondents who reported having used a mask in the past month, why they had done so. Respondents were not provided with potential answers. However, after each response, interviewers were instructed to probe further, by asking respondents: ""was there another reason?"".

Aid workers have often been targeted for carrying out life-saving humanitarian work. The country's capacity to prevent, detect and respond to emerging and expanding health threats such as COVID-19 has been substantially low. The Global Health Security Index in 2019 was 16.6 out of 100 indicating that the country was unprepared to manage such epidemics (Homepage - GHS Index, n.d.) . At the onset of the pandemic, Somalia had no single laboratory with the capacity to diagnose coronavirus (Mohammed A. M. Ahmed et al., 2020) and the country's health workforce is severely limited.In the absence of a strong system for surveillance and response, the government focused its efforts on testing only suspected cases (Mohammed A M Ahmed et al., 2020) . As such, the actual number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Somalia has likely been underestimated.Limited information is available on the burden of COVID-19 infection among health workers in fragile and weak health systems (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2020) . Here we present the preliminary findings of COVID-19 infection in Somali HCWs, the first of such information from Somalia.As of 30 September 2020, 3700 cases of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), including 98 associated deaths, have been reported in Somalia. Of these cases, 191 (5%) were HCWs, two of whom died. Owing to probable underreporting, weak surveillance reporting systems in hospital settings, stigma associated with testing/self-reporting as infected and because most cases present with mild or asymptomatic infection, the reported number of HCWs who contracted COVID-19 may be an underestimate.During the first 180 days of the start of outbreak, 311 HCWs were tested for COVID-19 of which 191 tested positive with a positivity rate of 61%. While all the six states in the country has reported infection in HCWs, there were states where very high positivity rates have been reported (Table 1) .[Please insert Table 1 here]Weekly progression: infection in health workers mirrored the country-wide exponential increase J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 Data on COVID-19 in HCWs showed that between epidemiological weeks 18 and 22 in May, when the number of cases across the country was also increasing and the outbreak spread rapidly, more HCWs (113/191; 59%) were infected during this peak period. The trend, though, varied throughout this outbreak (Fig. 1) . Despite limited data available, it seems that during the peak of the outbreak, frontline HCWs represented >5% of all cases of COVID-19. In some other countries such as in Italy, at least 20% of all COVID-19 cases during the epidemic's peak were in frontline HCWs (The Lancet, 2020).[Please insert Figure 1 here]Our data also suggests that of the 191 HCWs who contracted COVID-19 between 16 March and 30 September, 52 (27%) were doctors treating COVID-19 cases in hospital, 63 (33%) were nurses directly and indirectly involved in managing infected patients. Only 7 (4%) of laboratory technicians engaged in sample collection/handling were infected. Other staff working in the healthcare setting (e.g. cleaners, security guards, ambulance drivers, etc.) comprised 36% (68/191) (Fig. 2 ). This occupational pattern indicates a higher infection rate in HCWs either working in emergency rooms or providing critical care support for patients in high containment (intensive care) and indoor (e.g. laboratories, sample collection centres and isolation centres) settings. Our data indicated that the hospital ancillary staff (cleaners, security guards, housekeepers, ambulance drivers, etc.) had the highest rate of infection (36%) amongst all J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (27%).Our data showed that men were also at higher risk of infection than women, 150/191 (79%) men contracted COVID-19 compared with 41/191 (21%) women. Such findings were similar to what has been seen elsewhere and this needs to be explored further (Sim, 2020; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2020) .Protecting frontline HCWs during any public health emergency should remain a high priority, especially in fragile settings where the health workforce is significantly smaller than it should be to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. The sub-Saharan region has 0.2 doctors for every 1000 people, and this is well below the global average of 1.6 (Wadvalla, 2020). 1 Based on experience with other respiratory viruses, consistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is important to reduce transmission. However, anecdotal data suggest that shortages of masks, respirators, face shields and gowns, caused by the surge in demand and supply chain disruptions at the beginning of the outbreak, might have led to efforts to conserve PPE through extended use or reuse by HCWs. A number of studies in Africa have also suggested that knowledge among frontline health workers on transmission risks remains low, necessitating educational training programmes to ensure adherence to standard precautionary measures (Nkansah et al., 2020) (Elhadi et al., 2020) . However, many of these studies did not show a difference between different categories of HCWs, if any, in risk perception, knowledge or adherence to strict infection control/precautionary measures.Although addressing the needs of frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic is high priority, data to better understand the exposure risk of HCWs and mode of transmission, especially on the availability and proper use of PPE and adherence of HCWs to other infection control measures, are scarce. In fragile countries where the health workforce is already understaffed, high numbers of infections in HCWs means that hospitals have less capacity to care for patients, not only from COVID-19, but from other conditions. This situation will also disrupt essential healthcare services as there will not be enough HCWs to provide other routine services.One of the limitations for generalising the study findings and its interpretation is the small number of HCWs included in the study for understanding the risk of infection and its public health policy implication.

The disease has claimed millions of lives and wreaked economic havoc worldwide since it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The problem is further compounded by some countries experiencing a second and third wave of the pandemic [2, 3] and the emergence of new and possibly more virulent strains of the virus [4] . All these, coupled with its high infectivity rate resulted in an unprecedented global effort to develop and produce safe and effective vaccines within an equally unprecedented short time frame [5] . This feat was achieved in the last quarter of the year 2020 when the first set of safe and effective vaccine candidates received pre-licensure emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Agency in the United States of America and other countries [6] .However, the rapid positive progress in the fight against the COVID 19 pandemic has also brought new concerns. One such concern is the effect of the unprecedented speed of development and approval for use of the successful vaccine candidates on the already tenuous public confidence in vaccines and vaccinations. Prior to the pandemic, the waning public confidence in vaccines that had been simmering for decades reached crisis levels, prompting the WHO to declare 'vaccine hesitancy' as one of the ten threats to global health in the year 2019 [7] . Defined in 2012 as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite the availability of vaccination services [8] , vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, and varies across time, place and vaccines [8, 9] . Vaccine confidence is one of the most common determinants of vaccine hesitancy globally [10] . Vaccine confidence refers to trust in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, trust in the competency of the healthcare providers that administer them, and trust in the intentions of the policy makers that propose them [11] . Therefore, estimating the vaccine confidence levels in a population should give an indication of how hesitant or otherwise the population maybe. It has been indicated that an inverse relationship exists between vaccine confidence and vaccine hesitancy [12] , therefore an estimate of the level of vaccine confidence would indirectly be indicative of the level of vaccine hesitancy in a given population. This takes on a greater importance if the vaccine confidence investigation is conducted among the subset of the population charged with the responsibility of administering and promoting vaccines and vaccination to the rest of the general public; that is, healthcare workers and their trainers.The crucial role of healthcare workers to the success of vaccination uptake is well recognized as they are usually the most trusted source of health information for the general public [13] [14] [15] . Negative vaccine sentiments expressed by some of them is a cause for concern as those self-reporting to be vaccine hesitant also admit to not administering, recommending, or following the recommended vaccination schedule with their patients [13, 15] . This can undermine vaccination uptake in populations served by such healthcare workers, leading to pockets of under-vaccinated individuals who could potentially serve as reservoirs for outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. An undesirable situation to be avoided as much as possible especially in this pandemic period.Vaccine attitudes of healthcare workers have been investigated in diverse contexts and places [14, [16] [17] [18] [19] , and similar studies have been carried out among medical students and healthcare workers in training [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, few studies have reported on vaccine attitudes among future health care workers in training and their trainers together. This underscores the need for such a study as this that proposes to estimate the vaccine confidence index among both subsets of the population. In addition, the study will also be providing insight into intention to take COVID 19 vaccines in the study population when they become available. This will be a crucial piece in the knowledge puzzle of the vaccination attitudes among this subset of the population and contribute to that of the wider South African population. In the planned three-phase roll out of COVID 19 vaccination in the country[26], frontline healthcare workers are the priority population scheduled to receive the vaccines in the first phase. Having this baseline knowledge will assist in identifying possible barriers and facilitators to the receipt of the COVID 19 vaccines in the study population, and will provide more recent and supplementary information on intention to take COVID 19 vaccines of the general South African population in addition to those previously reported [10, 27] .In a 67-country survey study of the state of vaccine confidence conducted by Larson and her team 2015, they found that vaccine sentiments were generally positive across the countries surveyed which included South Africa [10] . However, they also reported a diversity of negative sentiments regarding vaccine safety and other issues which varied between continents and countries. The study had four statements related to attitudes towards vaccines: ""vaccines are important for children to have""; ""overall I think vaccines are safe""; ""overall I think vaccines are effective""; and ""vaccines are compatible with my religious beliefs"". Participants were asked to rate the degree to which they agree with each statement on the five-point Likert scale: ""strongly agree"", ""tend to agree"", ""do not know"", ""tend to disagree,"" or ""strongly disagree"". The proportion of South African participants who were skeptical of the importance, safety, effectiveness, and religious compatibility of vaccines were 6.6%, 10.2%, 10.2%, and 14.2% respectively. Over half a decade has elapsed since this survey was conducted, the world at large has changed and so has the vaccination landscape, especially with the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its disease sequalae, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic.The proposed study seeks to answer the following research question: what is the level of vaccine confidence of a cohort of future healthcare workers and their trainers at an academic institution in Cape Town, South Africa? The aim is to estimate the vaccine confidence level of current academic staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at a University in Cape Town.This is a cross sectional study including three subsets of the academic institution's population; academic staff, students, and staff that are also currently pursuing an academic qualification. The operational definition of ""academic staff"" for the purpose of this proposed study is staff that are engaged in teaching at both undergraduate and post graduate levels.Voluntary participation in the survey will be deemed as consent. Only current academic staff and students are eligible to participate.The survey will be conducted online using REDCAP survey software to capture participants' responses. The target population is the entire current academic staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the selected University (i.e. a census of all three sub-groups). It is expected that enough data would be generated through the responses received to power the study to answer the research question. A succinct questionnaire consisting of two types of questions; (1) demographic questions which would be the covariates of the vaccine confidence analysis which includes, but not limited to age and gender, and (2) the four vaccine confidence statements used in the 67 country survey [10] with the addition of two new statements. The first additional statement is about the importance self-vaccination, and the second additional statement is about COVID 19 vaccination intention. All participants will be encouraged to rate all statements as they apply to them. For each vaccine confidence statement, each participant will be asked to rate the degree with which he or she agrees with it; on a five-point Likert scale: strongly agree, tend to agree, do not know, tend to disagree, strongly disagree. The four vaccine confidence statements from the 67 country study [10] are: ""vaccines are important for children to have""; ""overall I think vaccines are safe""; ""overall I think vaccines are effective""; and ""vaccines are compatible with my religious beliefs"". In addition, as earlier indicated, we will add one question on vaccine importance (""vaccines are important for me to have"") and one about vaccine intention (""I will take a Covid-19 vaccine when one becomes available""). The responses will be on the same five-point Likert scale as above. The questionnaire will be in English.After data collection, each questionnaire will be checked for its completeness. Data entry, cleaning and coding will be done using the REDCAP survey software or Microsoft Excel program and exported to Stata software version 16.1 (College Station, TX) for analysis.Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and proportions. Continuous covariates will be presented using mean and standard deviation if normally distributed or using median and Inter Quartile Range (IQR) if not normally distributed.Statistical significance will be defined at a p-value <0.05. The main outcome to be investigated is the variability in the vaccine sentiment and vaccine intention within and across all groups. This will be done by considering the fraction of respondents that will either agree or disagree with the five statements on immunization and the one statement on ""intention to vaccinate"" previously described [10] . The ""strongly agree"" and ""tend to agree"" responses will be combined to make up the positive vaccine sentiments variable, while the ""strongly disagree"" and ""tend to disagree"" responses will be combined to make up the negative vaccine sentiment variable. The ""don't know response"" and no response will be removed from the data prior analysis.A limitation of this proposed study is a possible low response rate which is an inherent limitation of such online surveys. To mitigate against this, the questionnaire is kept short (a total of twelve items in all), drop down options or multiple-choice answers are provided as appropriate to facilitate obtaining timeous, complete and correct responses. At least two reminders, one per week will be sent to follow-up two weeks after the initial email with the survey link is circulated. In addition, cash incentives of a specified amount will be offered to randomly selected participants, one from each group from among the completed, valid received responses. Weighing method would be used to adjust for nonresponse bias should this challenge be encountered [28] .This study obtained ethics approval from Stellenbosch University in South Africa: HumanResearch Ethics Committee (HREC) reference # S19/01/014 (PhD).The study results will be presented at conferences and other relevant and appropriate platforms.

[4] [5] [6] As a prelude of SARS-CoV-2's cell entry, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein (S-protein) 7 on the virion surface binds ACE2 on a host cell. Therefore, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 becomes a primary target of the host immune system and is used as the leading antigen for vaccine development. Despite being detected from three different continents, the fact that the three aforementioned SARS-CoV-2 variants share some of the same mutations at the S-protein's RBD suggests that these mutations might have conferred an evolutionary advantage to the virus. While various mutations as well as deletions outside the RBD of S-protein are also important for the enhanced fitness (of variants) for entering host cells, here we focus on mutations in RBD that harbors the binding site of ACE2 and the epitopes for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).For the U.K. variant (with the N501Y mutation on RBD), experimental studies have demonstrated that the reproductive number which measures its infectiousness is about 0.4 to 0.7 higher than other strains of the virus 8 and determined recently it is unlikely to escape the BNT162b2-vaccine-mediated protection. 9 Our previous work 10 showed that this mutation in the U.K. variant can increase the RBD's binding affinity with ACE2, but has no obvious effect on mAbs. Besides the N501Y mutation, the South Africa and Brazil variants also contain the K417N and E484K mutations. Recent studies showed that the E484K mutation can not only enhance the RBD-ACE2 binding 11 but also help virus escape the therapeutically relevant mAbs. 12 However, reflected by the paucity of existing work the significance of the K417N mutation so far is still elusive, which prevents us from fully understanding these new variants' infection mechanism. As shown in Fig. 1a , in the wild-type RBD, K417 forms a salt-bridge with D30 in ACE2. Thus, the K417N mutation resulting in the abolishment of this favorable interfacial interaction (i.e. reducing the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity as also being verified in experiment 11 ) is highly unintuitive. Here, we are motivated to investigate the molecular mechanism of the K417N mutation, in order to unveil its key benefits for the virus to evolve through this path.Complementary to experimental efforts, the all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with sophisticated and well calibrated force fields have been widely used to image nanoscale events and investigate the molecular mechanism of proteins. [13] [14] [15] [16] In this work, we conducted a computational analysis on the K417N mutation in the South Africa variant using MD simulations with explicit solvent, aiming to gain a better understanding of its underlying molecular mechanism. Besides the RBD-ACE2 interaction, we also investigated the RBD's interaction with mAbs. In particularly, we explored the mAb CB6 that recognizes an epitope site in the RBD overlapping the binding site of ACE2, and investigated its binding competition with ACE2 over RBD. Our results may help provide invaluable insights on why K417N has been selected in the viral evolution and inspire a better design of more efficacious mAbs for treating COVID-19 patients infected with the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. calculated the interfacial contact areas for the complexes using the solvent accessible surface area method. 17 On average, the contact area is about 8.6 nm 2 between RBD and ACE2 while the one for the RBD-CB6 contact is larger and is about 10.3 nm 2 . During the entire simulation time, values of contact areas fluctuated around the mean, indicating that these two complex-structures were stable and equilibrated in the electrolyte.By examining the simulation trajectories, we found that K417 indeed played an important role in stabilizing the RBD-ACE2 and RBD-CB6 complexes. In Fig. 2b , we highlight the time-dependent number N of heavy (or non-hydrogen) atoms in ACE2 or CB6 that were within 5 Å of K417 in RBD. Notably, K417 in RBD interacts with many more atoms in CB6 than in ACE2. The average saturated number N for the RBD-CB6 complex is about 23 atoms (orange line in Fig. 2b ), while the one for the RBD-ACE2 complex is only about 6 atoms (blue line in Fig. 2b) . Additionally, the number N for the RBD-ACE2 complex fluctuates much more than the one for the RBD-CB6 complex, which indicates that the interaction in the latter complex is more stable.Among those residues (in ACE2 or CB6) in contact with K417 in RBD, we discovered two key salt-bridges. One is formed by K417 in RBD and D30 in ACE2 (as shown in Fig. 1a ).We illustrate in Fig. 2c that this salt-bridge is on the surface of the RBD-ACE2 complex.Thus, this salt-bridge is exposed to water and constantly disrupted by polar water molecules, accounting for the observed fluctuations in N (blue line in Fig. 2b ). The other one is formed by K417 in RBD and D104 in CB6 as shown in Fig. 2d . Remarkably, this salt-bridge is buried among the heterotrimer composed of RBD and two variable domains of the heavy chain V H and light chain V L of CB6. This salt-bridge buried inside the protein complex was very stable during the simulation, consistent with the nearly constant number N in Fig. 2b (orange line).To further demonstrate the stability of these two salt-bridges, we define the distance D between the NZ atom in the lysine (K) and the CG atom in the aspartate (D), as shown in the inset of Fig. 3a . The histograms in Fig. 3a show the probability distributions of the By definition, binding free energy changes for RBD with either ACE2 or CB6 (due to the K417N mutation) can be obtained as ∆∆G = ∆G 2 − ∆G 1 (see Fig. 3 ). In practice, it is not easy to directly calculate ∆G 1 and ∆G 2 , which can be circumvented by computing ∆G A and ∆G B instead using the thermodynamic cycle (see Fig. 3 ). Therefore, ∆∆G = ∆G A − ∆G B .Through the ensemble average, 18 ∆G A and ∆G B can be calculated theoretically (see Method 3d and 3e) , the K417N mutation yielded a free-energy change ∆G B of -32.08 kcal/mol.In the bound state for the RBD-CB6 (Figs. 3b and 3c) , the free energy change ∆G A =-22.49 kcal/mol. Taking all together, the obtained value of ∆∆G is 9.59 kcal/mol, suggesting that the K417N mutation significantly reduced the binding affinity between RBD and CB6.Similarly, for the RBD-ACE2 complex, we have ∆G A =-30.60 kcal/mol and consequently ∆∆G is 1.48 kcal/mol. Thus, the K417N mutation reduced the binding affinity between RBD and ACE2 as well, but the reduction is about 6.5 time less than that between RBD and CB6. Previously, it was demonstrated in experiment that the K417N mutation weakened the binding affinity between RBD and ACE2, 11 which is consistent with our simulation results.The noticeably small errors listed in Tab. 1 manifest the accuracy and convergence afforded by the FEP methodology. the complex of RBD (of the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein) and human antibodies, surprisingly we noticed that K417 in RBD can form a buried salt-bridge with either a glutamate or an aspartate in four other human antibodies as highlighted in IGHV-53 (Fig. 4a) , C1AB3 (Fig.   4b ), BD-236 (Fig. 4c) and CC12.1 (Fig. 4d) . Thus, it is likely that all these antibodies may not be able to neutralize the 501Y.V2 variant. It is worth noting that while writing this paper, an experimental preprint posted on bioRxiv demonstrating that the South Africa variant can evade the human antibodies CB6 (Fig. 1c , also known as LyCoV016) and CC12.1 ( Fig. 4d) mutations (Fig. S2a) , we observed the same improved binding structure (see Fig. S2b and Movie S1 in the Supporting Information). For the E484K mutation, after about 190ns simulation, K484 moved toward ACE2 to form a salt-bridge exposed on the complex's surface with E75 (see Figs. S2b and S2c, and Movie S1 in the Supporting Information).Therefore, the gain from the improved RBD-ACE2 binding resulted from both N501Y and E484K mutations might be enough to compensate the loss caused by the K417N mutation, and is likely to yield an even stronger interaction with ACE2 than the wild-type virus.In summary, we have shown that K417 plays an important role in the binding between RBD and ACE2/CB6, by forming interfacial salt-bridges. The salt-bridge between K417in RBD and D104 in CB6 is buried inside the complex and is therefore much more stable than the water exposed one formed between K417 in RBD and D30 in ACE2. Thus, the K417N mutation can weaken the RBD's binding with CB6 much more than with ACE2.More dramatically, the K417N mutation allows the variant to escape from many human antibodies other than CB6 by removing a salt-bridge buried in the RBD-antibody interface.Interestingly, the virus with the K417N mutation seems to scarify its binding affinity with ACE2 in order to survive the antibodies' attack. This strategy of eluding human antibodies might have been adopted by SARS-CoV as well, because after the sequence alignment the residue in SARS-CoV corresponding to K417 in SARS-CoV-2 is the valine (V).On the other hand, a recent study has demonstrated that immune systems of human may also quickly respond to these new variants and produce corresponding neutralizing antibodies that contain more somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations. 22 How the continued evolution of the humoral response to recent SARS-CoV-2 variants warrants further studies. Additionally, with the revealed mechanism underlying the K417N mutation, it is possible to design more efficacious antibody cocktails to treat COVID-19 patients infected with the variant 501Y.V2 as well as the recently discovered variant P.1in Brazil.","South Africa","abstract","2021-02-07",2

[4] [5] [6] The extremely fast transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 has aroused concern about its various transmission routes. 5, 7, 8 Knowing the extent of environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving safety practices for HCWs and answering questions about SARS-CoV-2 transmission among the public. 9 The ongoing capacity of viral spill-over from animals causing serious disease in humans has been demonstrated in this pandemic outbreak. 10 It implies the need for close monitoring to find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission routes through the population as well as in dental clinics and hospitals. 10, 11 From day one up to January 01, 2021, official figures released by the World Health Organization (WHO) at a glance, indicate over 84 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide with greater than 1.8 million death toll. Taking this a step further, from the total global confirmed cases, Africa accounts for >1.1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and >24,000.00 deaths have been reported. 14 In sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia has also been hit by this pandemic and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is increasing every single day. According to the Federal Ministry of Health and Ethiopia's integrated COVID-19 control system, the present figure, ie, until first January 2021, is more than 124,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 112,000 recovered and more than 1900 associated death toll. The current national statistics of COVID-19 indicates that the spread of the virus initially increased very slowly but is currently increasing at an alarming rate from the first confirmed COVID-19 case of Japanese citizens who came from Japan to Ethiopia (March 13, 2020). It is globally known that this newly emerged virus negatively affects not only human life and socio-economics but also the healthcare system. The pandemic primarily challenges the healthcare systems in almost every country around the world. 16 The Ethiopian healthcare system faces a shortage of medical supplies such as personal protective equipment like face-covering masks and medical equipment like ventilators, and rapid diagnostic kits. HCWs are not only at the forefront of the fight against this highly contagious infectious disease but are also directly or indirectly affected by it and the likelihood of acquiring this disease is higher as compared to the general population. Most scholars assumed and believed that HCWs have sufficient knowledge and good prevention practice toward COVID-19. 19 The eradication of COVID-19 appears to be virtually impossible, however, with a great trial and efforts of researchers, WHO on Thursday approved the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, a move aimed at helping the developing world gain access to the vaccine sooner. 20 Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. 21 Therefore, based on the WHO and CDC report, understanding its clear mode of transmission and taking appropriate preventive measures are the most essential and life-saving strategies for controlling the disease. 22 Taking this a step further, to flatten the curve of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, ie, social isolation, appropriate face mask usage, following rules of social distancing, avoidance of ""3C"" (Closed, Crowded or involving Close contact), 23 and proper hand washing practice or sanitization are among the most frequently recommended intervention measures. 24, 25 Hence, HCWs are at the forefront of infection prevention, and they are potentially at risk of getting the disease. 26 Therefore, all possible actions must be taken to control the spread of the infection to HCWs. Currently, quarantine areas in Ethiopia are already occupied; transmission of the disease among HCWs is associated with overcrowding, absence of isolation room facilities. So far a multi-centric study showed that HCWs have adequate awareness about the multiple modes of viral transmission as well as infection prevention practices. However, particularly in Ethiopia, the healthcare system is dilapidated and very weak, due to politically assigned hospital administration and expanded corruption. Thus, from time to time, the government's declining attention to the pandemic results in negligence and exhaustion of HCWs regarding containment of the pandemic. 27 Scientific scholars suggest that if there is poor knowledge and practice toward a new epidemic disease, it will become worse and transform into the pandemic range. 29, 30 In order to achieve success against the spread of COVID-19, assessment of the awareness of HCWs and their practice is very important. 7, 8 Taken together, this research focused on understanding the current knowledge toward the pandemic and on evaluating HCWs' practices to tackle the virus, avoid being infected, and protecting others at district primary hospital level.Study Area, Design, and PeriodThe study was conducted in Takusa Woreda, Delghi Primary Hospital, which is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Tana, 152 km from Gondar town, Ethiopia. The hospital serves more than 1.5 million people who reside in Takusa Woreda and other neighboring woreda. The hospital has 68 beds and 4 wards for inpatients, emergency, surgery, and outpatient department (OPD). An institutional-based descriptive cross-sectional study from August to September 2020 G.C was conducted.All professional HCWs at DPH were included during the study period; while non-professionals (including cleaners), professionals who were not in the workplace or not willing to participate, and administrative staff who worked in the hospital were not included in this study.Knowledge and practices toward COVID-19 disease were dependent variables; whereas socio-demographic details which included sex, age, religion, marital status, and profession were independent variables.HCWs: all people engaged in activities whose primary intention is to improve the quality of health. 31 For the purpose of this study, all active and voluntary health professionals who work at DPH were enrolled. These included nurses, laboratory experts, midwives, medical doctors, environmental public health officers, health officers, and an anesthesiologist. Knowledge was defined as having an adequate understanding of COVID-19.Good knowledge: when the respondent answered or scored ≥ 8 of 15 knowledge assessment questions (≥53.3%).Poor knowledge: when the respondent answered or scored < 8 of 15 knowledge assessment questions (<53.3%).Practice was defined as an act of performing given procedure(s) according to a set standard of WHO and CDC.Good practice: when respondent answered or scored ≥ 7 of 14 practice assessment questions (≥50%).Poor practice: when respondent answered or scored < 7 of 14 practice assessment questions (<50%).The total number of HCWs in this study was estimated to be around 112. The total number of willing participants and respondents in this study was 104 HCWs. Non-probability convenience sampling method was used in this study using a structured questionnaire to collect data from participants. This reflects a sample of HCWs that is proportionate to the number of HCWs within the district primary hospital in North West Gondar, Ethiopia.We used a questionnaire adapted from different current and past literature. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Thus, all relevant data were collected by a pre-oriented and trained data collector at the DPH. The questionnaire covers socio-demographics, mediainformation about COVID-19, knowledge, and practice (KP) regarding COVID-19. The questionnaires regarding the assessment of knowledge regarding COVID-19 had 15 questions with Likert-type scale options such as likely, unlikely, and I do not know. The correct answer for each question scored one point and if incorrect zero points. Likewise, an assessment regarding their practices toward COVID-19 was composed of 14 questions and participants responded with Likert-type scale options ranging from always to never. Similar to knowledge score, the practices were assessed and scored one point for each question which was correctly answered, and zero for incorrect answers. Taken together, regarding both knowledge and practice, those who scored above the total average of the knowledge and practice question were considered as ""good"", whereas, below the average value were labeled as ""poor"", respectively. The questionnaire and the collected data were reviewed daily and coded before analysis for clarification, and completeness based on the pre-test. Pre-test phase was conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaire and confirmed by a pilot study on ten HCWs who worked nearby at primary Hospital, Kolladeba primary Hospital, in North West Gondar. Based on the pre-test, proper modifications were completed before the actual data collection and analysis commenced at DPH.After the data were collected, analysis was performed by using International Business Machines Corporation, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS) version 20. Descriptive analysis was done. Frequency distribution and percentage were used to describe data on knowledge as well as practice related to the pandemic. Data were presented in the form of tables and figure. The Pearson's Chi-squared test was utilized to assess the either socio-demographic variables and source of information had an association with both knowledge and practice toward COVID-19. P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. However, because we did not find any association and the survey had a limited sample size, we did not analyze both binary and multiple logistic regression.Among a total of 104 HCWs, 71 (68.3%) were male and 33 (31.7%) were female. The mean age of respondents was 30±5 years and ranged from 20 to 50 years (median age of 28 Originally, knowledge about the pandemic was measured from various information sources with different preference as well as availability or access to the source of the information. This finding demonstrates that HCWs obtained information about this pandemic from social media such as Facebook, telegram, which comprised 45.2% followed by different television programs like ETV, BBC, and CNN comprising 35.6% (Figure 1 ). Of the total social media users, 93.3% of HCWs used it most frequently, and sometimes, whereas only 6.7% never used social media as a source of information. Similarly, Google search engine accounted for 27.9% as source of information regarding COVID-19 among HCWs. Of the total Google search users, 59.6% used it sometimes, but 12.5% of the participants never used it. Very surprisingly, only 7.7% of the participants used international journals like dove medical press or nature frequently as a source of information.The present study also demonstrates the level of participants' knowledge regarding mode of transmission and atrisk groups of the population regarding COVID-19. The result showed more than 50% of HCWs recognized that humans can get the virus from animal contact and contaminated food. On the other hand, greater than 90% of HCWs were aware that the novel corona virus can be transmitted through either inhalation from the nearby infected individuals with sneezing droplets, or physical contact, and hand shaking. Moreover, 87.5% of HCWs thought that this virus was transmissible and considered as airborne disease and kissing equally. Furthermore, HCWs suggested that the virus was not transmitted vertically from mother to fetus via placenta (51%), or mother to child via breast feeding (58.7%), sexual contact (40.4%) and feco-oral route (33.7%) ( Table 2) . Regarding risk factor assessment, majority of HCWs (>94%) assumed individuals with asthma, COPD, and hypertension (HTN) were more likely at risk of case fatality of the disease. In addition, more than 70% of the participants recognized that pregnant women and children were more susceptible to COVID-19.This study also assessed the HCWs who used the types of preventive measures recommended by WHO or CDC to protect themselves or others from SARS-CoV-2. More than 50% of the HCWsalways practiced wearing surgical masks and avoiding hand to nose, eye and mouth contact. They also used hand sanitizer and avoided hand shaking while greeting friends with an equal proportion (64.4%). Surprisingly, around 11.5% never wore face covering masks even in hospital setup. However, more than 70.0% of the HCWs always wore surgical mask and used elbow cover while sneezing. Moreover, 44.2% of the participants frequently maintained the social distancing rule and avoided crowded areas (45%) where probability of getting the virus is high. However, greater than 45% of HCWs sometimes did not respectsocial distancing rule and visited crowded places during the pandemic (Table 3 ).In this study, out of 104 HCWs or health professionals, 94.2% had good levels of knowledge, which implies that the average knowledge score of the participants was 10.45 (SD=1.9, range 2-14) regarding transmission methods of the virus, and vulnerable or at-risk groups of the community. This knowledge score was comparatively higher than that of previously published articles from China (90%), 33 Kenya (88%), 32 Ethiopia (73.8%) 35 (88.2%) 34 and Egypt (80.4%). 19 Another Chinese research study showed that 88% of the healthcare staff were aware of COVID-19 (knowledge score: 8.17 ± 1.30), which was again lower than the current study. 40 The possible reason for the increment of knowledge is due to the accessibility of the information with different media sources in Ethiopia; telecommunication has a default mobile phone sound message during calls about COVID-19 transmission and prevention measures. 15 Despite this, individuals with respiratory disorders are more at risk of developing the disease. This may be due to the respiratory microbiome, which contributes to the host's local immune education and to the development of respiratory diseases, including allergies, asthma and others. 41 Their understanding related to at-risk groups of the population, 94.2% of HCWs believed that individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension were at higher risk of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. This finding was in agreement with previously conducted studies in Vietnam (79.2%). 40 Therefore, HCWs in different hospitals as well as healthcare system should be very conscious of patients with asthma, COPD, and other chronic diseases since those multi-morbidity patients are associated with highest hospital admission and case fatality rate with severe course of COVID-19. 42 Thus, we need to increase adequate understanding of participants from time to time about this pandemic. About 40.4% of the participants had poor prevention practice to tackle the pandemic in this study. As compared to the current study, a previous research article in Ethiopia showed a relatively lower level of knowledge (88.2%) with higher level of practice (63.5%) toward COVID-19. 34 Similarly, in Zambia about 84.1% and 75% of the study participants had good knowledge, and good practice toward COVID-19 respectively. 43 On the other hand, particularly for prevention practice, the current study is relatively higher than research done in NW Ethiopia, Gondar (38.73%). 44, 45 This difference may be due to the fact that this study was conducted in a single district primary hospital with limited number of study participants, whereas previously conducted research was in general hospital, teaching hospital, multicenter institution and large sample size. Moreover, due to the time gap, ie, participants' awareness about COVID-19 increasing from first day of confirmed case (March to May 2020) to October 2020. Regarding the DovePress main source of information of the participants to get information related to this novel virus, it was revealed that except for 6.7% of participants who never used social media, 93.3% of HCWs used social media either ""mostly"" or ""sometimes"" as primary source of information followed by their colleagues (90.4%). In fact, this finding is lower than that of a study conducted in Ethiopian 34 HCWs where social media was a major information source for COVID-19. In contrary, previous studies in Ethiopia 35 showed that News media (82.8%) and social media (64%); United Arab Emirates, 39 social media (61%), news media like TV (60%), and friends (31%) were the major sources of information related to COVID-19. The possible reason for the discrepancy of such result might be due to the fact that this study was only single institute based with limited sample size as well as limited facilities whereas the previous one was done in a multicenter hospital or more than three intuitions with large sample size. This should alert policy makers to the importance of social media in disseminating information to the public, especially in cases of pandemics. We also found that official sites such as the CDC, WHO website, newspaper and international journal like Dove medical press, BMC, or Nature which should reflect reliable sources of information, were less commonly used than social media (Facebook, Telegram, Twitter . . .) and news channels such as ETV, BBC, and CNN to obtain information. All the professionals on duty have to take protective measures in order not to infect themselves and their patients. Evidence shows that dentists, but also dental hygienists and dental assistants are potentially exposed to a high degree of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 virus during treatments that generate aerosols by using different devices, as airways-oral cavity, nostrils, and eye 11 The present study demonstrated that more than half of the respondent HCWs showed good prevention practice against COVID-19. Approximately59.6% of the HCWs protected themselves and others from being infected with COVID-19 through wearing masks, frequent hand washing, using hand sanitizer, restricting travel,avoiding 3C or ""zero C"", staying at home as much as possible and avoiding touching nose, eyes, and mouth, which was lower than studies reported from China (94%). 33 The current practices toward COVID-19 were again lower than the practice of other countries including China, USA. 33, 39 Even though the majority of study participants had good knowledge of COVID-19, only 59.6% of the participants had good prevention practice. Maintaining of social distancing, hand hygiene and mask-wearing, as practiced in many countries, has proven to be effective to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Parallel to a study in Nigeria, 27 social distancing (55.8%) and mask-wearing (44.2%) were not fully practicable. The possible reason for such poor practice was due to the type of HCWs or negligence of individual participants toward prevention practice, frequency of exposure, burden of the virus on that specific geographic area, frontline or non-frontline status of HCWs. Moreover, other factors such as availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) or PPE supply, water and soap supply to primary hospital were almost negligible. Apart from this, the existing ""pandemic"" scenario requires solid and reliable diagnostic tests in order to proceed with the required decision making and limiting the spread of this COVID-19 outbreak.The study design was institutional based cross-sectional, therefore causal modeling could not be attempted. Since the study took information at specified time-points, cause and effect association could not be studied. The other limitation was lack of sufficient similar study; which limits comparison with other studies. However, identifying knowledge gaps and practice can be used to develop effective and timely interventions. Moreover, the survey was conducted in only one district primary hospital in North West Gondar, Ethiopia so the results may not be generalizable to other hospital HCWs. Furthermore, the measurement of KP may be imprecise due to the limited number of study participants. Further study is needed with expanded sample size.The findings of the present study suggested that the majority of the study participants at DPH have good knowledge; nevertheless, they have poor practice toward COVID-19.Since preventive practice is a critical step and measurement of COVID-19 control, maximum attention should be given to improving preventive measure practice toward COVID-19 by the responsible body and hospital administration. Therefore, in order to bring their knowledge into practice, multidisciplinary training, frequent education intervention platform, and campaigns with special emphasis on COVID-19 preventive measures are needed for HCWs. The study was approved by Delghi Primary Hospital ethics committee and administrative office for this institutional based survey about current knowledge and prevention practice experience of HCWs from prior to data collection (Ref. No DPH/342/2020). Furthermore, the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Objective of the study was clearly explained to participants via email with the help of hospital administrative office before conducting the interview and verbal informed consent was obtained from each participant. All participants signed a written informed consent. Data were taken anonymously and kept confidential throughout the study period and kept locked in a cabinet.","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-02-02",2

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called coronavirus disease 2019 . This disease was later declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). This is the 3rd outbreak caused by the viruses from the Coronaviridae family. The previous two were the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, Guangdong Province of China; and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012. 1 The coronaviruses are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses infecting mammals and birds. These viruses can lead to severe lower respiratory tract infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome.The relationship between public health intervention strategies and livelihood in informal settlements during this pandemic has not been well integrated into the current studies and policy responses to curb the virus's spread. This question is particularly critical for cities with poor public health systems, undocumented migrants, and densely populated informal settlements because of social distancing difficulties. However, this socioeconomic emancipation is not a striking claim for spatial marginalization. The lack of an articulate policy question seems to be the missing link for researchers and decision-makers tasked with dealing with the pandemic. It would be difficult to find any article, even among the glossy magazines or propaganda relics we come across on library shelves, that articulates the question of policy mismatch vs. the informal settlement within the framework of pandemics. This is partly because COVID-19, a new strand of viral infection, seems to have a unique impact on different socioeconomic and health spheres. Thus, our opinion's distinctiveness rests in its contribution towards identifying and framing appropriate questions for future research and policy designs on this subject.There are over 100 urban informal settlements in Nairobi City (hereinafter referred to as ""Nairobi""), the capital of Kenya. This makes it relevant to examine the questions of pandemics and policy responses. The largest informal settlement in Africa (Kibera) is also located in the city, making it highly vulnerable to a disastrous outcome if wrong policies are adopted amid a pandemic. Informal settlements in Nairobi account for over 50% of the city's total population. However, this vast population is concentrated in approximately 5% of the city's residential area. There are still many unknown underpinning factors regarding the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, such crowded settlements deserve more in-depth analysis. This information is crucial for predicting the course of an epidemic. A significant number of transmissions, both in community settings and via respiratory droplets, occur through human-to-human contact. As of January 13, 2021, cumulative COVID-19 cases reached 98 555 ( Fig. 1 ) with cumulative 1 720 deaths (Fig. 2) in Kenya. Further, despite the curve appearing to flatten, a combination of a low number of tests and fluctuations in daily new cases (Fig. 3 ) could overshadow the thought that the disease is going away. The R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated to be 2.2-3.11, which is significantly higher than 1, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmissibility potential. If relevant measures are not put in place, it can dramatically spread infection. 3 As of December 5, 2020, there were 96 139 cumulative COVID-19 cases in Kenya with Nairobi far ahead than the rest of the cities/counties, as shown in Table 1 . Globally, policymakers and researchers have recommended suppression and mitigation as two primary interventions to be put in place to control the spread of COVID-19. In suppression, governments have implemented rigorous social distancing policies to reduce the reproduction rate of the virus. The measures include closing most public spaces, staying at home, reducing commercial activities, enforcing curfews, and banning nonessential travel. In mitigation, the virus is allowed to run its natural course in a controlled manner to enable communities to develop herd immunity. In Kenya's former strategy, the population carries the risk of a second wave of the disease outbreak. Significantly, most countries with informal settlements have yet to develop policies geared toward addressing the unique challenges faced by slum dwellers during the pandemic.Notably, previous pandemics have shown a negative and severe impact on people living in crowded settlements. The experiences in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leon during the spread of the Ebola pandemic and in Brazil, particularly the city of Rio de Janeiro (Favelas), during the Zika crisis, show that the housing characteristics in slum areas accelerated the spread of these diseases. 5 These findings are also echoed in a modeling study conducted during the influenza crisis in the slums of New Delhi, India. This showed that over 44% of slum dwellers were likely to be infected with the virus irrespective of whether they were vaccinated. 6 Kenya's strategy of containment and social distancing overlooked critical housing challenges in the slum areas of Nairobi. The majority of the houses in Nairobi slums are tiny, single-roomed units made from corrugated iron or mud often serve as the kitchen, bedroom, and sitting room for a multigenerational family. According to a survey by the African Population and Health Research Center, only 6% of the slum dwellers in Nairobi have access to clean water while 52% and 51% share toilets and sanitation facilities, respectively. 7 These houses make calls for social distancing challenging to implement as residents cannot enjoy the spatial distance. Inadequate access to water also affects the smooth implementation of policies calling for people to maintain hygiene. The tragedy for slum dwellers in Nairobi is that they are vulnerable to various forms of transmitted diseases given their houses' nature. Further, it is challenging for them to implement government policies, especially those that require adherence to spatial regulations.Like many other countries affected by COVID-19, the Kenyan government has put forward its health capacities and instituted public health strategies to prevent local transmission. Toward this end, on March 27, 2020, the government established a partial lockdown for three of the most affected counties (Mombasa, Nairobi, and Kilifi). It closed these counties' borders, suspending cultural and religious activities and shutting down schools. However, despite these policy control measures, the virus has spread rapidly, increasing infections and deaths. Researchers have recommended various predictive mathematical models to track and understand the virus's spread to formulate effective control strategies for COVID-19. Some of these models include: (1) Susceptible-Infection-Recovered (SIR) model, which describe individuals through three mutually exclusive stages of infection: susceptible, infected, and recovered; (2) Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, which considers the post-infection incubation period in which an exposed individual is not contagious; (3) A mass-action SIR model; and an Edge-based compartmental model. 8 Several intervention strategies, such as hand washing, social distancing, quarantine, isolation, wearing of masks, and contact tracing, have been promoted as critical approaches for controlling the spread of infectious diseases. A control-oriented SIR model that stresses the effects of delays and compares the outcomes of different containment measures has also been proposed. 9 These measures are supposed to slow the spread of the viruses, keep health services from being overwhelmed, and buy sufficient time to adequately respond to the virus with the overall benefit of reducing the loss of life.However, the existing global trends and the increasing COVID-19 cases in Kenya make one question the effectiveness of current strategies. The number of cases has quadrupled within a short period (from late June to early August of 2020) as the high transmission rate is experienced even after establishing the various plans to counter COVID-19. 10 In light of Fig. 3 , it seems the virus was not deterred by the partial lockdown, indicating the possibilities of ""other"" unknown intervening factors in its transmission. Again, this policy mismatch should remind policymakers and researchers that instituting massive policy without considering the contextual and behavioral factors could harm the residents more than do good. One possible factor in this pattern is the rapid urbanization of Nairobi. While the city continues to grow in population with the 2019 Census showing a growth rate of 3.88%, there is comparatively limited investment in redesigning the residential informal settlements. With this spatial condition, coupled with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, it becomes clear that the city could expect the sheer scale of infection, uncontrolled hospitalization, and casefatalities. This is because the lockdown strategy lacks diversity, promotes massification, and constraints access to already overburdened sanitary facilities and air conditioning. Although the WHO has applied social distancing as being scientifically robust with a significant reduction in transmission of COVID-19, the socioeconomic injustices perpetrated through this strategy might be overstraining to the vulnerable population. 11 The implementation of some COVID-19 countermeasures reveals the extent of socioeconomic and political inequalities within the country. For example, in Nairobi, the measures adopted have exposed the government's deficiencies in urban planning and failure to address informal settlement challenges. A significant portion of the city's population is finding itself contained in a small area. Further, they lack access to necessary sanitation facilities, have insufficient healthcare centres, and lack access to vital gear such as masks due to years of poor planning and neglect within this area. Moreover, with most slum dwellers depending on the informal sector, restrained movements and advice that they should work from home is a rude joke for them. This is because they rely on activities such as waste recycling, roadside vending, small-scale grocery shops, and selling second-hand clothes for their daily income.Social injustice has been manifested not only among adults living in slums but also in children. More specifically, school-going children living in Nairobi's slums have found themselves in uncharted territory as the Ministry of Education announced that students would be studying online for the remainder of the academic term. Previous studies 12 have revealed the level of inequality among schools in Kenya with unbalanced staff, facilities, and equipment, especially in public schools, to enable them to complete their curriculum on time. However, schools' closure has left many candidates sitting for their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) and Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations at a disadvantage, especially in schools that were lagging even on normal school days. However, these children are expected to sit for the same national exam. Back to the question of whether ""online"" classes can and would be effectively implemented in Kenya-the answer for slum dwellers would undoubtedly be ""no"". To successfully participate in online courses, one needs three critical assets: electricity, a computer or smartphone, and the Internet. These three facilities are difficult to come by in the slums. Still, even if one were to have access, most of the school-going children in the slums would find it difficult to get time for school work as they would be engaged in income-generating activities or other chores.The spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan City to the rest of the world has occurred in a short period. Therefore, the spread pattern could have allowed some countries-especially in Africa, which reported their initial cases a couple of months after the disease was detected in other parts of the world-to examine the condition and respond swiftly before arriving in their country. For starters, the most critical question is whether COVID-19, a public health crisis, would go down in history as a catastrophe. Historically, some of the worst disease outbreaks claimed the lives of nearly a third of the human population. Although the discovery of antibiotics and vaccines has reduced the risk of a global pandemic, not all infectious diseases have a vaccine or a cure. Therefore, this would mean that more proactive responses could have been enacted by examining the disease's speed and depth in other countries.The second question would be to assess whether COVID-19 showed similar or different signs and strengths than the previous SARS and MERS. While the two did not affect people in Kenya and Africa in general, the spread of COVID-19 to countries where SARS and MERS did not spread could be a wake-up call for preventive measures in Kenya. Similarly, the case-fatality ratio question has remained ambiguous as the mortality rate is not apparent. The government of Kenya and others worldwide have benefited from information on the mortality rate in Wuhan during the early stages of the pandemic and how the government was able to contain mass infections on the mainland.Another important question before the disease arrived in the country was whether the country's health system could shield citizens from the disease's negative impacts. Here, three essential sub-questions should be asked. First, does the government have the capacity to conduct contact tracing effectively? Once traced, are there sufficient quarantine facilities? Third, how and by whom will the cost of treatment covered? Notably, the spread of the disease in Kenya is partly due to the collapsed contact tracing strategy, which requires many resources and sophisticated technology.Furthermore, before adopting the lockdown and curfew policies, there was a need for advanced studies on the potential unintended consequences on people's lives. This specifically covers people living in informal settlements vulnerable to getting the disease due to the nature of their jobs and housing and who would pay a huge price from the economic lockdown given that they mostly survive on daily wages. The lack of such considerations has resulted in mounting pressure on the government to reopen the country as many lowincome earners face starvation. Conversely, cases of teenage pregnancies, police brutality, mental health problems, and domestic violence have increased tremendously. Perhaps given that the number of infections continued to rise despite the strict quarantine and lockdown measures, other less painful and effective policies would have been adopted.Nairobi's current infection trend shows that counties with dense populations have some of the highest COVID-19 transmission rates, but this might reflect a generalized epidemiological trend resulting in proneness to infection rather than a causal relationship. In this opinion, we aim to shed light on identifying the right question of the effect of a public health intervention on residents' behaviors and life dynamics. We observe that the low or high transmission rates are not necessarily a result of the intervention. However, it is ""other"" factors that should be known to future researchers and policymakers. In framing future research questions, we recognize the extent to which policy interventions spill over to jeopardize a vulnerable population. Thus, such a research agenda must prioritize designs that allow participation of the urban informal settlements population. Therefore, we propose three research questions for future analysis of this subject: (1) geospatial analysis; (2) informal formality; and (3) fit for purpose.First, while the lockdown significantly helped reduce international transmission of COVID-19 and hence minimized the death rate from the virus globally, the extent to which this strategy is an important preventive measure, especially in the Kenyan informal settlement, remains unknown. The extent to which social restriction matters to the transmission of pandemics in informal settlements remains largely unmeasured beyond socioeconomic implications. Geospatial analysis of geographical location time is crucial for advancing how geographical and behavioral factors can influence transmission. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide insight into the link between geography and the nature of intervention along several other dimensions: (1) the analysis would have to encompass the entire country;(2) the researchers would quantify the risks along with variables such as gender and age; (3) boundaries in space and time would have to be restricted concerning risk levels of the target population; and (4) the number of infections and death rates would be compared between residents in the informal settlement and those living in well-planned settlements and rural areas.The second question concerns the ""formality of informality"" in the context of a pandemic. COVID-19 has magnified the existing fault lines in the socioeconomic systems of the country. The policy mismatch phenomenon during the COVID-19 pandemic implies that the residents of informal settlements in Nairobi, mainly in Kibera, Mathare, Korokocho, Mukuru, Soweto, and Kawangware, continue to suffer poor planning, inadequate health facilities, lack of proper housing and sanitation, and insufficient water and electricity. The blanket policies characterized by curfews, partial lockdown, and ""social distancing"" that the government of Kenya has adopted appear to push residents further to the risks of contracting the disease. This social dimension of health presents an interesting conundrum and potential lacuna for policy research. Current research seems to evade concern on how informal activities and assets of informal settlements could be harnessed into meaningful strategies for effective public health intervention.Finally, to what extent are government policies suitable for purposes? In Nairobi, slum houses do not offer any comfort to their inhabitants, who are compelled by the partial lockdown to spend more time in crowded single-room, low-quality shanties. Several people are forced to share run-down residences even with overflowing toilets and bathrooms while children have to play in a polluted environment. As mentioned above, despite all the restrictive social measures imposed during COVID-19, the number of infected cases in the country steadily increased, begging the question as to whether these measures are effective. Crammed in the tiny homes are also multigenerational family members, which poses a serious threat to vulnerable populations: children, women, and older citizens. Policy mismatches are not limited to essential assets. Outdoor infrastructure can be instrumental in minimizing casualties in times of disaster. However, there is a lack of accurate data on the slum residents and unrestricted entry and exit in these areas. Surveillance, a centerpiece for countries such as China and Korea in flattening the COVID-19 curve through contact tracing, would be nearly impossible to attain in Nairobi slums should the disease break out. Vital concerns will have to be addressed in issues such as: (1) the vulnerability of casual laborers without health insurance coverage or pension; (2) the risks to the self-employed engaged in low-paying activities such as waste collection, recycling, and street vending; (3) the additional losses inflicted by the pandemic on their already meager incomes and their crowded neighborhoods that make them even more vulnerable to getting the disease; (4) the lack of the necessary social safety nets to access proper medication and the potential loss of life; and (5) ways of ensuring that the research design is responsive to the affected population.Beyond the above critical questions, other questions can be raised as the disease continues to spread. These include what options other countries have faced amid the pandemic and what the outcome was of adopting some of the policies. This will help countries that have not reached the peak of the disease in response to informed experiences. Specifically, it is worth reflecting on the uncertainties and apparent problems experienced by different countries in response to the virus. Second, given the disease's trend, is there room for optimism, and, if so, from where can such optimism be derived? Third, and most importantly, could this pandemic have been stopped by science? What about international organizations, such as WHO could have done it better? Has COVID-19 had any scientific surprises? How best can the government cushion the informal sector when reopening the country? How can we best respond to future pandemics? If addressed, these questions could contribute to more effective responses, especially by governments with weak public health systems and large informal settlements.Our thinking of future research and policy agendas on this subject was motivated by the limited attention that public health intervention's potential negative impacts have received in the current COVID-19 crises.Because of this inattention, very little data exist on policy analysis. As mentioned previously, this virus is first transmitted through human beings. Increased investment in researching pandemic-related policies, strategies, and interventions by governments and public health systems would help accumulate scientific evidence leading to the formulation of effective policies for handling future pandemics.

COVID-19 is currently triggering enormous global demands on health systems and presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment [1] . Coronaviruses have a genome made of RNA. Viruses with RNA genomes have an essential gene called the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is highly conserved, meaning that there are few changes in the gene from one RNA virus to another [2] . SARS-CoV2 binds principally to the cell-membrane angiotensen converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors through the viral structural spike (S) protein [3] . At the intracellular level, the virus activates cellular processes to produce viral proteins that replicate the virus's genetic material, providing potential targets for drug therapy [4] .In an urgent attempt to mitigate devastating catastrophe of SARS-CoV2, many drugs without established efficacy have been used in patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial [5] [6] [7] [8] . A combination of antivirals with different mechanisms of action may be more effective but at the same time, their adverse effects should not be underestimated [9, 10] . Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19 [11] . Drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost to treat COVID-19 [12] [13] [14] ; however, limitations such as low success rate and the possibility of adverse side effects, can not be overlooked [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . There is limited data on the human genome interactions with many of these agents and this may constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy. Knowing the major human genetic variants association with the clinical therapeutic outcome has the potential not only to expedite emergency use authorization and approvals but also to afford an additional level of safety and efficacy to patients. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to look at some drugs commonly used in regimens for COVID-19 and provides specific examples of how genetics may affect drug efficacy and toxicity. It adds to the efforts of recently published relevant articles [18] [19] [20] and does not serve as an exhaustive review of all relationships between host genetics and these drugs.Genetic polymorphisms are a type of genetic diversity within a population's gene pool. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are the most common type of genetic variation among people. Various polymorphisms exist in genes encoding phase 1 cytochrome P450 (CYP) or phase 2 drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, drug targets, or human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and predict drug efficacy or toxicity [21, 22] . Genetic variations of CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 were associated with therapeutic effects of phenytoin [23] , tamoxifen [24] , clopidogrel [25] , and tacrolimus [26] , respectively. The dose regimens of mercaptopurines and irinotecan should be adjusted according to the polymorphism of thiopurine methytransferase (TPMT) [27] and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) [28] , respectively. A variant allele in the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene has been associated with statin-induced myalgia [29] . A common variant in the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1(VKORC1) gene, has also been strongly associated with inter-individual warfarin dosing variability [29] .The genetic polymorphisms constitute the basis of pharmacogenetics which means the monogenic variants which alter the drug response [30] . The term pharmacogenetics was coined in 1957 [31] . On the other hand, PGx is the genome-wide analysis of genetic determinants of drug metabolizing enzymes, receptors, transporters, and targets that influence therapeutic efficacy and safety [32] . The realization that most variable drug responses appear to be multifactorial led to the rise of interest in PGx, a rise paralleled by the expansion of genetics into genomics.The rapid innovation in sequencing technology and genome-wide association studies has led to the development of numerous data resources and dramatically changed the landscape of PGx research. Resources provided by organizations such as The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) [27] and The PGx Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) [33] , that use standardized approaches to evaluate the literature and provide clinical guidance, are essential for the implementation of pharmacogenetics into routine clinical practice. Important online resources such as PharmGKB.org and cpicpgx.org provide the clinician with summarized PGx associations and clinical guidelines. Other resources include SCAN and PACdb PGx databases developed and published by the PGx of Anticancer Agents Research Group. SCAN is designed to collect, annotate, and present the relationship between genotype and gene expression. It is a large-scale genetic and genomic database containing SNP and copy number variation annotations along with a web interface, a set of methods and algorithms, and some data mining tools [34] . PACdb is a pharmacogenetics-cell line database collecting pharmacology-related information including genotypes, gene expression, and pharmacological data gathered via lymphoblastoid cell lines [35] .In recent years, clinical evidence has strengthened, guidelines have emerged, and genomic medicine is becoming integrated into routine care for certain disease states, such as some cancers. Recently, the FDA approved direct-toconsumer tests for PGx, breast cancer risk, and propensity to develop certain conditions (e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases) [36] . A notable example is that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes predict different sensitivity and resistance frequencies in the Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish populations necessitating warfarin dose adjustment [37] . Many major medical institutions have started implementing genotyping protocols for preemptive pharmacogenetic testing [38] . A good example of a pharmacogenetic test is the association between a particular HLA allele (HLA-B*5701) and hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir [39] .Moreover, HLA-B*1502 screening is successful in patients who are prescribed carbamazepine, particularly in Asians. The HLAB*1502 allele is associated with carbamazepineinduced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [27] .Chloroquine (CQ)and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) CQ and HCQ have been used to treat malaria for over 50 years. They were the first antiviral drugs officially indicated for COVID-19 in the U.S. as an FDA Emergency Use Authorization issued on March 28, 2020. This was later revoked on June 15, 2020 based on new data suggesting that the drug's potential benefits may not outweigh its known and potential risks [40] . However, a number of ongoing studies for both treatment and prevention of COVID-19 are still underway. HCQ and CQ inhibit major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II expression; production of IL-1, IFNα and TNF and interfere with cyclic GMP-AMP synthase activity partly by accumulating in lysosomes and autophagosomes of phagocytic cells and changing local pH concentrations [41] . CQ and HCQ were reported to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 2.71 µM and 4.51 µM in Vero E6 cells, respectively [42] .SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors expressed on host epithelial cells along with cofactor transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to enter the cell. HCQ and CQ inhibit virus entry by targeting the endosomal pathway. They increase the pH of endosomes and inhibit membrane fusion [43] . In addition, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 could be partly due to differential glycosylation of both ACE2 and the spike protein [44] . Several variants in ACE2 including p.Met383Thr, p.Pro389His, and p.Asp427Tyr were identified in the African American and Latino American populations. These pathogenic variants in ACE2 may inhibit interaction with the S protein and could influence the clinical efficacy of HCQ or CQ [45] . The ACE2 receptor N720D variant may enhance TMPRSS2 activation and subsequent viral entry [46] . HCQ and CQ may only work for TMPRSS2-absence patients who are infected by SARSCoV-2, and may have less effect or no effect for the patients with wild-type TMPRSS2 [47] .In patients with COVID-19, CQ has been administered orally at a dose of 300 mg for adults, twice daily (bid) for a maximal duration of 10 days. HCQ therapy is started at a loading dose of 400 mg bid. on day 1 and then lowered to 200 mg bid (10 days average). A recent study showed that both drugs have favorable and unfavorable characteristics, but none showed clear evidence of benefit for early outpatient disease or prophylaxis [48] .The most severe complications from use of HCQ and CQ include QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias [49] , which may pose a particular risk to critically ill patients. HCQ and CQ undergo N-dealkylation via CYP isozymes [50] . A few reports have described significance of gene polymorphisms in affecting HCQ or CQ treatment outcome. In African children with acute falciparum malaria, peak plasma CQ and DCQ concentrations were highly variable [51] . In malaria patients from Tanzania [52] , India [53] and Sudan [54] , the mean plasma CQ concentrations were higher in sensitive patients than in resistant patients. The carriers of CYP2C8-reduced activity alleles showed lower efficacy as compared with homozygous wild-type allele *1 A [55] . CYP2C8*4 is a missense mutation, which promotes a lower enzyme activity in vitro than the wild-type allele *1 A, and similarly CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3 also present a markedly decreased activity in vitro [56] . Both CQ and HCQ are metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, the expression of which varies among individuals as the result of genetic polymorphisms. High HCQ concentrations have been observed in individuals who are poor or intermediate CYP2D6 metabolizers (CYP2D6*4; CYP2D6*10) [57] . Both CQ and HCQ were reported to inhibit CYP2D6 activity [58] . They may potentiate other CYP2D6 substrates such as labetalol and carvedilol [59] and decrease the effectiveness of prodrugs reliant on CYP2D6 for activation such as codeine and tramadol [60] . There is no established clinical guidance related to CYP2D6 gene variants in CQ or HCQ use. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is most common in the Mediterranean area, in Europe, in Middle East, Asia and parts of Africa. Genetic variants affecting G6PD activity show remarkably individual and ethnical differences [61] . More than 160 G6PD genetic variants have been identified including G6PD B (wild type), G6PD A (non-deficient type) and G6PD A − (African deficient type). G6PD 376 G/202 A haplotype is the most common G6PD variants in sub-Saharan Africa [62] . CQ and HCQ use in individuals having genetic mutations in the G6PD may induce hemolysis and hemolytic anemia.The blood group ABO gene encodes glycosyltransferases which determine addition of N-acetylgalactosamine or galactose to H antigen and subsequently determines A and B antigens. Vasku et al. [63] identified an association of blood pressure with ACE I/D polymorphism and ABO blood group. Genetic variation within Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) has been studied extensively in the context of human exposure. Homozygotes for the nonsense mutation (rs601338 G > A) that inactivates the FUT2 enzyme are unable to secrete ABO(H) histo-blood group antigens or express them on mucosal surfaces [64] . An association between the A allele and COVID-19 prevalence/mortality was recently confirmed [65] . ABO blood group, Hb genotype and G6PD status showed no significant influence on CQ treatment outcome in Nigerian children with uncomplicated malarial infection, but there was greater risk of developing resistance to CQ in HbAA than HbAS individuals [66] . Another well-recognized adverse effect of HCQ and CQ is retinopathy, which occurs more frequently with long term use and higher doses. Retinopathy occurred less frequently in those with the minor allele of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA4 c.5814 A > G [67] . CQ and HCQ should be used with caution especially in combination with other drugs or at high doses potentially with monitoring of RBC or hemoglobin levels and genetic testing should be recommended.This macrolide antibiotic is used extensively in patients with viral infections to prevent severe respiratory tract infections Azithromycin-HCQ combination shows a synergistic effect on Covid-19 disease [68] . The pharmacokinetics (PKs) of azithromycin are influenced by the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter encoded by ABCB1. Genetic variation in ABCB1 showed up to a twofold lower peak azithromycin concentrations in 20 healthy volunteers after a single dose [69] . Higher systemic exposure to azithromycin is of particular concern when it is combined with HCQ or CQ because of their additive effects on QTc prolongation.Lopinavir (LPV)/Ritonavir (RTV), LPV/r LPV blocks a postentry step in the MERS-CoV replication cycle, conferring this drug a promising potential agent for COVID-19 [70] . RTV blocks CYP3A-mediated metabolism of LPV thereby prolonging its exposure. LPV is metabolized primarily through CYP3A and transported by ABCB1 and ABCB2. RTV is metabolized by CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP2D6. RTV inhibits CYP3A and organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), and may also induce other CYP isoforms [71] . RTV is enhancing the effect and concentrations of the medicines usually metabolized by CYP3A4, including LPV. RTV also increases the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by glucuronidation catalyzed by UGT. The clinical relevance of these effects needs to be investigated. LPV/r was used in a regimen of 400 mg/100 mg bid for adults for 10-21 days [72] . There is also an initiative to reformulate LPV/r in a new extracellular vesicles delivery system [73] .Genetic screening of Apo lipoprotein E (APOE) and APOC3 can reduce the risk of hypertriglyceridemia and lipodystrophy associated with RTV [74] . Interindividual variations of LPV concentration were associated with SLCO1B1. A pharmacogenomic analysis of LPV/RTV, including 1380 variants in 638 HIV-infected Caucasians, identified four significant variants. Clearance of LPV was higher in individuals with SLCO1B1*4/*4 and lower in individuals with two or more variant alleles of SLCO1B1*5, ABCC2 or a CYP3A [75] . The CYP3A4 polymorphism L292P (rs28371759, CYP*18B) is linked with increased CYP3A4 activity, thus facilitating the metabolism of drugs like LPV. L292P was reported to occur more in East Asians, indicating that East Asians may metabolize LPV and RTV more rapidly. There are about 66 coding SNPs in ABCB1 gene [76] . The 3435 C > T is present in exon 26 of the ABCB1 gene, involving a C-to-T transformation, and does not alter the amino acid isoleucine. The variant allele frequency of 3435 C > T in the Asian population differs significantly from the African and Caucasian population [77] . There are many non-synonymous polymorphisms in ABCB1 [78] . Among them, S893T, S893A (rs2032582), N21D (rs9282564) and S400N (rs2229109) can increase the drug concentration through decreasing the efflux of ABCB1. S893A carriers are found in all populations with high frequency, which is up to 90% in Africans. S893T carriers are almost East Asians, while N21D carriers are Europeans. These patients may have more response to the drugs transported by ABCB1.ATV exhibits potent anti-HIV activity and good oral bioavailability. ATV inhibits SARS-CoV2 replication in both Vero cells and human epithelial pulmonary cells (A549). ATV is metabolized by CYP3A and is an inhibitor of CYP3A and UGT1A. The CPIC guideline for ATV considers several polymorphisms in UGT1A1, including a variable dinucleotide (TA) repeat within the gene promoter region (rs8175347, alleles UGT1A1*28, *36 and *37), and the SNPs rs4148323 (UGT1A1*6) and rs887829 (UGT1A1*80) [79] . The UGT1A1*28 allele predisposes to severe hyperbilirubinemia in individuals exposed to ATV [80] . UGT1A1*28 homozygotes have the highest risk and UGT1A1*28 heterozygotes have an intermediate risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia [81] . The CPIC guidelines for pharmacogenomic prescribing of ATV recommend counseling on the likelihood of developing hyperbilirubinemia in UGT1A1*28/*28,*28/*37, *37/*37, and −364 TT genotype carriers before initiating therapy [79] . ATV metabolism is partially due to the P-gp efflux pump encoded by the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene, which seems to increase plasma concentrations of ATV in the presence of 3435 variable genetic homozygosis C/C, exposing the patient to a risk of hyperbilirubinemia and severe jaundice. Polymorphism 238 G > A appears to be related to an early onset of lipodystrophy [82] . Several studies demonstrated that APOA5 gene polymorphisms (1131 T > C and 64 G > C), APOC3 (482 C > T, 455 C > T, 3238 C > G), and ABCA1 (2962 A > G) and APOE (ε2 and ε3 haplotypes) are associated with a high risk of dyslipidemia [83] .FVP is a purine nucleic acid analog and potent RdRp) inhibitor. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of influenza and Ebola virus disease [84] . FAV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells [85] . FVP undergoes metabolism in the liver mainly by aldehyde oxidase and partially by xanthine oxidase. The efficacy of substrates of aldehyde oxidase such as azathioprine or allopurinol are associated with variants of aldehyde oxidase [86] .NVP is a NNRTI widely prescribed for HIV treatment. It is generally effective with some reported cases of hepatotoxicity and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. The HLA-DRB1*01, HLA-B*3505 and CYP2B6 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the onset of rash from NVP [87] . The CYP2B6 983 C allele was reported to confer a higher risk of SJS and TEN in a population of Mozambique treated with NVP. Polymorphism C > T position 3435 of MDR1 was associated with reduced risk of hepatotoxicity [88] . Also, the ABCC10 (MDR7) polymorphism rs2125739 has been associated with plasma concentrations of NVP.EFV is predominantly inactivated by CYP2B6, and patients with certain CYP2B6 genetic variants may be at increased risk for adverse effects [89] . In a genome-wide association study, CYP2B6 rs4803419 (g.15582 C > T) was independently associated with increased plasma EFV exposure [90] . Patients who were homozygous for the minor allele (g.15582 T/T) had plasma EFV concentrations comparable to CYP2B6 intermediate metabolizers (based on CYP2B6 c.516 G > T and c.983 T > C status). CYP2B6 genotyping can possibly afford minimization of adverse effects with EFV, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, by tailoring the drug dose to the genotype of patients [91] .Oseltamivir targets the neuraminidase distributed on the surface of the influenza virus [92] . Several clinical trials are still evaluating the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection [93] . Oseltamivir needs to be activated by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) into its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate [94] . G143E variants were reported to be 3.7%, 4.3%, 2.0% and 0% in White, Black, Hispanic and Asian populations, respectively [95] .A clinical study showed that G143E heterozygotes exhibited 18% greater AUC of oseltamivir and 23% smaller AUC ratios of oseltamivir carboxylate to oseltamivir compared to individuals with the 143GG genotype [96] . Significant inter-individual variability in oseltamivir PK and in antiviral effects have been consistently reported in clinical studies [97] . CES1 and ABCB1 genetic variants have the potential to serve as valid biomarkers for the prediction of oseltamivir activation and the optimization of oseltamivir pharmacotherapy [98] .Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated remdesivir effectiveness for the treatment of COVID-19 [70] . Remdesivir is primarily metabolized by hydrolase in vivo [99] . It has a generally low risk of significant genetic PKs interactions. In vitro studies suggest that it is a substrate for drug metabolizing enzymes CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, as well as a substrate for OATP1B1 and P-gp transporters [100] . Thus, known variants of these genes could theoretically affect the PKs of remdesivir. According to current knowledge, no guideline recommends pharmacogenetic testing before remdesivir administration.Anakinra Anakinra is a biologic medicine used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with methotrexate. Anakinra inhibits the IL-1α and IL-1β and has been used with some success in several small studies in patients with COVID-19 [101] . A relationship between the infrequent IL-1a + 4845 G/T polymorphism and a significant better response to anakinra treatment was reported [102] .Treatment with TCZ may reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [103] . In vitro studies in hepatocytes have shown that TCZ blocks the downregulation of CYP450 (mainly CYP3A4) that is caused by IL6 [104] . Several genetic biomarkers have been associated with the efficacy of TCZ in RA, including FCGR3A, IL6R, CD69, and GALNT18 [105] . The only genetic variants potentially involving TCZ's PKs are in the FCGR3A gene. In 87 patients with RA treated with TCZ, FCGR3A rs396991TT genotype showed higher response at 12 months. Polymorphisms of IL6R are considered to affect the intracellular signaling pathway of IL-6 receptor bound to TCZ [106] . In contrast, variants in CD69 and GALNT18 are thought to have limited direct effects on TCZ. Genetic variation in IL6R may aid in predicting TCZ therapy outcome in COVID-19 patients. To date, no pharmacogenetic testing is recommended for TCZ.Multiple therapeutic agents targeting complement activation are currently being studied for COVID-19 [107] Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. AMY-101, a C3 inhibitor, is currently being tested in patients with COVID-19 [108] . The combination of clinical indicators of lung injury progression with known biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, plasma IL-6 levels and ferritin) would allow identification of patients that could benefit from complement inhibition [109] .Human HO protein has an important anti-inflammatory role in attenuating serious conditions like thrombosis, sepsis, tissue damage and fibrinogenesis, all of which are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections [110] . The inducibility of HO-1 is regulated by the promoter region guanosine thymidine dinucleotide (GT)n repeats mutation [111] . Patients with COVID-19 complications have longer GT sequences [112] . Inducing HO-1 expression may prevent SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary complications [113] .Hemin, a substrate for HO-1 obtained from the breakdown of RBCs, is FDA approved for treatment of porphyria and is effective in blocking Zika viral replication [114] . The hemin-induced HO-1 cytoprotective pathway appears as a consistent target to control COVID-19. Heme arginate increases HO-1 levels by inhibiting delta-aminolevulinate synthase and so it can improve inflammation and viral infections [115] . Heme arginate is able to induce CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [116] . CQ, HCQ, azithromycin, and remdesivir decrease heme production, in part, by inhibiting CYP induction, thus decreasing the demand for heme. These drugs also display interactions with the CYP system, which make maintaining safe effective therapeutic drug levels a challenge. Up-regulation of HO-1 is especially important in COVID-19 patients with the longer GT allele HO-1 polymorphism, and those with CYP2D6 polymorphisms that lead to supra-or sub-therapeutic drug levels. A synergistic anti-inflammatory effect may be obtained by the combination of heme arginate with repurposed anti-COVID-19 drugs that are not metabolized by CYP2D6/3A4. Recently, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone was found to save many severely ill COVID-19 patients [117] . Dexamethasone reduces hemolysis and induces HO-1 in macrophages [118] , leading to attenuation of the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients. There are a number of naturally occurring substances that are capable of upregulating HO-1 [119] such as thymoquinone, neem leaf extract, resveratrol and curcumin.There are some pharmacogenetic predictors of disposition and response of RAAS inhibitors [120] . Losartan, an ACE receptor blocker and is metabolized by CYP2C9 [121] . Genotyping some of Cyp 2C9 polymorphisms may affect losartan clinical benefits. The most common reduced-function variants are CYP2C9*2 (Arg144Cys), and CYP2C9*3 (Ile359Leu). CYP2C9 genotyping could be beneficial for dose adjustment. Other pharmacogenetic biomarkers, namely ABCB1 gene variants, could be useful predictors of losartan response [122] . The most relevant polymorphisms in ABCB1 are C3435T (rs1045642), G2677T/A (rs2032582) and C1236T (rs1128503) [123] . Regarding ACE inhibitors, ACE rs1799752 was related to variability in ACE inhibitors [124, 125] . This polymorphism consists of a 50-nucleotide deletion (del). Patients with the del/del diplotype correlated with a worse clinical outcome. The best pharmacogenetic predictor for spironolactone effectiveness is rs4961, located in the alpha-adducin gene, which predicts drug response in combination with furosemide [126] . Carriers of the G allele exhibited a better response to therapy compared with T allele carriers.Ivermectin has the potential to prevent viral replication of a broad spectrum of viruses. It has shown inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro through inhibition of Importin α/β1 (IMPα/β1)-mediated nuclear import of viral proteins [127] . Ivermectin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Ivermectin is both a substrate and a potent inducer of the P-gp. P-gp inhibitors can increase ivermectin plasma levels [128] .Nitazoxanide and its active metabolite, tizoxanide have demonstrated potent activity against SARS CoV-2 and MERS CoV in Vero E6 cells. Nitazoxanide upregulates the innate antiviral mechanisms by broadly amplifying cytoplasmic RNA sensing and type I IFN pathways [85] . Metabolism of nitazoxanide occurs via hydrolysis and then conjugation via glucuronidation. Nitazoxanide has a very favorable drug interaction profile with no known clinically significant drug interaction concerns. So far, no pharmacogenetic studies regarding efficacy or toxicity of nitazoxanide were rported.Currently, no direct evidence of PGx data in patients with COVID-19 is available. There are clear mechanisms by which genetic determinants may alter the therapeutic outcome of the current repurposed drugs for COVID-19. There is a need to do more PGx studies for COVID-19 repurposed therapies to establish evidence-based guidelines for genetic testing. The article identifies some potential associations between genetic variants and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 therapy. Incorporating the knowledge of PGx in the prospective clinical investigations of repurposed drugs during COVID-19 therapy is necessary to achieve safe and effective dosing and to reduce severity of adverse effects.Conflict of interest The author declares that he has no conflict of interest.Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.","Egypt","first author","2021-02-04",2

The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, as cases have been detected in most countries worldwide. 1 As of October 30, 2020, there have been 45,608,024 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases, including 1,189,139 deaths worldwide according to Johns Hopkins University. The pandemic has interrupted the learning of more than one billion students in 129 countries around the world according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 2 The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Ethiopia on 13 March 2020 which was the first one to be reported since the beginning of the outbreak in China in December 2019. 3 On 8 April 2020, the Council of Ministers declared a five-month-long state of emergency in response to the growing number of coronavirus cases, and schools, sporting events, and public gatherings were closed. 4 According to the ministry of health, Ethiopia there were 95,789 COVID-19 reported cases and 1464 (1.53%) deaths in Ethiopia until October 30, 2020.The COVID-19 pandemic affects mental health and well-being in addition to physical health. 5, 6 University graduating class students are more affected psychologically by the pandemic due to cancellation and postponing of anticipated events such as exchange studies and graduation ceremonies. 7 A poorly known contagious disease outbreak, like COVID-19, leads to unavoidable stress, fear, and anxiety. 8 The mental well-being of university students can be negatively affected by shifting face-to-face classes to online, suspension of the semester-end final examinations, and unavailability of books, computers, and highspeed internet connection at home. 9 During the pandemic, University students are at significant risk of adverse mental health outcomes resulted from the continuous spread of the disease, conspiracy theories, myths, and blame games, sensational media reporting of COVID-19, frustration and boredom, implementation of social lockdown with classmates, friends, and teachers, lack of personal space at home, and family financial loss due to lockdown. 10 The careers of this years' university graduates may be seriously impacted due to the pandemic since they experience major interruptions in teaching and assessment in the final part of their studies, and late graduation. 9 The pandemic has potentially affected students physically, academically, financially, and psychologically. In a short period, students' lives have dramatically changed as they have been asked to leave campus, adjust to new living circumstances, and adapt to online learning platforms. 11 Different studies showed that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was high among university students. From studies conducted in Pakistan and Bangladesh, the prevalence was 34% and 82.4% for depression and 45% and 87.7% for anxiety respectively. 10, 12 One study in Nigeria indicated that the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 31.9% and 41.4% respectively. 13 In Ethiopia, two studies reported that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 21.2% and 77.2%, 27.7% and 71.8%, and 32.5% and 48.5% respectively. 14, 15 Kinds of literature also indicated that age, sex, history of medical illness, living in a State/ Region with a high incidence of COVID-19, family income, having family members infected with the disease, the practice of preventive measures, and residence were determinants of depression, anxiety, and stress. 10, 12, 14, 15 The ongoing spread of COVID-19, strict isolation measures, delays in starting school, and postponing graduation across the country influences the mental health of graduating class university students. As a result, estimating the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on graduating class students is important for health authorities to develop preventive strategies and effective treatment modalities to alleviate its negative outcome. Therefore, this study is intended to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among graduating class students at the University of Gondar, northwest Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 10 to 30, 2020. Education). According to the information from the president's office, currently, there are 2546 Academic staff, 5473 Administrative staff, 41,730 undergraduate students, and 5497 postgraduate students at the University of Gondar. There are a total of 5396 graduating class students on the five campuses (source: University of Gondar Main Registrar Office).Graduating class students at the University of Gondar and available during the data collection period were included in the study. Those graduating class students who were absent from the class during the data collection period were excluded from the study.The sample size was calculated using the single population proportion formula by taking the estimated proportion of depression, anxiety, and stress among graduating class students: 21.2%, 27.7%, and 32.5%, respectively from a study conducted in southwest Ethiopia, 14 95% confidence interval, and a 5% margin of error and the largest number was taken. The final sample size was 350 after using the correction formula and adding a 10% non-response rate. To select study participants from the five campuses, all campuses were listed down with their total number of graduating students. The proportional allocation formula was used to allocate the number of students to the five campuses. Then the sampling frame was prepared for each campus by having lists of students from the main registrar's office. Finally, the study subjects of each campus were selected using a simple random sampling technique.Participants who score below 8 on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21) were considered as having no anxiety and those who score 8 and above were considered as having anxiety. 26 Participants who score below 10 on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21) were considered as having no depression and those who score 10 and above were considered as having depression. 26 Participants who score below 15 on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21) were considered as having no stress and those who score 15 and above were considered as having stress. 26 Use of chat, alcohol, cigarette smoking, or others at least once in the last three months.Exercising or doing any kind of sports activity including walking at least 20 min/day. 25 Data were collected using a structured pre-tested selfadministered questionnaire. The questionnaire contained 38 questions arranged into five sections; the first section contains six questions regarding the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, the second section contains three questions regarding clinical related conditions of graduating students, the third section contains two behavioral related questions, the fourth section contains six personal related questions, and the fifth section contains 21 questions regarding the depression, anxiety, and stress status of graduating students. Depression, anxiety, and stress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21). The DASS-21 comprises 3 components: stress, anxiety, and depression. Each has 7 scales, and the final score of each part will be obtained by summing the scores of the related questions. Each item scores from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much). 26 The reliability and validity of this questionnaire have been investigated. Its test-retest reliabilities for depression, anxiety, and stress were reported as 0.80, 0.76, and 0.77, respectively. For examining the validity of this scale, the confirmatory factor analysis method and the main component technique were implemented. 27 In the present study, the scale's face validity will be examined by the psychology and research methods expert. Data were collected with the help of five trained BSc nurse data collectors and three MSc nurse supervisors. A written guideline was given to the administrator of the questionnaire to assure that every graduating student received the same directions and information. During data collection data collectors and supervisors follow the recommended precautions to prevent COVID-19.Data clean-up and cross-checking was done before analysis. Checked, cleaned, and coded data were entered into EPI DATA version 3 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Descriptive statistics like frequencies, percentages, mean and standard deviation, tables, and figures were used to present data. To assess the association between the different independent variables with the dependent variable, first, bivariable relationships between each independent variable and outcome variable was investigated using a binary logistic regression model. Those independent variables with a p-value < 0.2 at the bivariable level were included in multivariable analysis to control potential confounding factors. After adjusting their effect on the outcome variable, those variables with a p-value < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval were regarded as factors significantly associated.The tool was pretested before the actual data collection time at Debre Tabor University which was not included in the study using 5% of the total sample size. Amendments on the instrument, such as unclear questions and ambiguous words made accordingly. The pretest was also be used to estimate how much time it takes to administer the entire questionnaire. The tool was first developed in the English language and translated to the Amharic language with back translation to English for consistency. The one-day training was given to data collectors and supervisors on the objective of the study, instrument, and data collection procedures by the principal investigators. Supervision was conducted by the principal investigators and supervisors. To ensure data quality, each data collector checked the questionnaire from each study participant for completeness daily. The supervisors and principal investigators review each questionnaire daily and checked for completeness.A total of 338 graduate class students participated in this study, with a 96.6% response rate. More than half (56.2%) of the respondents were male. The mean age of the respondents was 24.70± 2.78 SD years and more than half (58.6%) of them fall in the age range of 20-24 years. Concerning their residence more than half (57.7%) of the respondents live in an urban area. More than three fourth (77.5%) of the respondents were orthodox. Regarding their field of study majority (81.1%) of them was other than the health field of studies (Table 1) .The majority (88.5%) and (89.9%) of the participants were not diagnosed with any chronic disease and had no family members/relatives confirmed or suspected for COVID-19 respectively. Three hundred eleven (92.0%) of the participants had no history of mental disorders. More than threefourths (81.1%) of the participants did not use a substance like chat, cigarette, and alcohol at least once in the last three months. More than two-thirds (68.0%) of the respondents perform any kind of sports activity including walking for at least 20 min per day ( Table 2 ).Among the total 338 participants in the study, about 94.7% of the students had good knowledge about preventive measures of COVID-19. The majority of the participants (88.8%) in the study have a positive attitude towards the importance of the preventive measures of COVID-19. More than half (53.0%) of the participants in the study have practiced COVID-19 preventive measures. More than Table 3) .The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression among graduate class students of the University of Gondar was 22.2% with a 95% CI (17.8%, 26.6%), 39.6% with a 95% CI (34.3%, 45.6%), and 40.2% with a 95% CI (34.8%, 46.0%) respectively ( Figure 1 ). Fifty-five (16.3%), 32.2%, and 34.9% of the respondents faced difficulty relaxing to some degree, a considerable degree, and very much respectively. Nervous arousal was experienced by 28.1%, 39.1%, and 12.1% of them to some degree, a considerable degree, and very much respectively. Nearly three fourth (74.6%), 72.5%, 82.8%, 65.7%, and 50.6% of the study participants reported that they were easily upset, agitated, irritable, over-reactive, and impatient (Table 4 ). Two hundred eight (61.6%), 62.1%, 40.5%, and 34.6% of the respondents did not develop autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect respectively (Table 5 ). Nearly two thirds (64.2%), 72.2%, 68%, 65.5%, 55%, 57.4%, and 57.7% of the respondents develop dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia, and inertia respectively ( Table 6 ).Variables like sex, residence, living with a family, the field of study, diagnosed with chronic disease, confirmed/suspected cases in the family, history of mental disorders, perform physical activity, attitude towards COVID-19 preventive measures, practicing COVID-19 preventive measures, fear of infecting family members, contact history with suspected or confirmed cases, and living with a person aged >60 years were found to be significantly associated with stress using bivariable logistic regression analysis. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors like residence, living with a family, perform physical exercise, practicing COVID-19 preventive measures, and contact history with suspected or confirmed cases were significantly associated with stress. (Table 7) .Bivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out and the variables significantly associated with anxiety were; place of residence, the field of study, having a chronic disease, having a history of mental disorders, substance use, physical exercise, fear of infecting family members, confirmed/suspected cases in the family. Finally, multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify factors significantly associated with anxiety. The factors were the place of residence, substance use, physical exercise, and fear of infecting the family members. The odds of anxiety were 64% times less likely to occur among students who live in a rural area than in an urban area [AOR: 0.36; 95% CI (0.22, 0.61)]. Those students who did not use a substance like a cigarette, chat or alcohol were 73% times less likely to develop anxiety as compared to students who use substances in the last three months [AOR: 0.27; 95% CI (0.14-0.54)]. Those students who did not perform physical exercise were two times more likely to develop anxiety as compared to their counterparts [AOR: 2.12; 95% CI (1.24-3.62)]. Students who did not Figure 1 The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression among graduating class students at the University of Gondar, northwest Ethiopia, 2020 (n= 338). In bivariable logistic regression analysis, the following variables were found to be significantly associated with depression. (Table 9 ).After the first onset of the COVID-19 in china Wuhan city, it has had various effects on the Globe. The closure of universities due to the virus caused students to drop out of school. Especially it has a huge psychological impact on graduate class students. The current study revealed that 22.2%, 39.6%, and 40.2% of the respondents experienced stress, anxiety, pandemic. This result suggests that the coronavirus has a significant psychological impact on graduate class students who need mental health intervention. The prevalence of stress among graduating class university students in the current study was 22.2%. This finding was lower than studies conducted in Bench-Sheko Zone, South-west Ethiopia (32.5%), Dessie town, Ethiopia (48.5%), United States (71%), China (67.1%), Spain (28.1%), Canada (30%), and Malaysia (28.9%). 14, 15, 18, [21] [22] [23] 25 The possible justification for the lower prevalence of stress in this study might be due to the difference in time of the study.Currently, students can get a variety of information regarding the virus than the information they obtained at the beginning of the pandemic. Returning of the students to the university and start learning, the approval and administration of vaccines for COVID-19, and the increased number of patients who recovered from the disease than individuals who newly diagnosed and died might also contribute to the decrement of stress among students in the current study compared with the previous studies. The previous studies were conducted when students were at home and at the beginning of the pandemic which may result in a high prevalence of stress among students. The prevalence of anxiety in this study was 39.6%. This finding was higher than studies conducted in Bench-Sheko Zone, southwest Ethiopia; 27.7%, 14 China 24.9%, 16 Chinese university students; 15.43%, 19 another study in China; 7.7%, 20 and Spain; 21.34%. 22 This discrepancy might be due to poor socioeconomic status in Ethiopia which determines the body defense mechanism of preventing coronavirus infection, in developing countries as compared to a developed country like China. Studies provide strong evidence that socioeconomic status impacts the development of mental illness directly, as well as indirectly through its association with adverse economic stressful conditions among lower-income groups. 30 This might be also in China the health care system is well developed and advanced than Ethiopia so that anxiety due to fear of infection was higher in Ethiopia than in China. The prevalence of anxiety in this study was comparable with a study conducted in Italy; 34.4%, 17 Canada; 35%, 23 and 40.1% conducted in multicounty: Oman, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt. 31 On the other hand, the prevalence of anxiety among graduating class students in this study was lower than studies conducted in Dessie town, Amhara region, Ethiopia; 71.8%, 15 Addis Ababa Ethiopia; 51.6%, 32 and Bangladesh 87.7%. 12 This discrepancy might be due to the higher population density in Addis Ababa than Gondar, so that keeping a social distance is difficult in Addis Ababa than in Gondar, Ethiopia. Also, the prevalence of coronavirus cases was higher in Addis Ababa than in Gondar, due to these reason students in Gondar develops slightly lower than Addis Ababa. Urban living environments are associated with higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression, and psychosis. 33 The prevalence of depression in this study was 40.2%. This finding was higher than studies conducted in Italy; 27.8%, 17 China, 12.2%, 20 Spanish; 34.19%, 22 and Canada 30%. 23 This might be due to the difference in implementing preventive measures, getting access to preventive equipment, information technology, and health system. According to the World Health Organization, developing countries like Africa could be severely affected by the virus, which leads to more frustration and depression in developing countries. However, this finding was lower than studies conducted in Bangladesh; 82.4%, 12 China, 46.55%, 21 and Dessie Ethiopia; 77.2%. 15 The difference might be due to the difference in the study period. Even though the COVID-19 has been found active and lethal still, humans' fear has been declining over time. As soon as the COVID-19 virus detected there was a restriction in routine activities like lockdown and closing schools including universities and colleges and there was no hint about vaccines which leads humans to more frustration. On the other hand, the previous studies were done at a time when the students were out of school while this study is conducted after the students returned to the school.Residence, living with a family, perform physical activity, practicing COVID-19 preventive measures, and contact history with suspected or confirmed cases were the factors significantly associated with stress. Students who came from rural residences were 56% times less likely to develop stress compared with students who came from the urban residence. This finding was supported by studies conducted in Dessie town Ethiopia and China. 15, 16 This might be due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 in urban residences than the rural. Students who live in an urban area may have a higher risk of developing stress than students who live in a rural part of the country as most positive cases were detected in the urban area. Moreover, repeated media exposure and obtaining daily information regarding the pandemic might also expose them to stress. Students who lived alone were 75% times less likely to experience stress compared with students who lived with their families. This finding was supported by a study conducted in the United States. 18 This might be due to the pandemic increased the level of fear and worry about infecting their families. Students may be worried more if there are more vulnerable family members like older adults, with existing health problems, and pregnant mothers. They might also worry about their family members whose occupation increased their risk of exposure to the virus-like essential and health care workers which contribute to an increased level of stress. Those students who did not perform physical exercise were 2.2 times at a higher risk of developing stress compared with students who perform physical exercise. This finding was supported by studies conducted in Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. [34] [35] [36] This might be due to engaging in physical activity regularly is a healthy habit and a protective factor against diseases and harmful risk behaviors. Performing physical activity provides several benefits like improving self-esteem and body image, decreasing stress and nervous tension, improving motor balance, and favoring social relatedness. 37 Students who did not perform physical activity can not relate and socialize with their peers simply by belonging to a team or sports club which increases the risk of developing stress.Similarly, students who did not practice COVID-19 preventive measures appropriately were nearly two times at a higher risk of developing stress compared with their counterparts. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Dessie town, Ethiopia. 15 This might be due to preventive measures are key to reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. As a result, students who implement COVID-19 preventive measures like wearing a mask, hand washing, and physical distancing appropriately become more confident and less exposed to stress than students who did not implement it. Also, students who had a contact history with suspected or confirmed cases were nearly seven times at a higher risk of developing stress compared with those who had not a contact history. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Mexico. 38 This might be due to fear of being infected with COVID-19 and what could happen can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions. Students who had contact with COVID-19 suspected and positive patients might worry about their health and develop stress.Among the factors that affect the prevalence of anxiety in this study was the place of residence. Graduating students who came from the urban area had higher anxiety as compared to those students that came from the rural area. This finding was supported by studies conducted in Bangladesh 12 and China. 16 This might be due to one of the transmissions of coronavirus from an infected person to an uninfected person is physical contact. So people living in the urban area are more condensed than the rural area and rural areas are more scattered than the urban area. Another factor significantly associated with the prevalence of anxiety in this study was performing physical exercise for at least 20 min per day. Those students who did not perform the physical exercise for at least 20 min per day were almost two times more likely to develop anxiety as compared to those who did perform physical exercise regularly. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Bangladesh. 12 The possible reason might be due to regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids), and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance the sense of well-being.The graduating students who worried about family members who could be infected were more likely to develop anxiety in comparison with their counterparts. This finding was supported by studies conducted in Bench-Sheko Zone, South-west Ethiopia, 14 and Guangzhou, China. 20 This might be due to the greatest fear of students resulted from the possibility of infecting family members during the pandemic. Substance use like cigarettes, alcohol, or chat was one of the factors associated with anxiety in this study. The risk of developing anxiety was higher among substance users as compared to non-substance users. The possible reason might be due to some substances may help to ease anxiety in the shortterm, their effects are temporary, and the use of these substances can create a psychological or physiological dependence, which will cause or worsen other life problems and will ultimately exacerbate anxiety.Residence, living with families, the field of study, suspected/infected relatives and physical exercise were factors significantly associated with depression. Students who came from rural areas were less likely to develop depression. This finding was supported by the study done in Bangladesh. 12 This might be due to the difference in information and the implementation of preventive measures. As an example, in an urban area, there was a difficulty for implementing physical distancing due to the condensed population and get access to the daily reports of COVID-19 (death and new cases) which leads to the student's depression. Those students staying with family were four times at risk of developing depression compared with those students who stay alone. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Bangladesh. 12 This might be due to the fear of infecting and losing their families. Students who engaged in health science-related studies had less risk of developing depression compared with students in other fields of studies. This might be due to the healthcare students could have been well-informed on what to expect as the pandemic progresses compared to the students of other fields of studies.The odds of depression were nearly four times higher among students who have suspected or infected family members/relatives with COVID-19. This finding was supported by a study conducted in China. 20 This might be due to the fear of losing the beloved one, family, and relatives by death due to COVID-19 or fear of getting an infection from the relatives and becoming ill. Those students who did not perform physical exercise were nearly two times at risk of developing depression compared with their counterparts. This finding was supported by the study conducted in Bangladesh. 12 This might be due to the effect of physical exercise on psychological and physical health or spending time with physical exercise instead of only thinking about the severity and consequences of the outbreak.The study did not include non-graduating class university students. The cross-sectional nature of the study makes it impossible to draw inferences about the direction of relations and it does not show cause and effect relationship among study variables. The study did not incorporate objective measurements that may be prone to reporting bias since it was based on subjective responses.More than one-fifth, more than one-third, and nearly twofifths of graduating students had stress, anxiety, and depression in response to the COVID-19 pandemic respectively. Living in an urban area, living with a family, sedentary lifestyle, unable to practice COVID-19 preventive measures, and having a contact history with suspected/confirmed cases increases the risk of developing stress. Living in an urban area, substance use, sedentary lifestyle, and fear of infecting family members increase the risk of developing anxiety. Students who came from an urban area, live with a family, a study in non-health departments, had confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and did not perform physical exercise had a higher odds of developing depression. It is better to develop effective strategies and interventions, follow and order students, train students about self-protection, and establish a psychological crisis intervention team to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on graduating class students.AOR, adjusted odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; DASS, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; IRB, Institutional Review Board; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; OR, odds ratio; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SPSS, Statistical Package for Social Sciences; UNESCO, United Nation's Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization; WHO, World Health Organization.All data are available upon request.

COVID-19 is caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (WHO, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same class of other coronaviruses (Family-Coronaviridae) such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that have been implicated in respiratory and neurological diseases (de Wit et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2020) . The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province of China on December 31, 2019 and has since spread across all continents of the world (Zhu et al., 2020; . As of September 19, 2020, over 30.5 million confirmed cases had been reported, with more than 950,000 deaths confirmed world-wide (https://coronavirus. jhu.edu/map.html).SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may be asymptomatic, while those with confirmed cases showed common symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath (CDC, 2020; Chen et al., 2020) . The report of the WHO-China joint mission on COVID-19 has shown that 88%, 68%, 38% and 33% of infected patients showed fever, dry cough, fatigue, and sputum production symptoms, respectively (WHO, 2020) . The outbreak of the disease is currently the world's main health challenge, which has prompted WHO to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (WHO, 2020) .As the world is facing the scourge of COVID-19 outbreak, it is, therefore, a matter of urgency and necessity to develop or repurpose drugs or therapeutics to cure the disease. Although, there is currently no specific and permanent treatment for COVID-19, however, preventive, and supportive therapies are being implemented for its management to avert further complications and pathological damage (Rodr ıguez- Morales et al., 2020) . Researchers are working towards the development of effective treatments, and there have been reports that existing drugs, such as anti-malarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), antiretrovirals (Lopinavir-ritonavir) and Ebola drugs (remdesivir) could be effective against COVID-19 (Cao et al., 2020; CDC, 2020; Wang et al., 2020 ). An in silico study on four drugs (praziquantel, perampanel, pitavastatin and nelfinavir) against COVID-19 main protease enzyme showed that nelfinavir (NEF) exhibited the most promising and best inhibitory activity against the enzyme . Studies have also reported drugs/compounds such as zafirlukast, cefoperazone, Hesperidin, Curcumin and andrographolide as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 S gp (Basu et al., 2020; Maurya et al., 2020; Senathilake et al., 2020) . Several other studies, including clinical trials on vaccines and drugs, are ongoing. The COVID-19 S gp is vital in the entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor of the host cell using the COVID-19 S gp (Wrapp et al., 2020) . The receptorbinding domain (RBD) of COVID-19 S gp is used in binding with the ACE-2 receptor on the host cell to form the needed complex of RBD-ACE-2 that facilitate the viral entry (Wrapp et al., 2020) . High-affinity binding of the RBD-ACE-2 has been suggested to be one of the factors enhancing the quick and widespread of the disease (Wrapp et al., 2020) . Likewise, COVID-19 M pro is essential in viral replication and transcription (Yang et al., 2003; Pillaiyar et al., 2016) . Jin et al. (2020) further reported that the COVID-19 M pro through extensive proteolytic processing is responsible for the release of functional polypeptides from the virus polyproteins. The COVID-19 M pro and COVID-19 S gp are, therefore, attractive, and invaluable therapeutic targets for the development of drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment.Inhibition of the COVID-19 S gp and COVID-19 M pro will lead to a reduction in the spread of the infection to vulnerable hosts or cells and production of non-infectious virions. As part of the efforts to discover novel lead compounds for clinical use, this study employed combined structure-based drug design and molecular dynamic simulations to identify new leads that could target either the spike (S) glycoprotein (COVID-19 S gp ) and COVID-19 M pro or both. Fifty-three molecules with reported antiviral activities were screened as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 S gp and COVID-19 M pro or dual inhibitors. Antiretroviral drugs (lopinavir, nelfinavir and darunavir), anti-malaria drug (hydroxychloroquine), Ebola drug (remdesivir) and an irreversible inhibitor, N3 (peptidelike inhibitor) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, Ren et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016) were used as standard drugs for COVID-19 M pro , while for COVID-19 S gp , the antiasthmatic drug (zafirlukast) and cefoperazone were used as standard drugs (Senathilake et al., 2020) .The X-ray crystal structures of the COVID-19 M pro (PDB codes: 6LU7) and COVID-19 S gp (PDB code: 6LZG) were obtained from the RSCB Protein Data Bank (Burley et al. 2018; Jun et al., 2020) . The structures of the two proteins were then prepared on the UCSF Chimera software package (Yang et al., 2012) . The structure of the proteins were prepared removing water molecules, nonstandard naming, protein residue connectivity. The missing atoms of sidechains and protein backbone were added in the protein structure before the molecular docking.The standard drugs nelfinavir (NEF), lopinavir (LPV), remdesivir (RDV), N3, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), zafirlukast (ZFK) and cefoperazone (CSP) as well as the test molecules, were accessed from PubChem (Kim et al., 2016) and the 3-D structures prepared on the Avogadro software package (Hanwell et al., 2012) .The molecular docking software utilised in this study was the Autodock available on Chimera (Grosdidier et al., 2011) , with default docking parameters. Before docking, Gasteiger charges were added to the molecules, and the non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged to carbon atoms. The molecules were then docked into the binding pocket of the proteins; COVID-19 M pro and COVID-19 S gp by defining the grid box with a spacing of 1 Å each and size (27 Â 20 Â 30) and (17 Â 43 Â 27) pointing in x, y and z directions, respectively. The standard drug systems, as well as the 11 molecules with the best docking scores, were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. The best five molecules with good binding free energy were subsequently docked into the RBD of COVID-19 S gp (Figures 1 and 2 ).The MD simulation was performed as described by Idowu et al. (2019) . The simulations were performed using the GPU version provided with the AMBER package (AMBER 18), in which the FF18SB variant of the AMBER force field (Nair & Miners, 2014) was used to describe the systems.ANTECHAMBER was used to generate atomic partial charges for the ligand by utilising the Restrained Electrostatic Potential (RESP) and the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) procedures. The Leap module of AMBER 18 allowed for the addition of hydrogen atoms, as well as Na þ and Clcounter ions to COVID-19 M pro and COVID-19 S gp , respectively to neutralise all systems. The amino acids were numbered, numbering residues 1-303 for COVID-19 M pro and 1-223 for COVID-19 S gp . The systems were then suspended implicitly within an orthorhombic box of TIP3P water molecules such that all atoms were within 8 Å of any box edge (Jorgensen et al., 1983 ).An initial minimization of 2000 steps were carried out with an applied restraint potential of 500 kcal/mol for both solutes, were performed for 1000 steps using the steepest descent method followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradients. An additional full minimization of 1000 steps were further carried out using the conjugate gradient algorithm without restraint. A gradual heating MD simulation from 0 K to 300 K was executed for 50 ps, such that the systems maintained a fixed number of atoms and fixed volume. The solutes within the systems were imposed with a potential harmonic restraint of 10 kcal/mol and collision frequency of 1.0 ps. Following heating, an equilibration estimating 500 ps of each system was conducted; the operating temperature was kept constant at 300 K. Additional features such as several atoms and pressure were also kept constant mimicking an isobaric-isothermal ensemble. The system's pressure was maintained at 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat (Basconi & Shirts, 2013; Gonnet, 2007) .The total time for the MD simulations conducted were 100 ns. In each simulation, the SHAKE algorithm was employed to constrict the bonds of hydrogen atoms (Ryckaert et al., 1977) . The step size of each simulation was 2fs, and an SPFP precision model was used. The simulations coincided with the isobaric-isothermal ensemble (NPT), with randomized seeding, the constant pressure of 1 bar maintained by the Berendsen barostat (Basconi & Shirts, 2013) , a pressure-coupling constant of 2 ps, a temperature of 300 K and Langevin thermostat (Izaguirre et al., 2001 ) with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps.Analysis of root mean square deviation (RMSD), root means square fluctuation (RMSF), solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and radius of gyration (RoG) was done using the CPPTRAJ module employed in the AMBER 18 suit. All raw data plots were generated using the Origin data analysis software (Seifert, 2014) .To estimate and compare the binding affinity of the systems, the free binding energy was calculated using the Molecular Mechanics/GB Surface Area method (MM/GBSA) (Ylilauri & Pentik€ ainen, 2013) . Binding free energy was averaged over 100000 snapshots extracted from the 100 ns trajectory. The free binding energy (DG) computed by this method for each molecular species (complex, ligand, and receptor) can be represented as:The term E gas denotes the gas-phase energy, which consists of the internal energy E int ; Coulomb energy E ele and the van der Waals energies E vdw . The E gas was directly estimated from the FF14SB force field terms. Solvation free energy, G sol , was estimated from the energy contribution from the polar states, GGB, and non-polar states, G. The non-polar solvation energy, SA. GSA, was determined from the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), using a water probe radius of 1.4 Å. In contrast, the polar solvation, GGB, the contribution was estimated by solving the GB equation. S and T denote the total entropy of the solute and temperature, respectively.For the calculation/prediction of the pharmacokinetic properties of the lead compounds and the standard drugs, SwissADME server was employed (Daina et al., 2017) . The server predicts the target of small molecules.Fifty-three molecules and five FDA-approved drugs were docked into the active site of COVID-19 M pro to calculate the affinity of the molecules for the enzyme. The results of the molecular docking analysis for all the molecules are presented in Table S1 (Supplementary materials). Docking score is a measure of the fitness of the molecule into the catalytic active site pocket of an enzyme, and the more negative the value, the better the fitness of the molecule (Idowu et al., 2020) .The scoring functions permitted the calculation and prediction of the binding affinities of individual molecules, from which the best binding molecules were identified and selected (Abdullahi et al., 2018) . Eleven molecules out of the 53 compounds showed better docking scores for COVID-19 M pro that fall within or higher than the docking scores of the standard drugs except for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with the lowest docking score of À5.8 kcal/mol. Kumi et al. (2020) , suggested that selected molecules might generally display favourable binding mode within the active catalytic site of the enzyme relative to standard drugs and as well might enhance their interactions and stability within the active site. Tables 1 and 2 showed the results of the respective molecular docking analysis of the standard drugs and the five lead inhibitory molecules against COVID-19 M pro . The antiretroviral drugs, LPV (-7.1 kcal/mol) and NEF (-7.6 kcal/mol) (HIV protease inhibitors (PIs)) had higher docking scores than the recorded score for HCQ. Remdesivir, an anti-Ebola drug and N3, which had previously been reported to be an inhibitor of COVID-19 M pro , (Jin et al., 2020) showed docking score values of À7.4 kcal/mol and À6.7 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 1) . Nine molecules (BA, CA, EGCG, GRN, HCR, K7G, OAA, P3G, UAA) showed better docking scores ranging from À7.7 kcal/ mol to À8.8 kcal/mol, which were higher than the highest binding score for the standard drugs (-7.6 kcal/mol) (Table S1 supplementary materials). Additional two compounds (C3G and MA) exhibited docking scores that fall within the range of the docking scores for the standard drugs. As molecular docking only measures the geometric fitness of molecules at the active site of a protein, molecular dynamics simulations study was carried out on the standard drugs and the ten molecules (molecules with better docking scores) to investigate their binding affinities/energy and structural evaluation.Binding energies of the hit molecules and standard drugs for COVID-19 m pro and COVID-19 s gp In this study, molecular mechanics/generalised born surface area (MMGBSA) computational technique was employed to estimate the binding free energies (DG bind ) of the standard drugs and the eleven hit molecules towards COVID-19 M pro , and five lead molecules (molecules with the best binding Table 3 showed the results of the binding free energy of the best five molecules toward COVID-19 M pro , with N3 and NEF molecules exhibiting the highest binding energies of À52.463 kcal/mol and À51.618 kcal/mol among the standard drugs. This agrees with previous studies that reported the inhibitory activities of the two drugs against COVID-19 M pro . Xu et al., in an in silico study reported NEF to the most promising and potent inhibitor of COVID-19 M pro among the four tested drugs (praziquantel, perampanel, pitavastatin, and nelfinavir) after it exhibited the best binding energy against the enzyme . Both in silico and in vitro studies have reported the inhibitory activities of N3 not only against COVID-19 M pro but also against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Yang et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2016) . RDV and LPV showed a relatively similar DG bind , but lower than DG bind recorded for NEF and N3. HCQ had the lowest DG bind of À21.065 kcal/mol, which might suggest that HCQ could not be a protease inhibitor as it exhibits distinct mechanism of action from the mechanism of actions of known FDA-approved protease inhibitors. Although HCQ was listed by Centre for Disease Control (CDC) among drugs use in treating COVID-19, and drugs under clinical trial (CDC, 2020), its mechanism of actions has been reported to include alteration of protein degradation by acidic hydrolases in the lysosome, assembly of macromolecules in the endosomes, and increase intracellular pH (Robert, 1993) . This study assumes HCQ is not an inhibitor of COVID-19 M pro but suggests it inhibits SARS-CoV-2 through any of the mechanisms reported by Robert, 1993 . As shown in Table 3 , HCR exhibited the highest binding free energies relative to the standard drugs, while GRN had the second-highest value of À50.653 kcal/mol among the tested molecules but lesser than the values recorded for N3 and NEF. EGCG, C3G and K7G exhibited relatively similar binding free energy values comparable to those for RDV and LPV, while P3G exhibited the lowest value of À32.049 kcal/mol. From the binding free energy results, HCR, GRN, EGCG, C3G and K7G seemed to be promising and potential inhibitors of COVID-19 M pro . These five lead molecules were then docked into the RBD of COVID-19 S gp . Table S3 (supplementary materials) showed the result of the molecular docking analysis against COVID-19 S gp . C3G had the highest binding free energy of À42.310 kcal/mol higher than the binding energy values of the reference inhibitors (CSP, À35.509 kcal/ mol and ZFK, À24.242 kcal/mol) of COVID-19 S gp . In addition to C3G molecule, K7G and GRN (-32.210 kcal/mol and À26.922 kcal/mol, respectively) had binding energies higher than ZFK but lower than CSP. Consequent upon these data, it could be logically inferred that, C3G, K7G and GRN might possess dual inhibitory activities against COVID-19 M pro and COVID-19 S gp . A further probe to examine and establish the mechanistic inhibitory characteristics of the molecules through the interaction between the molecules and the active site amino residues (enzyme-ligand interaction plots) of the proteins (COVID-19 M pro and COVID-19 S gp ) was performed (Table 4 ).Receptor-ligand interaction examined the molecular interactions between the bound molecules and the amino acid residues at the active sites of the enzyme (Chetty et al., 2016; Idowu et al., 2019) . Figures 3-5 showed the 2 D visualisation of the interactions between the molecules and active site residues of COVID-19 M pro , COVID-19 S gp and the types of interactions (such as hydrogen bond, p-sigma, p-cation, p-Sulfur, p-alkyl, p-p stacked interaction, donor-donor interactions and Van der Waals (vdW) overlaps) observed in the interaction plots. For COVID-19 M pro , although, N3 and RDV had the same and the highest number of interactions (20 bonds) (Figure 1 ), but the binding free energy of N3 is higher than that of RDV. This might be attributed to higher number of der Waals force (12), Hydrogen bond (7) and p-Sulfur bond (1) in N3 than RDV with 10 van der Waals force, 1 Hydrogen bond and no p-Sulphur bond (Figure 3) . LPV exhibited the second highest number of interactions among the standard drugs but lower binding free energy than NEF with a total number of 16 bonds. This might be associated with the presence of attractive charge and donor- DEele electrostatic energy, DEvdW van der Waals energy, DGbind total binding free energy, DGsol solvation free energy, DEgas gas-phase free energy. donor interactions observed between NEF and the active site amino acid residues, which are absent in LPV interaction plot. From the interaction plots for the lead molecules ( Figure  4) , K7G, EGCG, GRN, and HCR had total number of interactions of 23, 22, 18 and 17 bonds, respectively. Although, HCR with the lowest number of bonds, had the highest binding energy due to the presence of noncovalent and p-p stacked interactions between the aromatic ring of HCR and amino acid residue ARG188. This interaction (p-p stacked) had been previously reported to be important in drug development (Babine & Bender, 1997) and has been used in the development of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor for treatment against Alzheimer's disease (da Silva et al., 2006) . This noncovalent and p-p stacked interaction was also observed in two of the standard drugs; between the aromatic ring of NEF and amino acid residue HIS 41, and aromatic ring of RDV and amino acid residue HIS 163.Novel coronavirus' main protease enzyme (COVID-19 M pro ), like other coronaviruses' main protease enzyme, has a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Jin et al., 2020; St. John et al., 2015) . Residues HIS 41 and CYS 148 at the active site of MERS protease enzyme have been implicated to be essential in inhibiting the specific activity of the enzyme (St. John et al., 2015) . Although, the features of the catalytic binding pocket of main protease enzymes of coronaviruses are conserved (Yang et al., 2005) , sequence alignment has shown that the CYS 148 has been replaced with CYS 145 in COVID-19 M pro (Jin et al., 2020) . Furthermore, a study has reported that the HIS 41 and CYS 145 play a vital role and are essential with regards to the inhibitory activity of any potential and promising inhibitors of COVID-19 M pro (Jin et al., 2020) . In this study, the interaction of all the five lead molecules and the standard drugs (except LPV, that interacted with only HIS 41) with both HIS 41 and CYS 145 residues of the enzyme, is a further indication that they might be potent inhibitors of COVID-19 M pro .For the COVID-19 S gp bound systems, C3G has the highest number of interactions (21), which justified its high binding free energy in this study. The two standard drugs had the same number of interactions (12 interactions each), but CSP had a higher binding energy which could be attributed to five carbon-hydrogen bonds in its interaction plot, which was absent in ZFK. GRN and K7G had a total of 9 and 11 interactions, respectively. Three carbon-hydrogen bonds interactions were also observed in C3G. A study on the analysis of the interaction surface of RBD-ACE2 revealed that strong H bonding was involved in the binding of RBD of COVID-19 S gp to ACE-2 . This might suggest that H bonding between RBD and a potential inhibitor is crucial for the development of COVID-19 S gp inhibitor. This could also justify the high binding free energy for C3G, (with a total of 18 H bonds), K7G (10) and CSP (9).Binding of an inhibitor to a specific biological target is usually associated with structural and conformational changes, which could influence the biological activity of the target (Sindhu & Srinivasan, 2015) . To establish the stability and proper equilibration of the investigated systems, RMSD, RoG and RMSF of alpha carbon (Ca) atoms were monitored and analysed along with the entire duration of 100 ns of the MD simulation for the apo-enzyme (unbound) and the bound systems. RMSD is a measurement of the systems convergence and stability (Hess, 2002) . The deviation produced by a protein during simulation is a factor determining the protein's stability. For the COVID-19 M pro , all the systems (including the apo-enzyme) achieved convergence between 10-12 ns MD simulation, signifying all the systems reached structural stability and maintained stable conformations after the convergence till the end of the simulation (Figure 6 ). C3G, EGCG, HCR, K7G and GRN had average RMSD values of 1.249 Å, 1.387 Å, 1.501 Å, 1.511 Å, 1.511 Å and 2.211 Å, while the standard drugs, LPV, NEF, N3 and RDV had average values of 1.861 Å, 1.901 Å, 3.367 Å, and 4.031 Å, respectively ( Figure 6 ). The confirmation of the apo-enzyme (COVID-19 M pro ) that served as control exhibited an average RMSD value of 2.471 Å. The result, therefore, showed that the binding of the five lead molecules, NEF and LPV induced more structural stability on COVID-19 Mpro and this is indicative of promising prospect for the identified lead compounds as COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors. The RMSD for the COVID-19 S gp systems revealed that all the systems, including the standard drugs, achieved convergence at 20 ns and maintained structural stability and stable conformation (Figure 7a ). C3G, K7G and GRN had average RMSD values of 4.217 Å, 4.131 Å, and 4.89 Å, while the standard drugs, CSP and ZFK had average values of 4.414 Å and 3.949, respectively. The binding of the ligands brought more stability to the enzyme, as the average RMSD values of the ligand are lower than the average RMSD of the apo-enzyme (4.821 Å)To evaluate the overall structural compactness of the enzymes upon binding of ligands, the RoG was also calculated. The alteration of structural compactness of a protein induced by the binding of the ligand could influence the biological activity of the protein (Sindhu & Srinivasan, 2015) , and the lower the RoG value, the more stable the system. In the COVID-19 M pro systems, the apo-enzyme exhibited an than the standard drugs (NEF; 22.223 Å, LPV; 22.354 Å, RDV; 22.267 Å, and N3; 22.531 Å) , which correlated with the RMSD results where all the five lead molecules induced more structural stability and compactness on the enzyme than the standard drugs ( Figure 8 ). The highest RoG value in the COVID-19 S gp systems was observed with ZFK (22.427 Å), with the lowest RoG value exhibited by K7G (20.523 Å). The three lead molecules (C3G, K7G and GRN) exhibited more structural stability and compactness than the two standard drugs (Figure 7b ).RMSF is a measure of the effect of the binding of the ligand on the behaviour of the active site residues of a protein.Higher and lower fluctuation values indicate more and less flexible movements, respectively. For the COVID-19 M pro , the highest average RMSF values were observed in N3 (2.215 Å) and NEF (2.096 Å), followed by LPV (2.002 Å), HCR (1.932 Å), RDV (1.865), GRN (1.821 Å), C3G (1.785 Å) and EGCG (1.801 Å). The lowest value was recorded in K7G systems with an average value of (1.791 Å) ( Figure 9 ). As shown in Figure 10 , similar pattern of fluctuations was observed in residues: 41-55, 155-165, 185-195 and 275-290 in all the systems, indicating more flexible movement and unrestricted fluctuations at the residues. The unbound system of COVID-19 S gp (Apo-enzyme) and K7G exhibited the highest and the lowest residual flexibility with average RMSF values of 4.301 Å, and 2.411 Å, respectively. ZFK, CSP, GRN and C3G had average values of 4.033 Å, 3.874 Å, 3.272 Å and 3.121 Å, respectively. The binding of the ligands (both in the lead molecules and the standard drugs) decreased the enzyme residues flexibility. At residues 165-171 and 217-220 (except for K7G at 165-171), the similarity in the pattern of fluctuations was observed for the unbound system and the molecules ( Figure 10 ).Assessing the drug-likeness of the hit molecules and the standard drugs By employing the SwissADME server, the pharmacokinetic properties of the standard drugs and the lead molecules were assessed (Daina et al., 2017) . Yamashita and Hashida (2004) , reported that the in-silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) evaluation gives an in vivo overview of the drug interaction, and eventually decrease the risk of disapproval of drug development. The Lipinski's rule of five (Ro5) is a set of rules used to evaluate the drug-likeness of compounds with pharmacological activity. The Ro5 examines both the physical and chemical properties of a compound to ascertain its safety as an orally active drug (Lipinski et al., 2012) . The rule stated that the molecular weight of a potential compound should be less than 500 daltons and the lipophilicity of the compound (partition coefficient (logP)) should not be greater than 5. The higher value of logP usually means the probability of a compound to permeate the lipid membrane is low (Remko et al., 2011) . As shown in Table 5 , the hit molecules and the standard drugs had logP values lesser than 5, indicating they could permeate the lipid bilayers. However, the results of this study further showed that all the standard drugs (except RDV) passed the Ro5, and none of the hit molecules passed the Ro5. The maintenance of optimal concentrations of a drug in the systemic circulation is a dependant factor of the absorption of such drug in the Gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This is therefore important for such a drug to get to its site of action with enough concentration to exert its maximum therapeutic effects (Kremers, 2002) . LPV and HCQ are highly absorbed in the GIT, while the other molecules had low absorption rate. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a protective gate that prevents the passage of toxic compounds into the brain or the central nervous system (Begley & Brightman, 2011) . Compounds with larger molecular weight (higher than 400 Dalton) or not lipid-soluble cannot pass through the BBB, but smaller and lipid-soluble molecules can pass through the BBB (Begley & Brightman, 2011) .Of all the lead molecules and the standard drugs, only HCQ (lower molecular weight of 335.87 g/mol) was predicted to permeate through the BBB. The bioavailability score of a drug is the measurement of the degree or rate of absorption and quantity of a given amount of unchanged drug that goes to the systemic circulation (Heaney, 2001) . Intravenously administered drugs have a higher bioavailability score than an orally administered drug. In the calculation of drug dosage, it is an essential pharmacokinetic property that needs to be carefully considered. Higher bioavailability score correlates with a higher optimal concentration of drug in the systemic circulation and enhanced maximum therapeutic effects. NEF, LPV, HCQ and ZFK had the highest bioavailability scores of 0.55, and CSP exhibited the lowest score of 0.11.Considering the vital roles of COVID-19 S gp and COVID-19 M pro in the entry mechanism and replication of SARS-CoV-2, inhibition, and the discovery of potent inhibitors of these proteins are important in the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, this study employed molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation techniques to identify potential inhibitors of these proteins. The results of the binding free energy revealed that five molecules (HCR, GRN, K7G, EGCG and C3G) and three molecules (GRN, K7G and C3G) are high affinity binders of COVID-19 M pro and COVID-19 S gp, respectively. Structural dynamics analyses of the two proteins upon inhibitor binding, evaluated by the calculation of RMSD, RoG and RMSF of C-a atoms, revealed that binding of five molecules (HCR, GRN, K7G, EGCG and C3G) and three molecules (GRN, K7G and C3G) conferred stability and compactness on the structural architecture of COVID-19 M pro and COVID-19 S gp , respectively. GRN, K7G and C3G might possess dual inhibitory activities against COVID-19 S gp and COVID-19 M pro. The study further revealed that the lead molecules possess similar pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties with the FDA-approved standard drugs. These lead molecules will serve as prerequisite towards the development of inhibitors of COVID-19 S gp and COVID-19 M pro upon additional in vitro and in vivo evaluations.","South Africa","first author","2021-02-16",2

In a short time later the disease has rapidly spread around to most countries of the world. The World Health Organization declared that the rapid spread of this virus represents an unprecedented challenge, which requires cooperation and collaboration of all countries of the world [2] . The main challenge lies in the ability of countries to provide the necessary health care to the large number expected to be infected in a short time. Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population announced the first case in Egypt on February 14 for a Chinese citizen [3] . In March 5 2020, the first case of coronavirus among citizens inside the country was reported.The Egyptian government has taken several gradual precautionary measures since the announcement of the emergence of the virus to control the spread, such as imposing a curfew for certain hours and imposing limited partial isolation of some places that witness an increase in the number of infections in addition to the relatively expanded examination of contacts of confirmed cases.In general there are three different categories of the methods used to study the spread of infection diseases. The first is to establish a mathematical model of a dynamical system to describe the evolution of the disease; the second is to use statistical methods and the third is using machine learning expert methods [4] . The second and third methods need a large number of data to be effective.Mathematical modeling plays a vital role in predicting the health and environmental impacts of epidemics and diseases for animals and humans [5] [6] [7] The importance of using mathematics in transmission and spread of epidemics was born in 1766 in the article of Bernoulli that describe the influence of smallpox on the average expected life period using mathematical table analysis [8] .In 1902, Ronald Ross used mathematics to investigate the feasibility of alternative strategies for malaria [9] .In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick illustrated the dynamics of infections spreads using a system of differential equations [10] that are called SIR models.In mathematical modeling, the population is divided into compartments in accordance to the state of their health, such as susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) as in SIR model. Other states of the population linked with control policies such as quarantined (Q) are also used.In this work we shall consider formulation of the model using fractional derivatives in the Caputo sense definition [11] [12] [13] . Other fractional operators such as the Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu will be discussed in the future and compared with the Caputo one [14] [15] .Fractional derivatives have been used efficiently to fine tune many existing models of physical and natural phenomena [16] [17] . In the field of Bio-Modeling, fractional derivatives were used to generalize the Hodgkin-Huxley model [18] . The model using fractional derivatives gave more accurate results than the model using classical derivatives. In the field of physical science, fractional derivatives were used to model viscoelastic substances with good agreement with experimental results [19] [20] [21] . Also, Sherief et al [22] have constructed a successful fractional model for thermoelasticity (see also [23] [24] ).The main advantage behind the use of fractional derivatives stems from its memory effect. This means that its definition as an integral over past times makes the effects of the stimuli somewhat retarded not instantaneous as in the classical models. This is in accord with what is found in nature.After the spread of the Corona pandemic, a few models have emerged that use fractional differentiation to model the corona propagation such that the paper by M.A.Khan, A. Atangana, in this paper the author consider the model formulation by applying Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative operator [6] . They applied their model in Wuhan China considering the sea food marketr as the main source of infection. All the parameter that they have used were either values from the literature or estimated from the Wuhan city of China.In this paper we develop a fractional model using Caputo fractional operator that adapts well to COVID-19 in Egypt to support efforts to control proliferation at rates that health care can handle. We consider the reported cases in the interval from March 10, 2020 to May 12, 2020.According to the known characteristics of COVID-19 and the treatment and where k 1 is the ratio that reflects the rate of infection from an asymptomatically person symptoms one and is the infection rate that can be approximated by the The rate at which highly infectious people will be transferred to confirmed cases 3 k Transition rate from exposed to infected class 2 k Transition rate from exposed to isolation 4 k The proportion of recovering peoples if being admitted to isolation ward As soon as a person is infected, the proportion of becoming in I is , which  means that the proportion of becoming in Q equal [28] . There are a number of (1 )   numerical methods that are used to solve fractional differential equations such as those in [29] [30] [31] [32] . We use Laplace transform technique to solve the model as follows:Taking the Laplace transform with parameter z defined by the relation where , , , and are considered the initial conditions taken inMarch 10, 2020. Solving the system of equations (10) and then using numerical inverse Laplace transform to find the unknown functions in the time domain. The inversion method uses Fourier expansion techniques. The details can be found on [33] .We now apply our model to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt. We use : The transition rate from exposed to infected class and : The proportion of becoming symptomaticThe average number of days in Expose = 5 days and of 20 % all them would be transferred to I class. In figure 2 , the graph shows a good agreement of the trend of daily real confirmed cases with that estimated by FSEQHIR model at α equal 0.97. The effect of fractional parameter α in fine tuning the model is illustrated in figure3. Figure 4 represents the infection rate according to the relation (8) . Finally, in figure 5 , the cumulative of the modeling confirmed cases are drawn to predict the total numbers of cases.We have proposed a new fractional mathematical model to predict the spread of epidemics in Egypt. The proposed model predicts a significant increase in the number of cases after two months, as in figure 2 . Accordingly, a number of measures to control proliferation must be taken such as the application of a comprehensive ban, isolation, and social divergence policies for a specific period of time. To show the effect of this precautionary policies, we have prepared an imaginary model, as in figure 6 , to control the spread of the disease after reaching near 500 confirmed cases daily. The change in the model depends on expeditiously expanding the isolation procedures for suspects or potential exhibitors, as well as increasing the duration of curfews. We see from Figure 7 that the suggested modified model predicts reaching a maximum number of cases per day and then these numbers decrease monotonically after that.","Egypt","abstract","2021-02-16",2

The United States of America and India are the two most affected countries as of September 17, 2020, with a death toll of 199,746 in the USA and 83,198 in India.In March 2020, the first case of confirmed COVID-19 was recorded in the kingdom of Morocco; the patient, who presented with acute pneumonia, was an imported case from Europe. As of September 17, 2020, the number of cases confirmed in the different regions of our country was 92,016, including 1,686 deaths, the majority of which were diagnosed after the deconfinement in June 2020.This rapid viral spread has prompted the publication of numerous studies to identify clinical, biological, radiological, and genetic predictors for the progression to severe and fatal forms of the disease [3] . Recognition of these predictors will make it possible to stratify the risk and direct the intervention studies to target patients at risk of worsening and progression to death. Moreover, such predictors would also allow for the optimized allocation the human and technical resources for management. Demographic (advanced age, male sex), clinical (comorbidities, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), and radiological predictors have been extensively detailed in different studies [3] [4] [5] . Biological (lymphopenia, hyperferritinemia, serum C-reactive protein [CRP] levels) predictors [3, 6] have been reported but remain mostly undescribed in the North African region.Our study enriches these data by reporting the experience in our developing country, which undertook confinement measures at an early stage of the crisis, thereby impacting the evolution of this pathology. The objective of our study was to describe the hematological and biochemical abnormalities in Moroccan patients with COVID-19 and to identify the parameters that can help distinguish those likely to develop severe COVID-19.This single-center, retrospective, observational study was approved by the institutional scientific and ethics committees of Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital and Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), and consent was not required (CE_UM6SS/1/ 06/2020-April 3th 2020). This study describes the demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and outcomes of incident cases of COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from March 18, 2020, the date of the first confirmed case in our hospital, until May 20, 2020. This time frame was chosen to have a minimum follow-up of 15 days for all patients. The last patient in the series was admitted on April 20, 2020.Only patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were included. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, Kit Genfinder) assay using a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included [7] . A total of 146 patients were recruited, excluding patients under 18 years of age; ultimately, 134 patients were selected and separated into two groups: 45 severe patients and 89 non-severe patients. Severely ill patients were defined as those admitted to the ICU with one of the following signs: respiratory rate more than 30 breaths/min, oxygen saturation less than 93% at room air, ARDS, or requirement of mechanical ventilation [8] . Non-severe patients were those with mild or moderate forms of COVID-19 according to World Health Organization criteria [8] .Electronic medical record data were collected using institutional software (DxCare SIH-HCK and LIMS SGL-HCK). Data collected included demographic, clinical, and biological factors, as well as complications at admission and during the hospital stay. Any missing or uncertain data were collected and clarified through direct communication with the relevant health care providers and family members of patients.Continuous variables were presented as means (standard deviation [SD]) if they were normally distributed or as medians (interquartile range [IQR]) if they were not normally distributed; categorical variables were presented as counts (%). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of distribution of continuous variables. Baseline demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics were compared among severe and non-severe patients. To compensate for the lack of data on certain biological parameters at a given time due to patient discharge or death, the parameters at admission, nadir, and peak during hospitalization were compared. Nadir and peak hematological parameters were obtained by following patients from admission to their last blood test. To compare differences between the two groups, we used the Student's t-test (parametric distribution) or Mann-Whitney's U test (nonparametric distribution) for continuous variables and the chi-squared or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. For all tests, a two-tailed α below 0.05 was considered statistically significant (P-value). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM SPSS).The number of confirmed COVID-19 patients was 134; 89 (66.4%) were admitted to single bedroom, and 45 (33.5%) patients with severe to critical disease required treatment in the ICU. The latter were distributed as follows: 31 survivors and 14 non-survivors. ). The other symptoms (myalgia, asthenia, headache, anosmia, ageusia, and digestive signs) were observed in our series less frequently ( Table 1) .Most of the patients received antiviral therapy, including hydroxychloroquine (127 patients [95%]) and azithromycin (127, [95%]), with no difference between the two groups. Severe patients received lopinavir/ritonavir (11, [24.4%] ). Five patients in the severe group received tocilizumab (11.1%), one of whom survived after 7 days of invasive mechanical ventilation. The majority of patients received low-molecular-weight heparin: 95% of patients with severe Transmission via ethnic or family clusters also appears to favor progression to severe disease. High levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), both on admission and during hospitalization, were strongly associated with progression to severe forms (Tables 2 and 3) . Lymphopenia and a tendency toward leukopenia and neutropenia also significantly favored severity (Tables 2 and 3 ). By following the kinetics of the biological assessment over the entire period of hospitalization, it was observed that the difference was significant between the two groups; moreover, the levels of LDH, ferritin, and CRP in severe patients began to regress from the 10th day of hospitalization in the ICU (Fig 1) . We described the clinico-biological profile of COVID-19 disease in the North African region using a sample of 134 patients. The demographic characteristics identified in our series support the data reported by several authors who have confirmed that advanced age is a factor that predisposes patients to COVID-19 and promotes progression to severe disease and death [11, 12] . For instance, Zhou et al. showed in their study that age over 50 years was strongly associated with the occurrence of ARDS and age over 65 years was associated with mortality [12] . However, advanced age was also reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS [13, 14] . The frequent age-related comorbidities observed in our [11, 12] . The reason for the association between infection-related mortality (particularly viral infections) and age may be impaired cellular immune function and a longer duration of inflammation in elderly people [11] . Male sex has also been reported as a factor influencing the severity of COVID-19 by most authors; this was also confirmed in our series [15] . In contrast, a team from Iran showed that sex may not be a factor promoting aggravation [16] . Furthermore, transmission via ethnic or family clusters, which was noted in our series (68 [65.4%]), raises suspicion of a genetic predisposition to the disease, which needs to be identified by in-depth immunological and genetic studies. The clinical signs presented by our patients, as well as their frequencies and rates, were similar to those in other series [3] . It is evident that COVID-19 disease is associated with significant morbidity, particularly in patients with chronic diseases, at least one-fifth of whom require supportive care in medical ICUs [17] , which are particularly limited in most developing countries such as those in Africa. Moreover, despite the implementation of optimal supportive interventions, the inpatient mortality rate remains above 1.4%, reaching 6.4% in the population aged over 60 years old [18, 19] .The biological profile of our patients is similar to what has been described in the literature, with the presence of lymphopenia in severe patients upon admission and an aggravation of lymphopenia during their stay. Several hypotheses have been raised to understand the pathogenesis of lymphopenia in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A Chinese study details the characteristics of the hemogram and lymphocyte subpopulations in 166 patients with the nonsevere form and 286 with the severe form. Severe patients had a significantly increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and elevated markers of inflammation (CRP, ferritin, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-10). In addition, there was an imbalance in the lymphocyte immune response in severe patients, who had more CD4 lymphopenia, more CD4-naïve cells and CD4 suppressor T cells, and fewer CD4 memory cells and regulatory T cells, compared to that in non-severe patients [20] . Rodriguez et al. have suggested that COVID-19 may act on lymphocytes, particularly T cells, possibly depleting CD4 and CD8 cells [15] .The viral particles spread through the respiratory mucosa, first using the ACE2 receptor at the level of ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and then infecting other cells. This induces a cytokine storm in the body and generates a series of immune responses, which cause changes in peripheral WBCs and immune cells such as lymphocytes [21] . This notion has been demonstrated by Henry et al. in their meta-analysis: the number of lymphocytes, particularly CD4 lymphocytes, can serve as a biological predictor of severity and mortality; in the case of COVID-19, they also reported the hypothesis that survival may depend on the ability to restore lymphocytes that are killed by the virus [22] . The same authors also reported significant increases in ferritin and CRP levels in patients with suspected severe COVID-19, consistent with the current findings.The increase in CRP levels reflects the extent of the systemic inflammatory syndrome seen in severe forms of the disease, which is accompanied by a massive release of inflammatory cytokines creating a ""cytokine storm"" responsible for acute tissue damage with the onset of severe ARDS and subsequent multi-systemic failure [22] .The increase in LDH levels observed in our series is consistent with the findings of Liu who correlated LDH, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and CRP abnormalities with severe COVID pneumonia [23] . The elevated ferritin levels are probably due to secondary phagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and severe cytokine release syndrome [24, 25] . An elevated D-dimer level was also significantly related to severity in our series and was the cause of coagulopathy with thromboembolic complications in 2.9% of our patients. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were not common in our series. Myocardial damage, as revealed biologically by high troponin and creatine phosphokinase levels indicative of viral myocarditis, which has been described by others, was not observed in our severe patients [26, 27] .In contrast, the evolution during the stay was marked by the significantly stark difference of the median nadir of WBC, lymphocytes, and Neutrophils, as well as the median peak of WBC, neutrophil, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, LDH, D-dimer, ASAT, ALAT, creatinine, and urea levels. This demonstrates the occurrence of complications of the severe form of COVID-19 including the following: bacterial superinfection, severe ARDS secondary to the cytokine storm, thromboembolic disease, and organ dysfunction (which is believed to be multifactorial [comorbidities, the cytokine storm of COVID-19, the resuscitation environment]), leading to death. This has been confirmed by several authors .The limitations of our study were as follows: the single-center retrospective study design, which increases the chance of selection bias and impacts the generalizability of data; the absence of evaluation of immunological parameters (CD4, CD8, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10) studied by the other teams, which could help us to properly analyze the inflammatory characteristics of our patients; the small sample size; and missing data from some paucisymptomatic patients and patients who died at a given time. This limits the in-depth statistical analysis needed to stratify the maximum risks associated with the pathology.We have investigated multiple studies, the majority of which originated in China, which can be compared to that of other populations to detect clinical and biological characteristics of COVID-19 that may be influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. For this reason, we recommend that clinicians closely monitor the biological parameters in hospitalized patients with respiratory distress related to COVID-19 and that further genetic and virology studies be conducted to properly control the risk related to the disease.Supporting information S1 Data.

As at 30 November 2020, over 60 million cases have been reported with about 1 million deaths, with spike in the number of cases and hence a second wave being reported in many countries including the United States of America, Canada and many European countries 4 . Despite concerted efforts to curb the spread of the disease, the pandemic continues to strain healthcare systems globally 5, 6, 7 . The unprecedented nature of COVID-19 presents therapeutic challenges implying that no specific treatment has been reinstated for the management of the disease and thus necessitating the use of empirical approaches 1 . It is clear that a safe, highly effective and globally acceptable vaccination program may be a long-term solution against this pandemic. However, a COVID-19 vaccine that is not equitable in terms of distribution and access poses a further challenge in effective curbing of the pandemic. We commented on the need to level any uneven power dynamics in COVID-19 vaccine access and distribution.The impact and importance of vaccines in modern medicine cannot be overemphasized. Vaccines have played immense roles in the total eradication of grave illnesses and in curtailing and curbing the spread and reducing the morbidity and mortality of many diseases and as such, the prognosis of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine can only be positive 8 As with many other efforts against the pandemic, the research into the development of vaccines is one that has undoubtedly been resource-consuming and quite sadly, not spared from political interference. For example, the United States has been able to fund and fasttrack the development of vaccines, securing a large number of doses of the vaccine for its people should it be approved 10 . Similar efforts have emerged in Europe with the European commission having sanctioned contracts with six pharmaceutical firms including a deal with Moderna for 80 million doses and an obligation to supply 80 million more 11 . Seeing as it may be realistically impossible for the production of successful vaccine candidates to meet up with the global demand, efforts to secure the first doses produced have largely been nationalistic with every country looking for means to secure the vaccines for their populations. It therefore raises the concern that even within the countries that manage to secure the first few doses of the vaccine, distribution which should prioritize high-risk groups, may succumb to political forces as it has on the global scale. Having described the exemplary efforts directed towards COVID-19 vaccine development and the concurrent political influences it is subjected to, a robust discourse about equitable distribution, affordability and accessibility of the vaccine to every individual regardless of political, racial or cultural background, becomes paramount. Despite indirect sovereign and imperialist low tones, collaborations between academia and industry in developing COVID-19 vaccine may appear beneficial. These openly political partnerships and efforts play into tensions among poor countries and ultimately prioritize rich countries over poor countries. The COVID-19 vaccine distribution must not allow for sovereignty which is tightly linked to historical imbalances in power and resources resulting into discrimination between rich and poor countries.It is worthy of note that deciding the appropriate approach to vaccine distribution requires a critical appraisal of the nature of the disease itself. It has been proven that the disease is most pathogenic in individuals with compromised immune systems and individuals living with other diseases, groups which have thus been classified as the high-risk groups. Individuals in this category include those with immunosuppressive illnesses like diabetes, cancers, HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, and the aged people. Health workers and primary caregivers are also a category of people with a higher index of susceptibility to the disease. In the same vein, individuals in lower income countries that are ravaged by war and conflicts, shrivelled by poverty and co-morbid epidemics, and could not conform with physical distancing and lockdown protocols constitute a significant number of vulnerable people. In an ominous twist, it could be the case that in the absence of conscious efforts towards equitable distribution of vaccines, the groups of people who may have the most access to the vaccines and the demography classified as high-risk groups may not overlap enough for a significant impact on the progression of the disease on the global scale. Ergo, equitability begins with coverage of individuals at higher risks of the infection. This further highlight that access to COVID-19 vaccine should be determined by medical need over national wealth, power, and international influence.For a disease that has claimed millions of lives and rendered millions incapacitated, it is expedient that vaccination, the utmost way-out from the debilitating effects of the virus, becomes accessible to and is equitably distributed among willing countries and individuals. Additionally, we must note that herd immunity-a concept used to describe protection of unvaccinated individuals by reduction of the number of people who can transmit the diseases and thus curtailing the rate of spread of infection-can only be achieved through equitable vaccine distribution. Failure to drive intentional efforts towards this, will create a world of bipartite healthcare coverage: one part favoured and the other part marginalized, constituting a vagrant act of injustice and inequality of health coverage. This can only mean that we can never truly eradicate the virus and deaths will continue to soar in the marginalized parts of the world.Unfortunate examples include the massive deaths from HIV/AIDS between 1997-2007 in Africa, a jarring record of 12 million mortalities which ravaged the continent 12 . Whereas developed countries had made abundantly available the drugs for the disease, African countries continued to succumb to the virus. Similar incidence has been observed during the 2009 swine-flu epidemic 12 . Rich countries procured the vaccine for the illness at surplus rates while the poorer countries were wanting. Unlike the higher income countries who have been able to enforce lockdowns and initiate physical distancing protocols, LMICs have barely been able to do this, and therefore breeding a swathing population of more vulnerable individuals. Moreover, LMIC countries have deplorable infrastructures including bad roads and housing, leading to an enormous number of difficult-to-reach population. In spite of these and even though their financial contributions to vaccine development have been limited, the world must carry them along in vaccination protocols towards a common enemy, a no-respecter of colony or social backgrounds. Poor countries must be supported in ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccine by levelling the power dynamics that perpetuate inequality and fuel injustice 13 .Vaccine hesitancy is another factor that could militate against equitable vaccine distribution. Vaccine hesitancy is ""the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines"", it was classified as one of the top ten threats to global health by the world health organization in 2019 14 . A growing number of people have a preconceived idea of outright refusal of the vaccine, borne out of misinformation or dogma, when it becomes available. The belief that the vaccine introduces a chip that commandeer people's autonomy by the government continues to be foreboding. In conjunction with dogmatic anti-vaxers and potential uneven power dynamics, vaccine hesitancy becomes a considerable challenge to vaccine distribution. To combat this, it is paramount to spread information and educate people in as way many ways as possible about the importance of vaccines and fight misinformation and conspiracy theories with evidence-based information.As unprecedented as the COVID-19 pandemic is and despite the daunting challenges it has posed, numerous remarkable feats have been achieved in curbing the spread and eradicating the disease, including but not limited to the current efforts for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, a feat achieved in just about 10 months, compared to the average time span for the development of vaccines even in the recent past which takes nothing short of a decade, indeed remarkable it is. This remarkable achievement, however, must not end there, COVID-19 vaccination programmes need to be global and multinational and prioritise the vulnerable and marginalized populations to fully curb this pandemic. We must ensure equity, fairness and transparency in COVID-19 distribution and gain public trust in COVID-19 vaccine through participatory community engagement. A reliable supply chain must be established to ensure timed and adequate tracking of vaccine deliveries to even the most remote part of the world. The healthcare workforce must be reinforced and adequately prepared to overcome challenges faced in vaccine distribution. COVID-19 vaccine distribution and access must be equitable and not politicized.","Nigeria","first author","2021-02-17",2

Such assays are useful for rapid antibody testing in surveillance programmes in outbreak settings or in high seroprevalence areas. The assays may assist in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in patients who test negative for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on naso-or oropharyngeal swabs. [1] In addition, they require minimal operator training and have a turnaround time of under thirty minutes. [2] Some valid concerns about the performance quality of these rapid assays exist, and most available rapid assays have been subjected only to single centre internal validation studies, in small populations. [3] Furthermore, the threshold antibody titre required to generate a detectable result on these devices is poorly described.We conducted antibody testing using all five rapid antibody assays on 102 participants with previous PCR-confirmed COVID-19. The majority of our participants were female (61%) and of black ethnicity (40%). Median age in the cohort was 37.5 years (IQR 29 -45.75) and most of the participants were HCWs (68%). The majority of our cohort were tested between 15-and 42-days post-positive PCR testing (n=83, 81%) with 4 (4%) and 15 (15%) being tested less than 15 days and more than 42 days post-testing, respectively. Comorbidities amongst the participants included hypertension (n=14, 14%), diabetes (n=12, 12%), asthma (n=10, 10%), HIV (n=6, 6%) and cancer (n=3, 3%). Additional demographic data are presented in Table 1 .Overall sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies was below 70% in all assays ( Figure 1 ). IgG sensitivity ranged from 36% (Innovita) to 69% (Dynamiker) whilst IgM sensitivity ranged from 13% (Innovita) to 67% (Dynamiker). Of note, the sensitivities of the Innovita (13%), AllTest (15%) and Altis (26%) assays to detect IgM were markedly lower than those of the Dynamiker (67%) and Cellex (64%) assays.Variability in diagnostic accuracy between the five rapid antibody assays for the detection IgG and/or IgM was assessed through the use of a correlation matrix represented in a heatmap ( Figure 2 ). This measured agreement between each assay for the detection of IgG or IgM. Four of the five assays (Dynamiker, AllTest, Altis and Cellex, Figure 2 ; r >0.8 for all) correlated well with each other in the detection of IgG.However, none of these four assays correlated well with the Innovita assay for IgG.Most strikingly, there was a significant reduction in IgG sensitivity for participants under 40 years of age compared to those over 40 years for all of the assays used ( Male gender has previously been associated with COVID-19 severity. [5] However, we did not find any difference in the sensitivity of any of the rapid antibody assays for IgG or IgM based on gender within our cohort (Tables 2 and 3) .A multivariate logistic regression was performed to exclude confounding variables and to confirm the factors associated with an increased likelihood of a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG or IgM response by rapid antibody assay. The variables included age, gender, time since positive test and severity. Age >40 years was the only variable associated with a significantly increased likelihood of a detectable IgG and IgM response by rapid antibody testing ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ). This was significant for all of the rapid antibody assays for IgG and all except the AllTest assay for IgM (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) .Rapid serological assays are increasingly becoming an essential component of surveillance of outbreaks and retrospective diagnoses of COVID-19. These assays have appeal as they are rapid, inexpensive and user-friendly. However, data evaluating their true clinical performance on finger-prick analyses at the POC, in a real-world clinical context, is urgently needed.Our analysis of patient factors associated with an improved sensitivity of the rapid antibody tests revealed an association between age and sensitivity. All of the assays demonstrated improved sensitivities in those patients aged >40 years for IgG and all the assays except the Altis for IgM. The higher sensitivity of these tests in older participants may indicate higher antibody titres in these individuals and therefore a higher likelihood of detection of such antibody responses by the rapid assays. Older patients with COVID-19 have been shown to have higher SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibody titres than younger patients, although the reason for this is unclear. [13, 14] It is likely that increased SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titres correlate with more severe COVID-19, and that increased age has been correlated with severe disease and worse outcome. [6, 15] . When both age and disease severity were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only age was associated with an increased likelihood of a positive rapid IgG or IgM antibody response, thereby suggesting that age may play a role independently of its association with disease severity. Our cohort primarily consisted of participants that had mild COVID-19 with 80% of the cohort in the mild to moderate category. Due to the fact that younger individuals typically experience milder COVID-19 disease and have an increased rate of asymptomatic infection, our findings may suggest a significant impediment to the use of these assays to assess seroprevalence in younger participants.This study described an overall underperformance of rapid serological assays to detect an IgG and IgM response two to six weeks after PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We highlight the heterogenous ability of the antibody assays to detect IgM and describe a significant independent association between age >40 years and increased sensitivity for IgG and IgM seropositivity. Judicious clinical use, recognising the limitations of rapid serological assays, especially amongst the young, is necessary.","South Africa","first author","2021-02-01",2

This virus belongs to the family of viruses known as Coronaviridae which makes the causes of COVID-19. The first outbreak of COVID-19 infection is reported in Wuhan China at the end of 2019. This virus is highly contagious and due to its fast spreading mostly the faced it in the form of infected cases, deaths and economic loss [1] . The pandemic not only affects the humans population but also gives big loss to the countries' economic growth. A lot of people lost their jobs, and many industries and other business hubs suffered a lot. The recent report of the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that a total of 10.27 million are tested positive and more than 1.52 million deaths a e-mail: muhammad.altaf.khan@tdtu.edu.vn b e-mail: skumar.math@nitjsr.ac.in (corresponding author) study was conducted in [24] , in which the authors analyzed the dynamical analysis of the corona infection through fractional model studied using the exponential type kernel. A novel coronavirus model has been recently introduced in [25] using the Caputo derivative. Recently, in [26] , the authors have presented a numerical investigation of fractional COVID-19 model in fractional derivative. More recently, the authors have analyzed the dynamics of corona virus infection through non-integer-order model in [27] . The dynamical analysis of the coronavirus model considering KSA real data is studied in [28] .Keeping the above facts in mind, in the current study, we reformulate the COVID-19 model [13] by applying the ABC fractional-order operator. We will analyze the model dynamics with these new operators and its appropriateness to our proposed model. In order to formulate the fractional COVID-19 model, we replace the ordinary derivative with the generalized ABC fractional derivative. Moreover, we carried out a detailed theoretical and numerical aspects of the proposed model in fractional derivative. Organizing the reaming work is as follows: Sect. 2 presents the basics definitions relevant to the fractional-order derivatives that will be used in the modeling considered. The model formulation in ABC fractional derivative is discussed in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents some necessary mathematical properties of the proposed model. The numerical solution and the resulting simulation results for memory index and various parameters are shown in Sects. 5 and 6, respectively. The concluding remarks relevant to the present investigation are summarized in Sect. 7.This section presents some important necessary concepts and basic definition regarding fractional operators.Definition 2.1 For the function denoted by y(t) ∈ C n , the Caputo type derivative having order ϑ in (n − 1, n] where n ∈ N is defined as [21] :Clearly C D ϑ t (y(t)) approaches y (t) as ϑ → 1. Definition 2.2 The ABC fractional operator is defined as follows: [21] :and AB(ϑ) is the normalized function and AB(0) = AB(1) = 1.The associated integral to the fractional derivative with Mittag-Leffler kernel is defined as follows [21] :Consider the system of fractional differential equation in Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo sense described as follows [29] :where F : D ⊂ R n × R + −→ R n and ϑ ∈ (0, 1]. Then, the following result deals with the globally asymptotic stability of fractional system (4).Theorem 2.1 [29] For the fractional system (4) with Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo derivative, let V(t, y(t)) be positive definite and V(t) = V(t, y(t)) be a continuously differentiable function. Further, ABC t 0 D ϑ t V(t, y(t)) is negative definite for all ϑ ∈ (0, 1]. If there exists a function say F of class K with V(y) = F(y) such that if V increase, then F increases, then the equilibrium point y = 0 is asymptotically stable point at t = 0.Initially, we present brief details of the classical integer-order compartmental model describing the dynamics of novel COVID-19 infection. The model under consideration has been recently studied in [13] . The transmission model is formulated by sub-dividing the total population described by N (t) at time t, into mutually exclusive eight sub-population groups. The respective sub-groups are the susceptible humans not yet infected but at risk to catch the infection S(t), exposed to COVID-19 infection E(t), the symptomatic humans are those infected individuals having clinical symptoms I (t), the asymptomatic infected humans are those having no or mild clinical symptoms of COVID-19 I A (t), the quarantined humans Q(t), the hospitalized (or in self-isolation) humans I H (t), the COVID-19 infected humans who are in critical situation I C (t) and those individuals that are recovered from COVID-19 infection are describing through the recovered class, R(t). In the considered model, it is considered that the hospitalized class I H (t) can transmit the infection further. The biological description and respective numerical values of the parameters involved in the model are described in Table ( 1). The resulting COVID-19 mathematical model is formulated with the help of the following nonlinear system of classical differential equations:subjected to initial conditions (ICs):The fractional derivative in ABC sense is more generalized as the kernel involved in this operator is both non-local and non-singular. Moreover, this operator has the ability by capturing the memory effect and the crossover behavior exists in the processes of biology models. Keeping these facts in mind, in this section, we reformulate the COVID-19 mathematical model (5) with the help of non-integer operator in ABC case with the order ϑ ∈ (0, 1]. The resulting non-integer-order mathematical model shown below is obtained with the replacement of the ordinary derivative by the fractional-order ABC operator:subjected to the nonnegative ICs (6) . For simplicity, let us takeandWith the above suggestions, we can write the model in the following form:In the above COVID-19 compartmental model (8) , the ABC D ϑ t denotes the fractional operator in ABC sense.The estimation of model parameters is essential and realistic approach to predict and explore the dynamics of a disease. In this part of the paper, we utilized the well-known least square The following feasible region is well posed and invariant for the ABC fractional model (8), where its dynamics can be analyzed: The dynamics of the total population is obtained by adding all equations of the model (8);Hence;We have then,The application of Laplace transform gives the following:Thus, N (t) approaches /d whenever t approaches ∞ and ∀ t > 0, all the solutions possessing by the system with its appropriate initial values of the model variables in will remain in . So, the region is said to be positive invariant and will attract all the solutions in R 8 + .The obtaining of the equilibrium points is the important concept in dynamical system, by which the stability of the system can be analyzed through that equilibrium point. Typically, in most of the biological models formulated for humans dynamics possess two equilibrium points , that is, the disease-free and the endemic. In order to get the disease-free equilibrium DFE of the model (8), we show it by and obtained is as follows:Another important concept in the disease epidemiology is the computation of the basic reproduction number. It is also called a threshold quantity that characterized the disease whether it can be controlled or not. The value of the basic production number less or greater decides the disease-free and endemicity, respectively, in the population. There are many methods to compute the basic reproduction for the biological models but the one that using the researchers mostly in their work is the next-generation technique [30] . Commonly, the basic reproduction number is denoted by R 0 . So, by using the method, by letting, x = (E, I, I A , Q, I H , I C ) T , then, we haveThe basic reproduction number R 0 at the DFE can be achieved using ρ(FV −1 ) for our considered model (8):The stability of the model will be analyzed through the basic reproduction number R 0 .We present here the global dynamics of the fractional model (8) at the DFE D * * 0 by constructing the Lyapunov function. Proof We take the following suitable Lyapunov function in consideration to prove the desired result:The time fractional derivative of L(t) in ABC sense along the solution of model (8) is as follows:It is clear that if R 0 < 1, then ABC D ϑ t L(t) is negative. Thus, following the results stated in Theorem 2.1, it is concluded that the DFE D * * 0 is GAS in .In this part of the manuscript, we present the important feature of the ABC COVID-19 epidemic model known as the existence and uniqueness (EU) as described in (8) . For the desired EU result, the fixed-point theory is utilized. Initially, the COVID-19 epidemic model (8) is reformulated via the following initial value problem:In the above problem (11) In addition, the function defined as above G fulfills the Lipschitz criteria shown as follows:Further, the following theorem deals with the required EU result.where,, and ψ 2 (ϑ) = ϑProof Taking the integral in ABC sense upon the problem (11), we leads to the following nonlinear Volterra integral equation:To move further, we define J = (0, T ) and the corresponding operator G :In a result, Eq. (14) takes the following form:We denote the supremum norm upon J by . J defines as follows:C(J , R 8 ) along with the norm shown by . J constructed a Banach space. Moreover, the following inequality can be easily shown:with y ∈ C(J , R 8 ), G(t, ς) ∈ C(J 2 , R) such thatUtilizing Eq. (16), we lead to the following resultFurther, making use of Eqs. (12) , (18) as well as the triangular inequality, Eq. (20) gets the following form:Finally, we obtainwhere,The operator G will be a contraction if it holds the condition in Eq. (13) . Hence, the system (11) has a unique solution.In this section, we investigate the iterative scheme of the COVID-19 epidemic model (8) with ABC operator in order to present the graphical impact of various parameters and memory index on the disease incidence. An efficient numerical scheme based on the two-step Lagrange polynomial approximation [31] is used for this purpose. Firstly, a brief derivation of the iterative scheme is presented for the general Cauchy problem described in (11) and then it is implemented for the fractional COVID-19 model (8) in consideration.Applying the integral operator in ABC sense as defined in (3) on both sides of Cauchy problem (11) . In a result, we lead to the following integral equation:where ψ 1 (ϑ) and ψ 2 (ϑ) are defined as in previous section. Further, at t = t k+1 = (k + 1)h, we haveNow, with the help of polynomial interpolation approach, the vector function G(x, y(x)) is approximated using two-step Lagrange polynomial upon the interval [t l , t l+1 ]. Thus, we On further simplification of the integrals in (26) , the approximate solution for the problem in consideration is as follows: Thus, the following recursive expressions are obtained for the ABC fractional COVID-19 epidemic model described in (8): In this section, we present the simulation results of the fractional COVID-19 epidemic model in the ABC sense (8) . For this purpose, we utilize the iterative scheme developed in the previous section and values of the parameters are given in Table 1 . The time level taken into consideration in simulations is 300 days. The initial conditions are taken from [13] . Initially, we demonstrate the impact of memory index (the order of ABC operator ϑ) on the dynamics of different population classes in the model (8) . The dynamical behavior of susceptible individuals is described in Fig. 2 . We observed that for smaller values ϑ the susceptible population initially increased until becoming stable after 250 days. Similarly, the influence of various values of the fractional order ϑ on the dynamics of exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic infected people and quarantine, hospitalized and critically infected COVID-19 individuals is described in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively. The same behavior is observed for all population compartments as can be seen in 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The simulation results describing the dynamics of the recovered individuals for different memory index ϑ are shown in Fig. 9 . The recovered population decreases for smaller values of ϑ and then finally became stable after 250 days. Moreover, to analyze the impacts of quarantine rate δ on the dynamics of cumulative symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infective individuals we vary this parameter with different rates and depict the simulations. The resulting graphical interpretations are carried out for four values of ϑ. From Fig. 10 , one can observe that the symptomatic infected population is decreased significantly as we increase the quarantine rate δ to its baseline value. This interpretation is carried out for different values of ϑ as can be seen in Fig. 10(a)-(d) . Finally, the importance of variation in δ is analyzed in Fig. 11 .The epidemic models formulated using the non-integer-order operators provide comparatively deeper insights into the disease transmission dynamics. In addition, the fractional derivative based on generalized Mittag-Leffler-type kernel is capable of capturing the crossover features found in the various biological problems. In this study, we explored the transmission dynamics of the novel COVID-19 pandemic using a fractional-order mathematical model in Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo sense. Initially, we briefly reviewed the classical integer-order mathematical model for the COVID-19 dynamics. The classical model is then extended to fractional environment with the help of ABC operator. In order to obtain the fractional model, we replaced the classical derivative with the ABC operator in the model. Some of the basic mathematical properties of the ABC COVID-19 epidemic model are carried out. An efficient modified Adams-Bashforth is applied to obtain an iterative scheme of the proposed fractional model. Moreover, detailed simulation results of the ABC mathematical model are presented to demonstrate the importance of the memory index ϑ and model parameters on the transmission and control of COVID-19 infection. Thus, from the interpretation presented in this study, we conclude that the models constructed in non-integer orders exhibit many characteristics that cannot be observed in integer order and more interesting results can be obtained. The studied will be extended in the near future to obtain its solutions using other operators in fractional derivatives.","Ghana","abstract","2021-02-03",2

The severity and spreading of the disease are attributed to different types of human coronaviruses [1] . A wide range of symptoms can be caused by these types, similar to those of the infection by influenza such as in case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [2] . The SARS-CoV-2 was identified to be a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a size of ~30 kb that belongs to the genus Beta-coronaviruses with a crown due to the presence of spike glycoproteins on the viral envelope [3] . It can infect the throat, the lower respiratory tract and cause pneumonia in humans, although it seems that the symptoms are milder than those of the other SARS viruses [3] . To date, more than 59.81 million cases in total have been confirmed worldwide along with 1.41 million death, according to the World Meter [4] .Each SARS-CoV-2 protein has its relevant functional role, active site and subsequently, its own druggable target. These proteins as non-structural proteins (nsp) e.g. nsp 3, the papain-like protease (PLpro, nsp3 domain), main protease (M pro , nsp5), the RNA polymerase complex (nsp12-nsp7-nsp8), and other targets [5] .The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) is a cysteine protease engaged in many cleavage steps in the precursor polyproteins, and so it has a critical role in the viral life cycle.The active form of M pro is a homodimer containing two protomers composed of three domains each: domain I, domain II, and domain III, domains II and III are connected by a long loop region [6] [7] [8] .The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors in type II pneumocytes in the lungs triggers the cascade of an inflammatory response in the lower respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to SARS-CoV-1 regarding the biochemical interactions and pathogenesis [9] . The spike glycoprotein is composed of a transmembrane trimetric glycoprotein protruding from the viral surface; it determines the diversity of coronaviruses and host tropism [10] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins also contain a variable receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 functional subunit, which binds to the ACE-2 receptor and subsequently to the type 2 transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The interaction complex is cleaved by TMPRSS2, leading to ACE-2 and the activation of the spike glycoprotein (Figure 1) , facilitating viral entry into the target cell [11] [12] . Inside the host cell, viral RNA hijacks the host cell machinery, inducing it to produce RNA and proteins that contribute to the assembly of new viral particles.Natural bioactive products are considered to be one of the main and most diverse sources of a variety of therapeutic agents, providing more than 50 % of the available drugs which are in clinical use around the world [13] . Natural compounds with marine origin are of great importance as a source of novel and potentially life-saving bioactive secondary metabolites, since the marine environment represents 95% of the biosphere [14] . There are more than 40,000 different phytoplankton species, including 680 species of marine algae belonging to Rhodophyta, Phaeophyta, and Chlorophyta, commonly known as red, brown, and green seaweed, respectively, in addition to 71 mangrove plant species that were previously documented in the global marine biotope. They provide essential metabolites, including fatty acids, ionic trace minerals, vitamins, enzymes, bioflavonoids, amino acids, as well as other nutrients [13] , which possess several beneficial biological effects, such as anti-cancer, antibacterial, and antiviral activity even against resistant strains [13] . Various aquatic organisms were previously reported to provide a variety of unique lead compounds with antiviral activity [15] . The drug repurposing approach provides a quick tool to overcome the coronavirus pandemic. Most drugs subjected to repurposing with the aim of overcoming the COVID-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans are well known with a history of decades of clinical use in some cases [16] . Many valuable efforts in drug repurposing approaches have been recognized against SARS-CoV-2 utilizing cheminformatics and bioinformatics tool [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .Recently, Claudio N. C. et. al. addressed three drug discovery strategies in the frame structural and druggability studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. [5] These includes interfering proteins responsible for genome stability as non-structural proteins (nsp) 13 , blocking proofreading proteins as nsp 14, and targeting nsp15 responsible for viral replication and also the accumulation of cytokine-producing macrophages [23] . The repositioning of antiviral drugs that are already used against SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including remdesivir (an RNA polymerase inhibitor), umifenovir (a membrane fusion inhibitor targeting viral entry), and lopinavir/ritonavir (a drug combination targeting viral proteases) was reported and currently being considered in different combinations in a Phase IV clinical trial, as shown in Figure 1 [24] . Therefore, the drug repurposing approach could be a promising tool for the discovery of an effective therapy against this novel coronavirus. This oriented us to search for a COVID-19 remedy among the known marine metabolites through in-silico screening for their activity against the COVID-19 protease, polymerase, as well as spike glycoproteins and comparing their activity to already used anti-coronavirus drugs [25] [26] [27] [28] . This study included a screening for marine bioactive compounds with reported antiviral activities ( discussed for the highest-scoring compounds. Our attention was afterwards directed to the ligand-based drug repurposing tactic, which included shape alignment, rapid overlay chemical structures (ROCS), and structure-property relationship to examine the druggability of the prioritized marine compounds. These bioactive compounds were made publicly accessible for facilitating the conduction of further studies and the optimization by the scientific community [29] . The study was performed using the Openeye scientific software [30] (academic license 2020). The compounds were ranked and sorted according to their consensus score values.Docking results of marine compounds against M pro (PDB ID: 6lu7 [31] and 6y2f [32] ), spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6vsb [33]), and RNA polymerase (PDB ID: 6m71 [34] )were subsequently filtered based on their obtained consensus score values. The lowest consensus score value indicated the strongest binding to the receptor. The compounds shown in Figure 3 displayed an interaction to the targeted receptors that was stronger than that of standard ligands (N3, α-ketoamide for M pro , S ligand 1 for spike protein, and remdesivir for RNA polymerase, respectively, shown in Figure 1 ). These compounds were subjected to the acquisition of further details, as shown in Tables 2-5 .The top hits compounds, as shown in Figure 3 , were classified based on their chemical structures into 1) hydrocarbon-based (enyne, conjugated ene, or alkanes) compounds, Sceptrin was found to form HBs with key amino acids, including Glu166 and Gln189 as well as two HBs with Asn142. Moreover, sceptrin was observed to overlay with cocrystallized ligands through a strong binding interaction, as shown in Figure 4c .Thalassoilin A and thalassoilin B exhibited the same binding mode and pose through the formation of HB with Gly143, although both displayed different modes of interaction in case of thalassoilin C, as shown in Figure 4d . Snapshot of these three flavonoids indicated high similarity in case of ligand pose. Interestingly, moderate in vitro antiviral HCV protease activity with an IC50 value of 16 μM was displayed by these flavonoids [35] . This result suggests that the total extract of this metabolite has the potential to be further investigated. Agelifenin exhibited weak bonding and no overlay with standard ligands in comparison to agelifenin 1, which was assumed due to extra bromination Some compounds still exhibited a stronger binding mode with PDB ID 6y2f than in case of 6lu7. Debromo sceptrin showed unique and strong interaction with the receptor through the formation of a binding mode and poses like the co-crystallized ligand, as shown in Figure 5a . Debromo sceptrin (pink) and sceptrin (blue) showed no co-overlay, as shown in Figure 5b . Moreover, a complete overlay was identified for thalassoilin B and thalassoilin A, while thalassoilin C exhibited different binding modes and pose, as shown in Figure 5c . In contrast, an overlay was identified for all acyl indole alkaloids (topsentin derivatives), as shown in Figure 5d . Although more than 50 compounds showed stronger interaction than the standard ligand, most of them exhibited different binding modes or docked outside the created receptor.Compounds containing long-chain hydrocarbon parts behaved stickier in association with standard ligands. Figure 6a Remdesivir is an anti-polymerase drug prescribed for the alleviation of the COVID-19disease. Its docking mode showed its ability to form two HBs with Gln166 through its oxygen of the furanose ring (strong) and via the oxygen of the carbonyl functionality.Additionally, it participated in another HB with Asn79 through the phosphor atom, as shown in Figure 7a . Rapid Overlay Chemical Structure (ROCS) is a chemoinformatic screening technique utilized to perceive a similarity between chemical entities based on their three-dimensional shape [36] . The 3D shape structure displays good neighborhood behavior in which high a similarity in the shape reflects the high similarity in their biology in cases where a high similarity in biology is not reflected in a similarity in the structure. [37, 38] Shape similarity using the ROCS tool has different applications, including virtual screening, lead-hopping, molecular alignment, pose generation, as well as structural predictions [36] . The approach of this study was to identify molecules that can adopt shapes which are extraordinarily similar to reported drug candidates (the query), as shown in Figures 8-10 . Based on this concept, matches are created according to only the volume of overlapping of optimally aligned molecules, which are virtually independent from the atom types and the bonding patterns of the query.The ROCS study requires two files which must be in 3D format in case of most stable conformers generated by the Omega application in the Openeye software: a) a database file, which includes the collection of all compounds for this study; b) a query file, which includes the standard (reference) molecules or the lead compound used for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replications.The outputs from the ROCS analysis were 1) a shape counter, shape atoms, and color atom labels for the database set as well as the query compounds, as shown in Table 6 and Figures 8-10 . The shape was represented with a series of dotted lines around the molecule, while the color feature was shown as a filled colored circle representing the different kinds of chemical features; 2) the overlay, which was considered to be the alignment between the database as well as the molecules and the query, as visualized by the vROCS and VIDA applications; and 3) the set of scores were expressed in Tanimoto scores.The most important score is the Tanimoto Combo (TC) that includes both shape fit and color. This score had a value between 0 and 2 and was the score used for ranking the hit list.Based on previous docking results, the compounds were found to express multi target actions as most of them exhibited high scores with the different targets (main protease, RNA polymerase, or spike glycoprotein). In this regard, these marine candidates were selected to be the subjects of further cheminformatics studies. Compounds formed flavonoids nucleolus (thalassoilin B, thalassoilin C and subsequently thalassoilin A)showed higher TC scores (0.6800-0.4980) than PF-00835231 and α-ketomide (0.4960, 0.4950 respectively) in comparison with remdesivir, as shown in Table 6 . Table   6 . Concerning the comparative analysis of these compounds in association with drugs inhibiting the viral entry, such as umifenovir, the following marine compounds were analyzed: acylindole marine alkaloids (topsentin, bromotopsentin, 4,5-dihydro-6deoxybromotopsentin respectively), lornemides A, dragmacidin F, atomeric acid, thalassoilin C, macrolactin A, PF-00835231, and subsequently thalassoilin A, exhibiting a high TC score (0.946-0.685, respectively), as shown in Table 6 . All marine compounds exhibited TC score more than remdesivir in case of umifenovir as a query. As a result, flavonoid compounds and acyl indoles exhibited high 3D shape similarity in association with most of the known reported drug candidates. Shape color and volume shape of all compounds were illustrated in Figure 6 including supplementary data for their figures. Physicochemical properties determine the drug-likeness score in case of orally administered drugs. Drug candidates with high drug-likeness scores were previously reported to exhibit higher absorption and bioavailability in lower doses and show fewer drug-drug interaction warnings [39] . Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) calculations contribute to the determination of the failure of approximately 60% of all drugs in the different clinical trial phases. In this regard,ADMET is determined at the beginning of the drug discovery phases to eliminate molecules coming with poor ADMET properties from an earlier drug discovery pipeline to save research costs. As demonstrated in Table 7 and among the selected compounds, atomeric acid displayed the highest drug-likeness score (0.56), followed by flavonoids marine compounds (thalassoilin B, thalassoilin C, thalassoilin A) with a drug-likeness score in the range of 0.39-0.36. Atomeric acid had the highest lipophilicity value with a logP value of 5.86 and, therefore, low hydrophilicity, causing poor absorption or permeation. This result suggested us to semi-synthesize this compound in an ester form to optimize the lipophilicity to be a potential orally active compound. 4.

It has caused huge mortality and morbidity in numerous countries and as of August 10, 2020, 19 718 030 cases of infection and 728 013 deaths have been reported [3] . Almost all countries and territories across the world have COVID-19 cases. However, there are significant Asia and 895 696 cases in Africa [3] . Similarly, there are variations in the case fatality rate, which ranges from 2.6% in Eastern Mediterranean, 1.9% in Africa regions and 6.0% in Europe. At the global level, the rate is 3.7% [3] .In addition to clinical interventions, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that aim to interrupt or reduce transmission are essential to combat COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] . Major NPIs recommended at the international level to control COVID-19 have been to give priority to active and exhaustive detection for cases, immediate isolation of COVID-19 patients, carefully monitor contacts as well as mandatory quarantine for all inbound travelers from countries with significant transmission of COVID-19 [7] . Many countries also imposed general lockdowns to limit the increases in cases during critical phases, especially in relation to health system capacity.Tunisia stands out as an interesting example as a result of its relatively small burden from COVID-19 in the first few months of the global pandemic. Indeed, despite its close connections to Europe, Tunisia was relatively well protected from COVID-19, since its first case was imported from Italy on March 2, 2020. The number of cases slowly increased for a while, and a few clusters J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of infections eventually emerged [8] . However, large scale community transmission was avoided and until June 27, 2020, the opening date of the borders, only 1169 cases have been confirmed.There have been 50 deaths due to COVID-19 during this period [9].In this paper, we study the impact of specific NPIs -contact tracing, isolation and lockdown -in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases through applying an existing model. We then adapt this model to take into account specificities of the Tunisian population as well as its epidemiological status. The findings from this paper will help assess different possible control interventions, and mathematical models in relation to real world experience.Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, we use a stochastic transmission model based on a branching process or Bienaymé-Galton-Watson process to quantify the impact of contact tracing, compliance with isolation and lockdown in reducing the number of cases infected with COVID- 19 [10] . Under ideal circumstances due to effective isolation after the appearance of symptoms and full contact tracing, there would be no secondary infections.In this model, the number of potential secondary cases produced by each individual is drawn from a negative binomial distribution branching process. We estimated the level of overdispersion in COVID-19 transmission by using a mathematical model that is characterized by R0 and the overdispersion parameter k of a negative binomial branching process as described The simulated process begins with an infected person. After an incubation period, the person shows symptoms and is isolated at a time t. A person infected with the virus could potentially produce secondary infections, with some transmissions occurring before the case is isolated, either due to contact tracing or due to appearance of symptoms. Thus, in the model, a Using this model, we assumed varying scenarios according to several parameters, namely the initial number of cases, the reproduction rate (Rt), the percentage of traced contacts, and the efficacy of isolation.The Rt according to the literature is 4 for scenario 0 without interventions and 0.5 after application of NPIs [15] .Other assumptions about NPIs were made as specified in the paper. For the Rt after isolation, we assume that it is proportional to the percentage of people respecting the NPIs and of the effectiveness of isolation.We then adapt the model to take into account individual characteristics of the population linked to severity of infection. We include the following characteristics relevant to COVID-19: age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and smoking. The inclusion of the distribution of the population by age and the prevalence of having at least one chronic disease or smoker in the model is based on the proportion of each group in the general population and the probability of being infected in the observed serial in Tunisia [17, 18] .We then re-run the model with Tunisian population data and using the country's actual number of cases before lockdown and reproduction rate ( Figure 2 ). Once again, we run 1000 simulations with these parameters ( Table 2) . The results are presented in terms of relative reduction rates expressed as a percentage, with 95% confidence intervals. For the Tunisian case study, results were calculated for the entire population, by age groups, among those with chronic illnesses and smokers. All the data analysis was performed in the R software.The results of Model I show that at a baseline reproduction rate of 4, increasing the identification of contacts from 20% to 80% after the first 100 cases will reduce the number of infections of 40% (95% CI: 37%-42%) after two weeks and 52% (95% CI: 47%-57%) after one month. If 100% of contacts are identified, there will be a 71% (95% CI: 67%-75%) reduction in infections after one month.However, if the intervention aiming at increasing the percentage of identified contacts is implemented only after the first 1000 cases reported, there will only be a 12% (95% CI: 10%-13%) reduction in infections after two weeks and a 18% (95% CI:16%-19%) reduction after one month as the percentage of contact tracing increases from 20% to 80%.Compliance to isolation has an important impact in reducing infections. The results show that at a baseline reproduction rate of 4, increasing the level of compliance to isolation from 20% to 80% from the first 100 cases will reduce the number of infected cases by 42% (95% CI:31%-52%) after two weeks and 45% (95% CI:29%-61%) after one month. If isolation is respected fully, there will be a 86% (95% CI: 77%-94%) reduction in the number of infections.If an intervention to increase compliance with isolation is only implemented after the first 1000 infected cases, the reduction rate will be around 28% (95 CI:26%-30%) after two weeks and 42% (95% CI:39%-45%) after one month (Figure 4 ).A general lockdown has a positive impact on the reduction of virus transmission with different degrees depending on the time of implementation and the number of cases recorded at that time. A general lockdown will reduce the number of infections by 97% (95% CI:96%-98%) after the first 100 cases, by 93% (95% CI:91%-93%) after the first 1000 cases, and by 82% (95% CI:79%-85%) after 10000 cases. Tunisia is a Northern African country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. The population is 11,551,447 inhabitants in 2018, with a quarter aged under 15 and 8% aged 65 years and over. The median age is 32 years. Life expectancy at birth is 75.9 years. There were 68846 registered deaths in 2018 [17] .In terms of chronic illnesses, 28 To understand the epidemiological results in Tunisia, we adapted the model as described earlier to take into account the demographics, chronic illnesses and smoking behavior of the Tunisian population. We additionally applied the actual number of cases and Rt from Tunisia.The results of the impact modelling of the general lockdown is consistent with the numbers of infections reported in the country. Indeed, Tunisia implemented its general lockdown after 75 cases were confirmed, on March 22, 2020. In the model, implementation of lockdown at this early stage reduced the number of infected cases by 86% (95% CI:83%-89%) among the general population, 98% (95% CI:97%-99%) among people aged less than 24 years, 88% (95% CI:86%-90%) among people aged 65 years and more, and 92% (95% CI:90%-94%) among people aged 65 years and more, suffering of chronic illnesses (Table 3) . These latter figures are also strongly supported by the low number of COVID-19 deaths in Tunisia.The international community is facing an unprecedented global crisis with the fast spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to an ever-growing number of countries and peoples. The epidemic is all the more worrying as there is no vaccine or treatment yet. In order to inform decision making it is important to compare strategies to control the epidemic, reduce mortality and limit pressure on the health system. A major challenge during outbreaks is the design of appropriate control interventions.Mathematical models are increasingly used to guide decision-making and to evaluate interventions. The results of our mathematical modeling have been very informative. They allowed us to conclude that rigorous contact tracing, screening of suspected cases, effective early isolation and a general lockdown have been essential to reduce the number of infections and to control the epidemic.The results of this modelling clearly show that the earlier effective contact tracing is implemented, the higher the reduction in new infections. The impact of an increase in percentage of contacts identified from 20% to 80% is around three times higher when the intervention is initiated with the first 100 cases compared to a latter intervention with the first 1000 cases.Similarly, higher compliance to isolation after the first 100 reported cases is two times more efficient in terms of reducing infections than if this intervention is implemented after the first 1000 reported cases.These results are supported by evidence from other countries. Indeed, the impact of contact tracing on COVID-19 has been proven in previous studies [20, 21] . Similarly, international evidence shows that isolation of cases and precautionary self-isolation of contacts are key J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f measures to bend the epidemic curve downwards [22] . They are key WHO recommendations, along with early diagnosis. This combination of interventions has been applied by most countries to control COVID-19 epidemic and prevent a large fraction of possible transmission chains [23] . Furthermore, our model shows that lockdown in Tunisia has had a critical impact on the transmission of the virus. Notably the number of infections among elderly people with chronic diseases has been reduced by over 90% due to lockdown, inducing a limited number of deaths. This is also supported by the evidence from other countries. Analysis of mortality data in the Chinese province of Hubei suggests that lockdown prevented the deaths of thousands of people [24] . And a more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19 [25] . Similarly, France has been heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and went into lockdown on the 17 March 2020. The lockdown resulted in a 77% (95% CI: 76-78) reduction in transmission [26] .Nonetheless, the timing of interventions, including a general lockdown is very critical. The timing of lockdown measures may explain differences in the capacity to contain cases between different countries [27] . For example, Italy implemented a lockdown on March the 11 th when it had an incidence rate of 11.71 cases per 10,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 0.11 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants [28, 29] . In contrast, Tunisia implemented its general lockdown after only 75 reported cases were confirmed (0.65/100 000 habitants), on March 22, 2020.The population's compliance to measures imposed by authorities is also critical in determining impact. In Tunisia's case, with the exception of some lapses, the population largely adhered to the measures put in place by the authorities during the first wave of the epidemic. This is supported by the Rt remaining low in almost all regions of the country and only a slight J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f increase in the cumulative number of cases from 1025 until the lifting of lockdown on May 4 [16, 30] .A strong limitation of this paper is that other effects of lockdown, including the effects on the non-COVID health situation, as mental health, and domestic violence were not included in the model. The huge social and economic impact of lockdown was not studied in this modelling study but have been extensively documented elsewhere [31] . As such the decision to impose general lockdown needs to be carefully considered by authorities and mitigation strategies to reduce impact on vulnerable groups, including poor women and children will be critical.Since May 4, Tunisia has embarked on a new phase in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic: progressive and targeted lifting of the general lockdown. Borders have been reopened to travelers since June 27, bringing an increase in the number of new cases. Initially new infections were mostly imported, however after 30 July local infections started exceeding imported infections but transmissions chains were still identifiable with clusters emerging from events like weddings or in some businesses [32] . Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated further and with more than 30000 new infections in the last 4 weeks (November 2020) and 227 infections per 100000 inhabitants in the last 2 weeks, Tunisia is currently facing an extremely challenging situation of COVID-19, with an imminent risk of saturating the health system's capacity. Authorities have imposed NPIs in this second phase too, however, stricter measures were applied much later than in the first phase when compared to numbers of cases.Additionally, the population's compliance to measures has been much lower this time around, partially due to the Tunisia's relatively outcomes during the first phase which has lowered people's perception of the risk from COVID good -19. Like in other countries, another national lockdown is considered untenable due to the huge social and economic impacts. As such, Tunisia faces a precarious situation, which will hopefully be contained through continuous strengthening of the health system response as well as stricter measures such as localized nighttime curfews that have now been imposed in some parts of the country [33] .

Meanwhile, the GH clade contains spike D614G plus NS3-Q57H amino acid substitutions. The O clade contains viral sequences that do not cope with any of above-mentioned criteria (Table 1) . Currently, G, GH, GV and GR are the major clades and account for more than 91% of all global SARS-CoV-2 sequenced genomes (GISAID sequence database).The GISAID clades are further divided into two major lineages: A and B. A numerical value of the descendants was given to sub-lineages with a maximum of three sublevels (ex. A.1.1.1). This nomenclature is known as the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (Pangolin), which is supported by a freely-available website (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/) (Rambaut et al., 2020a) . open source tracking introduced a new nomenclature system, in which a novel clade is introduced when the frequency of circulation reaches approximately 20% for worldwide strains (Hadfield et al., 2018) . Five clades were identified as being globally widespread: 19A (the root clade that spread in China then to the rest of Asia), 19B (the ancestor of the December 2019 Wuhan strain), and clades 20A, 20B and 20C. Clade 20A emerged due to D614G amino acid substitution in the spike glycoprotein during the European outbreak in February 2020. The latter spread globally during late February, from which clades 20B and 20C emerged in Europe and North America, respectively. All three clades (20A, 20B and 20C) belong to the GISAID G clade and harbour the D614G mutation in the spike (Korber et al., 2020) . Two variants of concern emerged. The Nextstrain classification was modified to include labels correspond to an emerging variant and the prominent spike mutation and currently new clades 20D, 20E, 20F, 20G, 20H/501Y.V2, and 20I/501Y.V1 have been added (Bedford et al., 2021) as shown in Table 2 .The SARS-CoV-2, VUI 202012/01 variant under investigation (which has been detected in the UK) belongs to 20B, clade GR, lineage B.1.1.7. and will latterly be referred to as the Variant of Concern (VOC) . It has spread to many countries around the world, in Africa (Gambia, Mayotte and Nigeria), (T716I, S982A, D1118) (Rambaut et al., 2020b) . Another VOC also emerged in South Africa that possesses 80A, 215G, 484K, 501Y, and 701V amino acid residues in the spike protein. It spread to Africa (Botswana, Ghana, Kenya Mayotte, Mozambique) Asia, (Bangaladish, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and United Arab of Emirates), Australia ( Asutralia and New Zealand), Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Filand , France, Germany, Irland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom), North and Central America (Canada, USA, Panama). These mutations developed unexpectedly, and the possible explanations for this are as follows: i) a prolonged infection among patients with reduced immunocompetence (Choi et al., 2020; McCarthy et al., 2020) , ii) increased mutation rate as a consequence of immune pressure during reinfection, iii) adaptation of the virus in a susceptible animal then transferring infection back to humans, as was detected in mink in Denmark (deletion 69-70 and Y453F) (Laussauniere et al., 2020). Some mutations can provide a selective advantage for the virus, including increased transmissibility, increased receptor binding affinity or providing the virus with the capacity to evade the host immune responsiveness or by simply altering neutralising epitopes. An earlier D614G variant increased the viral cellular infectivity but did not alter the clinical outcome of the disease (Volz et al., 2020 ). An attenuated SARS-CoV-2 phenotype was hypothesised based on 382 nucleotide deletions in SARS-CoV-2 Singapore strains . Such deletions resulted in the removal of the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of the ORF8 with subsequent assumption of reduced fitness of virus replication (Muth et al., 2018) . Interestingly, a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f similar deletion phenotype was detected in SARS-CoV at the end of the 2003 outbreak (Chinese-SARS-Molecular-Epidemiology-Consortium, 2004) . In addition, an isolate with 81 nucleotide deletions with subsequent deletions of 27 amino acids in the ORF7a was also reported in Arizona, USA (Holland et al., 2020) ; however, such variants have since disappeared.The D614G amino acid substitution was found in a B-cell epitope (Koyama et al., 2020) . The majority of the SARS-CoV-2 strains with D614G mutation also demonstrated P4715L and P323L amino acid substitutions in ORF1ab and RdRp, respectively. Spike D614G mutation in G, GR, and GH clades is suggested to be linked to higher viral loads (Bhattacharyya et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020) , while rapidly-spreading strains were linked to the presence of the Nsp12 P322L (Pachetti et al., 2020) . The GR clade is more prevalent among patients with severe disease manifestations (Korber et al., 2020) . Conversely, Grubaugh et al. doubt the possibility of a clear role for the D614G mutation based on currently available data, and that extensive experimental and epidemiological studies should be conducted to determine the impact of D614G on the current epidemic (Grubaugh et al., 2020) .Currently, there is no information on the impact of VUI 202012/01 mutations on the virus binding to the target cells, its transmissibility, disease severity, and the possible impact on virus neutralisation by antibodies from vaccinated and/or infected patients.It is assumed that N501Y increases the binding affinity to ACE2 (Starr et al., 2020) , and it has been found to increase both virulence and infectivity in experimentally-infected mice (Gu et al., 2020) . Although each of N501Y and P681H have been detected previously in SARS-CoV-2, it is the first time these have concurrently been present in the same virus. The VUI 202012/01 virus strain possesses the ORF8 Q27stop mutation that shortens the ORF8 protein with subsequent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f loss of function. However, ORF8 deletion was found to have only a slight effect on virus replication (Gamage et al., 2020) .It is well known that protection against coronaviruses depends on the development of Coronaviruses are subjected to high-frequency recombination events. Such recombination was responsible for virus evolution as reported in SARS-CoV (Hon et al., 2008) , MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2014) and was also speculated to occur due to a recombination event of the RBD from Malayan pangolin coronavirus (Wong et al., 2020) . Most SARSr-CoV viruses do not use ACE2; however, there is a possibility of acquiring such ability either by cumulative mutations or natural recombination with subsequent emergence of new SARSr-CoVs able to infect humans (Fan et al., 2019) . Accordingly, experimental chimeric SARS coronaviruses were successfully synthesised. This was achieved using a bat-SCoV genome and with the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain (Becker et al., 2008) BtCoV HKU5 containing the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein (BtCoV HKU5-SE) (Agnihothram et al., 2014) in addition to a chimeric virus of murine adapted SARS-CoV backbone containing SHC014 spike bat coronavirus (Menachery et al., 2015) . The latter was found to replicate efficiently without prior adaptation in both mice and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f human airway cultures. Such findings confirmed the possibility of natural recombination in the emergence of potential pathogens to humans and denoted the potential risk of constructing chimeric viruses based on natural circulating betacoronavirus strains since increased virulence to humans could not be excluded (Menachery et al., 2015) .All patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 possess detectable IgG + RBD-specific plasma antibodies and neutralising plasma for ~3 months (Isho et al., 2020; Marklund et al., 2020; Wajnberg et al., 2020) . Seroconversion begins after 7 days in 50% of symptomatic patients and after 14 days in all patients (Lan et al., 2020; Wölfel et al., 2020a; Wölfel et al., 2020b) . However, some mildly infected patients do not show detectable IgG (Lou et al., 2020; Okba et al., 2020) . This conflicting finding was explained by how low the sensitivity of the used technique was and the difference in the targeted antigen (Long et al., 2020; Marklund et al., 2020; Wajnberg et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020a) . This was confirmed by the fact that all patients with undetectable IgG showed evidence of the presence of neutralising antibodies using neutralisation assay (Marklund et al., 2020) .The COVID-19 severity is correlated to the IgG antibody titers since antibody titers were found to be higher in severe cases in comparison to mild ones Zhao et al., 2020) .protective antiviral functions after 3 months of exposure (Rodda et al., 2020) . IgM+ memory Bcells dominated in the first 20 days followed by a gradual increase in IgG1+ memory B cells . The latter cells express CD27 and positively correlate with the T follicular helper (Tfh) cell number that suggest high robustness . In addition, memory B cells showed upregulation of CD80, CD180 and TACI that assumed activation upon re-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f exposure to the antigen (Berkowska et al., 2011; Berkowska et al., 2015) . It was assumed that B cell memory is durable for up to 8 months, which would probably be protective upon reinfection.Accordingly, re-infection is proposed to be milder than the first exposure .Increased neutralising antibodies, IgG + classical memory B cells, Tfh, CD4 + memory T-cells, and IFN-γ CD8 + T cells were detected. The IgA + against the receptor binding domain sharply declined after 3 months, which denotes that short-lived plasmablasts IgA (Rodda et al., 2020) , SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells, and predominant IgG+ B cells with lower frequencies of cells expressing IgM and IgA were detected (Dan et al., 2020; Hartley et al., 2020; Juno et al., 2020; Rodda et al., 2020) . Based on such findings, memory B cells are expected to respond rapidly to SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure, thus generating neutralising antibodies that will provide protection (or at least guard against a severe form of the disease).In-vitro stimulation of CD4 + memory T cells from SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals resulted in a rapid expression of Th1-and Th17-cytokines and upregulation of both ICOS and CD40L on CXCR5 + cells (Rodda et al., 2020) .It has been found that the SARS-CoV-2 antibody level declines over time (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2020) , which might reflect a retrenchment of immune responsiveness.Meanwhile, mild COVID-19 induces an expanded population of memory B cells and CD4+ memory T cells. However, different levels of severity of COVID-19 could result in different levels of immune memory and subsequent immune protection (Rodda et al., 2020) . Rare cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were detected in different countries. It is known that protection correlates with homologous reinfection and antibody titers. To date, no major change in the spike protein was detected based on the GISAID sequence database. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was suggested to be milder (Abu-Raddad et al., 2020; . Three previously-exposed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f individuals with neutralising antibodies did not get sick when exposed to reinfection (Addetia et al., 2020) . Moreover, in an overnight camp, a previous seropositive attendee was not infected, while non-previously infected persons tested positive (Pray et al., 2020) . However, severe infections were also detected in some cases following re-infection (Selvaraj et al., 2020; Tillett et al., 2020; . A severe form of the disease in re-infected cases is unclear. It could be due to a huge viral load in the second attack of infection (Guallar et al., 2020) , infection by a more virulent strain, or the presence of poorly neutralising or non-neutralising antibodies being a progenitor for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (Du et al., 2016; Karthik et al., 2020; Khandia et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2014) . This phenomenon was documented in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Du et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014) , where SARS-CoV was found to be able to infect immune cells that lack the ACE-2 receptor through antibody dependent entry (Jaume et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014) . Further, ADE was detected in the presence of diluted anti-spike protein antibodies, but not with anti-nucleoprotein antibodies (Wang et al., 2014) . Interestingly, mAbs targeting the SARS-CoV spike epitopes (other than RBD epitopes) can lead to ADE (Wang et al., 2016) . Similarly, non-neutralising antibodies against MERS-CoV led to ADE experimentally in rabbits (Houser et al., 2017) . Although ADE was recorded in related viruses of SARS-CoV-2, using an animal model for human infection does not accurately reflect immunopathogenesis in humans. To date, there is no evidence that ADE occurs or even induces a serious effect in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the pathogenesis of a model virus strain in animals does not fully reflect human infection because most viruses are highly species-specific (Arvin et al., 2020) . Plasma therapy using a passive transfer of antibodies from the recovered patients was successfully used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and proved to increase the survival rate and reduce the disease severity as reviewed in (Alghamdi and Abdel-Moneim, 2020) , in which it J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was also reported with both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections (Cheng et al., 2005; Ko et al., 2018; Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015) .Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral replication probably by binding to RdRp (Eweas et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020), M and nsp14 (Eweas et al., 2021) . It is of interest that M and S as well as M and N interactions are critical for the assembly of viral proteins (Siu et al., 2008) . Remdesivir also possesses a high affinity to TMPRSS2 and An initial dose of 200 mg followed by a daily dose of 100 mg for 4 days is the current recommended regimen for treatment of children (> 12 years old and ≥40 kg). A single dose of 5 mg/kg in the first day, followed by daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg is the recommended regimen for treatment of children (≥3.5 kg to <40kg). The drug is given by intravenous infusion for a period of between 30 and 120 min. This treatment could be extended for an additional 5 days if there is no improvement in the treated patients. Liver injury, nausea, rash, and allergic hypersensitive reactions are among the detected side effects of Veklury (FDA, 2020b). An NIH-sponsored clinical trial revealed that remdesivir shortened the time of recovery , J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f however, a WHO SOLIDARITY trial showed that remdesivir showed neither a significant reduction in the duration of hospitalization or mortality (Pan et al., 2021) .On 16 th February, 2020, favipiravir (T-705), a viral RNA polymerase inhibitor, was approved for marketing in Zhejiang Province, China (National-Health-Commission-of-the-People's-Republicof-China, 2020). To date, SARS-CoV-2 has been tested against five FDA-approved drugs: chloroquine phosphate (an old antimalarial drug), ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide and nafamostat, in addition to two viral RNA polymerase inhibitors: remdesivir (GS-5734) andfavipiravir. Both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be more effective than the other drugs following in vitro evaluation .Ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, was found to possess antiviral activity against dengue virus and was also found to possess potent in-vitro anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Caly et al., 2020) . It is assumed to play a role in preventing viral entry since it interacts with both the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the human ACE-2 receptor (Eweas et al., 2021; Lehrer and Rheinstein, 2020) as well as TMPRSS2 (Eweas et al., 2021; Glowacka et al., 2011) . It also binds efficiently to SARS-CoV-2 nsp14, N and M proteins with a potential role in alleviating the efficiency of virus replication and assembly (Eweas et al., 2021) and N nuclear import that is mediated by IMPα/β1 (Caly et al., 2020; Rowland et al., 2005; Tay et al., 2013; Timani et al., 2005; Wagstaff et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2020) . It is likely that it binds to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro with subsequent inhibition of post-translational cleavage of viral polyproteins (Eweas et al., 2021) .Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine interfere with virus entry (by blocking the terminal glycosylation of ACE-2), and inhibit the post-entry mechanism through alkalinisation of the endosome pH (Vincent et al., 2005) . They also inhibit the biosynthesis of sialic acid (Vincent et prophylaxis (Barnabas et al., 2020; Boulware et al., 2020; Rajasingham et al., 2020) . In addition, many retrospective observational studies deny its value in COVID-19 treatment (Geleris et al., 2020; Magagnoli et al., 2020; Rosenberg et al., 2020) and also in some prospective clinical trials (Cavalcanti et al., 2020; Horby et al., 2020) . However, more than 100 clinical trials conducted on the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are still ongoing ; thus, it may be too early to determine conclusively the value of such drugs.Camostat mesylate (a serine protease inhibitor) inhibits TMPRSS2 and may be a candidate drug for treating SARS-CoV-2 since it was proved to inhibit SARS-CoV in BALB/c mice (Zhou et al., 2015) . In a ddition, bromhexine hydrochloride (a mucolytic cough suppressant) is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and could also be used for treatment, since it was found to be effective for both influenza viruses and coronaviruses (Lucas et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2017) . More recently, a severe COVID-19 patient recovered following treatment with a soluble recombinant human ACE-2. After treatment, the virus disappeared from the patient and there was a significant decline of different cytokines (Zoufaly et al., 2020) . EIDD-2801 is a ribonucleoside analogue On 21 st November 2020, the FDA provided an EUA for using a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab, which are monoclonal antibody therapies (MABs) against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. It is administered by intravenous infusion for mild-to-moderate (but not severe) COVID-19 cases (12 years of age or ≥ 40kg) and to patients at risk of developing severe COVID-19, including patients ≥65 years old or those suffering from chronic diseases. It was proven that the combined MAB therapy improved the clinical outcomes within 28 days post-treatment. It is not recommended for COVID-19 patients who are hospitalised and in need of high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Treatment among such patients might be accompanied by deterioration of the disease conditions for those patients (FDA, 2020a).To date, five vaccines have been licenced, as follows: i) two RNA vaccines: BNT162b2 (Pfizer and BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna); ii) two inactivated vaccines (SinoPharm and Bharat Biotech); and iii) a non-replicating adenovirus vector vaccine (AstraZenca). The BNT162b2 from Pfizer and BioNTech was the first authorised candidate vaccine (mRNA in lipid nanoparticles) with 95% efficacy (Polack et al., 2020) , then the SinoPharm inactivated vaccine, followed by Moderna (mRNA-1273) that demonstrated 94.1% vaccine efficacy , and more recently the AstraZenca adenovirus vaccine that demonstrated 90% vaccine efficiency together with the COVAXIN from Bharat Biotech (the first indigenous vaccine). The The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is encapcidated into a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) (Mulligan et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2020) . The mRNA-1273 was developed by Moderna/NIAID and BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 were developed by BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer and are among the potential RNA vaccines . Another effective vaccine is the subunit vaccine containing recombinant purified spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coformulated with Matrix-M1 adjuvant (Novavax) (VAC-LSTM, 2020). In terms of immunogenicity, adjuvanted, protein-based vaccines are followed by mRNA vaccines then J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ChAdOx1-based vaccines, and AdV5-based vaccines then the inactivated seem to rank the lowest. Post-vaccine side effects are highest for vectored vaccines and lowest for inactivated and protein-based vaccines and mRNA vaccines (Krammer, 2020).A live attenuated vaccine is considered among the best for human viruses with many successful models including for poliovirus, measles, rubella, mumps, and yellow fever. The fact that it simulates natural infection without causing the disease causes it to induce mucosal, humoral and cell-mediated immune responsiveness against the virus. However, this type of vaccine requires a long time for development and to ensure vaccine efficacy and safety. Currently, three SARS-CoV-2 live attenuated vaccines (two from India and one from Turkey) currently exist. Two are in pre-clinical testing while Codagenix/Serum institute of India is in clinical phase I (VAC-LSTM, 2020).Due to the urgent need for a potent vaccine against COVID-19, an acceleration in advancing vaccine development exists. However, the adoption of novel human vaccines without previous licensed models may lead to uncertainties regarding long-term safety issues. Meanwhile, most vaccine trials have not been conducted on the most vulnerable subjects, which includes the elderly, pregnant women, and children. The role of different vaccines on the autoinflammatory responses such as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) has not been examined (Koirala et al., 2020) .Like ADE, vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) has been detected in preclinical trials of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines when associated with low neutralising antibodies (Graham, 2020; Haynes et al., 2020) . However, this was not detected with the SARS-CoV-2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine , although, monitoring of the possible VAED risk J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f needs to be carefully monitored. However, an important pending issue is the longevity of the neutralising antibodies and protective memory immune responsiveness. It is apt to mention that neutralising antibodies persisted for 3 months after the second booster dose of vaccine . The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 2 billion doses of an effective vaccine will be available by end of 2021; however, since the world population is 7.7 billion, there will not be enough vaccines to accommodate the world's entire population. A priority list of populations who are at highest risk of infection/spread and high fatality in need of vaccination has been developed by the WHO, and healthcare workers, the elderly population above 60 years of age and people younger than 60 years who have comorbidities have been given the highest priority in early vaccination campaigns.Lessons from the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003 were not heeded, the most important being to never allow free will to challenge nature. Although, there is no report of foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2, transmission is assumed to be introduced by close animal-to-human contact or by the virus being inoculated through skin injuries that probably occur during butchering of such animals for food consumption. It is speculated that consumption Whether the immune pressure in the absence of sufficient herd immunity will increase the mutation rate or evolution of immune-escape variants is not known. The successful and rapid development of mRNA based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be helpful to control other viruses (e.g. Ebola, Dengue).Although nobody can predict the future course of the SARS-CoV-2, nonetheless, some facts about this emerging virus are now clear. In the spirit of strong implementation of the One Health concept, the restriction and even the ban of both live wild animal markets and experimental induction of recombination studies on SARSr-CoV are highly recommended. Although remdesivir is the current FDA approved antiviral drug for treatment COVID-19, however, a doubt raised about its significance in reducing the duration of hospitalization or mortality rate. This finding, although requires more confirmation, highlights the need of developing potential antivirals against the SARS-CoV-2.A second wave of the disease has now been recorded worldwide, with a tremendous increase in the number of COVID-19 patients over recent months, which reflects the long-term battle with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19. Upregulation of both memory B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells upon reexposure to the SARS-CoV-2 were recorded. Accordingly, re-infection is proposed to be milder than the first exposure. Meanwhile, the sharp decline of IgA + after 3 months might be responsible for the re-infection in previously infected patients and probably vaccinees.

Since then, human -to-human transmission rates across the world has soared dramatically making it one of the most challenging global health problems. On 30 January 2020, the World health organization considered COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern and announced the pandemic threat in March 11,2020 [1, 2] . On May 15, 2020, 4,553,394 confirmed cases of covid-19 were identified, worldwide, with death rate of 6.7 and 37.7% of recovery [3] .In Tunisia, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on March 2, 2020. Since then, several measures have been taken to break the spread of the epidemic among the population. These steps include the successive screening at point of entry, 14 days isolation of travelers returning from risk areas, closure of school and university facilities, ban of sports and cultural events, borders closure, curfew and finally, a national lockdown was announced on March 22, 2020 [4] . On May 8, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 1030 [5] .Several studies have addressed clinical, radiological and biological issues in COVID-19 patients [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The clinical spectrum is large and ranges from asymptomatic or mild forms, accounting for about 80%, to cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome that may lead to intensive care or death [11] .However, we note a scarcity of data on prognostic factors associated with a better outcome and recovery. Since an early recovery reduces the shedding and spread of the virus, identifying recovery prognostic factors may improve our understanding of the dynamics of transmission and foster the control of the epidemic [12] .The present study aims to estimate recovery time and identify related prognostic factors among Tunisian infected people with COVID-19.This was a retrospective nationwide cohort study. It included all confirmed COVID 19 cases listed among the database of the national observatory of new and emerging diseases (ONMNE), which is the national center for disease control and surveillance, from March 2 to May 8, 2020.A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as any person, whether symptomatic or not, with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).From March 2, 2020, when the first case was reported, all confirmed cases has been consistently and timely reported by the laboratory to the national observatory for new and emerging diseases (ONMNE).All positive cases were isolated for at least 14 days, at home or in dedicated COVID-19 centers, and were not released until they got two negative laboratory test results. Hospitalization was only indicated for the serious cases requiring a respiratory assistance or special care. A questionnaire was administered by a team of trained physicians, who were responsible to ensure the followup of all confirmed cases by phone calls. This questionnaire included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, isolation setting, symptoms and treatment. The recovery statement was based on laboratory data. For asymptomatic patients, the first recovery testing was scheduled for the last day of the isolation period. For symptomatic patients, the first recovery testing was done 3 days after the symptoms disappearance and at least 7 days after onset of symptoms. In both situation, the second recovery testing was done 24 to 48 h after the first negative sample. If the first recovery test was still positive, then the second recovery test was done 7 days later.The formal criteria for recovery was defined by two successive negative RT-PCR control specimen and recovery time was defined as the period from the date of symptoms onset to the date of a second negative test. (when patients got positive RT-PCR result following false negative result, it was considered as non-effective negative result in our study). After recovery statement, home auto-isolation was advised.The laboratory testing for SARS by RT-PCR was the laboratory method of reference to confirm cases. Charles Nicolle hospital laboratory which is the national influenzae World Health Organisation (WHO) collaborating laboratory was the reference laboratory at national level. It received all the specimens during the first period of outbreak investigation. Later on, other laboratories performing SARS specific PCR tests were invloved.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens was performed at the National Reference Laboratory. RNA was extracted from NP swabs using the GXT NA extraction kit (HainlifescienceGmbh, Nehren, Germany) or the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen®, Courtaboeuf, France) following the manufacturers' instructions. For SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, the in-house RT-PCR was used according to the Hong Kong protocol (based on two monoplex assays: the N gene RT-PCR as a screening assay and the Orf1b assay as a confirmatory one). With this assay, a positive COVID-19 result is determined when both targets (N and Orf1ab) reach a defined cycle threshold (Ct) of less than 40 [13] .Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17.0 software. Data were expressed as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate for continuous variables. The median time to recovery was estimated by Kaplan-Meir Methods. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate factors influencing the recovery time, with the hazards ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05.A total of 1030 patients tested positive for COVID 19 disease were collected between March 2 and May 8, 2020. The mean age was 43.2 years ±18.2, and 526 (51.1%) were female. Ninety seven percent of patients were Tunisians (Table 1 ) and quarter of infections were imported, mainly from France or Turkey. One hundred and seventy three patients (17.8%) were admitted to the hospital, most of them in a non-intensive care department and only 47 in an intensive care unit (ICU). Sixty six patients (38.2%) received an hydroxy-chloroquine treatment (HCQ). Half of the cases received the HCQ in a hospital setting and the others received it either from a private doctor or as self-medication. Patients who did not require care have been self-isolated at home (55.5%) or in dedicated centers for positive cases (44.5%). One hundred and forty-one patients were healthcare professionals. The source of contamination was the healthcare environment in half of the cases.Seventy five percent of patients had symptoms. The most common symptoms were fatigue, cough and fever, which occurred respectively in 51.6, 51.3 and 48.3% of symptomatic patients. Symptoms such as headache, anosmia and digestive signs were also common in those patients ( Table 2) .As of May 8, 2020, a total of 634 (61.6%) patients were recovered, 45 (4.4%) patients were dead and 351 (34.0%) were still being followed up.Survival analysis was used to analyze the prognostic factors of the disease in patients with COVID-19. It showed that the median duration of illness was estimated to be 31 days (95%Confidence Interval [CI]: [29] [30] [31] [32] ) (Fig. 1) . In univariate analysis, older age (Fig. 2) , imported cases and being symptomatic (Fig. 3) were associated with a longer duration of illness. Whereas, being a healthcare worker (Table 3 ).The main result of our study was the long duration of the disease. It took 31 days from the symptoms onset date, for symptomatic patients, or the laboratory confirmation date, for asymptomatic patients, until the second negative sample. Our national cohort reached 1030 COVID-19 infected patients. It is a relatively young population with most patients under 55 years of age. In the literature, a mean age between 48 and 55 years was reported [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] . For the gender, there was no predominance of men or women. The number of imported cases was higher than the number of native cases until 18th March, 2020. The trend reversal (native cases vs imported cases) was evident from 03/21/2020 which implied an increase in horizontal transmission [5] .Most of cases were mild as evidenced by relatively low ICU admissions and a high number of asymptomatic patients with mild symptoms that do not require treatment in a hospital structure. In fact, the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus severe and fatal cases for COVID-19 infection is currently still unknown. According to a Chinese report publishing all confirmed, suspected, and asymptomatic cases in China, 80% of infections were mild and could recover at home [18] . Concerning clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease, the common symptoms reported by symptomatic patients were cough, fatigue and fever in nearly half of cases and headache in 35% of cases, which was consistent with general symptoms of viral infection. Similar symptoms were described in several case series [6, 15, 19] . One out of three symptomatic patients reported loss of smell and/or taste. This type of disturbance was widely reported in the literature specially among patients with mild and moderate forms of coronavirus disease [20, 21] . A multicenter European study showed that 85.6 and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions [22] .The median duration of illness was estimated to be 31 days counting from the day of onset symptoms for symptomatic patients and from confirmation date for asymptomatic patients. This estimation for illness duration was long. In a recent Singapore study, similar results were recorded. It indicated that by day 15 from onset of illness, only 30% of all COVID-19 patients were PCR-negative by nasopharyngeal swab; this rose to 95% by day 33 [23] . According to these results, the duration of viral shedding may extend to a month and sometimes longer for a small group of patients. Current guideline suggested two consecutive negative RT-PCR test results is one of the criteria for hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation. However, a high false negative rate of viral test was reported and some patients experienced a ""turn positive"" of nucleic acid detection by RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 after two consecutive negative results, which may be related to the false negative of RT-PCR test and prolonged nucleic acid conversion [24, 25] . The Singapore study indicates also that viable virus was not found after the second week of illness despite the persistence of PCR detection of RNA [23] . It is, then, important to note that traces of virus detected by RT-PCR were not necessarily correlated with the ability of transmission.In addition, a recent Canadian study demonstrate that infectivity as defined by growth cell culture were most likely between days one and five [26] . These data indicate that even viral RNA detection may persist in some patients, such persistent RNA detection represent non-viable virus and such patients are non-infectious [23] . These findings are consistent with the new WHO recommendations for discontinue transmission-based precautions (including isolation) and release from the COVID-19 care pathway with 10 days after symptom onset, plus at least 3 days without symptoms for symptomatic patients and 10 days after test positive for asymptomatic patients [27] . These new recommendations should be taken in a count to adapt strategy to discontinue isolation of COVID-19 patients in our country.Cox regression model showed that younger patients recover faster compared to elderly patients. Similar findings were also reported in literature [28, 29] . In fact, many studies found a high proportion of severe cases and fatality rate among elderly patients with COVID-19 [16, [30] [31] [32] [33] .Based on the result of this study, being a healthcare worker was showed to be significantly associated to a lower median time to viral clearance after onset of symptoms. This finding could be explained by the fact that the healthcare workers' monitoring and control was different from that of other COVID-19 patients and that the deadlines for carrying out the control samples were shorter. Indeed, the COVID-19 monitoring and control protocol adopted by the Tunisian health authorities was inspired from the recovery criteria of the European center for disease prevention and control (ECDC) documents [34] . This protocol consists in carrying out a control sample for asymptomatic patients after 14 days from the date of confirmation. For symptomatic ones, if the fever or any other signs persist beyond 14 days, the control sample was postponed for 3 days after the disappearance of the last sign. These deadlines are not respected for healthcare staff involved in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Healthcare workers infected with COVID-19 follow a closer control protocol, which may explain the faster time to viral clearance among them.Results showed that the place of isolation is playing a significant role in survival time to recovery from COVID-19 infection. According to the output of the cox model, COVID-19 patients in self-isolation at home are almost three times more likely to recover faster than those in dedicated COVID-19 centers. In fact, the Tunisian strategy was based in the first phase of the epidemic on the isolation of confirmed COVID-19 cases at home or in dedicated centers and to hospitalize only serious cases requiring special care. Afterwards, given the registration of an increasing number of secondary cases among the close contacts of confirmed patients, the health authorities decided to create specialized centers to isolate COVID-19 patients in order to limit community transmission. The delay in recovery for COVID-19 patients isolated in COVID-19 centers compared to those in selfisolation at home could be explained by the fact that patients do not respect self-isolation inside these centers leading sometimes to mass gatherings. This promiscuity inside the dedicated centers for infected people may thus promote the maintenance of viral load. Symptomatic patients seem also to have slower recovery duration. This study has some limitations. There was a lack in some clinical information such as comorbidities and vital signs (heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure etc). In addition, since we used phone interview, information concerning, biological and radiological data were not available for patients who have been hospitalized.Isolation of COVID-19 patients in dedicated centers or at home until the negativation of their second control sample was the strategy that Tunisia followed to combat the novel coronavirus. According to the results of our national study, the estimated duration of illness was extremely long, implying the isolation of confirmed COVID-19 cases for long periods. This partly explains the success in controlling the epidemic in Tunisia. However, with current science data, which proves that viral detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness, we strongly recommend to lighten our isolation strategy in accordance with the new WHO recommendations.The results we found reinforce guidance that additional control measures must be undertaken to avoid mass gatherings inside isolation centers. Elderly and symptomatic patients need particular attention and closer monitoring. ","Tunisia","abstract","2021-02-03",2

The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in many parts of Africa suggesting the current mitigation measures will be maintained or reintroduced for periods at least until the pandemic peaks [3] .Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) advisory to sustain routine immunisation (RI), vaccine coverage temporarily declined in many countries including Kenya that reports a 33% disruption of RI [4] [5] [6] [7] . Following guidance from the WHO, all countries suspended scheduled measles SIAs [6] [7] [8] . Measles control in Kenya is achieved by giving children a first dose of measlescontaining vaccine (MCV1) at 9 months, and a second dose (MCV2) from 18 months. SIAs, first introduced in 2002, are conducted periodically among children < 5 years or < 15 years for accelerated control of measles [9] . Based on the accumulation of susceptible children, the timing of such campaigns has typically been chosen to close immunity gaps in time to prevent potentially large measles outbreaks. A measles SIA originally planned for 2019 was rescheduled for February 2020 due to a shortfall in funding and postponed again following the COVID-19 pandemic.Following identification of the first COVID-19 case on March 13, 2020, Kenya imposed various mitigation measures: ban on large gatherings, suspension of international flights, closure of bars, cessation of movement from hotspot counties, restriction of restaurant operating hours, and a nationwide curfew from 7 pm to 5 am. While it is plausible that these physical distancing and lock down measures may reduce the risk of measles outbreaks, they are temporary and may be associated with rebound risk periods.The availability of recent measles serological data provided the opportunity to use Kenya as a case study to estimate the impact of reduced measles vaccination coverage and suspended SIAs due to COVID-19 on the risk of measles outbreaks.This study used a cohort mathematical model that combined measles serological data, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage estimates.We estimated measles immunity profile in children using serum samples collected during serological surveys among residents of Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) Kilifi, Kenya [10] for the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Impact Study (PCVIS) [11] . These serosurveys, conducted every 2 years since 2009, target 50 KHDSS randomly selected children in ten age strata (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, (8) (9) , and 10-14 years) and blood samples < 2 ml were collected from participants. The sample size for the PCVIS serosurveys was calculated to obtain narrow confidence intervals around the estimate of prevalence of immune response both overall and by age-category for each serosurvey year. For instance, for a proportion of 0.80, the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) would be 0.77-0.84 overall and 0.69-0.91 in each age stratum.In the 2019 serosurvey, there were 497 participants and the blood samples were collected in July (165), August (162), September (130), and October (40). We tested for measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using a fluorescent-bead-based multiplex immunoassay. Antibody concentrations ≥ 0.12 IU/ml were considered protective against measles [12] .We assumed these results reflected measles immunity in Kilifi in August 2019 and assumed 96% of persons > 15 years had protective measles antibodies concentrations, similar to findings in adults in Nairobi in 2007-2009 [13] (Table 1) . We also assumed protection from maternal immunity was similar to the proportions of the infants < 9 months old who had protective antibodies.Vaccination coverage MCV1 national coverage in Kenya has been between 75 and 80% since its introduction in 1985 [17] . MCV2 was introduced in Kenya in 2013 and coverage rose up to 45% in 2018 [9] . The last measles SIA in children aged 9 months to 14 years took place in 2016 and achieved 95% coverage [22] .We assumed national MCV1 and MCV2 coverage were 79% and 45%, respectively, in 2018, and that these stayed at the same level from August 2019 until the end of March 2020 when COVID-19 contact restrictions were introduced in Kenya. From April 2020, we explored the following routine vaccination coverage scenarios alongside a suspended SIA.A. Routine vaccination coverage remained the same B. Routine vaccination coverage reduced by 15% for both MCV1 and MCV2 C. Routine vaccination coverage reduced by 50% for both MCV1 and MCV2 D. Routine vaccination was suspendedWe used an age-mixing matrix which consisted of the number of contacts between six different age groups. The matrix was generated from diary studies conducted in Kilifi, Kenya [21] , using a bootstrap of 4000 samples by randomly sampling n individuals with replacement from the n participants of the contact survey.We adapted a static cohort model of measles immunity [23] to estimate age-stratified population immunity profile in Kilifi by combining recent measles serological data with new vaccine-derived immunity during the prediction period using the local vaccination schedule, MCV1 and MCV2 uptake, and vaccine efficacy. We assumed waning immunity or additional acquired immunity from natural exposure, and demographic changes in the short time frame were negligible. Hence, the key mechanisms of the projection model were that individuals are born at a constant rate, gained immunity through vaccination at the recommended age and at the observed coverage, and grow older.In extrapolating immunity for young infants under 9 months old, maternal immunity was assumed to be the same as the observed data. For ages 9 months to 17 months, immunity was estimated in accordance with the assumed MCV1 vaccination uptake and a vaccine effectiveness of 93%. For those ≥ 18 months, we estimated the immunity based on the assumed uptake of MCV2 and the same vaccine effectiveness. We aggregated projected immunity to age groups given by contact data and weighted each age group according to population estimates before averaging them to estimate overall immunity. We did not explicitly model MCV2 delivery but rather assumed that the MCV1 effectiveness is an average of MCV1 and MCV2 efficacy weighted by proportion of children who receive MCV1 only or both doses. The underlying assumption here was that the same children who received MCV2 had also received MCV1. We predicted age-stratified and population-level immunity until December 2021.To derive a contact-adjusted estimate for the proportion of the population who are immune to measles, the predicted age-stratified immunity profile was weighted by age-stratified social contact patterns observed in Kilifi. This method has been previously shown to yield robust projections for measles immunity to transmission in the population [23] .The herd immunity threshold (HIT) for measles during the COVID-19 pandemic was calculated assuming an R 0 of 12 to 18 with a median of 14 [19] and that COVID-19 prescribed contact restrictions caused a 50% reduction in measles transmissibility similar to the observed reduction in physical contacts in Kenya [20] . We also explored a 25% and 75% reduction in measles transmissibility in a sensitivity analysis. The HIT is calculated as 0 = (R 0 -1)/R 0 .We obtained a crude estimate of the outbreak risk using the predicted immunity and HIT. The probability of a large outbreak, p, sparked by a single infected individual was given by p = 1 − (1/R) I0 where I0 is the initial number infected and R is the effective reproductive number. R < 1 implies that probability, p, is negative which is defined to be 0 for no outbreak.The effectiveness of a post-lockdown SIA in reducing outbreak riskWe assessed the impact of SIAs in two age categories: 9 months to 5 years and 9 months to 15 years, by predicting the post-SIA immunity profile and the corresponding risk for a large measles outbreak. We simulated SIAs in either November 2020, December 2020 or December 2021, assumed a coverage of 95% similar to the most Vaccine effectiveness (beta distributed) MCV1: 85% (80-90%) +MCV2: 98% (95-100%) Combined effectiveness 93% (88-96%) [15, 16] Age-immunity profile in < 15 years old (bootstrapped from data) Observed in 2019 [11] Proportion immune among > 15 years old (beta distributed) 96% (90-99%) [13] Vaccine coverage August 2019 to March 2020 (assumed to be same as in 2018) (beta distributed)MCV1: 79% (75-85%) MCV2: 45% (40-50%) [9, 17, 18] Vaccine coverage from April 2020 MCV1 and MCV2 0%, 15%, 50%, or 100% reduced Assumption R 0 measles (Log-normally distributed) 14 (12-18) [19] Reduction in contacts during COVID-19 50% (25% and 75%) [20] Age demographics From KHDSS in 2019 [10] Social mixing matrix From 2011/12 [21] recent national SIA in 2016 [22] , and applied vaccine efficacy of MCV1. The SIA was simulated by reducing the age-specific pool of susceptible by the effective coverage of the SIA.In simulating the SIA, we used the age-specific predicted immunity to calculate the age-specific pool of susceptible at the different time-points. We reduced this age-specific pool of susceptible in the age-groups of interest by the effective coverage of the SIA. We aggregated the results and adjusted the overall crude immunity using the social contact matrix. Finally, we calculated the outbreak probability assuming a SIA is conducted before restrictions are lifted (using the reduced HIT based on 50% reduction in contacts) and assuming an SIA is conducted after restrictions are lifted (using the normal HIT based on 0% reduction in contacts).We assessed the sensitivity of our findings to uncertainty inherent in several of our assumptions via probabilistic re-sampling. We included uncertainty for population immunity profile, combined MCV1 and MCV2 vaccine effectiveness, and MCV1 and MCV2 coverage ( Table 1) . As part of each parameter bootstrap, we also bootstrapped participants of the serological survey and hence the age-stratified population immunity at the start of the simulation. We present median estimates including uncertainty quantified as per the 95% quantiles of the 4000 bootstrap samples.We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of a delay in receipt of MCV1 on outbreak probability. We delayed the age of receipt of MCV1 in our model by 3 months as reported for delayed vaccination in Kilifi [18] and also by 6 months. We also predicted unadjusted population immunity in Kilifi and estimated the corresponding probability of a large outbreak.The proportion of MCV1-eligible children with protective measles antibody concentrations was high in 2019 as shown in Fig. 1 and Additional file 1; Table S1 . Seventyone of 74 (96%) children ≥ 9 years had protective levels. Similarly, 228 of 237 (96%) 4-8-year-olds were immune. Among under-fours eligible for MCV1, 145 of 166 (87%) were immune while one of 20 (0.05%) children under 9 months old, who were ineligible for MCV1, had protective antibodies.We estimate that in late 2019, population immunity adjusted for age-differences in social contacts was 90% (85-92). Predicted immune proportions were unchanged in February 2020, at the time of originally planned SIA.Following the start of COVID-19 pandemic and restriction measures that caused a decrease in vaccination coverage, we estimate that population immunity decreased quickly, depending on the extent of reduction in vaccination coverage. If coverage reduced by 15% from Fig. 1 Age-stratified population immunity profile. Estimated age-stratified proportion of the Kilifi County population who were immune to measles infection in August 2019 from data. Antibody concentrations ≥ 0.12 IU/ml were defined as protective. Confidence bounds displayed (in red) are the 95% quantiles of a nonparametric bootstrap that is used to propagate uncertainty into the modelling framework. MCV1 is recommended to be administered at 9 months as per the Kenyan immunisation schedule and MCV2 from 18 months April 2020, the contact-adjusted population immunity would decline to 88% (85-91) by December 2020 and 87% (84-90) by December 2021. A 50% reduction in vaccination coverage would lead to a more rapid decline in this immunity to 87% (83-89) in December 2020 and 85% (81-87) in December 2021 (Fig. 2) .A basic reproduction number of 14 (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) implies a HIT of 93% (82-94) and if, as a result of physical distancing, measles transmission is reduced by 25%, 50%, and 75% this HIT drops to 90% (89-93), 86% (83-89), and 71% (67-78) as seen in Additional file 2: Fig. S1 . Before contact restrictions came into effect in April 2020, ageadjusted immunity was below the HIT: in 99% of simulations this immunity was below the HIT (Additional file 3: Fig. S1 ). Reduction in HIT temporarily mitigated the immediate risk for measles outbreak as in April 2020, 94% of simulations were above the 50% reduced transmission HIT, 20% were above the 25% reduced HIT, and 100% of simulations were above the 75% reduced HIT.Depending on vaccination coverage maintained during COVID-19 pandemic, population immunity may decline quickly in young children (< 2 years). By April 2020, ageadjusted immunity fell below the normal transmission HIT in all simulations under all the scenarios. (Additional file 3: Fig. S1 ).Similarly, the risk of a large measles outbreak from the introduction of a single infectious individual increased quickly if routine vaccination coverage declined (Fig. 3) . If in December 2020, measles transmissibility is similar to pre-COVID-19 levels and routine measles coverage since April 2020 reduced by 15%, 50%, or 100%, we estimate the probability for a large measles outbreak as 38% , 46% , and 54% (43-64), respectively, in the age-adjusted analysis. By December 2021, this risk would increase to 43% (25-56), 54% (43-63), and 66% (59-72), respectively. The probability of a large measles outbreak was much lower if measles transmissibility reduced by 25%, 50% and 75% (Additional file 4: Fig. S1 ). In December 2020, if routine measles coverage since April 2020 reduced by 50%, we estimate the probability of a large measles outbreak as 28% (7-45), 0% (0-18), and 0%(0-0) assuming a 25%, 50%, and 75% reduction in transmission.A SIA in 9-month to 5-year-old children or 9-months to 15-year-olds both during and immediately after lifting transmission-reducing COVID-19 restrictions can substantially reduce outbreak risk (Fig. 4) .If measles vaccine coverage declines by 15%, 50%, or 100% from April 2020, a post lockdown SIA delivered to children 9 months to 5 years old in December 2020 with 15% reduction, c. 50% reduction, and d. 100% reduction, indicate the median estimates and the uncertainty of the predicted immunity quantified as the 95% quantiles of the bootstrap analysis. There was a quick decline of predicted immunity over the study period that was based on assumed reduction in routine coverage Fig. 3 Probability of a large measles outbreak sparked by a single infected individual. Outbreak probability was calculated using the predicted immunity and herd immunity threshold before (red) and during (green) COVID-19 movement restriction measures. Zero probability indicates no possibility of an outbreak. The bold lines and shaded region in each scenario, i.e. a. no reduction, b. 15% reduction, c. 50% reduction, and d. 100% reduction, indicate the median estimates of outbreak risk and the uncertainty quantified as the 95% quantiles of the bootstrap analysis. The risk of a large measles outbreak from the introduction of a single infectious individual increased quickly based on the level of impairment of routine vaccination coverage Fig. 4 Probability of a single infectious person seeding a large outbreak before (none) and after implementing a SIA in children 9 months to 5 years old (U5) and in 9 months to 15 years old (U15) at different timepoints post-lockdown (normal transmission) and during lockdown (50% transmission reduction). Outbreak probability was calculated by comparing the proportion immune with the herd immunity threshold. The shaded area is the median estimate of the outbreak risk and the error bars indicate the uncertainty in outbreak risk quantified as the 95% quantiles of the bootstrap analysis. In all the scenarios, i.e. a. No reduction, b. 15% reduction, c. 50% reduction, and d. 100% reduction, the risk of a large measles outbreak would be largely mitigated through delivery of a SIA among children < 5 years old or < 15 years old 95% coverage would reduce the risk of an outbreak to 0% (0-17), 0% , and 0% (0-22), respectively, in age-adjusted analysis. A similar SIA would reduce the risk of an outbreak to 0% in all the scenarios assuming a 50% reduction in contacts in December 2020 (Fig. 4) .Even if RI coverage is low through to December 2021, the risk for a large measles outbreak would be mitigated through an SIA for under-fives if delivered as soon as possible (Additional file 5: Fig. S1 ).A 3-month and 6-month delay in the receipt of MCV1 in age-eligible children caused a marginal increase in the risk of a large measles outbreak (Additional file 6: Fig.  S1 ). This increase in outbreak risk associated with a delay in receipt of MCV1 was also evident for different assumptions of transmission reduction during lockdown (Additional file 6: Fig. S1 ).The predicted crude population immunity was slightly higher compared to age-adjusted immunity but followed the same declining trend over time (Additional file 7: Fig. S1 ). Before contact restrictions came into place, 73% of simulations were below the HIT and by October 2020 and July 2020, this immunity fell below the HIT in more than 95% of simulations under scenario C and D respectively (Additional file 8: Fig. S1 ).Our analysis suggests a decline in population immunity during COVID-19 pandemic will result in an increased risk of a measles outbreak depending on the extent to which routine vaccination coverage is reduced. We estimated the probability of a large measles outbreak from the introduction of a single infectious individual to be 38% , 46% , and 54% (43-64) in December 2020 assuming a 15%, 50%, or 100% reduction in routine measles vaccination coverage respectively since April 2020. This risk, which will increase to 43% (25-56), 54% (43-63), and 67% (59-72) by December 2021, will be greatly reduced if a SIA among children < 5 years old is conducted before or immediately after all COVID-19-related restrictions on physical contact are lifted.We based our analysis on an immunity model that combined serological data and age-specific mixing patterns in Kenya. Combining the two is a better strategy for predicting outbreaks as opposed to using immunity profiles alone as it allows adjustment of overall immunity by taking into account the contribution of each agegroup to transmission [23] .As there is considerable uncertainty in actual reduction of routine vaccination uptake, we predicted population immunity for scenarios of routine vaccination coverage since April 2020, i.e. 15%, 50%, and 100% reductions, and the corresponding outbreak risk. Our assumption of 15% reduction in vaccine coverage rates is based on reduction in vaccine clinic visits in Kilifi County (DHIS2 Routine Report) while the 50% reduction lies in the range of reported disruption in vaccination services from WHO immunisation pulse poll [6] . We assumed a 50% reduction in measles transmissibility given that COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented on 25th March 2020 were reported to have reduced social contacts and disease transmission by the same margin [20] . Although some restriction measures remain in place, e.g. nationwide curfew, others like the partial lockdown have since been eased and ban on international flights was lifted on 1st August 2020. While the assumption of a 50% reduction in measles transmission was applicable at the beginning of the epidemic due to stringent measures imposed, current herd immunity threshold may be much higher than originally assumed but still lower than pre-COVID-19 threshold.To account for the uncertainty in measles transmissibility during lockdown, we explored two other scenarios, 25% and 75% reduction in measles transmission in a sensitivity analysis. We found that a 75% reduction in measles transmission would result to zero outbreaks in all the scenarios during the entire study period, which was much lower compared to the outbreak probability in our baseline analysis. A 25% reduction in measles transmission resulted to a much higher probability of measles outbreak compared to our baseline analysis. For instance, in December 2020, the estimated outbreak risk was 28% (7-45) compared to 0% (0-18) in our baseline analysis assuming a 50% reduction in routine vaccination coverage.In the calculation of a quantitative impact of outbreak risk, our estimate of the probability of a large outbreak was based on the introduction of a single infectious individual in a population where there is hardly any measles circulation. Based on our results, the outbreak probability would be much higher and severe if multiple cases were introduced.SIAs in Kenya are generally conducted every 2-4 years and provide a second opportunity for vaccination in children regardless of their vaccination history and are ideally timed to close immunity gaps arising from the accumulation of susceptible and vaccine failures [24] . They have been shown to be effective in increasing immunisation equity by reaching children from poor households [25] . In February 2020, at the time of the planned national SIA, we estimated that 90% (85-92) of the population were immune after adjusting for age-differences in social contact. This immunity which was equivalent to a 34% (8-54) probability of a large outbreak suggests the SIA would have been timely in closing immunity gaps.The risk of an outbreak which was accelerated by immunity gaps arising in children who missed their routinely delivered MCV1 and MCV2 continued to increase in subsequent months following the start of COVID-19 and by December 2020, the estimated risk had increased to 38% , 46% , and 54% (43-64) assuming a 15%, 50%, and 100% reduction in measles vaccination coverage respectively. Based on limited information on additional reductions in vaccination coverage as the pandemic progressed in Kenya's devolved counties and marked reduction in vaccination services in Kenya in May 2020 compared to January and February 2020 reported in the second WHO immunisation poll, it is highly probable most areas will experience an outbreak risk of 46% (30-59) corresponding to a 50% reduction in routine coverage.Assuming all COVID-19 restrictions remain in place, the risk of outbreaks would only be experienced in the suspended RI scenario in 2021. The severity and timing of these outbreaks would be largely reduced if a measles vaccine campaign is delivered but it will also depend on time delay of catch-up campaigns and speed at which a campaign can be organised. In December 2020 for instance, a SIA would reduce outbreak risk to zero in all scenarios with an upper bound risk of 15% while in December 2021, outbreak risk would reduce to zero with an upper bound risk of 25% after delivery of SIA.The current disruption to vaccination services will cause further delays to vaccination, which is a challenge even in normal circumstances. We had previously reported consistently poor timeliness of MCV1 vaccination across 6 different birth-cohorts (2011-2016) in Kenya [18] . Here, a delay in age of MCV1 by 3 months resulted in a marginal increase in outbreak risk. For instance, assuming a 50% reduction in routine vaccination, a delay in vaccination would see the risk increase from 46% (30-59) to 53% (40-64) by the end of the year. This reiterates the importance of timeliness in administration of vaccines in children as even a slight delay may cause considerable immunity gaps.Our results emphasise the importance of maintaining high RI coverage during this pandemic because the benefits of sustaining RI services far outweighs the risks of any excess COVID-19 deaths that may arise from vaccination clinic visits [5] . Due to the highly infectious nature of measles, massive outbreaks following disruptions to health care systems and reduced MCV1 coverage are typical. Following the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014-2015, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea reported more than a 25% reductions in MCV1 coverage [26, 27] . Reported cases also occurred in a lower age group compared to pre-Ebola period suggesting accumulation of susceptible children who missed their vaccine doses was a key contributor. Immunity gaps continued to be felt in these countries 2 years later even after successful implementation of SIAs.Recently, measles outbreaks have been reported in five counties in Kenya [28] even with COVID-19 restrictions which suggests an adverse synergistic interaction between pre-existing gaps of susceptibility due to lower vaccination coverage in some counties (compared to national estimates) and a precipitous drop in RI coverage during this period. These outbreaks and our results are well aligned with recent Kenya measles risk assessment report by the Measles and Rubella Initiative, and recent WHO guidance on catch-up vaccination to close the immunity gaps caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.As expected, majority of vaccine eligible children had protective antibody concentrations against measles while only one of 20 (0.05%) infants under 9 months old had protective levels. This suggests that there is an extended period of susceptibility in young infants probably a consequence of rapid decay of maternally acquired antibody. This will require further investigation in Kenya. However, this phenomenon has been previously reported in areas where maternal immunity is increasingly from immunisation rather than natural infection [29] .Our analysis was based on data from a rural area in the African region. Although these results are largely representative of rural areas in measles endemic settings, they may vary in an urban setting especially as measles susceptibility profiles have been shown to vary across urban and rural settings mainly due to heterogeneity in vaccination coverage and the different mixing patterns between and within age-groups.A key strength of our study is the availability of recent serological data which provides an excellent means of directly estimating levels of population protection against infection and can also be used to guide post-COVID-19 SIAs. In addition, the availability of an agemixing matrix from the same area allowed us to estimate overall immunity by taking into account the level of contact between different age-groups.Our study has a few limitations. Population immunity was only available for children < 15 years, but we varied observed immunity estimates in adults from a previous study in our model which resulted in a slight shift in overall immunity. Our results showing SIAs conducted in under-fives will mitigate the risk of measles outbreak risk are based on the assumption that majority (96%) of the older age groups have measles immunity. Susceptibility gaps in this older age-groups will require SIAs for a wider age range (e.g. 9 months to 15 years) to close population immunity gaps and reduce the outbreak risk. The serological data estimates and the mixing matrix used in our study may not be fully representative of the country although we utilised national estimates of vaccination coverage, which was the main driver of predicted immunity. We did not explicitly model MCV2 delivery but assumed the overall effectiveness was an average of MCV1 and MCV2 efficacy weighted by the proportion of children who either receive MCV1 only or both doses. Finally, there is some uncertainty around the actual reduction in transmission due to variability in compliance with physical distancing measures in place. However, we accounted for uncertainty by varying both the reduction in transmission and the R0.Measles SIA originally scheduled for February 2020 in Kenya would have been well-timed as population immunity was below herd immunity threshold. Interruptions to RI since the start of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Kenya have now widened the measles immunity gap, but the associated risk of large measles outbreaks were partially mitigated by COVID-19 contact restrictions in place. As these measures have almost been fully lifted, we estimate that measles outbreak risks will dramatically increase, and an immediate SIA will be required to close measles immunity gaps.","Kenya","abstract","2021-02-03",2

The 55 identification of antivirals by drug repurposing was so far largely unsuccessful. Remdesivir, an 56 inhibitor of the viral polymerase, is the only antiviral with proven efficacy (Beigel et al., 2020) . 57 However, the clinical benefit reported for Remdesivir treatment is moderate and has been called 58 into question (Consortium et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . Recombinant antibodies, which target 59 the viral spike protein (S) and neutralize infection in cell culture and animal models (Baum et al., 60 2020a; Chen et al., 2020) , have been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) and may 61 provide a valuable treatment option in the absence of other antivirals. In contrast to the moderate 62 success in the area of antivirals, protective mRNA-and vector-based vaccines encoding the 63 SARS-CoV-2 S protein have been approved for human use and are considered key to the 64 containment of COVID-19 (Baden et al., 2021; Polack et al., 2020) . 65 SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus that uses its envelope protein 66 spike (S) to enter target cells. Entry depends on S protein binding to the cellular receptor ACE2 67 and S protein priming by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Zhou et 68 al., 2020) and these processes can be disrupted by soluble ACE2 and serine protease inhibitors 69 (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Monteil et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Further, the S protein of SARS- 70 CoV-2 and other coronaviruses is a major determinant of viral cell and species tropism and the 71 main target for the neutralizing antibody response. The genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 has 72 remained relatively stable after the detection of first cases in Wuhan, China, in the winter season 73 of 2019. The only exception was a D614G change in the viral S protein that became dominant 74 early in the pandemic and that has been associated with increased transmissibility (Korber et al., 75 4 2020; Plante et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2021) . In contrast, D614G has only a moderate impact on 76 SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by sera from COVID-19 patients and by sera from vaccinated 77 individuals (Korber et al., 2020; Weissman et al., 2021) . 78 In recent weeks several SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged that seem to exhibit increased 79 transmissibility and that harbor mutations in the S protein. The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 (UK 80 variant), also termed variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 or 20I/501Y.V1, emerged in the 81 United Kingdom and was associated with a surge of COVID-19 cases (Leung et al., 2021) . 82 Subsequently, spread of the UK variant in other countries was reported (Claro et al., 2021;  83 Galloway et al., 2021) . It harbors nine mutations in the S protein, six of which are located in the 84 surface unit, S1, and three are found in the transmembrane unit, S2 (Fig. 1 ). Exchange N501Y is 85 located in the receptor binding domain (RBD), a domain within S1 that interacts with ACE2, and 86 its presence was linked to increased human-human transmissibility (Leung et al., 2021; (Muik et al., 2021) The spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants mediate robust entry into human cell lines 125 We first investigated whether the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-1 isolate with D614G All S proteins studied were robustly expressed and mediated formation of syncytia in 139 transfected cells ( Fig. 2A) . Entry into all cell lines was readily detectable but the relative entry 140 efficiency varied. Particles bearing the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants entered 293T 141 (Brazil variant) and 293T-ACE2 (South Africa and Brazil variants) cells with slightly reduced 142 efficiency as compared to particles bearing WT S protein, while the reverse observation was 143 made for Calu-3 cells (UK variant) . For the remaining cell lines, no significant differences in 144 entry efficiency were observed between SARS-CoV S WT and S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 145 7 variants (Fig. 2B) . Collectively, these results indicate that the mutations present in the S proteins 146 of UK, South Africa and Brazil variant are compatible with robust entry into human cells.The spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants mediate fusion of human cells 149 The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 drives cell-cell fusion resulting in the formation of syncytia and 150 this process might contribute to viral pathogenesis (Buchrieser et al., 2021) . We employed a cell- (Hoffmann et al., 2020a) . In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 161 S protein mediated efficient membrane fusion in the absence of TMPRSS2 expression in target 162 cells (Fig. 3A ,B) and this property is known to depend on the multibasic S1/S2 site of this S 163 protein which is absent in SARS-CoV S (Hoffmann et al., 2020a) . Finally, the S proteins of all 164 SARS-CoV-2 variants tested facilitated cell-cell fusion with similar (UK) or slightly reduced 165 (South Africa, Brazil) efficiency as compared to WT S protein (Fig. 3A,B) . We next investigated whether the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants showed altered 169 stability, which may contribute to the alleged increased transmissibility of the viral variants. For 170 this, we incubated S protein-bearing particles for different time intervals at 33°C, a temperature 171 that is present in the nasal cavity, and subsequently assessed their capacity to enter target cells.The efficiency of cell entry markedly decreased upon incubation of particles at 33°C for more 173 than 8 h, but no appreciable differences were observed between particles bearing S proteins from 174 SARS-CoV-2 WT or variants (Fig. 4A ).Although the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants under study did not differ markedly (Monteil et al., 2020) . Similarly, the clinically proven protease inhibitors 189 Camostat and Nafamostat block TMPRSS2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and their potential 190 for COVID-19 treatment is currently being assessed (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Hoffmann et al., 191 2020c). Finally, the membrane fusion inhibitor EK1 and its optimized lipid-conjugated derivative 192 9 EK1C4 block SARS-CoV-2 entry by preventing conformational rearrangements in S protein 193 required for membrane fusion (Xia et al., 2020) . We asked whether entry driven by the S proteins 194 of UK, South Africa and Brazil variant can be blocked by these inhibitors. All inhibitors were 195 found to be active although entry mediated by the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants was 196 slightly more sensitive to blockade by sACE2 as compared to WT S protein, at least for certain 197 sACE2 concentrations (Fig. 5) . Conversely, entry driven by the S protein of the Brazil variant 198 was slightly more sensitive to blockade by EK1 and EK1C4 as compared to the other S proteins The vaccine BNT162b2 is based on an mRNA that encodes for the viral S protein and is highly 237 protective against COVID-19 (Polack et al., 2020) . While the S protein harbor T-cell epitopes 238 (Grifoni et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020) , efficient protection is believed to require the induction of 239 neutralizing antibodies. We determined neutralizing activity of sera from 15 donors immunized 240 11 twice with BNT162b2 (Table S1 ). All sera efficiently inhibited entry driven by the WT S protein 241 and inhibition of entry driven by the S protein of the UK variant was only slightly reduced ( Fig.   242 7B,C). In contrast, 12 out of 15 sera showed a markedly reduced inhibition of entry driven by the 243 S proteins of the South Africa and Brazil variant (Fig. 7B,C) , although it should be stated that all 244 sera completely inhibited entry at the lowest dilution tested. In sum, these results suggest that 245 BNT162b2 may offer less robust protection against infection by these variants as compared to Thus, the S proteins of these viruses mediated entry into various cell lines with roughly 285 comparable efficiency and no evidence for increased S protein stability or differences in entry 286 kinetics were obtained. Similarly, the S proteins of all variants were able to mediate fusion of 287 human cells. Moreover, entry driven by all S proteins studied was blocked by sACE2, protease 288 13 inhibitors targeting TMPRSS2 and a membrane fusion inhibitor. However, it should be noted that 289 the S proteins of all variants were slightly more susceptible to blockade by sACE2, suggesting 290 differences in ACE2 engagement between WT and variant S proteins.Although host-cell interactions underlying viral entry might not differ markedly between 292 SARS-CoV-2 S protein WT and the variants studied here, major differences in susceptibility to Fígure S1.

Based on the situation report of the World Health Organization (WHO) -November 2020, COVID-19 is extremely spreading worldwide over 230 countries and accountable so far for > 96 million cases and > 2 million fatalities (https://covid19.who.int/, accessed on 23 rd Jan 2021). Coronaviruses is part of a large family of enveloped single stranded RNA genome (ssRNA) that belong to the Coronaviridae family. They are categorized into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses [5] . Some of coronaviruses prompted several respiratory diseases, such as SARS-CoV [6] , middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [7] and the pandemic COVID-19 [3] . SARS-CoV-2 are beta coronaviruses [3, 8] with symptoms commonly like other respiratory viruses infection, such as influenza and rhinovirus. [9] Papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like / main protease (3CLpro / Mpro) [10, 11] are critical for the release of 16 non-structural proteins (nsps1-16) after processing the two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. [12] These polyproteins are created following the virion entry to the host cell where their production is initiated via translation of 5'-terminal open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1ab). [13] It is known that the establishment of the replicase complex necessary for viral genome replication is conditional on nsps [14] . Nonetheless, PLpro performs a key role for the release of nsp1-3 from the viral polyprotein which is critical for viral replication.Furthermore, PLpro has been reported to negatively regulate the host innate immune response towards the viral infection by its deubiquinating and deISGylating effect. [15, 16] Therefore, PLpro has been identified as an imperative target for viral replication suppression attempts in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. [15, 17] Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) remains an essential technique in modern drug discovery. [18] [19] [20] [21] Molecular docking is widely employed in SBVS campaigns and computational drug repositioning for COVID-19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] utilizing the structural information of the protein targets to gauge molecular databases and predict the favored binding of compounds.However, the docking tool should be evaluated utilizing benchmarking molecular sets. [31, 32] Also, ensemble docking has emerged as a popular approach which incorporates the protein J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f flexibility and tackles the problem of false positive results of rigid docking [33] . This can be achieved via Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that has shown to be a powerful approach for sampling different protein conformations. Usually, screening this ensemble of conformations gives better results than single crystallographic structure [34] .Accordingly, it is the target of this study to investigate samples of the conformational space of SARS-CoV2 PLpro. One reason for this is the limited number of X-ray structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for PLpro (around 24 structures) compared to the main protease (Mpro, around 200 structures). Additionally, compared to Mpro [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] , fewer reports about targeting PLpro is presented in literature. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] In the context of drug repurposing to treat COVID-19, Balasubramaniam et al. [46] reported potential targeting of three SARS-CoV-2 proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, papain-like proteinase and helicase, by the antiviral drug elbasvir through virtual screening of 54 FDA-approved antivirals and 3300 investigational drugs. Kandeel et al. proposed some FDA-approved drugs and supplements to target PLpro.Their methodology was based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding energy calculations. [51] Also, Cavasotto and Di Filippo presented a docking-based screening using a quantum mechanical scoring of a library built from approved drugs and compounds undergoing clinical trials, against three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, including PLpro. [52] Kouznetsova et al. [48] repurposed FDA-approved drugs along with inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). De Vita et al. [49] adopted an FDA-approved drugs screening approach combining MM-GBSA calculations for ranking drugs along three different SARS-CoV-2 targets, including PLpro, and MD simulations for the best ligand in each target member. Delre et al. [50] suggested known drugs as both covalent and non-covalent inhibitors for PLpro depending on covalent docking, non-covalent docking and MM-GBSA calculations.The mentioned approaches lacked to objectively consider different conformations of the highly flexible loop (T265-H272). This encouraged us to explore the conformational space of PLpro for screening purposes. For this we conducted a long-range molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of PLpro for 1 micro-second. Then the simulation trajectory was clustered to extract representative structures for ensemble docking purposes. Furthermore, guided by our recent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f benchmarking study of SARS-CoV2 PLpro [13] , we employed FRED [53, 54] for ensemble screening of DrugBank database against the cluster representatives. The results highlight potential consensus binders to many of the MD clusters as well as the newly introduced X-ray structure complexed with small molecule (PDB ID: 7JRN). Generally, this approach can help in identifying drugs for repositioning via targeting multiple conformations of a crucial target for the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic.The 24 structures of PLpro comprises the following PDB IDs: 6W9C, 6WRH, 6YVA, 6XA9, 6XAA, 6WZU, 6XG3, 7CJD, 7D6H and 7D47 for the apo structures, while 6WUU and 6WX4for complexes with a peptide-like inhibitors. Also, PDB IDs of 7JRN, 7JN2, 7JIR, 7JIT, 7JIV, 7JIW, 7CJM, 7KOK, 7KOL, 7KOJ, 7D7T and 7CMD have been recently introduced for protein -small molecule complexes (Resolution and R-Value Free are shown in Table T1 in theBased on previous reports and the recently deposited X-ray PDB structures of PLpro, Tyr268 and Gln269 were proposed to be the key residues for small molecule recognition. [13, 17] They encompass the main part of a flexible loop that can adapt various backbone and side chain conformations, as seen in Fig. 1 . However, their unbound X-ray structures appeared to show close conformations (pairwise RMSD < 1A) and their side chains mostly appear to point outwards to the solvent exposed area. [13] Unlike the unbound conformation, the structures complexed with small molecules appeared to show more distinct and ordered conformations for the key Tyr268 and Gln269 where their side chains pointed inwards to offer a hydrophobic wall for interactions with the small molecules. [13] Therefore, based on the data available from the PDB, two main X-ray structures can be extracted representing distinct conformations of the binding site loop (see Hence, we aim in this section to investigate samples of the conformational space of SARS-CoV2 PLpro with a focus on the conformational changes of the key binding site residues.Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to explore the protein conformational space of the apo/native form (PDB ID: 6W9C) and give insights into the dynamic nature of the binding site. Long-range molecular dynamics simulations for 1 micro-second ware performed to give robust sampling of the protein conformations. The simulation system was subjected to a preliminary minimization step followed by an equilibration step of 6 ns. The system was then subjected to production run of 1 micro-second. Fig. 2 shows Radius of Gyration (Rg) and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) for the protein backbone atoms through the 1 micro-second simulation, where radius of gyration is a measure of the change in the compactness of the protein during the simulation. Its low range of 1Å (48-49Å) indicates the stability of the protein during the simulation and the absence of major conformational change in protein structure. While RMSD is a measure of the deviation of the backbone atoms from the initial protein structure. It is observed that RMSD has a range of 3Å with lowest and highest values of 1Å and 4Å, respectively, which gives an indication of the stability of the protein throughout the simulation. It is also observed that the trajectories are divided into three main ensembles. The first ensemble has RMSD of 1-3 Å (0 -300 ns), the second and third parts are interchangeable from 300-1000ns showing fluctuation in their RMSD from 2 to 4 Å. Clustering for the simulation trajectory was performed to extract representative structures of the protein different conformations. The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f clustering algorithm used calculates the average RMSD between trajectory frames and clusters close frames together. In a first run, we assigned the RMSD measurements to be calculated on the backbone atoms. Fig. 2 shows bar plot of timeline frame distribution of the three resulting clusters with a frame distribution between clusters similar to the distribution of backbone RMSD through the simulation run shown in Fig. 2 , which supports the aforementioned observation.Top: Protein radius of gyration (R g ) through the 1 micro-second simulation time showing low fluctuation of 48-49 Å with low range of 1 Å indicating the protein compactness during the simulation . Middle: protein RMSD of backbone atoms during the simulation time showing three clusters for the protein with the first cluster from 0 to 300 ns, and the second and the third clusters from 300 ns to 1 micro-second. Bottom: Timeline bar plot of protein cluster distribution during the 1 micro-second simulation assigning the RMSD matrix to be measured on the backbone atoms. It shows three clusters corresponding to the three clusters concluded from protein RMSD measurement, with the first cluster in red and second and third clusters in blue and green, respectively. Fig. 1 and reported earlier. [13] The rest of the binding site amino acids (L162-E167, P247-P248, Y264-Y273 and T301) showed lower RMSF values < 1 Å indicating their stability during the simulation. The rest of the protein amino acids displayed low RMSF values highlighting their stability as well (Fig. 3) . Bottom: per residue RMSF with color notation corresponding to the protein (top) color notation. It shows the binding site residues RMSF (red and blue rectangles) and the highly flexible residues (yellow rectangles).The MD simulation resulted in a trajectory file of 14285 protein frames. Considering all the frames in an ensemble docking approach is certainly time-consuming, and redundant outcome can be produced due to high frame similarities in some regions. Therefore, partitioning MD frames into clusters of similar frames addresses the problem of their large number. TTClust program [55] was used for this clustering task, where it calculates the average RMSD between frames and cluster similar frames together. In the first run, the RMSD was assigned to be calculated on the backbone atoms ( Twelve protein structures comprising the ten MD clusters representatives, the starting X-ray structure (PDB ID: 6W9C) and the X-ray structure of PLpro-small molecule complex (PDB ID: 7JRN) were utilized for ensemble docking for screening the DrugBank database [56] . Such set up is to represent various states of the conformation space of PLpro. This approach would enable us to extract a consensus list of drugs that is able to target PLpro in different conformations simultaneously. Based on the results of our previous benchmarking study [13] , we applied FRED docking tool for this ensemble screening approach since it showed promising screening performance in recognizing bioactive molecules in a pool of challenging decoys for both the bound and unbound states of PLpro. [13, 31] Also, we biased our consensus selection for drugs enriched in the newly introduced X-ray structure complexed with a small molecule (PDB ID: 7JRN), because it showed the best benchmarking results among other PLpro X-ray structures. [13] Top enriched 1% of the screened DrugBank database [56] (25 compounds) were retrieved for each docking run and concatenated together to extract commonly enriched drugs in a consensus list. Drugs with 1% enrichment and in consensus rank for 5, 6, 7 and 8 different conformations are listed in Table 1 . As a consensus, ten drugs were shown to commonly target different conformations of PLpro. and -10.38, respectively. Interestingly, their docking score is observed to be the best in the X-ray structure (7JRN) compared to other conformations, therefore, we inspected their postulated binding poses in such X-ray structure, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 .Benserazide appeared to be enriched for 5 conformations involving both X-ray structures (PDB IDs: 7JRN and 6W9C). It is an inhibitor of levodopa (L-DOPA) decarboxylation that acts peripherally and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It is used in combination with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease management to prevent its decarboxylation and facilitate its blood-brain barrier crossing. Upon investigation of Benserazide postulated binding mode and comparing it with the co-crystallized ligand in (PDB ID: 7JRN), two hydrogen bonds with Asp164 side chain and Gln269 backbone atoms are conserved in both poses. These two hydrogen bonds are formed by the hydrazide group of Benserazide and the amide group of the co-crystallized ligand. Two additional hydrogen bonds with Tyr268 and Tyr273 side chain atoms are formed with Benserazide. Additionally, the T-shaped pi-pi stack between the cocrystallized ligand naphthyl ring and Tyr 268, and its pi-alkyl interaction with Pro248, are also conserved with the trihydroxy phenyl ring of Benserazide (Fig. 6A) . can be valuable in prospective drug design projects targeting PLpro (Fig. 6B) . Dobutamine is observed to be enriched for 5 conformations including the X-ray structures (PDB IDs: 7JRN and 6W9C). It is a β 1 agonist used in the treatment of congestive heart failure.As shown in Fig. 7 , its dihydroxy phenyl group maintains a pi-pi stacking with Tyr264 phenyl group, and a hydrogen bond with Tyr273. Additionally, the phenol substituent forms a pi-anion interaction with Asp164 amino acid (Fig. 7A) . Fig. S4 and Fig. S5 .Masoprocol is enriched for 6 conformations including the X-ray structure (PDB ID: 7JRN). It is a lipoxygenase inhibitor used as antineoplastic drug for precancerous skin growths. It possesses a structure similarity with Dobutamine, hence, its docking pose reproduced similar binding pi-anion interactions with Asp164 by both phenyl rings. Two additional hydrogen bonds were also predicted between both Leu162 backbone and Gln269 side chain and the dihydroxy phenyl ring, which also forms a T-shaped pi-pi stack with Tyr268. The other dihydroxyphenyl ring also forms a hydrogen bond with Arg166 side chain.The proposed docking poses of the three drugs (benserazide, dobutamine and masoprocol) were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations for 50 ns to test their stability inside the binding site. The values of R g , RMSD, and RMSF indicate stable simulation for these ligand-PLpro complexed forms (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Material) . It is noteworthy mentioning that seven other drugs were predicted to target different conformations of PLpro (Table 1) , namely: Amifostine, Carglumic, Pemirolast, Penciclovir, 5-O-phosphono-alpha-D-ribofuranosyl diphosphate, Pyridoxal and Adenosine phosphate.Amifostine is a prodrug which is dephosphorylated by alkaline dephosphatases to yield the free thiol active drug. It is used as cytoprotective in cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.Carglumic acid is N-acetylglutamate (NAG) synthetic analog which is used in treatment of hyperammonaemia in NAG-deficient patients through activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) liver enzyme to start the urea cycle and convert ammonia into urea. Table T2 in the Supplementary Material.The PLpro apo crystal structure (PDB ID: 6W9C) was subjected to 1 microsecond molecular dynamics simulation at NPT ensemble. The simulation system was prepared using OpenMM Setup utility [57] . AMBER14 [58] force field was used for the protein parameters and TIP3P-FB water model [59] was used for water molecules. A preliminary clean up step was done for the protein PDB file by adding missing OXT atom for LYS315 amino acid. Hydrogen atoms were added at pH value of 7.0. The protein was immersed in a cubic water box with a padding Amber Force Field (GAFF) [60] parameters were used for the three drugs. Both GAFF parameters and ELF10 charges were generated on the fly by the OpenEye toolkits 2019.4.1. [61] Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method [62] was used for the calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions with a 0.0005 error tolerance for truncating the Ewald summation. A 1.2 nm cut off was used for both PME direct space interactions and Lennard-Jones interactions. The length of all bonds that involve a hydrogen atom, and the water molecules, involving their bond length and angles, were constrained. Langevin integrator was utilized for integrating force equations with step size of 2 ns, temperature of 310 K and friction coefficient of 1 ps -1 . Mote Carlo barostat [63] was used for pressure coupling with assigning 310 K as constant temperature value, 1 atm as constant pressure value and 25 steps as pressure update frequency. The dynamics simulations were carried out using OpenMM python application layer [57] . We started the simulation with a minimization step with 10kJ/mole as energy convergence criteria, then, 3,000,000 equilibration steps (6 ns). Finally, the simulation was carried out for 500 million steps (1 microsecond). A trajectory snapshot was reported every 35,000 steps (70 ps), resulting in a final trajectory file of 14,285 total frames. For the three ligand-PLpro MD runs with benserazide, dobutamine and masoprocol, equilibration was run for 500,000 steps (1 ns), the production was run for 25,000,000 steps (50 ns), and trajectory reporting was set to one snapshot per 1000 steps resulting in a trajectory file of 25,000 snapshots. RMSD, RMSF and radius of gyration was calculated out using ProDy python library [64, 65] .As a first step of trajectory clustering, the trajectory frames were aligned on the protein backbone atoms of the starting structure. Then, pairwise RMSD between frames was calculated and stored in a matrix, for backbone in the first clustering run, and heavy atoms of residues T265-H272 in the second run. This matrix was then used in hierarchical clustering of frames implementing the ward method in calculating the distance between the newly formed clusters. A third clustering run was carried out assigning 10 clusters as output cluster numbers. Clustering was carried out using TTClust program [55] .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fDrugBank database [66] was downloaded from www.drugbank.ca (DrugBank -release March 2020) with 2454 ligands. It was prepared by MOE [67] with retrieving one conformer of one protonation state at pH 7.0 implementing Amber: 10EHT forcefield. Multi-conformer file generation for the database was carried out using OMEGA conformer generation module of OpenEye software [68, 69] with a default number of 200 conformers generated for each ligand.The 10 representative protein structures, along with the downloaded protein structures (6W9C and 7JRN), were prepared using MakeReceptor GUI module of OpenEye software [70] . With respect to the 10 representative structures, possible cavities on the protein surface was detected by cavity detection utility of MakeReceptor implementing a molecular probe. Then, the search box dimensions were assigned according to the detected cavity volume of the binding site surrounding the binding site amino acids: L162-E167, P247-P248, Y264-Y273 and T301. Virtual screening was carried out using FRED module of OpenEye software [53, 54] , by docking the multi-conformer DrugBank database file into the prepared protein structures. Protein and protein-ligand 3D interaction figures were generated using UCSF Chimera [71] .Drug repurposing of DrugBank database was carried out by adopting ensemble docking approach for multiple conformations of PLpro SARS-CoV-2 molecular target. Ten PLpro different conformations sampled from 1 µs MD simulation, in addition to two reported PDB PLpro structures, were used for ensemble virtual screening. Based on consensus ranking of the top 1% of the screening hits, three drugs showed to target different conformations with high docking scores and interaction with Tyr268 and Gln269 key binding residues, namely:Benserazide, Dobutamine and Masoprocol. Further MD simulations for these drugs complexed with PLpro indicated higher stability and binding of dobutamine and masoprocol inside the binding site compared to benserazide. Moreover, Metoclopramide, Isocarboxazid, Procainamide and Remoxipride showed the best docking scores over all docking runs combined despite their lower consensus over different conformations. These proposed drugs can be biologically evaluated as potential SARS-CoV-2 treatment candidates. Globally, this protocol can help in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f identifying drugs for repositioning via targeting multiple conformations of a crucial target for the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic.The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.TMI conceived the idea and supervised the project.

This tradeoff has been experienced both in developed and developing economies. While there has been significant progress in tracking the morbidity of COVID-19 globally, there has been limited progress quantifying the disruption of COVID-19 especially in sub-Saharan African countries and in more rural, informal sectors such as agriculture where real-time data is limited. Senegal was one of the first African countries to detect a COVID-19 case (March 2, 2020) and subsequently rapidly mobilized preventative measures such as closing large public gatherings, restaurants, schools, religious sites, aviation, foreign tourism, and imposed curfews, but did not impose a total lockdown (Le Nestour et al., 2020) . COVID-19 cases and deaths have slowly risen, though slower than most countries, with reported confirmed cases of 14,014 and deaths at 291 as of September 8, 2020(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The disruption of such preventative measures on Senegalese food systems is less clear. Disruptions to agricultural markets and supply chains have been widely reported in Senegal with horticultural markets likely one of the hardest hits as they rely heavily on timely access and transportation to markets from rural and peri-urban settings and to demand from urban cities and towns. The timing of the imposed preventative measures also corresponded with much of the horticultural growing season, whereas Senegal had begun to lift restrictions prior to the start of the cereal production season around the end of July to early August 2020. To address these questions, a multidisciplinary team developed a survey using Qualtrics © software. The survey design and implementation followed standard practices in the field (Dillman, Smyth, and Christian, 2014) . The target audience for the survey was smallholder farmers from across Senegal's 14 regions (Dakar, Diourbel, Fatick, Kaffrine, Kaolack, Kédougou, Kolda, Louga, Matam, Saint-Louis, Sédhiou, Tambacounda, Thiès, and Ziguinchor) . The population considered in the survey included smallholder farmers (male and female) from across Senegal. The goal was to survey three districts per region, or 42 districts out of the total of 45 districts. In each district, 20 farmers were targeted, which produced an overall sample size of 885 farmers. In order to be included in the survey, the potential respondents needed to be at least 18 years of age, engaged in smallholder production, and head of household.Once the sample was drawn, the survey was administered with the assistance of ISRA and local enumerators, who were familiar with local languages, agriculture, and cultural context.The database from which the sample was drawn included farmer names, region, and contact information. Respondent anonymity was maintained by ensuring that individual contact information was not linked to the resulting data. In the introductory instructions to the survey, participants were informed that participation was completely voluntary, that the information they shared would not be linked to them or any individual, and that the data would be reported in aggregate form only. It was also clarified that they had the option of withdrawing their participation at any time. These explanations were followed by the first question, which asked respondents specifically if they wished to participate in the survey, and an affirmative response was taken as their consent to continue.The regions were divided up among the enumerators, who were supplied with the survey, translated into the local language, and the names and cellular numbers of the potential J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof respondents. All enumerators were trained and given clear instructions on how to pose the question and document the response for uniformity. Once contact was made, respondent consent was ascertained, and the survey was administered via cellphone. As each respondent gave their answers to the questions, enumerators entered the data directly into the Qualtrics © survey system.Overall, the content of the survey was designed to capture farmer perceptions regarding their agronomic, livestock, and horticultural practices and biophysical conditions as well as social well-being concerns. The questions were relative to the main 2020 agricultural season. For most smallholder farmers, the main cropping season entails a planting season of June to July, and a harvest season of October to December (FAO/GIEWS, 2020). The survey also included demographic questions for disaggregation and analysis purposes. Variables of interest include the perceptions of potential impact of COVID-19 on farming systems and their practices, agricultural productivity, communities, economics, markets, labor, gendered division of labor, food security, and community well-being. A summary of the questionnaire structure in terms of design, questions, sections and possible responses is provided in Table 1 . Of the total sample of 885 potential respondents, 872 agreed to participate in the survey, and 13 declined.The survey was launched on June 5, 2020 and was closed on June 20, 2020. The first documented case of COVID-19 in Senegal was in March 2020 (Dia, et al., 2020; Worldometer, 2020) . During the survey period, the incidence of COVID-19 was increasing in Senegal (from 4,155 to 5,783 confirmed cases) though the average rate of daily increase was relatively low at 2.37% (https://covid19.who.int/region/afro/country/sn). In addition, the majority of the cases were clustered in the capitol city of Dakar. Therefore, the respondents' perceptions, concerns, and expected impacts from COVID-19 were based on a complex combination of access to information, media coverage, and other cultural spread of information in Senegalese society, as well as their own anticipated experiences potentially due to the pandemic.All the data collected from the survey was quantified (means, percentage and frequencies), standard deviation (SD) and analyzed using SPSS, a software package used for statistical analysis.Results from this survey represent a total of 872 respondents with 868 completing the demographic questions. Seventy-three percent of the respondents were male farmers (n = 637) and 27% were female (n = 231). The average age range of the farmers was between 45 -54 years of age with the majority of respondents (86%) between the ages of 35 to 64. Household size ranged from 2 to ""more than 20"" family members per household, though the vast majority (86%) fell in the range of 6 to 20 members. Having said that, 11% of respondents reported a household size of ""more than twenty."" The variation in household sizes depended on the village and compound. Seventy-eight percent of the respondents indicated having a strong relationship with a farmer organization, and 54% of these considered themselves to be active in that organization either most of the time (30%) or about half of the time (24%).Near the top of the survey, all respondents were asked about the primary activity of their farm in order to characterize the farming system as primarily a cropping, livestock, or horticultural system, or whether it was a diversified system. As shown in Table 2 , the large majority of respondents are engaged in farming systems that are primarily cropping (80%), followed by livestock (12.3%), and horticultural systems (3.6%). Those that characterized their farms as diversified made up 4.1%. Results from the diversified response were included in the other three categories (i.e., crops, livestock, and horticultural systems).The following sections will provide a brief description of the farming systems from each category along with the perceived anticipated impacts from COVID-19. Subsequently, we discuss any anticipated mitigation strategies and then the perceived socio-economic and livelihood impacts related to the household and community, and potential issues related to women and youth.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proofAs noted above, 80% of respondents described their farms as primarily cropping systems.The most commonly grown crops among the respondents are shown in Fig. 2 . The frequency of responses shown in the y axis is greater than the number of respondents because they had the option of choosing multiple crops as applicable, for example, if their three main crops were peanut, maize, and millet.A majority (64%) responded that more than half of their crop production is consumed in the household, indicating that these basic grains and cereal crops are critical to the food security in Senegal. Disruptions in these cropping systems would have direct implications for household level food security. Across the country the major crops grown are peanut, maize, pearl millet, rice, sorghum and cowpea (Leippert et al., 2020) . Peanuts (i.e., groundnuts) play an important role in the rural economy as a cash crop and for other crops as well (Diagana et al., 2008) . Table 3 highlights some important findings regarding farmers' anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their cropping systems. The majority of respondents expressed concern that COVID-19 would reduce their access to crop inputs for the season (89.3%), reduce their ability to plant crops (78.9%), and reduce crop yields (79.6%). These percentages are the aggregation of the two response categories ""somewhat agree"" and ""strongly agree."" In addition, slightly more than half of the respondents (51.6%) expressed a concern that COVID-19 would likely impact their ability to rent machinery. These response categories are on a 5-point scale, from 1 = ""strongly disagree"" to 5 = ""strongly agree."" Based on this scale, the highest means for the responses are ""reduce access to crop inputs"" (4.36), ""reduce ability to plant crops"" (4.05), and ""reduce crop yields"" (3.98) ( Table 3) . These collective results suggest strong concerns about the upcoming planting and harvesting season due to COVID-19.Following the questions above regarding farmers' anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their cropping systems, the survey asked respondents to estimate the extent of the expected impacts on crops. For those who anticipate a reduction in their ability to plant (cropped areas), 40.5% estimated that the reduction would be less than a quarter or none at all (aggregates the categories of ""none"" and ""less than a quarter""), and 50.1% anticipate a reduction in their ability to plant crops by less than half or 26% to 50%. The remaining 9.5% anticipate more than half up to a 100% reduction in their ability to plant crops. Similarly, for those who anticipate a reduction J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof in crop yields in the upcoming harvest season (Fig. 3) , 41.6% estimated that the reduction would be less than a quarter or none at all (aggregates the categories of ""none"" and ""less than a quarter""). And 50.3% anticipate a reduction in their anticipated yields by less than half or between 25% to 50%, which could have a major impact on food security. Therefore, as illustrated, a majority of farmers anticipate some impacts related to input access, area planted, and yields, and they appear to believe that these impacts will significantly affect their yields or ability to get their crops planted.As shown in Table 2 , 12.3% of respondents described their farms as primarily livestock systems. The most common livestock raised among the respondents are cattle (67.1%) andgoats/sheep (60.8%) ( Table 4 ). The frequency of responses shown in Table 4 is greater than the number of respondents because they had the option of choosing multiple livestock as applicable, for example, if they raised both cattle and sheep or goats. Herd size (number of animals) ranged from very small (0-5) to very large (>501), though the majority (57.8%) fell in the range of 11 to 100 animals owned. Having said that, there were also 24 respondents (16.9%) in the 6 to 10 animals range, and 28 respondents (19.7%) in the 101 to 500 animals range. Table 5 highlights findings regarding farmers' anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their livestock systems. Similar to the cropping system farmers, substantial majorities expressed concern that COVID-19 would reduce their access to inputs for livestock (85.9%), reduce their ability to feed livestock (78.8%), and reduce their ability to sell livestock (69.7%). These percentages are the aggregation of the two response categories ""somewhat agree"" and ""strongly agree."" Less concern was express about the likely impact of on their ability to rent draft animals for farming operations. This finding could be due to the possibility that few farmers utilize these services, such as renting draft animals, in a typical year. Based on the 5-point scale, (1 = ""strongly disagree"" to 5 = ""strongly agree"") the highest means for the responses are ""reduce access to inputs for livestock"" (4.37), ""reduce ability to feed livestock"" (4.13), and ""reduce ability to sell livestock"" (3.97) ( Table 5) .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fAs noted in Table 2 , 3.6% of respondents described their farms as primarily horticultural systems. The most commonly grown crops among the respondents are shown in Fig. 4 . Table 6 highlights findings regarding farmers' anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their horticultural systems. Substantial majorities expressed concern that COVID-19 would reduce their access to inputs for the season (86.1%), reduce their ability to plant vegetables (73.9%), reduce their ability to hire labor for the upcoming planting season (72.3%), and reduce their yields in the upcoming harvest season (86.1%). These percentages are the aggregation of the two response categories ""somewhat agree"" and ""strongly agree."" Based on the 5-point scale (1 = ""strongly disagree"" to 5 = ""strongly agree""), the means for the responses are ""reduce their access to inputs"" (4.32), ""reduce ability to plant vegetables"" (4.05), ""reduce their ability to hire labor""(4.06), and ""reduce yields"" (4.12)all means of above 4 on a 5 point scale.Following on the questions regarding anticipated impacts on their horticultural systems, the survey also asked respondents to estimate the extent of the expected impacts on horticulture.For those who anticipate a reduction in their ability to plant vegetables, all respondents estimated that the reduction would be less than half (aggregates the categories of ""none"", ""less than a quarter"", and ""less than half""). For those who anticipate a reduction in vegetable yields in the upcoming harvest season, 96.9% estimated that the reduction would be less than half (aggregates the categories of ""none"", ""less than a quarter"", and ""less than half"").As indicated in the survey design (Table 1) , the remaining questions related to adaptation and mitigation of COVID-impacts, livelihoods and social well-being, and challenges related to women, youth, household and community. These questions were asked of all respondents regardless of their farming systems, (e.g., crops, livestock, or horticulture). Therefore, the following results represent the data from all 868 respondents. The sequence of questions began with understanding if farmers anticipated a need to make agricultural adaptations to mitigate the potential impacts of COVID-19. When asked in the survey ""has COVID-19 impacted you directly"", 84.1% of the respondents indicated ""yes"". The next set of questions was related to their potential plans. Thirty-one percent of respondents indicated that there was a ""high to very high"" likelihood that they would change their traditional agricultural practices to mitigate COVID-19 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof impacts. In regard to changing their crop calendar, 36.8% indicated that likelihood was ""very low to low"", and 26.5% indicated the likelihood was ""high to very high"", as illustrated in Table   7 . More than half (53.8%) indicated that the likelihood of being able to hire labor for planting and harvesting for the upcoming cycle was ""very low to low"".Conversely, 60% of respondents indicated that the likelihood of managing their livestock differently was ""very low to low"". When asked what contingency plans they were making (if any), 32% of the respondents indicated that they ""had no plan"" and 45% of the farmers' indicated that they were going to diversify their crops, consider short variety cycles, and intensify their crops in the hopes of increasing production. Some farmers indicated the need to diversify activities (10%) including, ""making an action plan for the gradual resumption of activities, sell animals, and approach banks to obtain funding."" Other responses to this question included financial concerns (8%), ability to obtain support from the government (2%), and the need to modify social mobility activities to protect against the virus (3%), all of which has the potential to impact farming activities and mitigation plans. COVID-19 related to their livelihoods and social well-being. The majority of the respondents expressed concern that COVID-19 would make it more difficult to get enough food on a regular basis for their household (82.5%); that the markets where they purchase food will either be closed or significantly disrupted (79.5%); that the price of food would increase (73.5%); and that the market where they sell their produce/livestock will be either closed or significantly disrupted (73.2%). These percentages are the aggregation of the two response categories ""somewhat agree""and ""strongly agree."" Based on the 5-point scale, the means for the responses are ""getting enough food"" (4.29), ""market closure or disruptions (for purchases)"" (4.06), ""increase price of food"" (4.04), and ""ability to sell produce/livestock"" (3.89), as indicated in Table 8 .In addition to access to food and markets, and potential rising costs, hiring labor is also a critical aspect in the farming systems. As clearly indicated in Fig. 5 , farmers are concerned about the potential negative impacts from COVID-19 and are not very confident that they will have adequate access to labor throughout the coming agricultural cycle. On a scale of ""not at all J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof confident"" to ""very confident"", 47% of the respondents indicated that they were ""not at all confident"" to ""only slightly confident"" that they would have adequate access to off-farm labor, and 39.9% indicated that they were ""somewhat confident"" that they would have adequate access to labor.An additional question, if the farmer depends on off-farm labor, was related to the ability to hire workers for the coming agricultural cycle from their community, the region, or from neighboring countries, which is very common for Senegal (e.g., Guinea-Bissau, Mali).As shown in Fig. 6 , 79% of respondents were confident that they will be able to hire workers from their community, 42.5% from their region, and then their confidence drops to 7.7% from other regions and 1.8% from contiguous countries. The remaining 3.2% indicated having no confidence that they would be able to hire workers due issues related to COVID-19. These concerns are also highlighted in perceived challenges for communities, households, and youth, which is discussed later in this article.Given the potential for disruptions and unanticipated impacts from COVID-19 at the community and household level, the researchers were also interested in exploring the farmers'perceptions of what might be the impact on women and youth, specifically. This is because women play significant role in major agricultural activities (from planting to harvesting and processing) and non-agricultural activities (e.g. family care, nutrition and marketing). Similarly, youth engagement in agricultural activities is also increasing. Table 9 illustrates the perceived impacts of COVID-19 for women. Respondents (64.1%) indicated that they anticipate a significant increase in women's labor in the household (e.g., meal preparation, water collection, childcare), and they anticipate a significant decrease in women's labor in on-farm activities (56.9%), and a significant increase in off-farm activities (e.g., wage labor, market activities)represented by 59.3% of respondents. These percentages are the aggregation of the two response categories ""somewhat agree"" and ""strongly agree."" Based on the 5-point scale, the means for the To further understand the challenges, farmers were asked to identify what they considered the greatest challenges that COVID-19 will pose for women in their household and/or community. Of the 868 responses, the top three challenges were related to: 1) food security and concerns of having access to food (27%); 2) social well-being and adapting to household needs due to the pandemic (24%); and 3) financial concerns (17.4%). Other topics that emerged were the need to diversify activities and to focus on health issues related to cleanliness and mobility.Respondents were also asked to reflect on their perceptions of what might occur for youth due to COVID-19, as illustrated in Table 10 and Fig. 7 . When aggregating the response categories of ""somewhat agree"" and ""strongly agree"" in the 5-point scale, approximately 60% of respondents indicated that they anticipate a significant increase in youth's labor in on-farm activities (e.g., weeding, planting) and 70% of respondents anticipate a significant increase in off-farm activities (e.g., wage labor, market activities).Farmers were also asked to identify what they considered the greatest challenges that COVID-19 will pose for youth and the vast majority of the comments (75%) were related to jobs, (un)employment, and concerns of poverty. Other comments related to the need to keep youth engaged in economic activities, preferably in agriculture (8%). Other challenges were related to social well-being (5%), health concerns (4%), food security (3%), and fear of exile and/or idleness (2.5%). Interestingly, 5.5% of the responses indicated that they did not anticipate any challenges for the youth.To augment our understanding of issues related to livelihoods and social well-being, the survey included questions related to access to social services and financial support. On a scale of ""not at all confident"" to ""very confident"", 52% of the respondents indicated that they were ""not at all confident"" to ""only slightly confident"" that they would have access to other social services to help their household, and 51.8% of the respondents indicated their lack of confidence of having access to farm credit, subsidies and other financial supports. These results in Table 11 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof align with the comments from the challenges indicated by the farmers at the household and community level.When asked ""what are the greatest challenges that COVID-19 will pose for your household"", 55% of the 868 respondents indicated concerns related to food security, access to food, and potential famine. They also indicated concerns related to social well-being, access to services, and the precariousness of the situation (19%), as well as concerns with lack of jobs, employment, and potential poverty (16.5%). The remaining challenges were related to health, cleanliness, and following the COVID-19 preventative measures (8%). Similarly, when asked about challenges for the community, the main concerns were food security and fear of famine (44%), availability of jobs and fear of poverty (18.9%), and health (12.7%) and social well-being (11.8%) concerns. Other challenges that were mentioned were related to the need to change and/or reorganize their cultural and social systems to 'strengthen solidarity between the different strata of society' (4.7%), and the need to comply and respect the government's response to the pandemic (2%).The objective of this study was to understand farmer perceptions of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on agricultural practices and social well-being of smallholder farmers in Senegal.In designing the survey, we were particularly interested identifying any potential vulnerabilities in Senegalese farming systems that might raise concerns about the resilience of these systems. A key point is that across the three farming systems (cropping, livestock, horticulture) significant majorities expressed concerns, especially related to access to inputs, ability to plant (cropping, horticulture), reduction of yields (cropping, horticulture), ability to feed livestock, ability to sell livestock, and the ability to hire labor (horticulture) (see Tables 3, 5 , 6). These could point to important vulnerabilities in the farming systems but may also provide opportunities for specific interventions and capacity building efforts.While a large majority of respondents say they have been impacted by COVID-19(84.1%), few adaptive and mitigative activities are being put in place. Nonetheless, when asked about the likelihood that they would change traditional practices and/or change their cropping calendar, the largest response groups (about 36%) were in the ""medium"" category (Table 7) . ThisJournal Pre-proof may suggest an openness on the part of at least some farmers to mitigative strategies, and therefore an opportunity for outreach and capacity building around best practices to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19.The majority of respondents expressed concern that COVID-19 would make it more difficult to get enough food on a regular basis for their household (82.5%); that the markets where they purchase food will either be closed or significantly disrupted (79.5%); that the price of food would increase (73.5%); and the market where they sell their produce/livestock will be either closed or significantly disrupted (73.2%) (Table 8) . Indeed, 55% of the 868 respondents indicated concerns related to food security, access to food, and potential famine. Further, when asked about their likely access to social and other services, 52% of the respondents indicated that they were ""not at all confident"" to ""only slightly confident"" that they would have access to other social services to help their household, and 51.8% of the respondents indicated their lack of confidence of having access to farm credit, subsidies and other financial supports (Table 11) .Finally, respondents were also concerned about the impact for women, specifically 64.1% anticipated a significant increase in women's labor in the household (e.g., meal preparation, water collection, childcare), and they anticipate a significant decrease in women's labor in onfarm activities (56.9%), and a significant increase in off-farm activities (e.g., wage labor, market activities) represented by 59.3% of respondents. In regard to impacts for youth, approximately 60% of respondents indicated that they anticipate a significant increase in youth's labor in onfarm activities (e.g., weeding, planting) and 70% of respondents anticipate a significant increase in off-farm activities (e.g., wage labor, market activities). And 75% of respondents were concerned about jobs, (un)employment, and concerns of poverty.The survey results captured the perceptions, concerns, and anticipated impacts from COVID-19 and indicates a need to address these concerns to reduce the anticipated impacts from the pandemic. It is clear from the results that the anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on agriculture will be felt on both the biophysical aspects such as production and access to inputs as well as socioeconomic aspects such as access to labor, markets, or rapid shifts in demand. Across all farming systems (cropping, livestock, horticulture), there are significant concerns about J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof access to inputs, the stability of markets (for both buying and selling), and access to labor.Identifying challenges related to the community, household, women and youth there was clear concerns related to food security (famine), social well-being, access to financial services, and the precariousness of the situation, as well as concerns with lack of jobs, (un)employment, and potential poverty.The perceptions from this study are beneficial and warrant a more in-depth examination of the actual impacts from COVID-19 on the farming systems related to the agronomic and biophysical issues as well as the impact on the livelihood and social well-being of the families as the community and household levels. This study supports the need to use a farming systems approach to gather perceived and actual impacts of COVID-19 on smallholder farmers across production, environmental, economic, social and human domains. It will also be important to examine the actual impacts related to the challenges faced by women and youth especially in regard to labor, income, and health. Based on this study, the researchers plan on conducting a follow up survey and potential in-depth interviews and/or focus groups to better understand actual impacts of COVID-19, with the hope to identify the characteristics that strengthen smallholder farming systems resilience to adjust to anticipated and unanticipated shocks, such as COVID-19, to decrease the negative impacts and increase the rate of recovery. In addition, there would be value in evaluating the catastrophic predictions made about the impact of COVID 19 in terms of mortality and morbidity particularly in developing poor countries, such as Senegal.Lastly, it is important to recognize the need to document the policies and approaches implemented by the Senegalese government in developing and monitoring structures for the improvement of smallholder resilience, but this was beyond the scope of this study.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest or no competing interest.

The high transmission of the coronavirus among all age groups and the increasing fatalities among people with comorbidity have required governments to take different measures that have restricted human mobility and put many economies on hold [1] . Moreover, with the daily exponential increase of the number of cases, COVID-19 has overwhelmed the health care capacities of many countries [2] . As a result, there is a need to find the immediate solutions to the saturated capacity of hospitals by increasing the number of hospital acute and critical beds [3, 4] , as well as, providing the healthcare personnel (HCP) with enough and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) [5] . In fact, the HCP are vulnerable populations to the infection if there is not enough shortage of PPE, or if the PPE are not effectively used [6] . Recent report by the International Council of Nurses [7] has revealed that 90,000 HCP have been infected, and more than 260 nurses have died.As the pandemic is still taking many lives everyday, it is very important to understand if the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) [8] are effective in reducing the burden on the public health. Keep in mind that some countries choose to have drastic measures, other countries choose to not [9] . The decision of taking any measure to protect the population should take into consideration: (A) to protect the most vulnerable population, particularly the elderly population which has high mortality rate [10, 11] (B) the capacity of the healthcare system [12] and the economical cost of such measures. In fact, American Hospital Association has estimated a total lost of $202.6 billion for America's hospitals and health systems in four months [13] .Mathematical models are among highly used tools,by many governments, to help in decision making during this pandemic [20] . Many models were able to give different estimations of the end of the pandemic and the number of the people that could be infected in different countries [23, [26] [27] [28] [29] . However, there is a need for mathematical models that help to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 for the most vulnerable population: Elderly people. As this population is most likely to be hospitalized, due the current pandemic, such models should be able to estimate the hospital bed capacity needed to give the proper care to the COVID-19 patients in general and COVID-19 patients with comorbidity, which are mainly the elderly. As the majority of the countries, affected by the COVID-19, are implementing control measures to effectively contain the spread of this disease, it also important to evaluate, via mathematical models, the impact of such measure on the public health capacity. Finally, we need to get more insight of the effect the scarcity of the PPE on the dynamic of the spread of the disease.For these purposes, we propose an age-structured model that investigates the projected number of infected cases, number of acute and critical hospital beds needed in three different countries USA, UAE, Algeria. To examine the impact of the NPI on each country, our estimations are made using the data before April 20th, 2020, and the second for data between April 21st and May 15th, 2020, where we will highlight the variations on the value of the basic reproduction number and the transmission rate in terms of these two time series. We also examine the possible impact of a full lockdown, if implemented, on the dynamics of the disease. Finally, we investigate the effect of unavailability of the PPE on the transmission of the disease.The content of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is devoted to constructing the mathematical model using a detailed epidemiological background of the parameters. The method of approximation is also given. In Section 3, we give the estimation of the peak pandemic outbreak time and the number of the infection cases are determined. Finally, the number of the needed beds generated by this peak is provided. In addition, the basic reproduction number is calculated for each one of the studied countries. We examine the achievements of each country, after implementing NPI, on reducing the spread COVID-19 and its influence of the value of the epidemic peak outbreak. The effect of the full lockdown on the peak outbreak pandemic is the subject of our investigation in Section 5. The influence of the scarcity of the PPE on the peak epidemic outbreak and the number of the infection cases is examined in Section 6. A conclusion is presented at the end of the paper.In this section, we present the mathematical model for predicting the pandemic of COVID-19. The model is an agestructured model [16] [17] [18] 25, 31] that takes into consideration the age as a factor of the progress and severity of this disease.The corresponding model is given by the following structure:where S t; a ð Þ; I t; a ð Þ are, respectively, the fraction of the susceptible and infected individuals at time t and age a. C t ð Þ represents the fraction of hospitalized individuals at time t. The hospitalized individuals mean those who are infected and in a need for acute or critical beds. This fraction of the population might infect their soundings including the HCP. This situation can happen when the right PPE is not available or is not efficient to protect from the COVID-19 infection. In our model, we consider the parameter a that measures the degree of protection of the HCP. Meaning, when a ¼ 0 there is full protection, for a ¼ 1 there is no protection. This rate changes from one country to another depending on how much of the medical protection standards are followed and the supply of PPE is available. In the context of our study, it is natural to assume that the standard of the protection of the HCP against COVID-19 is higher in the UAE and USA than in Algeria.The parameter 1=lrepresents the average time spent by an infected person in the hospital care before either she/he dies or recovers. In general, this value is between 10 and 20 days [14, 15] . In our context, we suppose that 1 l ¼ 15. This parameter can be written as l ¼ l 1 þ l 2 , with l 1 is the mortality rate and l 2 is the recovery rate as a result of a successful medical intervention. The parameter 1 c ¼ 10 is the average of the infection period [32, 22] . b is the transmission rate. The integral R þ1 0 I t; a ð Þda represents the total fraction of the infectious individuals at time t.We also make the assumption that the infectioness of the COVID-19 depending on the age of the patient, we consider the following function.where s ¼ 60. It is very important to mention that the initial conditions will be considered depending on the country considered as it is presented in following Table 2 .For the well-posedness of the systems, we define the following spaceÞis the space of functions that are positive and Lebesgue integrable, which is equipped with the normWe suppose that the initial conditions S 0 ; I 0 ; C 0 ð Þ2H. Using a similar approach as in [21, 16] , we can deduce that (2.1) has a unique positive solution for initial conditions that belongs to the space H.We define the basic reproduction number R 0 , which represents the number of the new infectious cases by one infected individual in the infection period during a given time of spread of the COVID-19 [19, 33] .Now, we are interested in approximating the transmission rate b. Obviously, this rate changes from one country to another as each country has a different level of intervention such as lockdown, social distancing, and curfew. Calculating the total fraction of the infected individuals and the susceptible ones by integrating the first and the second equation of the model (2.1), we obtainWe also haveBy replacing the inequality (2.4) into the third equation of the system (2.3), we get the following inequality:As any pandemic, there is an exponential growth in the beginning of the time series of number of cases. Therefore, we assume that the total fraction of the infected individuals i t ð Þ has the following special form:where x 1 represents the proportion of the declared infection cases by the World Health Organization [34] on the first of April, 2020. To obtaining the best value of x 2 at which is an approximation to the declared infection cases, we use the method of least squares method for approximation the real data by an exponential functional. The obtained results are highlighted in Table 3 . From the second equation of (2.3) we get retrieve the maximum of the real data, and we obtain the values of b for each country as it is highlighted in Table 3 .3. Simulation of COVID-19 peak using data before 20/04/2020Based on these approximations, we give the following prediction on the COVID-19 epidemic in the USA, the UAE, and Algeria.In the case of the USA, from Fig. 2 , we expect the peak to be reached at t ¼ 45 (which means May 05th) with a proportion of 0:007786 of the total population to be infected, that is, 2 555 365 infection cases. Currently, the number of active case is around 1; 364; 000, which is 1 M more than our estimation. In fact, our finding reflect the possible number of cases in the USA if no containment measures were taking. The infection will end after three months it starting which means by the end of June. At t ¼ 58 , our simulation shows that the number of hospital beds needed will reach 833960. Moreover, Fig. 2 shows that infection will appear mostly in the aged individuals.In the case of the UAE and based on the parameters values in Table 3 , Fig. 3 represents the number of the infection cases, as well as the prediction the time pandemic peak outbreak. Based on our simulation, the number of infected cases would reach its highest at t ¼ 56 starting from the first of April 2020, meaning on May 26th, with the proportion 1:67% of the total of population to be infected, which is equivalent to 165360 infection cases. Next, it will decrease brutally and the infection will disappear 100 days starting from the first of April 2020, which means around July 9th. On the other hand, the maximum number of beds needed will 63138 on t ¼ 66, i.e. June 6th, 2020.In the case of Algeria, Fig. 4 shows the prediction of the peak number at t ¼ 51, which is on May 21st, with the proportion 0.0005579 of the total of population which is equivalent to 23 052 of the population been infected. We also predict the end of the pandemic to be at end of June and beginning of July. In terms of the number of hospital beds needed, we estimated the peak of the number of hospital beds to be, 8545 beds, on May 31th; by the end of June all beds related to epidemic will be released.As the prediction of the previous section were based on the data from the beginning of April until April 20th. In this section, we are interested in analyzing the impact of the NPI, taken by different governments after April 20th, on reducing the burden of the disease on the health care capacity. For this purpose, we use the data of number of infections in the three countries, reported by WHO [34], between April 21st and May 15th.By using the same method as the previous section, we obtain the values of x 1 and x 2 on the following figure (see Fig. 5 ).Which leads us to the new estimation of parameters in the following table (see Table 4 ).Next, we use these estimations to investigate the peak of the epidemic. Similar to the approach of the previous section, we get the results of Fig. 6 .Consequently, we observe a clear reduction of the number of the infected people at the peak of the pandemic in the three countries (As shown in Table 5 ). Moreover, with the NPI, the peak day of each country will be delayed compared to the previous estimation. For the USA, the peak is on t ¼ 53 (May 13th), for UAE t ¼ 63 (June 2nd) and for Algeria t ¼ 61 (May 31st).Since not all the countries were able to stop the community transmission of the COVID-19 by the NPI, we would like to know how a full lockdown, if it was applied, would have affected the progress of the COVID-19. The full lockdown means to completely restrict all social movements. For this purpose, we choose the transmission rate as a constant before applying the lockdown and it exponentially decreases after applying the lockdown [24] . By using this assumption and based on the results obtained in the previous section, we can see that the transmission rate becomes smaller (see Tables 3  and 5 ). Therefore, we consider the transmission rate as a decreasing function of time. More precisely, we suggest the following form of b t ð Þ Table 3 Estimation of x 1 ; x 2 , the transmission rate and the basic reproduction number. Fig. 1 The approximation x 1 and x 2 using the data [34] where the values used in Table 3 are used for each sample and t ¼ 0 represents the date 01=04=2020. Indeed, we consider that b 0 takes the values highlighted in Table 3 , l ¼ 0:16 (see [24] ) and T represents the time of applying the lockdown where it is supposed to be applied at T ¼ 30. In Fig. 7 , we investigated the influence of this restriction on the peak of the epidemic and the date of the end of the infection.The Fig. 7 shows the simulation of the number of infected people and number of the beds needed in the case of the full lockdown. The blue curves represent the obtained results in Figs. 2-4 , i.e. without lockdown, which is summarized in the Table 6 . The green curves represent the time series of the epidemic in each country in the case of the lockdown. The findings of this case is presented in the Table 7 .From these two tables, we find that the UAE would benefit the most from a 30-day full lockdown as the number of Table 3 are used for each sample and t ¼ 20 represents the date April 21st, 2020. Table 4 Estimation of x 1 ; x 2 , the transmission rate and the basic reproduction number on the period between April 21st to May 15th, 2020.Country Fig. 6 The influence of the measures taken after 21/04/2020 on the value of the pandemic peak of COVID-19.infected people will drop to 24% from the original estimation and then Algeria with 43:3%. However, the USA will benefit less from this measure with a drop to only 72:2%. Similarly in the case of hospital beds needed, with a full lockdown, the UAE needs will drop to 13:1% from the original estimation.In the case of Algeria, the number of hospital beds needed will drop to 23:8%, and for the USA it will drop by more than half, to 44:7%. By applying such strict measures, our simulations show that the epidemic would finish after 63 day, which means by June 2nd, 2020.6. The effect of the PPE on the spread of COVID-19In this section, we are interested in analyzing the efficacy of the availability of the PPE on the spread of the COVID-19 among the HCP. In our model (2.1), the parameter that represents this efficacy is a. In reality, as the number of the infected cases increases the HCP are obligated to increase their work load, which makes them more susceptible to infection, particularly if there is a shortage or an improper use of the PPE. Therefore, we consider that a is an increasing functional in i t ð Þ. and we choose the following special form:N is the total size of the population and qis the percentage of individuals that uses the PPE.In fact, i t ð Þ ¼ R þ1 0 I t; a ð Þda ¼ 0 (there is no infection) then a ¼ 0, which means the PPE is available, and there is no chance for an HCP to be infected during their contact with an infected person at the hospital. On the other hand, for i t ð Þ ¼ 1, which means that all the population is infected, a approaches 1, i.e. the PPE is scarce or unable to protect the HCP. Fig. 7 The effect of the full lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 in the USA ((A) and (B)), the UAE ((C) and (D)) and Algeria ((E) and (F)). The blue figures represent the case of the absence of restriction and the green curves represent the case of the full lockdown.By replacing a with a i t ð Þ ð Þ in the system (2.1), we obtain the simulations of the Fig. 8 . In these plots, we can see that the availability of the PPE affects the peak of the epidemic, where the peak becomes higher, the green curve represents the dependence on the availability of the PPE to the infected case a i ð Þ, where the blue curve shows the times series of the disease in Figs. 2-4. In these simulations, we calculated the number of nurses and doctors of each country and estimated the q ¼ 0:715% for the USA, q ¼ 0:117% for the UAE and q ¼ 0:16% for Algeria.From these simulations, it is clear that the shortage of the PPE could cause doubling of the number of infected cases as well as the number of hospital beds needed. However, it does not affect the time of the peak nor the end of the epidemic. Which conclude the importance of the availability PPE is lowering the number of the transmission the healthcare facility, long term care and among the general public.In this paper, we presented an age-structured model to predict the size of epidemic in three different countries: the USA, the UAE and Algeria. This model takes in consideration the number of hospital beds needed for the COVID-19 patients that need either acute or critical care. Table 6 The main characteristic of the pandemic in the absence of the restriction of human movement strategy. The time t ¼ 0 refers to the date 01=04=2020.We first consider the number of infected cases from the beginning of the epidemic until April 20th, 2020. We calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 for each country data set. We also estimated the time peak of each country and the number of the cases and hospital beds needed. By looking at the current data of each country, we had overestimated the number of cases at the peak as well as the time of the peak. Naturally, the number of beds needed was also overestimated. In fact, these estimations did not take in consideration the efforts that each country made, after April 20th, 2020, to contain the pandemic, and it shows the possible impact of the COVID-19 if the governments did not take the right measures to protect the public health.By assuming that all these countries started the NPI measures after April 20th, we fitted our model to the data between April 21st and May 14th, 2020 to re-estimate the main parameters of our model. The prediction of the characteristic of the pandemic is highlighted in Table 5 . Compared to the previous scenario, the main conclusions are: (a) the three countries made substantial efforts to reduce the spread of COVD-19 disease, which shows clearly the reduction of the basic reproduction number, (b) the NPI measures were able to reduced the size of the pandemic and delayed its peak.Next, we investigated the question of the possible impact of a full lockdown, if applied, on the population to contain the spread of the disease. We assumed that each country applied the full lockdown starting from April 20th. With this scenario, in 30 days the virus would vanish from the three countries and community infection would disappear. Although such measure will have economical effects on each country and psychological effects on the population, it will help to reduce the burden on the healthcare capacity as shown in the Tables 6 and 7.In the last part of the paper, we studied the effect of the unavailability or improper use of the PPE on the spread of the COVID-19 among the HCP. By assuming that the infection could be transmitted to the HCP, via the patients in acute and critical conditions, our simulation showed that such scenario would double the number of the infected people and numbers of hospital beds needed at the peak of the pandemic. Which is a clear indication of the importance of providing enough stocks of PPE to HCP as well as for the care givers in long-term care facility.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","Algeria","abstract","2021-02-28",2

In Ethiopia, the first case was detected on March 13, 2020. 2, 3 The total numbers of cases, recoveries, and deaths as of October 8, 2020 were 80,895, 35,670 and 1225, respectively. Ethiopia is one of the developing Sub-Saharan African countries facing the double burden of infectious and noninfectious diseases. 4 On top of this, the current pandemic of COVID-19 brings additional frustration to the country. 5, 6 The world's prison population is estimated at around 11 million, with rates of incarceration ranging from 698 per 100,000 population in the United States to as low as 16 per 100,000 in the Central African Republic. 7 In Ethiopia, there are approximately 113,727 people incarcerated. 8 People destitute of their liberty, such as people in prison institutions and detention centers, are likely to be more vulnerable to the coronavirus disease outbreak than people who live outside because of the cramped conditions in which they live together for long periods. 9, 10 Moreover, the current situation shows that in prison and detention facilities, people incarcerated gathered in close proximity may act as a source of infection, magnification, and spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 within and beyond prisons and detention centers. 11, 12 Prison health is, therefore, generally considered public health. 10, 13 Most prison institutions and detention centers were built to take full advantage of public safety; not to minimize the transmission of communicable disease or to competently deliver health-care services. 14 The probability of transmission of potentially infectious diseases such as COVID-19 are increased by crowding, 15 interruptions in medical evaluation and treatment, inadequate resource and limited access to soap, water, and clean laundry, insufficient infection-control expertise and prohibitions against the use of proven harm reduction tools. 13, 16 Besides, many prisons and detention centers lack sufficient information technology; clinical information-sharing between institutions and the different jurisdictions responsible for the care of inmates is often poor. 9 The high prevalence of mental illness among prisoners and detainees often complicates the proper management of contagious illnesses like the COVID-19 pandemic. [17] [18] [19] The systemic neglect of prisons and other places of detention in many countries have resulted in inadequate resources, management, oversight and accountability mechanisms, including ill-equipped personnel, and limited links to public health systems. Prison overcrowding persists in most countries and constitutes one of the most fundamental obstacles to providing safe and healthy custodial environments in line with fundamental human rights. 20, 21 Confined accommodation, unhygienic conditions, ventilation, and nutrition as well as inadequate health-care services in many prison systems will in the same way challenge infection control measures and thus considerably raise the risk for infection, increase and spread of COVID-19. 22, 23 The majority of prisoners and detainees will eventually return to their families. Therefore, the situation of a rapid increase transmission of COVID-19 within prisons and detention centers will have an amplifying effect on the epidemic within the total population. 24, 25 The high turnover of prisoners being admitted and released as well as the daily interaction of prisoners with prison officers, health-care professionals, visitors and service providers all provide for an intrinsic link between prisons and public health. 24, 26, 27 On these grounds, any control strategy for COVID-19 in the community that does not embrace the prison institution and detention center context will not be sustainable. 9 In Ethiopia, the Ministry of Peace and Federal Prison Administration is in charge of health in prisons. The central government and the authorities of the regions have contingency plans for COVID-19 prevention and control, which is a suspension of the visits of family members and progressive isolation from the external community. However, it does not embrace the adoption of practices to identify possible cases and to treat infected subjects. In regional prisons, conditions are much worse because of greater overcrowding, poor hygiene, and environmental conditions (poor ventilation system, indiscriminate disposal of solid and liquid waste, limited access to bathroom and toilet facilities, and insufficient supply of safe water) and inadequate medical facilities. 28 Confirmed COVID-19 cases among prisoners and prison officers have been reported in many parts of the world, including Ethiopia. This number, however, is almost certain to increase alarmingly in the future. In addition, the burden is already high in prison institutions and detention centers around the world due to the introduction of other restrictions, such as the suspension of prison visits and furloughs. 29, 30 In Ethiopia, the federal and regional governments decided to pardon to more than 40,000 prisoners in an effort to hold the spread of COVID-19, focusing on those with a maximum sentence of less than one year and approaching their release, elderly prisoners, including women detainees with children and expectant mothers. 23 There is no evidence regarding the total number of cases and deaths in prison facilities in Ethiopia.However, to date, there are plenty of prisons and detention centers in Ethiopia, including Bench-Sheko, Sheka, West Omo, and Kaffa prison institutions, which have been living in gathering ways and uncomfortable situations. In addition, prisons and detention centers often lack sufficient hand washing areas, quarantine rooms, and personal protective equipment. 31 answer a research question, whether the correctional facilities were prepared and ready against COVID-19 pandemic in Bench-Sheko, Sheka, West Omo, and Keffa zones southwest, Ethiopia.The study was conducted in Bench-Sheko, Sheka, West Omo, and Kaffa zones from May 1 to June 30, 2020. Bench-Sheko zone which is one of the 16 zones in the Southern Nation Nationality and Regional state, it is located 585 km away from Addis Ababa, the center of Ethiopia, in a southwest direction with an estimated population of 829,493 and the primary health service coverage of the zone is 92.6%, covering a total catchment area of 19,965.8 km 2 with the majority 86% (1,061,120) of the population living in the rural areas. The zone has about 39 functional health centers. The zone, has one prison institution and eight detention centers having more than 2500 prisoners.Kaffa zone is located at 468 km from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Administratively, the zone has 10 districts and one town administration. Based on the 2007 census of the central statistical agency of Ethiopia (CSA), the total population of the zone was estimated to be 1,171,133, of whom 578,151 (49.4%) were males and 592,982 (50.6%) were females. This zone has one general public hospital, one primary hospital, and 43 public health centers. There are 12 detention centers and one prison institution with 2500 prisoners in the zone.Sheka zone is located approximately 700 km southwest of Addis Ababa. The geographical condition of the area lies between 07° 07.494 ̍ to 07° 52.301 ̍ N and 035° 16.576 ̍ to 035° 39.516 ̍ E with altitudinal ranges of 950 to 2780. This zone has one general public hospital, six public health centers, and one prison institution, five detention centers and having more than 1200 prisoners.West Omo zone is a newly established zone of the South Nation Nationalities and Peoples of Ethiopian Regional State which has seven districts and 116 kebeles (112 rural and four urban), with a total population of 272,943 constituting 12% of regional populations and inhabited by a pastoral community of 135,025 (49.47%) male, 137,918 (50.53%) rural resident 243,738 (89.3%) urban residents 28,113 (10.7%). The total households are 55,703. Regarding health infrastructure, this zone has two hospitals and 13 health centers,94 health posts which make the zone basic health service coverage 90% and health centers and health posts coverage 98% and 90% respectively and one prison institution, nine detention centers and having more than 2000 prisoners.A cross-sectional study design mixed with qualitative approach was conducted. All prisons and detention centers found in in Bench-Sheko, Sheka, West Omo and Kaffa zones were taken as the source population, while randomly selected detention centers and all prisons found in Bench-Sheko, Sheka, West Omo, and Kaffa zones were considered as the study population.The four prisons found in the zones and 50% of the detention centers were included. During the selection of detention centers simple random sampling technique was used, first, the list of all detention centers found in each district was obtained from respective zonal administration then, using the list of detention centers as a sampling frame 50% of the detention centers were selected randomly giving 17 detention centers.Interview guide and observational checklist were adapted from WHO for evaluation of risk assessment and management techniques. It has eight sub-themes: human rights, risk assessment and management, referral system and clinical management, contingency planning, training, risk communication, preventive measures, and case management of the prison institutions and detention centers against This tool was validated by WHO and recommended to assess correctional facilities readiness against COVID-19 pandemic.As part of ensuring the quality of the data, a pretest was conducted on 5% of the detention centers which were not included in the study. Accordingly, an amendment was made based on the result of the pretest. The interview was conducted with open-ended question with purposively selected 50 prisons and detention center's top managers and team leaders such as chief executive of prisons (4), head of detention centers (17) , shift coordinators (21), head of prison clinics (4), and head of the prison cafeteria (4) .The data were collected by four BSc nurses after providing extensive training on the objective of the study, contents of the questionnaire, data collection procedure, infection prevention and control techniques including proper use of personal protective equipment. The data collection process was supervised by three health-care professionals having a BSc degree in public health. Supervision was made on the daily basis, checking completeness, and consistency of the collected data was made.The data were cleaned, edited, coded, and entered into EpiData manager, and exported to SPSS software version 25. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were used to describe each item under the sub-themes of WHO risk assessment checklist. The final result was presented using tables. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim, translated to English language, and analyzed with Open code version 4.02 software and content analysis was followed. Codes and categories were developed and findings were summarized by supporting with quotes from respective study participants. Moreover, the data coded by researchers independently and we brought the codes together to see intercoder consistency.Ethical approval letter was granted from Mizan-Tepi University Ethical Review Board. The official letter of cooperation was obtained from the zonal health bureau. Before conducting the interviews, information was given to the participants, and respondents were assured of voluntary participation, confidentiality, anonymity and freedom to withdraw from the study at any time. In addition, the objective of the study was explained with the nature of the study and associated risk and benefit. Moreover, the verbal informed consent was approved by the Mizan-Tepi University Ethical Review Board, and this study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Based on assessment of the facilities in implementing protocols of health service accessible for people in prison facilities comparable to those in the general population; five out of 17 detention centers and three out of four prison facilities fulfill the standards. Based on observed basic living standards (space, fresh air, light, and sanitation), neither prison facilities nor detention centers provided appropriate services. All prison facilities and detention centers permitted people in prison more than one hour of outside activities daily. In one prison facility and three detention centers noncustodial actions for the running of criminal justice were being used (eg electronic tagging and physical exercise). Moreover, the following are part of responses from study participants:Even though the number of prisoners was reduced after decided pardon by the federal and regional governments, prisoners are living in a very crowded place. In this situation, it is difficult for us to practices coronavirus prevention measures such as keeping physical distance. (A chief executive of prison study participant) I have encountered some prisoners presented with anxiety, after they were done compulsory physical exercise and beaten up by prison officials. (A head of prison clinic study participant)Regarding risk assessment and management, none of the detention centers and only two of the prison facilities had indepth archives of people moving in and out of the facility. Again, none of the detention centers and only one of the prison facilities had risk assessment held on people entering the facility. The facilities also claimed that the assessment is being undertaken even on prison officers entering the facility at each access. However, none of the facilities had a dedicated area for risk assessment ( Table 1 ). The key informants added to this issue saying: I think it is important to undertake risk assessment on every individual before entering prison and detention centers; however, we do not have dedicated screening area and assigned health personnel to do so. (A head of prison clinic study participant) Unlike prison facilities, detention centers do not have clinics and health personnel to care for detainees. As a result, we are facing challenges to undertake different measures and risk assessment related to corona virus. (A head of detention center study participant)Prisons' and detention centers' health personnel were asked if there was quick access to laboratory test in case they encounter suspected case; and all of the prison and detention centers reported that they did not have this. Only two of the prison facilities mentioned that laboratory-confirmed cases had access to quarantine and management. But the quarantines were not adequate and not as per the national protocol. All the prison and detention center staffs mentioned that health-care teams dealing with the collection of biological submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of General Medicine 2021:14 samples had no access to the essential protective equipment as described in the WHO prison guideline ( Table 2 ). One of the study participants described his concern on this issue as follows: Despite having referral system and clinical management recommended by national protocol, we do not have a functional laboratory, clinical management, and referral system in our facility. (A chief executive of prison study participant) Five of the prison facilities and three of the detention centers reported the presence of a contact approach to deal with public and risk communication about disease outbreaks in prison. None of the detention centers and three of the prison facilities claimed to have a mechanism to gather and integrate the risk perception of people in prison, staff, and visitors in message development. Key messages were communicated in a clear, accurate and relevant manner to people in prison facilities about preventive measures, especially hand hygiene and respiratory good manners in almost all prisons and detention centers. However, information on COVID-19 was not accessible through relevant channels and tools were not conveyed by trusted influencers/mediators in all facilities ( Table 3 ). One of the study participants stated the concern as follows:We have made an effort to communicate the prisoners on frequent hand washing and keeping respiratory hygiene, but detail information on the nature of coronavirus disease was not communicated yet. (A head of prison clinic study participant)Regarding prevention measures, there is no standard in place to handle officers who meet the definition of a suspected or confirmed case in all prisons and detention centers. In all facilities there are routines and facilities that allow hands to be washed with soap and water and dried using single-use towels. But there is no wall-mounted liquid-soap, paper towels, and facilities in place that allow appropriate physical distancing (Table 4 ). In addition, one of them described the concern as follows:In different corners of the prison facility, there are posted material reminding hands to be washed with soap and water, however, we do not have other necessary materials such as paper towel and face mask. (A chief executive of prison study participant)All detention centers and prison facilities were not integrated into the local/national epidemiological surveillance system. Besides, neither detention centers nor prison facilities had isolated and single accommodation places, facilities designated exclusively as well as health-care professionals assigned to care for suspected and identified COVID-19 cases according to national protocols. One of the study participants explained the issue as follows:submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of General Medicine 2021:14If we encounter suspected case, there is no clear structure to communicate with a concerned body. Also, there is no isolation and quarantine center in our facility to manage suspected case. (A head of prison clinic study participant)People in prison facilities and detention centers are highly vulnerable to communicable diseases. 7, 12, 33 Prisoners and detainees in those facilities live in close proximity with Is there a mechanism to gather and integrate the risk perception of people in prison, staff and visitors in message development? . 34 This aim of this study was to assess preparedness, prevention and control of COVID-19 in prison facilities and detention centers. In this study, most prison facilities and some detention centers had not provided standards of health care for prisoners and detainees. This is inconsistent with the WHO recommendation, which states the supply of appropriate health-care services for all people in prisons and detention centers to be given without insight on the grounds of their legal status. 8, 25 This might be due to resource insufficiency associated with poor financing of correctional institutions and other administration issues. In all studied facilities, people in prisons were allowed more than one hour of outdoor activities daily. This finding is in line with WHO and UNODC standards. 21, 25 Regarding basic living standards for people in prison, none of the facilities provided appropriate service. This finding contradicts WHO recommendation on the handling of prisons. 13, 25 This might be related to inappropriate construction of facilities that did not consider criteria of enough space, fresh air, light, and sanitation.Although WHO recommends that prisons and detention centers have a full registry of all people moving in and out of the facility, 25 almost all of the detention centers and two out of the four prisons facilities had not made an effort to have a full registry of all people moving in and out of the facility as presented in Table 1 . As part of an endeavor to tackle the rapid spread of the virus in highly vulnerable places like prisons and detention centers, it is imperative to undertake risk assessment on all people entering the prison and detention facilities and there should also be a dedicated place to do so. 25 However, contrary to this general direction, all detention centers and three of the prison facilities did not comply with this standard. Moreover, they did not have a dedicated place to do so. Poor infrastructural setup coupled with inadequate awareness about the COVID-19 pandemic among the prison staff might be the reason why standards are not being met.In this COVID-19 pandemic period, as a precautionary measure, all prison facilities found in the study area did not allow any visitors access to the facilities. Nonetheless, in all detention centers it was possible for visitors to get access into the detention centers, before entering into the detention centers, only five of the detention centers would give advice on contact restrictions and presence of symptoms to visitors well in advance as presented in Table 2 . In this COVID-19 pandemic, visitors are prohibited from access the prison facility, unless the need for visiting is approved by the prison's higher officials. 13, 23 Unlike prisons facilities, detention centers allowed visitors into the facilities. Before entering to the facilities, only five of the detention centers gave advice for visitors with symptom on contact limits. Only one detention center precludes asymptomatic individuals from visiting if they meet any of the criteria for exclusion. In this regard, only one of 17 detention centers fully complies with the WHO recommendation. 25 In our assessment, none of the prison facilities and detention centers had quick access to laboratory tests for suspected cases, and adequate quarantine, took action to avoid concentration of people as well as access to the necessary preventive protective equipment according to national protocols and WHO prison guidance. Currently, only two prison facilities had access to isolation and management in a medical facility for laboratory-confirmed cases (Table 1) .Prison and detention staff and facilities in the study area have not received any training related to COVID-19 and the result is far from WHO recommendation. 9, 13 It is stated that before embarking on any initiative, it is fully important for the prison staff to participate in widespread information and awareness-raising activities, so that people in prison facilities, detention centers, and visitors are informed in advance and know the procedures to be adopted, why they are essential, and how they are to be carried out. It is particularly crucial that any possible limiting measures are explained and their temporary nature emphasized. 10 In this study, the majority of detention centers and prison facilities made key messages linked in a clear and important manner about the pandemic signs and symptoms and prevention measures as presented in Table 3 . This finding is consistent with WHO and UNODC guidelines which stated that key messages for people in prison and detention facilities, health service providers and visitors must be coordinated. 23, 25 This might be due to a clear awareness of the risk of an outbreak.As indicated in Table 4 , preventive measures of COVID-19 such as availability of protocol, hand washing basin, sanitation equipment, respiratory etiquette, and physical distancing were not practiced in all detention centers and prison facilities in the study area. The result is far submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of General Medicine 2021:14 from WHO recommendation in which all staff and people in prisons and detention facilities should have wideranging awareness of COVID-19 prevention strategies, including obedience to hand hygiene measures, respiratory etiquette, physical distancing (keeping a distance of at least two meters from others), being alert to signs and symptoms of COVID-19, staying away from ill people, and (in the case of staff) staying home when ill. 8, 9, 25 The observed gaps could be attributable to lack of resources, finance, and training programs.The intent of the present study was to address the preparedness and readiness of correctional facilities to combat COVID-19 pandemic in a low resource setting area particularly in southwest Ethiopia. The result revealed that prisons and detention facilities found in Bench-Sheko, Kaffa, Sheka, and West Omo zones have demonstrated less preparedness and readiness to COVID-19 pandemics compared with WHO recommendations. Notably, prison and detention facilities have made little effort in addressing the following preventive measures: risk assessment and management, referral system and clinical management, contingency planning, prevention measures, training for staff, and risk communication, which are WHO recommendations for highly vulnerable places like prisons and detention centers. Federal and regional prison administrations, Police Commissions, Ministry of Health and other relevant entities working in prevention and control of COVID-19 pandemic, should focus on endeavoring to alter prison environments in the way that suits the WHO recommendations, prevent noncustodial measures and safeguard the right of prisoners and detainees. In addition, the federal government should mobilize resources and allocate adequate COVID-19 related budget to prison and detention facilities. Moreover, upcoming educational interventions are recommended for staff, prisoners and detainees to raise awareness of this disease and should be focused on rural detention centers and prison institutions which lack information and facilities. Likewise, educational messages should be more simplified and understandable in their ethnic languages. Moreover, frequent communication is recommended between detention and prison staff, health-care providers and the public to help to avoid empirical preventive measures and response to the disease and to empower the prison and detention staff with the information. Finally, further studies are suggested to explore the potential reasons for ineffective response to the COVID-19 pandemic in correctional facilities of Ethiopia.The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.","Ethiopia","first author","2021-02-02",2

World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease; novel coronavirus disease 2019 and, by March 2020, it had become a pandemic (Purcell & Charles, 2020; Sohrabi et al., 2020) . The responsible virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhu et al., 2020; Gorbalenya et al., 2020) , which shares about 80% genetic similarity with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003) .Some patients of this novel disease, COVID-19, develop moderate and life-threatening conditions with symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, septic shock and metabolic acidosis (Jin et al., 2020) . Due to potentiality of this disease to be severe and fatal, there is need to identify its risk factors especially for life-threatening conditions. This is to ascertain the specific medical and demographic physiognomies with more accuracy; it will equally enable the apposite supportive hands and rapid intensive care unit treatment when required.In USA, as at 7 August 2020, the total number of confirmed cases was 3,404,410 and 118,145 mortality cases. Of the 118,145 deceased patients, 53% were males, while some other countries such as Peru, India, Burkina Faso, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Thailand, Bangladesh and Nepal had mortality rates of males as high as 70%, 73%, 74%, 74%, 74%, 74%, 76%, 76%, 77% and 81% respectively (UNWOMEN, 2020) . Even though these data may be underreported, Lau et al. (2020) employed mortality rate as yardstick for data reliability. Meanwhile, more disparity in gender distribution of COVID-19 incidence has been documented. Sohrabi et al. (2020) , Del Rio & Malani (2020) and Cascella et al. (2020) reported that severe manifestations are more common in males, particularly in the elderly.Nigeria confirmed its index case in Lagos State on 27 February 2020 (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), 2020a). Thereafter, the first 32 cases were managed in Mainland Hospital, Yaba, Lagos State. Out of the 32 cases, 66% were reported to be males (Bowale et al., 2020) . As of 6 September 2020, the total number of confirmed cases had risen to 54,905 with 64% being males and 36% females (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), 2020b). This raises the question if it is a COVID-19 risk factor to be male?With focus on Nigeria data, this study considers daily incidence of COVID-19 reported cases based on gender. It answers the question whether daily COVID-19 incidence in Nigeria is gender-skewed, as well as provides relationship between daily incidence and gender. A predictive model based on vector autoregressive moving average model is formulated for the gender based daily incidence in Nigeria. Similarly, a predictive model based on univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is formulated for the daily death cases in Nigeria. The study targets the optimal fitting model for predictive and inferential purposes.Recent literature showed the relationship between countries' population and daily incidence cases among some African countries (Makinde et al., 2020b) . The study also highlighted significant monotone trends in the daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality counts of many countries in Africa up to 25 April 2020. Makinde et al. (2020a) highlighted effect of modes of transmission of COVID-19 on prevalence and mortality counts in WHO regions. Ojokoh et al. (2020) considered the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on farming, food security and agribusiness in some West African countries. Some predictive models have been suggested in literature for modelling COVID-19 dataset. These include use of ARIMA model (Benvenuto et al., 2020) . Abdulmajeed, Adeleke & Popoola (2020) considered an ensemble model based on ARIMA model, a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model for incidence cases in Nigeria.The Nigeria's COVID-19 incidence data by gender reported in this study have been sourced from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC). The data is available at https://www.ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps. The data include Nigeria's daily COVID-19 incidence broken down by sex and daily death cases. Figure 1 presents plot of Nigeria's daily COVID-19 incidence by gender from 11 April 2020 to 12 September 2020. Figure 1 Plot of Nigeria's daily COVID-19 incidence by gender from April 11, 2020 to September 12, 2020. The plot displays compares daily male, female and total incidence from April 11, 2020 to September 12, 2020Full-size  DOI: 10.7717/peerj.10613/ fig-1 It is observed from the figure that the daily incidence is higher in males in most of the days under study. Daily total incidence was on the rise until the end of July. Figure 2 presents plot of Nigeria's daily COVID-19 death cases by gender from 11 April 2020 to 12 September 2020. The highest daily death cases were recorded on 16 June 2020.The data were characterized by eight missing values. (Tsay, 2014) can be employed to investigate whether the daily incidence cases (Z t ) are autocorrelated or random. The MLB test is a multivariate generalisation of the univariate Ljung-Box test. The test rejects the null hypothesis that the daily incidence cases (Z t ) are random if p-value of the test is less than a chosen level of significance.Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (Dickey & Fuller, 1979 ) is a statistical test for finding out if a time series contains a unit root. A time series has a unit root implies that the time series is not stationary. The null hypothesis for the ADF test is that a time series has a unit root. A non-stationary time series is differenced d times until it attains stationarity.Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test (Tsay, 2014) was developed to investigate whether a vector time series contains conditional heteroscedasticity. The LM test can be employed to test for autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects in the daily COVID-19 incidence. The test rejects the null hypothesis that there are autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects in the daily COVID-19 incidence if p-value of the test is less than a chosen level of significance.Vector autoregressive moving average model of order p and qVector autoregressive moving average model of order p and q, denoted by VARMA (p, q), is a multivariate generalization of univariate autoregressive moving average model for stationary time series. Mathematically, the VARMA (p, q) model is defined asis a vector of male and female incidence at time t, m t ¼ m 1;t m 2;t is an intercept vector, e t ¼ e 1;t e 2;t is a random error vector,is a parameter of vector autoregressive part and u i ¼ u i;11 u i;12 u i;21 u i;22 ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; q is a parameter of vector moving average part. The random error vectors e t ; e tÀ1 ; . . . ; e tÀq are independently, identically, and normally distributed with mean zero and covarianceWhen time series (Z t ) in not stationary, the difference operator D d is employed on Zt to achieve stationarity. The difference operator D d is defined asOlusola-Makinde and Makinde (2021) The coefficients of the VARMA model are estimated using conditional maximum likelihood approach (Tsay, 2014) .The univariate autoregressive integrated moving average model, denoted by ARIMA (p, d, q), on a Nigeria daily reported death cases X t ð Þ at time t is defined aswhere p, d and q are orders of autoregressive, differenced and moving average parts respectively, e t is the residual of the estimated Y t , which is assumed uncorrelated. D is the difference operator, f 1 ; f 1 ; . . . ; f p are the parameters of the autoregressive part of the model, u 1 ; u 2 ; . . . ; u q are parameters of the moving average part of the model. The choice of optimal values of p and q are based on the ARIMA (p, d, q) model with the least Bayesian information criterion. The coefficients of the ARIMA model are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation.The crude case-fatality risk (cCFR) (Lau et al., 2020) of COVID-19 infections at date t is defined as the ratio of the total number of deaths on day t to the total number of confirmed cases on day t. Lau et al. (2020) defined an cCFR-adjusted total cases of country A at date t relative to country B aswhere ATCC (A) is the cCFR-adjusted total COVID-19 cases of country A at date t, cCFR (A) and cCFR (B) are crude case-fatality risk of countries A and B respectively at time t.The fold change at date t is defined as fold change at date t ¼ cCFR À adjusted total cases at date t total reported cases at date t :There is a significantly increasing trend (p-value < 2:22 Â 10 À16 ) in daily male incidence from 11 April 2020 to 18 June 2020 while there is a significantly decreasing trend (p-value ¼ 1:9091 Â 10 À12 ) in daily male incidence from 19 June 2020 to 12 September 2020. There is a significantly increasing trend (p-value < 2:22 Â 10 À16 ) in daily female incidence from 11 April to 13 July 2020 while there is a significantly decreasing trend (p-value = 1:4916 Â 10 À6 ) in daily female incidence from 14 July 2020 to 12 September 2020. Similarly, there is a significantly increasing trend (p-value < 2:22 Â 10 À16 ) in daily total incidence from 11 April 2020 to 1 July 2020 while there is a significantly decreasing trend (p-value = 2:084 Â 10 À12 ) in daily total incidence from 2 July 2020 to 12 September 2020. There is a significantly increasing trend (p-value ¼ 3:5763 Â 10 À7 ) in daily death cases from 11 April 2020 to 16 June 2020 while there is a significantly decreasing trend (p-value ¼ 2:1484 Â 10 À14 ) in daily death cases from 17 June 2020 to 12 September 2020. White-neural-network test shows that daily female incidence is not linear in mean (p-value = 0.00058746) while daily male incidence is linear in mean (p-value = 0.4257). McLeod-Li test was applied to investigate whether there are no autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects in the daily incidence cases. There is an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effect in daily female incidence if the mean daily female incidence changes over time. This implies that on the average, the daily female incidence changes significantly over time. This is shown in Fig. 3 . The McLeod-Li test shows that there is autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity in the female incidence (Maximum p-value = 1:4277 Â 10 À5 ) and male incidence (Maximum p-value = 9:0816 Â 10 À14 ) at 5% level of significance. This is confirmed by the LM test for vector of male and female incidence. The LM test shows that there are autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects in the daily COVID-19 incidence (p-value = 0.0001). Similarly, the multivariate Ljung-Box test (Tsay, 2014) shows that the daily incidence cases (Zt) are not random (p-value = 0.0000). This implies that the daily incidence cases are autocorrelated. Figure 4 presents the plot of cross correlation between the daily male and female incidence at k previous days. It was observed that the cross correlation values are positive at all lags and significant up to 18 previous days. This implies that daily female incidence at day t is significantly increasing as the daily male incidence increases at day t À k. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to test if the null hypothesis that confirmed male and female cases have the same distribution against the alternative hypothesis that the distributions of male and confirmed female cases are not the same. Result of the test shows that confirmed cases in male and female have different distributions (p-value < 2:22 Â 10 À16 ) and the number of confirmed cases is significantly higher in males than in females. Augment Dickey-Fuller test was employed on each of the series to investigate if the confirmed male and female incidence cases are stationary at 5% level of significance. The test rejects the hypothesis that a time series is not stationary if p-value of the test is less than 0.05. Table 1 presents the test statistics and p-values of the test for incidence by gender. The Nigeria's daily COVID-19 incidence is not stationary for male (p-value ¼ 0:9328) and female patients (p-value ¼ 0:9069). The difference operation of the daily COVID-19 incidence was performed. The data was differenced once to attain stationarity, that isThen, VARMA (p, q) model of various orders were fitted to the differenced data with the aim of identifying the optimal VARMA model for the data. The optimal VARMA model is chosen as the model that minimises the Bayesian information criterion. The optimal model is VARMA (0, 1) model. Table 2 presents the estimates of coefficients of optimal VARMA (0, 1) model. The optimal VARMA (0, 1) model can be expressed mathematically as: The optimal VARMA (0, 1) model can also be presented as two univariate regression models:The test of significance of estimates of coefficients of the models shows that estimates of coefficients of the models are significantly different from zero (p-value < 0:05). This is given in Table 2 . The implication of the above equations is that daily male incidence does not significantly depend on female incidence at previous days. Similarly, number of female incidence does not depend on male incidence at previous days. Figure 5 presents the comparison of the observed incidence with fitted data by gender. It can be observed from the figure that the models fit the data well.

The total reported cases as of 12 September 2020 is 440,248. The calculated cCFR value of Germany as of 12 September 2020 is 0.0362.The total reported cases as of 12 September 2020 is 440,248 while the estimated total COVID-19 incidence cases based on cCFR is 233,188. The fold change value of Nigeria is estimated to be 0.5297. Modelling Nigeria's daily COVID-19 death cases Augmented Dickey-Fuller test was employed to investigate the stationarity of Nigeria's daily COVID-19 death cases. The ADF test (p-value = 0.0888) fails to reject the null hypothesis that the daily reported death cases are stationary at 5% level of significance. This implies that the daily COVID-19 death cases are not stationary. That is, the average and variance of reported death cases change with time. To overcome this, a univariate autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) model of various orders was formulated for Nigeria's daily COVID-19 death cases. Optimal model was selected following Makinde & Figure 6 Comparison of observed data with fitted death cases in Nigeria. It compares observed daily death cases with daily fitted death cases from April 11, 2020 to September 12, 2020. This is to illustrate how well the optimal ARIMA model fits the observed death cases. Full-size  DOI: 10.7717/peerj.10613/ fig-6 Fasoranbaku (2011) and Benvenuto et al. (2020) . The optimal model for the Nigeria's daily COVID-19 death cases is identified to be ARIMA (0, 1, 1). Figure 6 presents the comparison of the observed death cases with fitted data. It can be observed from the figure that the optimal ARIMA (0, 1, 1) model fits the data well.Daily confirmed cases in Nigeria are gender-skewed (Fig. 1) . The daily male-female ratios of COVID-19 confirmed cases are higher than one over the study period. This is confirmed in Fig. 3 . In the figure, daily average confirmed cases are consistently higher in males but monotonically increasing till 8 August 2020. Result of Wilcoxon signed-rank test shows that confirmed male cases are not distributed equivalently as confirmed female cases. The result of the test confirms that confirmed male and female cases have different distributions and the number of confirmed cases is significantly higher in males. Bianconi et al. (2020) argued that gender inequalities may have influenced either the estimation of COVID-19 cases or the susceptibility to COVID-19 over time. Bianconi et al. (2020) observed a time-related changes in sex distribution of COVID-19 cases in Italy as well as declining infection proportion with male-female ratio from 9 March to 11 May 2020. However, there is no significant time-related changes in sex distribution of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. Bianconi et al. (2020) argued that males have been reported to be at higher risk of developing symptoms and severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19, and may have had a higher access to COVID-19 diagnostic tests at the beginning of the observed period as compared to females. Gebhard et al. (2020) claimed that COVID-19 is deadlier for infected men than women in China in terms of fatality rate, and that differential susceptibility between males and females may be imparted in diverse ways by gender for infectious diseases caused by viruses. Klein & Huber (2009) argued that susceptibility and response to viral infections, incidence and disease severity may differ in males and females. Gadi et al. (2020) attributed higher risks of COVID-19 in males to the lack of the stimulatory effects of estrogen and that androgens which males produce seem to have a defensive mechanism against their immune response. Jin et al. (2020) investigated the role of gender in morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 in China and concluded that men could be more at risk of death by COVID-19.The confirmed male and female incidence cases were not stationary. This implies that either their means, variances or covariances increased with time (Fig. 3) . The confirmed male and female incidence cases were differenced once in order to achieve stationarity. The VARMA model was fitted to the differenced data. The fitted VARMA model showed that daily male incidence does not significantly depend on female incidence at previous days. Similarly, number of female incidence does not depend on male incidence at previous days. Comparison of the observed incidence with fitted data showed that the models fit the data well (Fig. 5) . Similarly, ARIMA (0, 1, 1) model was selected as the optimal ARIMA (p, d, q) for fitting daily reported death cases using Bayesian information criterion. The model fits the data well, as shown in Fig. 6 . This is in line with study of Benvenuto et al. (2020) , where ARIMA models were performed on the Johns Hopkins epidemiological data to predict the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19. However, parameters of optimal ARIMA models were not identified in their study.In evaluating massive under-reporting and under-testing of total reported COVID-19 cases in some global epicenters, cCFR value of Germany was used as a standard in Lau et al. (2020) . In this study, cCFR value of Germany was also considered as the standard. As of 12 September 2020, the cCFR values of Germany, Greece and South Korea are 3.62%, 2.36% and 1.61% respectively while the cCFR value of Nigeria is 1.92%. The estimated total COVID-19 incidence cases is 233,188. There is no evidence of massive under-detection and under-reporting in Nigeria. When estimating the real total amount of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, no considerable increase in the number of COVID-19 incidence is detected in comparison to Nigeria's total reported COVID-19 cases. Fold change can be used as an indicator for under-reporting and under-detecting COVID-19 cases. Nigeria's fold change value is estimated to be 0.5297 as of 12 September 2020. This value is comparable to fold change of South Korea but less than that of Italy, France, Spain, Iran, China and the USA as of 17 March 2020. This study is limited by dearth of information on mortality cases by gender and daily population in Nigeria.This study provides insight into how COVID-19 affects one sex than the other in Nigeria over a period of time. In particular, a vector autoregressive moving average model was formulated for predicting gender based-daily incidence in Nigeria. Also, a predictive model based on autoregressive integrated moving average model was presented for daily death cases. The findings show that males were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than females. The mean daily incidence changes over time for male and female but the change is significant for female individuals. The significance of gender on daily incidence was highlighted. The vector autoregressive moving average model shows that male incidence does not depend on number of female incidence at previous days. Similarly, number of female incidence does not depend on number of male incidence at previous days. Massive underreporting and under-testing was not observed in Nigeria's reported COVID-19 cases based on crude case-fatality risk and fold change.The authors received no funding for this work.","Nigeria","abstract","2021-02-12",2

Greater than 2 million people were infected and 139,378 peoples died with it exclusively until this proposal was developed. 5 Different organizations such as WHO, CDC, and other professional document that practicing hand hygiene is the simplest and preferable technique in the prevention of the spread of the current serious issue of SARS-CoV-2 and other community-acquired and hospital-associated infections. 3, 6 Hand hygiene can be done by several methods; the most important method is frequent hand washing with soap and plain water or sanitizing hands with alcoholbased hand sanitizer (ABHS) in the absence of water and soap. [7] [8] [9] The use of ABHS has been reported as the common recommended means of hand hygiene. 10 The most regularly utilized ABHS should have an alcohol concentration of 60 to 85%. 11 The effectiveness of these ABHS depends on the concentration of alcohol and the time of rubbing. Rubbing hands with ABHS (60 to 85% concentrations) for 25-30 seconds was reported to kill 99.99% of microorganisms on hand. For instance, rubbing sanitizers with 70% alcohol is suggested to kill 99.9% of the microorganisms on hands. 12 Currently, in Ethiopia, different ABHS have been distributed throughout the community and the market, regarding the protection of community and health professionals suffering from a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak. But still now, the efficacy of them was not evaluated even though, for effective protection, effective ABHS is mandatory. This is the reason why this research was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has been sold in southern parts of Ethiopia.The finding of this study will be used for better understanding of status of ABHS that have been sold and distributed in the community. The result will be helpful for ministry of health, policy-makers, and health professionals, other stakeholders and community partners working on COVID-19 outbreak prevention strategy. It may also help as a baseline data for further related studies and early evaluating of alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Sanitizers containing an alcohol concentration between 60-85% are suggested to kill 99.99% of microorganisms on hands. The sanitizers which are effective on bacteria are effective in virus and vice versa. Therefore, we were forced to assess the efficacy of alcohol-based hand sanitizers only on selected bacteria, but not on virus (SARS-CoV-2) due to our laboratory set up constraint for viral isolation and growth. Following this assumption and reviewing related literature, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella boydii were selected at the department of microbiology laboratory at Mizan Tepi University from different left over clinical specimen (Urine, stool and wound) which were collected with laboratory technologists for laboratory test at Mizan Tepi teaching hospital. The microorganisms were isolated from clinical specimens with culture, gram stain, and biochemical test. During the study, clinical specimens were inoculated on chocolate agar, blood agar, MacConkey agar, and Mannitol salt agar, and incubated overnight (35°C -37°C) for colony isolation. Then on the second day gram stain test was examined to differentiate gram positive from negative bacteria for all colonies. At the 3rd day test organisms were isolated with biochemical tests using their biochemical characteristics after overnight incubation (35°C -37°C). The isolated test organisms were stored on storage media and kept at 2-8° C. It were refreshed on nutrient agar and used when needed.Seven locally made products of alcohol-based hand sanitizers were purchased from local vendors in Southwest, Ethiopia (Table) . Sanitizers that have been sold on markets southern parts of Ethiopia were included and tear or not sealed expired and unlabeled (unknown manufacturer) hand sanitizers were excluded from the study ( Table 1) . bactericidal concentration, for performing the agar diffusion test, and other tests necessary for the study such as biochemical tests. This 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard was prepared into a test tube from the mixture of barium chloride dehydrate (BaCl2. 2H2 0) solution and sulfuric acid (H2 SO4) with verification of the mixture absorbance (0.08-0.10) density precision via a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 625nm. The prepared tube was stored in a sealed container at room temperature in a dark place. 13 Each selected test organism was standardized before the research was performed by taking a loopful of inoculum using a sterile loop from a pure culture, transferring and suspending it into tubes of sterile normal saline. Then, the suspension density was adjusting by comparing it with the 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards by either adding additional bacteria or sterile saline. 14 To determine the susceptibility test of selected test organisms for each hand sanitizer well variant agar diffusion method was used. 15 This agar diffusion method was done in duplicates for each hand sanitizer by inoculated sterile Mueller Hinton agar plates using sterile cotton swab which was immersed into a tube contain standardized test organisms. After Mueller Hinton agar was inoculated, it was allowed to remain at room temperature to dry for only some minutes and 8 equally spaced holes were bored in the agar plate with the 8th hole at the center of the plate with the aid of a sterile 6mm cork borer. The 7 holes were filled with 50µL of the hand sanitizer at the same time as the central hole (8th) was filled with an equal volume of sterile water for control purposes. The Mueller Hinton agar was incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. The zones of inhibition (susceptibility or resistance) of the hand sanitizers to each test organism were examined with the help of a ruler in millimeter by evaluating the average of 2 readings that were found from duplicates of agar diffusion test for each hand sanitizers.In this study MIC (the lowest concentration of a definite antimicrobial or hand sanitizers required to inhibit the growth of a known test organism in vitro 16 ) was done on nutrient broth for each hand sanitizer against the selected test organisms. It was done by preparing various concentrations of each hand sanitizers (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%). Then, one milliliter from the different concentrations (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%) of each sanitizer was introduced into the tube containing equal volumes (1 mL) of nutrient broth inoculated with standardized test organism. A tube, containing only nutrient broth and bacteria without sanitizer and a tube containing just the sanitizer and broth without bacteria was used as negative control and positive control, respectively. Finally, the tubes were incubated for 18-24 hours and visible growth (turbidity) was assessed. When compared with the controls, the concentration of the sanitizers at which no visible growth was regarded as MIC.During this study MBC (the lowest concentration of a specific antimicrobial substance that can kill 99.9% of a given bacterial strain 16 ) was determined from the MIC tests that showed no visible growth by taking a loopful of inoculum living test organisms from the MIC tubes by streaked on fresh Mueller Hinton agar. The streaked Data analysis was done by descriptive methods.The reliability of the study findings was guaranteed by implementing strict quality control (QC) methods throughout the whole process of the laboratory work, such as preanalytical (specimen collection from hospital laboratory room, transportation from hospital laboratory to testing laboratory, etc.), analytical (reagent preparation, sample inoculation, gram stain, bacterial isolation, biochemical test, MIC, MBC agar diffusion test, etc.) and postanalytical (reporting MIC, MBC result, etc.) quality control. During MBC and MIC only broth as a negative control to test the sterility of the media and equipment, and culture inoculated broth without antibiotics as a positive control to test the growth ability of the medium was also used. All materials and equipment are controlled and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were strictly followed.In our study, efforts were made to assess the efficiency of seven hand sanitizers (MTU, Folium Fine, Epharm, Harego, Taflen and Sheba) by using agar disc inhibitory activity against the selected test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella boydii). The zones of inhibition of the hand sanitizers at their claim concentration including the unknown (unlabeled) concentration Taflen products were ranged from no inhibition zone (Folium) to 27mm (Sheba). For instance, 9mm (Folium) to 17mm (MTU) on Staphylococcus aureus; 8mm (Folium) to 20mm (Fine) on Escherichia coli; 6mm (Folium) to 20mm (Fine) on K. pneumoniae; 6mm (Folium) to 27mm (Sheba) on Ps. aeruginosa; 8mm (Folium) to 15mm (Hargo) on Salmonella typhi; whereas on Shigella boydii it ranged from 8mm (Folium) to 17mm (Ephram) ( Table 2) .All hand sanitizers were further tested to determine their MIC and MBC values at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% (at claim concentration). The minimum inhibitory concentration against all selected test organisms was observed at 45%, 55%, and 65% except Taflen which have had unknown concentration but it was bacteriostatic at undiluted form (Table 3) .The content of the concentrations tubes of MIC was further plated out on sterile Mueller Hinton agar plates in order to determine the bactericidal effect of concentration. MTU (except against E. coli), Fine, Hargo, Ephra and Sheba hand sanitizers were showed growth on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% concentrations against the selected test organisms. The growth of selected test organisms was decreased in colony-forming unit across increasing the concentration gradient of different hand sanitizers (Table 4 ). But a Folium product was indicating that the product was only bacteriostatic against the selected test organisms at 65% but not bactericidal. Similarly, MTU product had a MIC value of 65% concentration against E. coli but was not bactericidal (Table 5 ).

This has led to the development, production and importation of several hand sanitizers by various companies with the intend of profit-making as well as supporting the health-care system and community in preventing transmission of disease especially COVID-19. But there is no information about laboratory-based efficacy evaluation. In this study, the efficiency of the claim concentration of the seven hand sanitizers was assessed. The seven hand sanitizers MTU, Folium, Fine, Ephra, Hargo, and Sheba with claimed concentration of 80% ethanol alcohol, and Taflen with unknown (unlabeled) concentration of ethanol alcohol as the main active ingredient were displayed bacteriostatic activity against all the selected test organisms at a concentration of 45%, 55%, and 65%. Moreover, all Fine, Harego, Epharm and Sheba hand sanitizers showed bactericidal activity against all selected test organisms, with MBC values of 65% and 75%. Generally, the growth of selected test organisms was decreased in colony-forming unit across increasing the concentration gradient of different hand sanitizers. This bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity more probably due to alcohol components of alcohol-based hand sanitizer which is the major active ingredients intended to exert disinfectant activity in bacteria by causing protein denaturation, disruption of tissue membranes and dissolution of several lipids. 17 Folium which contained 70% denatured ethanol was not active against all selected test organisms in bactericidal activity with no to narrow rim of inhibition zone in disk diffusion agar. The lack of bactericidal activity and more or less no disk inhibition zone observed in this product could be due to the relatively decrement of the concentration (70%) denatured alcohol compared with others since the efficacy of alcohol-based hand sanitizers is affected by several factors such as the type of alcohol used, concentration of alcohol or amount of alcohol used, the possible contact time 18 and absence of active ingredient in product (hydrogen peroxide) which may limit the cidal effect of the alcohol from attainment the bacterial cells.MTU product was the other hand sanitizer product which was not active against E. coli test organisms in our study. This could be poor or prolonged storage of the products which could lead to increased temperature causing evaporation of the active ingredient and characteristic of the E. coli strain since the strain is bacteria, which can easily develop resistance.There are limitations in our study; we could assess the efficacy of only seven locally made but not imported sanitizers. Only bacterial strain was used because of laboratory setup constraint for virus strain growth.We evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of the seven most popular brands of hand sanitizers sold in Mizan-Aman town. Of the seven the six sanitizers except MTU product for E. coli and Folium were the products that were effective in inhibited growth of all the selected test organisms in vitro, and they were had effective bactericidal activity on their claim concentration. But MTU products against E. coli and Folium against all selected test organisms were not had effective bactericidal activity. Even though alcohol-based hand sanitizers are easy to prepare, they must be used after proper testing of their efficacy at their producer claimed concentration to protect consumers from buying poor quality products. The company should have to follow strict standard operational procedures to produce standardized products. The regulatory authorities should enforce strict quality control measures during production, distribution and routine laboratory-based inspections to ensure the efficacy of products. Lastly, consumers should be aware of the availability of poor quality sanitizers on the shelves of some retail outlets. The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.We conduct our study in compliance with recognized international standards and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical clearance was acquired from the Research and Ethical Review Committee of College of Medicine and Health Sciences, at Mizan Tepi University. The permission letter was taken from the clinical director of the Mizan-Tepi University referral hospital and laboratory head. Data were collected after full written consent had been obtained from each participant. For the purpose of the study, codes were used instead of any personal identifiers which were labeled by laboratory technologist on the specimen tubes during specimen collection. Specimens with abnormal test results were informed to physicians for further diagnosis and treatment accordingly.","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-02-12",2

Whereas most people with COVID-19 develop only asymptomatic or mild illness, at-risk patients can develop severe disease requiring hospitalization and respiratory [1] [2] [3] . In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, multi-organ failure, including acute kidney injury and cardiac injury [2] [3] [4] . Older age and underlying comorbidities due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, have been reported as risk factors for disease severity and death [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .Underlying conditions in the setting of low and medium-income countries (LMICs) are different from those in high-income countries (HICs). In LMICs, infectious diseases are highly prevalent than NCDs. One such infectious diseases are neglected infectious disease (NIDs). Most notably, parasitic infections affect more than 2 billion people throughout the world, with disproportionately high prevalence rates in resource-poor settings [9, 10] . Multicellular and highly complex parasites such as Ascaris, hook worm, Trichuris, Enterobius and Schistosoma, as well as unicellular organisms including Entamoeba, Giardia, Toxoplasma, Cyclospora and Cryptosporidia are among the major organisms that contribute to the global intestinal parasitic disease burden [9, 10] . The distribution of parasitic infections varies widely in the different parts of the world.Chronic and persistent parasitic infection is common in LIMCs, and chronic parasitic infections, possibly in part through direct modulation of the host's immune responses, have been shown to alter clinical outcomes to other infections [11, 12] . Pre-existing parasitic infections may also modify the host's immune response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with possible beneficial or detrimental effects [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Recent reports demonstrated an inverse correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 and with soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis or malaria [20] . To the best of our knowledge, however, there have been no studies to date that have assessed the effect of co-infection with parasites on the severity of COVID-19. In this study, therefore, we compared the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with or without parasitic co-infection.We identified individuals recruited to the Profile-CoV study who had been screened for parasitic infections. Profile-CoV project (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04473365) is a prospective observational cohort study being undertaken in two sites in Ethiopia, with the aim of profiling of immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 in the context of persistent immune activation in Sub-Saharan Africa.All patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a nasopharyngeal real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted into Kuyha Isolation Hospital run by Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle, Northern part of Ethiopia for isolation and treatment. Patients were admitted irrespective of the clinical severity status. Admitted patients receive supportive therapy according to clinical need. Patients with severe disease receive high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula or intubation as well as dexamethasone. All COVID-19 cases confirmed by PCR test result between July and October 2020 were included in this study.Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected using standardized Case Record Forms (CRFs) adapted from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium's (ISARIC) CRFs for emerging severe acute respiratory infections [21] . Patient's clinical status was stratified following WHO criteria as asymptomatic, mild/moderate, severe (with dyspnea, respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute, O2 saturation ≤ 93%, lung infiltrates ≥ 50% of the lung fields within 24-48 hours), and critical (with respiratory failure, septic s hock, and/or multiple organ failure) [22] . All data were then entered onto electronic medical records.SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR on samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs, according to WHO guidelines. Fresh stool sample specimens were obtained for examination for ova and parasites. Analysis included direct microscopic examination and modified Ritchie concentration method [23] . In addition, the intensity of infection was determined using Kato-Katz method and was calculated and reported as individuals' eggs per gram of feces (EPG), as described previously [23, 24] and recommended by the WHO [25] . Helminth-positive individuals were stratified into three infection intensity categories: (i) light (1-99 EPG), (ii) moderate (100-399 EPG), and (iii) heavy (≥400 EPG).Patients enrolled provided written consent to participate in to the Profile-CoV study. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Health Research Ethics Review Committee (HRERC) of Mekelle University College of Health Sciences (#ERC 1769/2020). All individual identifiers were de-linked from the original sources.The primary outcome for this study was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who developed severe disease among patients with and without a parasitic co-infection. Asymptomatic and mild/moderate cases were classified as non-severe cases and both severe and critical were classified as severe cases. Baseline characteristics for continuous variables were expressed as the median with interquartile range (IQR), and for categorical variables as proportions. Whereas categorical variables were compared using χ² test or Fisher's exact test, categorical variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests, as appropriate. The association between parasitic co-infection and COVID-19 severity was determined by logistic regression analysis. Independent variables, including age, sex, comorbidity, parasite infection (overall and disaggregated by parasite type into protozoa and helminths), were included in the initial univariate analysis. Then a multivariate regression analyses [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)] were calculated (with backward stepwise elimination) by including all variables that were p<0.20 by univariate analysis. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data was analyzed using STATA (Statistical package v. 14.0, StataCorp, Texas, USA).Baseline socio-demographic data of the study participants is summarized in Table 1 . The majority of our study population were male (62.5%). The median age of the cohort was 32 (IQR 26-43) years, the majority (60.7%) being in the age range 24 to 44 years. Most notably, 86.8% the cohort population were either asymptomatic or had mild/moderate symptoms at the time of diagnosis. The remaining (13.2%) had either severe disease or required admission to intensive care unit (ICU). COVID-19 patients with severe disease tended to be older and had had significantly higher symptoms, including cough (82.4% vs. 21.9%), dyspnea (70.6% vs. 2.9%), fever (61.8% vs. 13.9%), head ache (41.2% vs. 15.4%), chest pain (25.0% vs. 1.1%), myalgia (25.0% vs. 3.1%), sore throat (20.6% vs. 4.3%), hemoptysis (13.2% vs. 1.6%) and diarrhea (5.9% vs. 1.3%), when compared to those presenting with non-severe form of COVID-19.Of the total 515 individuals enrolled in the study, 267 (51.8%) harbored one or more intestinal parasites (Table 2 ). Protozoa and helminth infections comprised 28.4% and 33.8%, respectively. The most common protozoa infections were Entamoeba spp. (23.5%) and Giardia (4.6%). Among helminths, the most common infections were H. nana (21.2%), S. mansoni (6.2%), and A. lumbricoides (4.9%). There was no difference in gender and age distribution when those with parasites were compared with those without parasites (Table 2) . However, those without parasite co-infection presented with significant higher proportion of fever (25.0% vs. 15.7%), head ache (24.2% vs. 13.9%), dyspnea (18.2% vs 6.0%) and hemoptysis (5.7% vs. 0.8%) than those with parasite co-infection. In addition, the proportion of comorbid conditions, in particular NCDs, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The proportion of COVID-19 patients with parasitic infection decreased with increasing categories of disease severity, in particular for any parasitic and helminthic infections ( Figure 1 ). In addition, clinical outcomes were considerably worse in COVID-19 patients without parasites (Table 1) . Of all COVID-19 patients, a higher proportion of patients without parasitic co-infection were admitted to ICU and required supplemental oxygen compared to those with parasitic coinfection (Table 1) In univariate analysis, older age, diabetes, hypertension, cardio-vascular diseases, chronic obstructive lung diseases, chronic liver disease, and chronic kidney disease were all associated with increased likelihood of COVID-19 severity (Table 3 ). In the contrary, having any parasite, protozoal infection and helminth infections were all associated with reduced probability of severe COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, older age, hypertension and chronic kidney diseases were associated with the odds of COVID-19 severity. In addition, after adjustment for age and presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 patients with any parasite co-infection [aOR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.77); p=0.006; Table 3 ], or with protozoa co-infection [aOR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.21-0.98); p=0.044] as well as those with helminth co-infection [aOR 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17-0.80); p=0.011] had lower probability of developing severe COVID-19 compared with those without parasite, protozoa or helminth co-infection. Interestingly, we noted that the odds of having a NCD was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients having co-infection with parasites (OR: 0.52 95% CI: 0.30-90.2, p=0.020), or helminths (OR 0.26 95% CI: 0.12-0.56; p=0.001).This study demonstrated that co-infection with enteric parasites, both protozoa and helminths, was associated with lower probability of developing severe COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, the findings represent the first report regarding an association between parasites and COVID-19 severity. Notably, the association was maintained even after adjusting for age and presence of comorbid conditions, factors commonly associated with COVID-19 severity.In addition, previous reports have demonstrated that helminthic infection reduces the risk of development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome in humans [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . This is in line with our All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The pathogenesis of severe disease in COVID-19 has been linked to the phenomenon of immune hyperactivation [35, 36] , that resembles that of chronic inflammatory condition, such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . It is possible, therefore, that parasites mute COVID-19 severity through their effects in modulating systemic immune response. Parasitic infections modulate human's immune systems , in such a way that the T-helper (TH) responses are augmented along with predominant regulatory (Treg) responses [11] . This parasite-driven TH2 response, in turn, may counterbalances TH1 responses, responsible for the hyperinflammation associated with severe COVID-19 [11] . In addition, parasite-driven gut microbiome changes may modulate the host's immune response [12] . Thus, it is possible that parasitic infections may affect pathogenesis both through direct modulation of the immune system as well as through parasite-driven microbiome balance. Indeed, it has been demonstrated in animal models that enteric helminth protect against pulmonary viral infections through interaction with microbiota [42].The strengths of the current study include the prospective nature of the study design. However, our study has some limitations. First, stool samples were not able to be collected for every consecutive patient which may have resulted in a potential selection bias. Second, stool examination was determined by microscopy only. The presence of very low intensity parasite infection determined by PCR, though shown to be superior to microscopy with increased sensitivity and specificity [43] , might indeed preclude the effects on immune modulation to have any significant effect. Third, the effect of individual parasite species on COVID-19 severity could not be ascertained in the current study because of the small sample size in groups with different parasite species. Finally, the inclusion of smaller proportion of severe cases as compared to nonsevere cases in our cohort may potentially bias the results.In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that pre-existing parasitic infection, both with protozoa and helminths, may provide some sort of protection from the pathology linked with severe COVID-19. This is corroborated by the observed low fatality rate of COVID-19 in LMICs settings where parasitic infections are endemic [15, 18, 20, 44] . We also recommend to expand the study to other LMICs and also include the effect of the interplay between parasitemicrobiome on COVID-19 severity. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19 offers avenues for novel preventive and therapeutic interventions.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.All rights reserved.

Evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic source [2] . This animal coronavirus spill over to humans is the third one to be documented in the past twenty years [1] . Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through close contact with an infected individual via respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected individuals through infected secretions, or indirect contact through touching contaminated surfaces [3] . There is also increasing evidence for the airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 with enclosed environments with poor ventilation of particular concern [4] [5] [6] .Africa's first recorded case of COVID-19 was in Egypt on 14 February 2020 [7] . South Africa reported its first case of COVID-19 on 5 March 2020 in a 38-year old male who had returned to South Africa after a trip to Italy [8] . South Africa's daily COVID-19 case numbers started increasing significantly from mid-March 2020 reaching the highest daily recorded number of cases in its first wave of 13,944 on 25 June 2020 [9] . By 31 October 2020, South Africa had recorded 723,682 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 19,230 COVID-19 deaths which represented over 40% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases and approximately 45% of all COVID-19 deaths in Africa at the time [9] . However, excess deaths data for South Africa suggest that the number of COVID-19 deaths in South Africa was substantially higher [7] .A study conducted in the United Kingdom as well as in the United States found that frontline healthcare workers are more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than the general community [10] . Inpatient settings appeared to pose the most risk followed by nursing homes, and outpatient hospital clinics [10] . There has been a significant number of COVID-19 deaths among health workers globally. It was reported in early September that the number of COVID-19 deaths among health workers worldwide was at least 7000 [11] . The countries that were estimated to have the most deaths of health workers were Mexico (1320), the United States of America (1077) and the United Kingdom (649) [11] . South Africa with 240 estimated deaths at the time was seventh on the list [11] .Infection prevention and control at healthcare facilities is critical in limiting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to health workers and patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a number of strategies to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health settings including isolation of suspected cases, the application of standard precautions to all patients, and the implementation of additional precautions for suspected COVID-19 cases [12] . Administrative controls should be implemented and engineering and environmental controls should be utilised to limit transmission in health facilities [12] . This is echoed by South African guidelines [13] . Health workers are crucial in successful implementation of infection prevention and control strategies. The aim of our study was, therefore, to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control knowledge and attitudes of frontline health workers in four provinces of South Africa. In addition, we explored some elements of health worker and health facility infection prevention and control practices.A cross-sectional study design was utilised with both descriptive and analytical components. The knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) survey was part of a rapid appraisal of the COVID-19 occupational health and safety response in four provinces in South Africa.The study was conducted in public sector (governmentrun) facilities in four of the nine provinces of South Africa viz. Gauteng Province, Limpopo Province, Mpumalanga Province, and North-West Province. The public sector facilities comprised district, regional, tertiary, central, and specialised psychiatric hospitals as well as community health centres.The study population comprised frontline health workers within the four provinces that are based in casualty (accident and emergency) departments, outpatient departments, and entrance points of health facilities. These are likely to be the initial points of contact between undiagnosed COVID-19 cases and health facility staff thereby placing workers stationed in these areas at risk of COVID-19 transmission. This included both clinical and non-clinical staff. The health facilities from which participants were drawn were conveniently sampled. At each facility, the target was to invite at least one health worker from each of six categories of staff to participate viz. medical doctors, nurses, cleaners, porters, security personnel and clerks. Clinical associates (similar cadre to physician assistants) were also invited to participate but are not employed at all facilities. Health workers were selected at each facility based on their availability at the time of the rapid appraisal. This was done to minimise disruption to normal service delivery.A structured questionnaire with closed-ended questions in four sections (socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge items, attitude/perception items and practice items) was utilised for data collection which took place over a two-month period commencing mid-April 2020. The knowledge items of the KAP survey were based on the WHO interim guidance of 25 January 2020 [12] . The WHO interim guidance released on 19 March 2020 did not reflect any changes with respect to the knowledge items included in our questionnaire [14] . For the knowledge items, participants were provided with a statement and had to indicate if they agreed, disagreed or were unsure. The attitude and perception items used a five-point Likert response scale (strongly disagree; disagree; unsure; agree; strongly agree). The practice items measured both individual and facility practices with the WHO guidance being used as the basis for most of the items [12] . The responses from which participants could select for the practice items were 'yes', 'no', 'not sure', and 'not applicable'. The 'not applicable' option was provided as not all practice items were applicable to all categories of health workers and 'not applicable' responses were not included in the data analysis. The questionnaires were selfadministered with a researcher or trained research assistant being in the vicinity to address any queries. Physical distancing, wearing of medical masks and hygiene measures were employed to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the data collection process.Data entry was done on Microsoft Excel and imported into STATA version 16 (v15 (Statacorp; http://www. stata.com) for analyses. For the knowledge items, 'unsure' and non-responses were treated as being incorrect and were included in the denominator when calculating the proportion of correct responses. The number of questions answered correctly were added to give a score out of 10. Participants were classified as having adequate knowledge if they answered six or more questions correctly and good knowledge if they answered 8 or more questions correctly. Logistic regression was utilised to determine factors associated with a good knowledge score. Socio-demographic and employment variables with a p-value less than 0.25 on univariate logistic regression were included in the initial multivariate logistic regression model. The final multivariate model was developed by dropping variables from the initial model using a backwards stepwise approach. For each attitude/perception item, the proportion of participants selecting each Likert-scale option was calculated. Proportions were also calculated for each of the practice items.A total of 286 health workers from 47 health facilities participated in the survey. The health facilities comprised 4 community health centres, 22 district hospitals, 11 regional hospitals, 7 tertiary hospitals, a central hospital, and 2 specialised psychiatric hospitals. The socio-demographic and employment characteristics of the participants are displayed in Table 1 . The majority of participants were aged between 30 and 49 years (62.9%) and the median age was 39 years. There was substantially more female (59.6%) than male (40.4%) participants. A large proportion of participants (46.6%) did not possess a diploma or degree. Except for clinical associates (1.8%), the different occupational categories of frontline staff were well represented. The 'other' category included various occupational categories such as allied health professionals, pharmacists, and pharmacy assistants. As would be expected based on the facilities selected, the largest proportion of participants (45.1%) worked at district hospitals.The proportions of health workers who responded correctly to each of the knowledge items are shown in Table 2 . More than 90% of participants provided correct answers on each of the two items related to the mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Just over half of participants (52.1%) knew that droplet and contact precautions were required for both confirmed cases of COVID-19 and for suspected cases. The lowest proportion of correct responses (6.6%) was obtained for one of the questions related to the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used in the routine care of COVID-19 patients. In total, there were three items where the proportion of correct responses fell below 50%. Medical doctors attained the highest or jointhighest proportion of correct responses on eight of the ten items.The mean score on the 10 knowledge items was 6.3 (SD = 1.6) ( Table 2) . Medical doctors had the highest mean score of 7.9 (SD = 1.2) followed by nurses with a mean score of 7.0 (SD = 1.4). The difference between doctors and nurses was statistically significant (p = 0.002). Cleaners, clerks and security personnel all had mean scores below 6. Approximately two-thirds of participants (67.4%) answered six or more questions correctly while less than a quarter of all participants (24.1%) managed to score eight or more. The majority of participants in all but one of the health worker categories answered six or more of the questions correctly. With the exception of medical doctors, the majority of participants in each of the health worker categories failed to achieve a minimum of eight correct responses. The final multivariate model for factors associated with a knowledge score of ≥8 is shown in Table 3 . The initial model consisted of sociodemographic characteristics with p < 0.25 following univariate logistic regression viz. age, education, occupation, years of experience and type of facility where employed. Health workers aged 40 years and older had lower odds of getting 8 or more of the knowledge items correct. Medical doctors and nurses had higher odds of scoring 8 or more as did health workers employed at tertiary hospitals.Only half of participants (50.7%) felt adequately prepared to deal with patients with COVD-19 at the time of the survey (see Table 4 ). A majority of participants (86.1%) indicated they would wear the required PPE even if it were uncomfortable. Almost two-thirds of participants (65.1%) strongly disagreed with the statement that they would still treat a COVID-19 patient even if the required PPE was not available with a further 21.7% disagreeing with the statement. A substantial proportion of participants (46.8%) felt they could be infected with COVID-19 at their facility regardless of the precautions they take. One-tenth of participants (10.0%) indicated they would continue to report for duty even if they had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. More than 5% of participants (6.4%) indicated they would resign to avoid contact with COVID-19 patients.Participant responses to questions related to their own practices as well as that of their health facility are shown in Table 5 . Just over half of participants (51.3%) confirmed they had undergone occupational health and safety training. Slightly more than half of participants indicated they had received infection prevention and control training (55.6%) and training on the correct use of PPE (56.2%). Less than 90% of participants indicated they had access to medical masks (85.7%) and gloves (88.7%) with approximately half of participants (51.0%) indicating they had access to respirators in their department. The vast majority of participants indicated they practiced hand hygiene after touching a patient (97.7%) and after touching a patient's surroundings (90.3%).Our study examined the knowledge, attitudes and practices of frontline health workers across occupational categories. We included both clinical and non-clinical personnel. The expectation was that knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control would differ by occupational category and we, therefore, stratified our analysis of the knowledge items by occupation. When comparing mean scores, clinical personnel (doctors and nurses) fared better on their overall knowledge than non-clinical personnel. This was confirmed by our * includes 5 clinical associates # includes 7 health workers who did not provide their occupational category multivariate model with doctors and nurses having significantly higher odds of obtaining eight or more knowledge items correct. Doctors fared significantly better than nurses in our study with respect to mean knowledge scores. A study in Greece found a larger proportion of physicians received high scores on their knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 preventative practices in comparison to nurses [15] . A COVID-19 KAP study of healthcare workers in China found similar knowledge scores among doctors and nurses [16] while a COVID-KAP study among clinical personnel in Uganda found no significant difference in the level of COVID-19 knowledge of the different clinical cadres [17] . A survey of generic infection prevention in Ethiopia found physicians were significantly less knowledgeable with respect to infection prevention than nurses [18] . In addition to occupational category, we found that a good knowledge score was also significantly associated with age and type of facility where employed. Older health workers had lower odds of achieving a good knowledge score than younger health workers. This finding corresponds to the finding of Olum et al. [17] who used a similar cut off of 80% for knowledge items and reported significantly lower odds of achieving this in their participants older than 40 years. Two other COVID-19 KAP studies in health workers that have used knowledge scores have not shown a relationship between knowledge scores and age [15, 19] . Olum et al. [17] speculate that the higher knowledge scores seen in younger health workers may be related to their utilisation of a diversity of information sources. Infection prevention knowledge has been linked to years of experience but we did not find that to be a statistically significant association in our study [18] . In our study, health workers employed at tertiary hospitals had higher odds of achieving a good knowledge score. Tertiary hospitals in South Africa provide specialist, subspecialist and intensive care services with many involved in training of health professionals [20] . The higher knowledge scores obtained by health workers at tertiary hospitals may reflect the greater focus on infection prevention and control at this level. Based on a similar argument, one would expect health workers from central hospitals to also perform well but we are unable to draw any conclusions on this as there was only one central hospital in our sample.With respect to the individual knowledge items, there appeared to be an understanding of the mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across health worker categories. Possibly the most concerning of the knowledge items, was that almost half of the participants did not know that droplet and contact precautions were needed for both confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19. Worryingly, this included almost 40% of nurses. Participants also struggled with the question related to hand hygiene with the majority of participants indicating alcohol-based hand rubs are always preferred over soap and water. This is not the case as the WHO recommends soap and water if hands are visibly soiled [12] . Contrary to the WHO's guidance, an overwhelming majority of participants indicated boots, coveralls and aprons were needed in the routine care of COVID-19 patients. The WHO recommends a medical mask, eye protection, non-sterile long-sleeved gown and gloves [12] . A majority of participants indicated that suspected COVID-19 cases should be given N95 respirators to prevent transmission to health workers while the WHO recommends they be given medical masks [12] . Though the survey was conducted during the early stages of the epidemic in South Africa, the large proportion of participants who felt they were not adequately prepared to deal with COVID-19 was concerning. On a positive note, the health workers displaying attitudes and perceptions that would put themselves or others at risk were in the minority. Approximately 12% of health workers indicated they would choose not to wear the required PPE if it were uncomfortable. This is higher than a healthcare worker KAP survey on healthcareassociated tuberculosis where 6.2% of participants indicated they would not wear a mask if it were uncomfortable [21] . Approximately 9% of the participants would treat COVID-19 patients even if the required PPE were not available indicating the vast majority of participants understood the risk of treating COVID-19 patients without PPE. It is noteworthy that 10% of participants indicated they would still continue to report for duty even if they had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 thereby putting colleagues and patients at risk. This may indicate a failure to effectively communicate the appropriate protocols to all health workers. While the proportion of participants indicating they would resign to avoid contact with COVID-19 patients was small (6.4%), it is nonetheless significant in a country already struggling with health workforce shortages in government facilities.As health worker and health facility practices are intertwined, we asked our participants about both. Appropriate training has been shown to improve both infection prevention knowledge and practices [18] but only just over half of our participants had undergone infection prevention and control training. Given the important role that PPE plays in the prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it was concerning that more than 40% of participants had not received training on the correct use of PPE. The availability of infection prevention guidelines has also been associated with improved infection prevention knowledge and practices [18] and more than 70% of participants indicated these were available in their departments. It was concerning that not all participants had access to medical masks and gloves in their departments given that these should be routinely available. While the case numbers were low in South Africa at the time of the survey, these were expected to increase and lack of access to PPE would put these health workers at risk. Given the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted by direct and indirect contact, the results for hand hygiene practices were encouraging. Our results differed markedly from the much lower 47% hand hygiene compliance rate after patient contact reported by Erasmus et al. [22] .Our survey was conducted as part of a rapid appraisal of COVID-19 occupational health and safety preparedness in four provinces of South Africa. We used convenience sampling to maximise the number of facilities that could be assessed in a short period of time. While we believe that our sample provides a fair reflection of the knowledge, attitudes and practices in health facilities in the four provinces, the non-probability sampling strategy needs to be borne in mind with respect to generalisation of the findings. Our study focussed on health workers that were likely to be the initial point of contact with COVID-19 cases at the various facilities. It is possible that their knowledge, attitudes, and practices differ from health workers working in wards and intensive care units who need to provide longer term care to COVID-19 patients. As we did not have access to patient statistics at facility level, we did not compare knowledge, attitudes and practices between health workers at healthcare facilities with high COVID-19 patient volumes and those at facilities who see few COVID-19 patients. The scientific community's understanding of COVID-19 has been rapidly evolving since the first cases were discovered. We developed our questions on the accepted understanding of COVID-19 at the time of the survey and analysed the results as such. With respect to an acceptable knowledge score, it is not clear-cut as to what an appropriate cutoff would be particularly with clinical and non-clinical cadres involved in our study. We, therefore, presented results for an adequate score of 60% and a good score of 80%. Health worker reporting of practices may not reflect actual practices and it is likely that the self-reported hand hygiene compliance is an overestimate. Substantial discrepancies between self-reported hand hygiene practices and direct observation have been reported in the literature [23, 24] .The majority of participants in our study demonstrated adequate knowledge of COVID-19 infection prevention and control with approximately a quarter of participants having good knowledge. A good knowledge score was associated with occupational category, age, and level of hospital. The attitudes of participants reflected a willingness to engage in appropriate SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control practices as well as a commitment to be involved in COVID-19 patient care.

Human coronaviruses can cause a mild disease similar to a common cold, while others cause severe diseases (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). Previously not identified in humans, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [2] , and within three months, the virus had spread across all continents in the world [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Considering its global threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30 th , 2020 declared it a public health emergency of global concern [1, 8] .According to the WHO coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) dashboard posted on 13 th February 2021 [9] , there were 107,686,655 confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease with 2,368,571 deaths globally. Continuously, numerous countries are recording large-number of cases daily. Western Pacific has 1,524,130 cases, Europe 36,294,484 cases, South-Eastern Asia 13,165,612 cases, Eastern Mediterranean region 5,975,060 cases, the Americas 48,021,725 cases, and the African region 2,703,899 cases. In that regard, panic among members of the public is imminent, which increases mental stress and excruciating psychological distress [10] .Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a family of viruses responsible to cause respiratory infection in humans and enteritis in animals [11] . The 2019-nCoV is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified [12] . Most patients show mild to moderate, pneumonia-like symptoms, and may recover without special treatment [13] . However, older people and those with underlying medical conditions develop a severe acute respiratory infection. The initial case of COVID-19 disease demonstrated a pneumonia case of unknown cause after being assessed for viral pneumonia by testing of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid using complete genome sequencing, cell cultures, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .The current COVID-19 disease has an evident high mortality rate. Frontier healthcare workers are mandated to control and manage epidemics based on their professional oaths and regulation codes. Due to high infection rates, the WHO has recommended strategic infection prevention and control (IPC) measures among healthcare workers and teams [22] . Ideally, these would reduce the rate of infection among them considering their high vulnerability [23] [24] [25] [26] . Furthermore, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f public expects them to reduce the burden amid the crisis. However, the crisis may be severe in developing countries where most health facilities are challenged with inadequate staffing, medical facilities, medical supplies, and diagnostic equipment and reagents. In that regard, the unprecedented influx of COVID-19 cases may further stretch the already inadequate human resource for health. Consequently, health workers may be working for long hours in stressful environments, which may lead to fatigue, anxiety, and depression. In China, a psychological impact report of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare workers and the general public has provided insightful facts. Therefore, healthcare workers in developing countries like Kenya should expect similar effects and perhaps severe due to other challenges such as inadequate budgetary allocation to healthcare services, out of pocket spending for healthcare services, inadequacies in healthcare infrastructure and systemic challenges due to inadequacies of implementation of key policies set by the government [27, 28] .Although there have been studies on the prevalence of self-medication among healthcare workers [29] and the general public [30] before and during the COVID-19 pandemic attributed to the current pandemic, there are no detailed studies on the levels of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers in Kenya due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the state of anxiety and depression due to the novel 2019 coronavirus disease among frontier healthcare workers in Kenya. A cross-sectional study design was employed in this study among 476 frontier healthcare workers actively involved in the management of the COVID-19 disease pandemic. Stratified sampling was used in this study. First, different cadres of frontier healthcare workers were used as strata and in each stratum, an online questionnaire was sent to their professional online groups and platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook. From each stratum, data was collected through random sampling of the received questionnaires until the required sample was reached. The shared questionnaire was anonymous to ensure data confidentiality and reliability.The sample size was determined by using the following formula: N = Z α 2 P (1−P)/d 2 , where α was 0.05, Z α was 1.96 (at the 95% confidence level) and the estimated acceptable margin of error for proportion d was 0.05. The minimum sample would be 385 participants but we ended up recruiting 476 participants.The study adopted two validated questionnaires; Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)to assess the level of anxiety and a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess the level of depression. A social-demographic section was added to capture information on; gender, age, level of education, years of experience, marital status, religion, the cluster of health facility deployed, cadre, and on-job-training on COVID-19 disease.The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire is a validated seven-item, self-report anxiety questionnaire designed by Spitzer et al. [31] to assess the patient's health status within two (2) weeks. The items indicate the level an individual feels nervous, anxious or on edge, unable to control worrying, worrying too much about different things, having trouble relaxing, being restless, being irritable, and being afraid that something negative might happen. Scores from 0, 1, 2, or 3 were tagged on symptoms; 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days,' and 'nearly every day', respectively. Then, the scores totals were presented from 0 to 21.Scores 5, 10, and 15 represented cut-off points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f respectively [32] [33] [34] . When screening for an anxiety disorder, a score of 10 and above was recommended for further evaluation [35] .The PHQ-9 is widely used as an open-access screening instrument for depression in different health care and community settings [36] , which tallies nine questions from ""0"" (not at all) to ""3""(nearly every day). The tool was developed as a fully self-administered version of the original PRIME-MD by Spitzer et al. [37] . PHQ-9 total scores for the nine items range from 0 to 27. The nine items include the experience of pleasure, feeling down, sleep disruption, energy levels, appetite, feeling of failure, trouble concentrating, speaking slowly or being fidgety, and having suicidal thoughts or self-harm over the past 2 weeks. The tool has been validated for use in primary care. Furthermore, aspects of the construct validity of the PHQ-9 have been documented in studies done both in medical settings and in the general population, exhibiting strong associations of the PHQ-9 depression severity score with diverse aspects of health-related quality of life [36, 38, 39] .Data were analysed using the Statistical Package Programme for Social Science Version 23.0.0 by IBM. Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to establish the difference in levels of anxiety and depression across the socio-economic characteristics. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to establish the predictors of levels of anxiety and depression among health care workers and associations were considered significant at p<0.05.The approval to conduct this research was obtained from the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching A majority of health care workers in the survey had mild anxiety about the COVID-19 disease pandemic, 33.8% (n=161) had moderate anxiety while less than 17.6% (n=84) had moderately severe, and 13.4% (n=64) severe anxiety as shown in Table 2 .Approximately 53.6% (n=255) of healthcare workers had a mild form of depression, 26.9%(n=128) had moderate depression, 10.3% (n=49) had moderately severe depression, and 9.2%(n=44) had severe depression as indicated in Table 3 .The univariate analysis illustrated a statistical difference in anxiety levels and the respondent's gender (p>0.002), years of work experience, (p=0.005), and the cadre (p=0.0028). Univariate analysis of the association between socio-demographic characteristics and levels of depression had a statistical difference based on respondents' genders and the level of depression due to the COVID-19 disease pandemic (p=0.045). There were no statistically significant differences across other socio-demographic characteristics based on the level of depression as shown in Table 5 .Significant variables associated with the anxiety level included in the univariate analysis were In this study, gender, years of experience, and the cadre of respondents were statistically significant in terms of anxiety. Female participants were more anxious compared to their male counterparts, and the impact on nurses was severe compared to other cadres. The current study agrees with a similar study that has shown similar results [41] . Also, studies have attributed this to the level of interactions and roles played by women in society. Therefore, their duties at the health facilities may predispose them to the virus, which would endanger their families at home [42] .Nurses are the first frontline healthcare workers to interact with patients testing positive, which makes them more vulnerable. This not only poses a danger to them but also their peers, family members, and relatives with whom they interact and live [43] .The study reported that the number of patients testing positive for COVID-19 has exponentially risen, exerting pressure on the limited public health facilities and health personnel in the country.Also, the fear of incapacity to handle COVID-19 patients had elicited anxiety among healthcare workers, due to the nature of the virus. These findings agree with studies undertaken in China during the onset of the pandemic [10, 14] .In the current study, parameter estimates revealed that for every unit increase in the level of anxiety, male respondents were 0.855 times less likely to experience anxiety as a result of COVID-19 than females, similar to anxiety, female healthcare workers were more likely to be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f depressed as a result of the COVID-19 disease pandemic, and this agrees with other studies which have been recorded during epidemics of similar nature [44] . The observed differences can be attributed to gender-based roles for women at the household level. Available studies have also noted that anxiety symptoms positively predict later depressive symptoms [45, 46] and therefore there is a need to put measures in place once there is an indication of anxiety as this will greatly impact the development of depressive symptoms [47] .Also, the current study reported a relatively high number of frontier healthcare workers without confidence in managing COVID-19 cases. This would be attributed to the novelty of the disease.This finding is in agreement with other studies conducted during disease outbreaks and pandemics in different regions [48, 49] , which have indicated that during the onset of pandemics, the healthcare workers are generally not well prepared especially in instances where the outbreak are novel.The findings of the current study indicated that the majority of healthcare workers had mild anxiety and depression. Female healthcare workers were more likely to experience severe anxiety and depression and the levels of depression differed across different cadres of respondents. Therefore, there is a need for psychosocial support for frontline healthcare workers during the pandemics.The study utilized validated tools and methodologies in assessing the levels of anxiety and depression. Whereas the data was generally representative of the study population, the scope of the current study was limited to assessing anxiety and depression levels among frontier healthcare workers due to the novel 2019 coronaviruses disease.

Several vaccines were developed and approved in record speed, and are now being distributed as quickly as possible. [5, 6] Still, affordable anti-viral treatments will still be needed for those that are not vaccinated or where vaccines fail to work. The clinical benefits of Remdesivir, the only antiviral drug approved for treatment of COVID-19, are being discussed controversially, [7] such that COVID-19 treatment remains largely supportive. Repurposing of drugs already licensed for other diseases is a comparatively fast method to meet the urgent need for effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Artesunate 2 and other synthetic derivatives of the sesquiterpene lactone natural product artemisinin 1 that is isolated from Artemisia annua plants, are the key active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of WHO-recommended anti-malaria combination therapies, used in millions of patients every year with few side effects. [8] Teas made from the leaves of A. annua plants are recommended in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat malaria [9] and teas from Artemisia plants are widely used in many African countries to treat malaria patients, albeit contrary to WHO recommendations.[10] Artemisinin and its synthetic derivatives have shown impressive effects against other parasitic infections, [11] a range of different types of cancer [12] and viruses [13] in vitro and in human clinical trials. In addition to pure, semi-synthetic substances, Artemisia teas and plant material have been explored for use to treat different diseases. [14] A. annua extract had shown anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV in 2005 [15] and SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 value: 2.5 µg/mL) [16] [18] . Standardized A. annua extracts with high artemisinin content are currently being studied in an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial against COVID- 19 [17] . Artesunate 2 was significantly more active than A. annua extracts against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [16] . The excellent safety profiles of artemisinin-based drugs in humans and their ready availability for worldwide distribution at a relatively low cost render them attractive repurposing candidates for treatment of COVID-19. Early during the pandemic, traditional medicines made from plant extracts were employed in various countries in efforts to prevent COVID-19 infections or treat COVID-19 patients. In South Africa, teas of A. afra that -in contrast to A. annua -do not contain artemisinin 1, were used widely without in vitro or clinical data. [19] In Madagascar, Covid-Organics, a drink containing mainly A. annua extract and/or plant material, was announced by the President of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina as a ""miracle cure"" in April 2020, subsequently used in the country and exported to several African nations in hope to prevent and treat COVID-19 infections.[20] Due to fears that artemisinin combination therapies against malaria may become ineffective if artemisinin-based treatments are used against COVID-19, the WHO issued a warning against the use of traditional medicines.[21] More recently, the WHO modified its recommendation and called for an investigation into the potential efficacy of plant-based treatments. [22] To date, no in vitro data concerning anti-viral effects of A. afra plant extracts or Covid-Organics has been disclosed. Here, we report that various A. annua as well as A. afra plant extracts and Covid-Organics exhibit some anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. It is unclear whether the plasma concentrations that can be achieved in humans using such extracts are sufficient to prevent or treat COVID-19 infections. Human clinical trials will be required to answer the question whether the traditional medicines may indeed have an effect in preventing or treating COVID-19 infections. Plant Material. Dried leaves of Artemisia plants grown in different countries and in different years were obtained as donations (see supporting information). Covid-Organics was purchased in Madagascar. Extraction. Distilled water (10 mL) was heated to 90 °C in an Erlenmeyer flask. Dried plant material (1 g) was added to the solvent and kept for two minutes at 90 °C, then 20 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was filtered using filter paper and solid material washed with fresh distilled water (20 x 2 mL). The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and the solid material was stored at -10 °C prior to sample preparation. An ethanolic extract of A. annua var. To determine the antiviral effect, tenfold dilutions of the compound-virus mix was incubated with CRFK or VeroE6 cells for 45 minutes at room temperature respectively. The cells were washed with PBS once, overlayed with 1.3% methylcellulose containing medium and plaque formation assessed two days post infection. Plaques of FCoV were stained with specific antibodies (primary antibody: mouse anti feline coronavirus monoclonal antibody at 1:500 dilution solution, Bio-Rad; secondary antibody: Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse at a 1:500 dilution; Thermo Fisher) and counted manually by fluorescence microscopy (Axio observer, Zeiss). SARS-CoV-2 plaques were stained using crystal violet. Cell viability assays in VeroE6. To evaluate cytotoxic effects of the tested extracts, compounds and diluent (DMSO), cell viability was studied using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8, Merck, Germany). VeroE6 cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well of flat bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark). The next day, medium was exchanged containing specified concentrations of the samples. Each concentration or dilution was tested in three replicates; at least six nontreated control wells were included in the assay. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, CCK8 Reagent (10 µL) was added per well and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, prior to recording absorbance at 450 nm using a FLUOstar OPTIMA 96-well plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany). Absorbance recorded in each well was related to the average absorbance of nontreated control wells to calculate the percentage of cell viability. Sigmoidal dose response curves were fitted and median cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values were calculated with GraphPad Prism 8.0.0.A. annua and A. afra plants were extracted using distilled water at 90 °C for two minutes and then 20 minutes at room temperature. Solids were removed by filtration and the solvents evaporated. The extracted materials were dissolved in DMSO and filtered. Artemisinin (500 mg) was dissolved in DMSO (3 mL). Covid-Organics (50 mL) was dried by rotary evaporation and dissolved in DMSO (3 mL) (see supporting information for details). To assess the antiviral activity of the extracts and pure artemisinin, we first used the feline coronavirus (FCoV), a biological safety level (BSL)2 coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 that can be handled outside of a BSL3 facility. The extracts were diluted tenfold in DMEM medium and incubated with FCoV solution with 100 PFU for 45 min at room temperature. Virus and inhibitor mix were incubated with a monolayer of CRFK cells and plaque formation assessed two days post infection. A typical dose-dependent curve of virus inhibition is shown in Figure 2 (for details see the supporting information). All samples inhibited the virus at high concentrations. The antiviral activity was clearly reduced below 2 mg/mL, as no virus inhibition was observed, while all samples showed similar activity at the range of 5 -10 mg/mL. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) was estimated based on these curves ( Table 2) . Covid-Organics showed moderate inhibitory activity against FCoV ( Figure  S1 , supporting information). The most promising samples based on the FCoV inhibition data were selected for in vitro inhibition studies using SARS-CoV-2 in the BSL3 facility. The extracts with the highest activity in on FCoV were subsequently tested for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 using plaque reduction assays. SARS-CoV-2 plaque numbers were reduced following incubation with the extracts at at 1.83 mg/mL, while no activity was detected at 0.18 mg/mL. A. annua and A. afra aqueous extract as well as an A. annua ethanolic extract showed the strongest inhibition with EC50 values below 1 mg/mL ( Figure 3 , Table 2 ). The cytotoxicity of all samples towards VeroE6 cells was assessed to ensure that any antiviral effects were not caused by toxicity. Using the Cell Counting Kit-8, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of each extract in VeroE6 cells was determined and showed a similar toxicity profile with a CC50 around 10-20 mg/mL ( Table 2 ). The selectivity index (SI) was assessed by comparing the EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 with the CC50 of the extracts. The aqueous extracts of A. annua from Burkina Faso and Brazil and A. afra from France showed an SI > 20. These tests confirmed that the extracts can inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 at levels that are not toxic to the cells. The Covid-Organics drink was first concentrated by rotary evaporation and then diluted for the test. As the exact mass concentration was unknown, the inhibitory activity is shown as percentage to the raw drinks ( Table 3 ). The EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 7.73% of raw drink using the plaque reduction assay. The selectivity index was thereby 5.28. Natural products have been a rich source for the discovery of new drugs. For thousands of years humans have turned to plants in attempts to prevent, alleviate, or heal different diseases. Today, these ""traditional medicines"" have been broadly replaced by synthetic active pharmaceutical ingredients. Still, compounds obtained by isolation from plants are used in modern approaches to treat infectious diseases, cancer, and other ailments. Many natural products exhibit antiviral activities. [24] Artemisinin, isolated from A. annua plants, and the semi-synthetic derivative artesunate 2 obtained by chemical modification, inhibit a variety of viruses [13] including SARS-CoV. [15] Given the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the use of artemisinin 1 (Figure 1) , artemisinin derivatives such as artesunate 2, as well as A. annua extracts for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [16] .Artesunate was found to be most effective in inhibiting the virus, but A. annua extracts also revealed some activity in vitro. Human phase 2 clinical trials are currently ongoing to test the efficacy of these substances in treating COVID-19.[17] Other groups reported similar findings concerning pure synthetic artemisinin derivatives [25] and whole A. annua plant material. [18] Reports that teas made from A. annua and A. afra plants, [19] as well as Covid-Organics, a drink made from A. annua leaves and Ravensara aromatica in Madagascar, [20] have been used throughout Africa. Our earlier observation that A. annua extracts can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro prompted us to test whether such extracts can indeed inhibit coronaviruses. To assess the inhibitory activity of the different plant extracts against two different coronaviruses, the feline FCoV and a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, we performed plaque reduction assays in vitro. Screening of samples was performed using FCoV in a BSL-2 facility in blind fashion. The activity of the most promising samples was subsequently tested in a BSL3 facility using a SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Short pre-incubation with the extracts significantly inhibited plaque formation of both viruses, indicating that the extracts suppress viral replication in a dose dependent manner in vitro ( Figure 3 ). Some differences in the inhibitory activity against FCoV and SARS-CoV-2 were observed and confirm reports that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive to antivirals than FCoV. The extracts, with some slightly varying activities, were found to inhibit both coronavirus FCoV and SARS-CoV-2. Among the active samples were extracts of A. annua and A. afra plants ( Figure 3 ). This finding was surprising considering that A. afra does not contain artemisinin and even more so since synthetic artesunate, a pharmacokinetically improved derivative of artemisinin, proved most active in previous in vitro SARS-CoV-2 inhibition studies [16, 25] . Our findings suggest that not just artemisinin but also other compounds present in the Artemisia extracts have inhibitory effects towards SARS-CoV-2. It has been suggested that flavonoids present in Artemisia species are active against SARS-CoV-2. [27] The commercial Covid-Organics drink prepared from A. annua plants was promoted by the president of Madagascar in April 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic without any published scientific support as to its efficacy. Subsequently, a controversy around the product and its use in several countries in Africa arose due to fears that the use of artemisinin containing extracts may result in a resistance to this drug by Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. We felt it was important to test the extracts in vitro and determine whether this product has any antiviral activity. In our in vitro test, Covid-Organics was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the concentrations we investigated (Figure 3) , with an EC50 of 7.73% to raw drink and a selectivity index of 5.28. Covid-Organics exhibited a higher antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 compared to FCoV, which could be attributed the different interactions with the viruses and/or host cells. Even though inhibition of virus infection is noticed, the selectivity index is not very promising. For all samples -A. annua and A. afra extracts as well as Covid-Organics -tested, it remains to be proven whether serum levels required to inhibit the virus can be reached in patients. Extracts showed some toxicity at higher concentrations but the selectivity index of 10 opens a useful therapeutic window to be explored in human clinical trials. It will have to be tested whether such extracts exhibit activity in the upper respiratory tract. Artemisia extracts used as teas and Covid-Organics may be potential countermeasures for COVID-19. However, the in vitro inhibition data reported here needs to be followed up with investigations in animal models as well as human clinical trials before recommendations for use in patients can be made.The following are available Figure S1 : Inhibitory activity of Covid-Organics against two different coronaviruses. Values are expressed as mean ±SD, n=3. Table  S1 : List of dried leaves and compounds from various places and their inhibitory activity against FCoV. ","Madagascar","abstract","2021-02-15",2

It caused anxiety and fear among the public with the emergence and rapid spread of the disease. Such outcomes affected individuals at a global scale in varying degrees [1] . Similar to the SARS outbreak in 2003, knowledge and attitude toward infectious diseases are associated with various levels of panic, which can subsequently impact the prevention of the spread of the disease [2, 3] .Individuals due to COVID-19 suffer from stress, anxiety, and depression [4] . Moreover, the increased requirements for personal protective measures, such as the use of detergents, frequent handwashing, and cleaning of frequently used surfaces, could exert an impact on the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in terms of incomplete cleanliness.Cases of COVID-19 in Egypt were initially announced by the end of February 2020. The Egyptian government has made considerable efforts to allocate the required human and financial resources to contain the outbreak which continues to this day. Healthcare workers (HCWs) expressed concerns regarding the increased use of masks and sanitizers, which resulted in the shortage of resources in the medical market [5] . This concern was raised in addition to the shortage of healthcare facilities and personal protective equipment, thus endangering their health (WHO, 2020), and the stigmatization of HCWs in Egypt.The different psychological impacts observed during the COVID-19 pandemic necessitate the evaluation of these domains among the Egyptian population. The limited resources of healthcare systems in Egypt, control measures for infection, and overall reduced level of public education could add to the psychological impact of the pandemic among the Egyptian population relative to other populations. Thus, the study hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic could exert a major effect on the mental health wellbeing of HCWs compared with the general population due to limited information. Furthermore, it could lead to increases in concerns about the disease without identifying treatments and in socioeconomic burden due to the lockdown strategies for reducing disease transmission. Against this background, this study evaluates the knowledge and attitude toward and socioeconomic burden of COVID-19 and assesses the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic with mental health problems regarding anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder of the general population and HCWs in Egypt.Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and socioeconomic burden of COVID-19 and to assess the associations of COVID-19 pandemic with the mental health problems regarding anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder of the general population and HCWs in Egypt.This was a cross-sectional study.The study employed a semi-structured questionnaire that was disseminated online using Google Forms between May 1 and June 1, 2020. The sample size was estimated using the EPI info statistical package Version 7. The parameters used to determine the sample size were a proportion of 0.5, a confidence level of 95%, and a margin of error of 5%. The sample size was 385 for the general population with 10% allocated as a non-response rate. A total of 524 participants responded. The study recruited the general population throughout Egypt. The participants were informed about the objective of the study and that the personal results were sent back through their e-mail (optional). The result report was sent at the end of survey with appropriate recommendation for need for psychiatric help in case of abnormal scoring of the questionnaires. They provided written informed consent before completing the questionnaire.A link to the questionnaire was sent through What-sApp and other social media platforms. The snowball sampling strategy was used. The participants were encouraged to forward the link to as many people as possible. After agreeing to participate, the participants filled up the questionnaire, which included a set of questions in sequential order over several sections as follows: demographic features, socioeconomic scale, knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19, concerns regarding COVID-19, and/or curfew and its effect on daily, social, and economic life. The last section of the questionnaire assessed mental health status using the Arabic versions of Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). The participants were further grouped into two, namely, non-HCWs and HCWs. The study defined a HCW as a person who delivers medical care and services to the sick and ailing either directly as doctors and nurses or indirectly as aides, helpers, laboratory technicians, or even (workers in) medical waste [6] .The exclusion criteria were participants aged less than 18 years or who live outside Egypt.The study obtained ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of Medicine Assiut University with Approval Number 17300381. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with registration number NCT04344834 on April 14, 2020. Informed consent was written and obtained from the study participants by their agreement to participate in the study before filling the questionnaire. The participants were assured of data protection and informed that data would be anonymous. All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standard of the institution and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments.The tool collected data on sex, age, residence, marital status, level of education, employment, number of children, smoking status, and history of chronic medical conditions.The Arabic version of the socioeconomic scale consisted of four dimensions, namely, level of education, employment, total family monthly income, and lifestyle of the family [7] .The tool included knowledge about routes of transmission, timeframe of developing the disease, protective measures used by the participants against COVID-19, expected percentage of recovery, frequency of following news about COVID-19, source and type of health information followed, and level of trust in health information.Attitude toward COVID-19 covered dealing with self and other family members if a participant is a suspected case of COVID-19, dealing with suspected and recovered infected persons nearby, level of fear of the disease, expectation about the pandemic, and whether to accept voluntary isolation hospitals.Items under this dimension were used to assess the effect of COVID-19 and/or curfew on aspects of daily life, such as relationships with children and spouses and family problems. The effect of COVID-19 on daily activities, such as eating habits, sleep, spare time, travel, necessary activities, and family visits, and aspects of children's life, such as physical, emotional, recreational, or educational, were assessed. Moreover, economic burden, such as a change in family income and work, was assessed.The study employed the Arabic version of the BAI [8] , which is a multiple-choice self-reported inventory for measuring the severity of anxiety. The scale consists of 21 items. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severe). The total score ranges between 0 and 63, where the total scores of 0-7, between 8 and 15, between 16 and 25, and between 26 and 63 indicate normal, mild, moderate, and severe levels of anxiety, respectively [9] .The scale is used to measure the severity of self-reported depression. The study utilized the Arabic version [10] . After summing the score of each item, the total score is obtained. The scale consists of 21 items with scores ranging from 0 to 63. Scores between 0 and 13, between 14 and 19, between 20 and 28, and between 29 and 63 indicate the absence of depression and mild, moderate, and severe levels of depression, respectively [11] .The Arabic version was used to specifically measure the types and severity of symptoms of OCD. The scale is composed of five items on obsessions and five items on compulsion with scores ranging from 0 to 4 (0 = no symptom, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = extreme). The maximum total score is 40. The total scores of the range of severity for obsession and compulsion are as follows: 0-7 = subclinical (normal), 8-15 = mild, 16-23 = moderate, 24-31 = severe, and 32-40 = extreme. The cut-off score of clinically significant symptoms is 16 [12] .Statistical analysis was performed out using SPSS version 21.0. Frequency distribution was used to summarize the categorical variables. Cross-tabulation was used to test for differences in categorical variables using the Chisquare test. An independent t test was used to compare continuous data. Univariable analyses using linear regression were conducted to identify the predictive factors of the occurrences of anxiety, depression, and OCD. Results were considered statistically significant at p-value ≤ 0.05.A total of 524 participants responded from 23 governorates. Table 1 states that the participants comprised 402 non-HCWs and 122 HCWs (23.3%). More than half of the participants were female (57.4%), aged between 31 and 40 years (53.05%), married (58.8%), and belonged to the middle socioeconomic class (66.6%). University graduates accounted for approximately 42% of all participants. A history of chronic medical illnesses was observed in 18.3%, and approximately 83.2% were living in urban areas.A significantly higher proportion of HCWs stated that transmission could occur through the nose, eyes, and stool relative to non-HCWs (i.e., 93.4% vs 85.1%, 69.7% vs 60.9%, and 24.6% vs 18.9%, respectively). Meanwhile, a higher percentage of non-HCWs cited transmission through the mouth (79.6%), contact with infected objects (52%), and food (19.9%). Moreover, more HCWs than non-HCWs believed that the disease develops within 14 days of exposure to a positive case (91.8%) and after contact with asymptomatic carriers (82.8%). In addition, approximately two-thirds of both groups expected recovery to be between 50 and 90%. More than two-thirds of the participants follow health information news on a daily basis with a higher proportion of HCWs (68%). A significantly high percentage reported that their sources of information are official records and social media. Significantly higher percent of HCWs follows the news regarding the dead cases (p = 0.001) ( Table 2) . Table 3 presents the analysis of the attitude or concerns toward COVID-19. In terms of dealing with the self or a family member as a suspected case of COVID-19, 51.2% and 55.7% of non-HCWs and HCWs opted for home isolation. Moreover, 58.2% of the HCWs reported using protective measures in the presence of recovered COVID-19 cases, whereas a high proportion of non-HCWs (39.1%) would avoid any contact. Conversely, 71.6% of non-HCWs would use protective measure to deal with recovered cases and 8.5% would avoid any contact relative to the HCWs. Both groups significantly differed in level of fear from the disease (p = 0.038) with a higher percentage of HCWs reporting a moderate degree of fear.Analysis of the effect of COVID-19 and/or curfew on daily living demonstrated a significantly impaired social life especially regarding children's problems for both groups with a more prominent effect among HCWs (22.1%). In contrast, non-HCWs (20.4%) reported an improvement in social life. COVID-19 and/or curfew exerted a significant effect on daily living with a higher effect in HCWs than non-HCWs mainly on family visits, travels, and eating habits. A significantly high proportion of HCWs indicated a worse impact of COVID-19 and/or curfew on their children's life in the recreational, educational, and physical aspects. A significant effect of COVID-19 was observed for economic life in both groups (p = 0.008) mainly in the form of decreased income. Approximately one-third for both groups showed a decrease in working hours, which could be related to the curfew ( Table 4) .Inventory, and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Table 5 indicates that HCWS experienced increased frequencies of anxiety (32%) and OCD (29%) than non-HCWs (30% and 28%, respectively), whereas non-HCWs had increased frequencies of depression (69%) than HCWs (66.4%).Analysis of the BAI scale demonstrated normal scores of 69.9% and 68% for HCWs and non-HCWs, respectively. Moderate degree of anxiety was higher in HCWs (13.1%), whereas those at a severe degree were higher in non-HCWs (11.2%). According to BDI scores, 31.1% and 33.6% of non-HCW and HCWs, respectively, indicated normal scores. Meanwhile, moderate degree of depression severity was higher in non-HCWs (19.9%), whereas those at a severe degree were higher in HCWs (20.5%). In addition, the Yale-Brown scale analysis illustrated that a normal score was the most frequent at 71.3% and 71.9% for HCWs and non-HCWs, respectively. Moderate and severe degrees of OCD reached 4.9% and 1.6% for HCWs and non-HCWs, respectively. No extreme score was recorded for both groups.Regression analysis demonstrated that the most significant risk factors for anxiety were being less than 20 years old, urban residency, unemployed or student status, smoking, history of chronic diseases, and low socioeconomic class. Significant risk factors for depression were age being between 20 and 30 years old, student status, smokers, and low socioeconomic class. The observed significant risk factors for OCD were being female, urban residency, and history of chronic diseases (Supplementary Table 6 ). Pandemics exert intense impacts on the mental health of a given population. Several studies reported that the general population adversely develops the psychological consequences of pandemics, such as SARS, Ebola, and H1N1 [13] [14] [15] [16] . The common themes of psychological responses to outbreaks include guilt, grief from loss, stigmatization, anxiety, and depression. Fear and anxiety related to epidemics or pandemics also influence the behavior of communities. During the H1N1 epidemic, a significant proportion of the population was unaware of the severity and preventive measures of the epidemic [17] .To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to address the psychological association between COVID-19 and anxiety, depression, and OCD in Egyptian subjects from different governorates. More than half of the participants were female, middle-aged, married, and belong to the middle-class socioeconomic level. Majority of the participants were educated, urban residents, and employed. In a similar study on Egypt that assessed the knowledge and attitude of the general public toward COVID-19, two-third of the participants were female, most of them were from urban areas, and more than half were university graduates [18] . These characteristics are expected to be dominant because these population groups have more access to the Internet and thus complete the questionnaire.Previous studies have found that the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 could range between 0 and 24 days [19] , and approximately 44% of the virus transmission can occur before symptoms emerge [20, 21] . Transmission occurs when the mouth, nose, or conjunctiva is exposed to infective droplets with certain evidence that COVID-19 could be present in fecal matter [22, 23] . The WHO (2020) has emphasized the importance of frequent hand washing, respiratory precaution, and environmental disinfection. Subsequently, the participants in the current study displayed an adequate level of knowledge regarding the mode of transmission of COVID-19, incubation period, and preventive measures. However, the HCWs utilized hand wash, masks, gloves, and alcohol more frequently than non-HCWs. Strict infection control measures in health services could increase the HCWs' use of protective measures. Conversely, a shortage of such protective measures or high cost could be the reason for the low utilization of non-HCWs. Similarly, a study on the Egyptian population found that participants demonstrated sufficient general knowledge about COVID-19, its routes of transmission, and positive attitude toward preventive measures [18] .In the current study, the participants regularly followed health information mainly through official records and the Internet with a high level of interest in news about new positive and death cases related to COVID-19. The low level of interest in following recovered cases indicates concern regarding the spread and fatality of the disease particularly with the participants' expectation of a low chance of recovery.Attitude toward the management of suspected family members showed the tendency of the participants to avoid informing health authorities or seeking medical care in hospitals and preferring home isolation or waiting for symptoms to emerge. This tendency could be explained by the stigmatization of COVID-19-infected patients. The stigma can force people to hide their illnesses and avoid immediate healthcare (WHO, 2020). In a study on Egypt, approximately 22.7% of the participants believed that COVID-19 infection is associated with stigma and that 75% of the participants were willing to undergo home isolation, whereas a low proportion was willing to stay in hospitals in the case of contact with an infected case [18] .In the current study, the attitude of the non-HCWs toward positive or recovered cases nearby indicates a fear of transmission after recovery. However, a significant proportion of HCWs felt comfortable to contact the recovered cases safely. Nevertheless, Lo et al. [24] recently reported that the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 persists for approximately 18 days in the nasopharyngeal cavity or 19 days in the feces after the improvement of symptoms.In the current study, the participants exhibited a moderate level of fear of the disease. More HCWs than non-HCWs expected worse outcomes from the epidemic. Moreover, COVID-19 exerted a negative impact on the different aspects of life of the participants, which added to the fear regarding the pandemic. This effect was more prominent in HCWs. This finding is similar to that of a study in Egypt that reported increased stress from work and home during the COVID-19 pandemic with increased financial stress [25] . In the current study, the non-HCWs reported more improvement in their social or daily life than HCWs, which could be attributed to the decrease in the working hours, thus leading to longer periods of staying at home due to the curfew and having more time for vacations. Meanwhile, the urgent increase in the demand for HCWs increased their working hours, thus putting more workload for them.HCWs displayed increased frequencies in clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and OCD than non-HCWs. In addition, HCWS suffered from severe levels of depression and OCD than non-HCWs. Several studies provided evidence that COVID-19 is severely affecting the wellbeing of healthcare professionals [26] . This result could be related to the regular following of health information, increasing concern regarding news about infection and death rates, expectation of worse outcomes from the pandemic, negative impact on social and daily lives, decreased income, decreased vacation from work due to increased work shifts, and increased risk at work. In a systematic review, Vindegaard [27] demonstrated that symptoms of depression and anxiety increased among HCWs compared to the general public. Similarly, higher levels of symptoms of OCD were reported among health professionals compared with non-medical staff.The current study illustrated that being female, young, students, smokers, and urban residents and a history of chronic diseases and low socioeconomic class were significant factors associated with high risks of anxiety, depression, and OCD. Similarly, a study in China reported that women and students suffered from high levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak [1] . Similarly, previous study reported that those with chronic illnesses are susceptible to psychological impact as they consider themselves to be of poor health and thus more susceptible to contract COVID-19 [28] .In addition, urban residence increases the occurrence of these mental health outcomes because sources of health information, such as the Internet, are more readily available in urban areas. The mean score of knowledge could be significantly lower among those living in rural areas [18] . In Egypt, the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases occurs mainly in urban areas, where isolation facilities are present. Thus, residents in cities are more aware of such cases. Meanwhile, those belonging to the low socioeconomic class tend to suffer more from the impact of COVID-19 in the economic aspect. The COVID-19 pandemic led to several implications for closure of schools, companies, and public places, and changes in work routines that led to isolation and increased physical and social distance, and feelings of helplessness [29] . The dramatic economic impact [30] and lack of interpersonal attachments could lead to poor physical and mental health [31] .In another study in Egypt, Arafa et al. [32] demonstrated that being female, working in non-health sectors, watching or reading COVID-19 news for longer than 2 h daily, and lack of emotional support were associated with a high prevalence of severe to very severe depression and anxiety among the general population. However, the said study was conducted only in four Egyptian governorates.Therefore, the present study recommends decreasing mental health consequences by encouraging daily exercise activities at home and maintaining safe modes of social communication, such as through smartphones, during the COVID-19 pandemic [33] . Early detection and effective treatment of mild clinical mood symptoms are necessary to prevent their evolution to more complex psychological responses [26] . Adequate psychiatric treatments should be provided for those presenting with severe mental health problems. Psychotherapy techniques based on the stress-adaptation model may be helpful because emotional and behavioral responses form part of an adaptive response to extreme stress [34, 35] .The present study has several limitations because it was limited to the individuals with access to smartphones, e-mail addresses, and the Internet. This group largely represents the educated population. Therefore, the findings should not be generalized across the population, particularly those with less educational attainment. Moreover, people with concerns regarding their mental health wellbeing were expected to participate as an online questionnaire was used to collect data.HCWs displayed sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 and held a positive attitude toward protective measures compared with non-HCWs. COVID-19 exerted a negative impact on the different aspects of daily, social, and economic life. HCWs displayed higher levels of anxiety and OCD than non-HCWs. Furthermore, HCWS suffered from high frequencies of clinically significant symptoms of depression and OCD in severe degrees than non-HCWs. Mental health surveillance among the public during or after the COVID-19 pandemic could promote adequate responses to the anticipated mental health issues associated with major public emergencies similar to COVID-19.","Egypt","abstract","2021-02-15",2

AUTHORS","Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in December 2019 and is the cause of a devastating pandemic resulting in more than 100 million infections and over 2 million deaths within the last year. COVID-19 shows an extremely variable clinical course: ranging from an asymptomatic state or mild respiratory symptoms to severe viral pneumonia with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome . While most COVID-19 cases are mild (~80%), up to a quarter of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons present with severe disease necessitating hospitalization and ~5% of critical cases require intensive care, putting extreme pressure on health systems. Severe disease is most commonly observed in those with advanced age, male gender and pre-existing co-morbidities (such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity or chronic lung disease) (Clark et al., 2020) . Immunologically, COVID-19 severity has been associated with major systemic alterations of the host immune system, including profound lymphopenia, skewed distribution and activation of T cell subpopulations, disruption of the B cell compartment and elevated plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (Chen and John Wherry, 2020; Laing et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . A growing body of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response plays a key role in modulating COVID-19 pathogenesis (Meckiff et al., 2020; Oja et al., 2020; Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020; Sattler et al., 2020; Schub et al., 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020) . And while the precise nature of T cell responses conferring protection is still unclear, it is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 elicits a broad T cell response in the majority of patients, with CD4 responses being dominant over CD8 (Altmann and Boyton, 2020) . Moreover, pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells may also contribute to the divergent manifestations of COVID-19. These cells, likely acquired during previous infections with endemic human coronaviruses, have been identified in 20 to 50% of SARS-CoV-2unexposed individuals in different populations around the world (Braun et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020; Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020; Sette and Crotty, 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020) . It is yet to be determined whether pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient to confer protection or attenuate the severity of COVID-19. Our knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 induced immune responses is rapidly expanding, yet very few studies have simultaneously examined the magnitude, functional and phenotypic profile of SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells in relation to disease severity. This represents an important gap in our understanding of the role played by T cells during the clinical course of COVID-19, which has implications for pathogenesis and the assessment of vaccine efficacy. Importantly, in countries with a high burden of HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections, the intersecting coronavirus, HIV-1 and TB epidemics pose additional public health challenges. HIV infection induces a profound dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems (Deeks et al., 2015) , weakening the host's ability to mount and/or maintain immune responses to other pathogens or upon vaccination (Avelino-Silva et al., 2016; Rubin et al., 2014) . Furthermore, immune dysfunctions often persist despite anti-retroviral therapy (ART) (Klatt et al., 2013) . It is therefore likely that HIV-1 infection will impair the SARS-CoV-2 immune response. Likewise, co-infection with active tuberculosis (aTB) and COVID-19 is also of particular concern. Both diseases are primarily respiratory illnesses, eliciting a hyper-inflammatory state in the lung. It is thus reasonable to speculate that the hyperinflammatory milieu induced by COVID-19 could accelerate TB disease progression and viceversa (Gupta et al., 2020b) . Moreover, profound lymphopenia and hyper-inflammation associated with COVID-19 could favor Mtb reactivation. These concerns are further underlined by several large epidemiological studies showing that, both HIV-1 and active TB independently associate with an increased risk of COVID-19-related death (Bhaskaran et al., 2021; Boulle et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020a; Davies, 2020; Geretti et al., 2020; Tamuzi et al., 2020) . It is thus an urgent research priority to investigate the profile of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and/or active TB and to assess the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on the Mtb-specific memory CD4 T cell response.In this study, focused on pathogen-specific CD4 T cell responses, our aims were to: 1) Compare the profile of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cells and COVID-19induced CD4 T cells, 2) Define the relationship between COVID-19 severity and the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response, 3) Investigate the impact of HIV and/or active TB coinfection on the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response and 4) Assess the effect of COVID-19 on the Mtb-specific CD4 T cell response.Using a whole blood assay, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2-and Mtb-specific CD4 T cell response in hospitalized COVID-19 (n = 95) and non-COVID-19 patients (n = 38). The clinical characteristics of patients are presented in Table 1 . COVID-19 cases were defined based on a documented positive SARS CoV-2 PCR swab result and hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients were all SARS CoV-2 PCR negative and had no detectable SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsidspecific IgG measured in blood collected at enrolment. Samples were collected at a median of 2 days (IQR: 1-4) after admission to hospital, Cape Town (South Africa). Briefly, the median age was comparable between the two groups (52 vs 51 years) and male predominated in the COVID-19 group (57.9% vs 34.2%, P = 0.014). A high proportion of co-morbidities, such as hypertension (46.3%), diabetes (32.6%) and obesity (26.3%), was reported in the COVID-19group. The non-COVID-19 controls were well-matched to the COVID-19 group in terms of prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity. However, a greater proportion of non-COVID-19 controls had cardiovascular (44.7% vs 7.3%, P < 0.0001) and other respiratory diseases (28.9% vs 2.1%, P < 0.0001) compared to the COVID-19 group. COVID-19 patients had a range of different requirements for oxygen therapy and supportive care, as reflected by their World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale score (see methods), with approximately half being classified as mild/moderate cases (WHO < 5) and the other half as severe cases (WHO ≥ 5). Most non-COVID-19 controls did not require oxygen therapy (57.9%). The majority of the COVID-19 patients received treatment with steroids (78.9%) following the outcome of the RECOVERY trial (Recovery Collaborative Group et al., 2020) . About 1/3 of the recruited participants were HIV-1 infected (n = 31). In the COVID-19 group, the majority of HIV-1-infected patients were on ART (74.2%) with a median CD4 count of 132 cells/mm 3 and a median log viral load <1.3 log mRNA copies/ml. HIV-1-infected non-COVID controls had a lower median CD4 count (20 cells/mm 3 , P = 0.03) and higher viral loads (5.37 log mRNA copies/ml, P = 0.0005) owing to proportionally fewer participants being on ART in this group (46.1%). Lastly, 15 participants in the COVID-19 group had active TB (8 of them also being HIV-1 infected) and 5 non-COVID-19 controls had active TB (all of them being HIV-1 infected). It is important to mention that most of the HIV-1 infected participants without active TB were virally suppressed (77.3%, 17/22), while only one of the seven HIV-1 infected participants with active TB was aviremic.The WHO ordinal scale, stratifying patients according to their oxygen therapy requirement, has been widely used as correlate of COVID-19 severity. Additionally, a wide range of nonspecific indicators of systemic inflammation (including amongst others: C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, serum amyloid A (SAA), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Ddimer, IL-6, IL-10, white cell count or neutrophil count) have been associated with adverse COVID-19 outcome (Chen et al., 2020b; Izcovich et al., 2020; Szarpak et al., 2020; . Furthermore, higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies have been shown to associate with increased COVID-19 severity (Bosnjak et al., 2020; Klein et al., 2020) . In this study cohort, we also observed increased level of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in patients with severe COVID-19 defined by the WHO ordinal scale ( Figure S1 ). Thus, based on the clinical data available in this study, eight clinical parameters were combined to perform a hierarchical clustering analysis, including WHO ordinal scale scoring, Roche Elecsys® anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody cut-off index (COI), white cell count (WCC), CRP, D-dimer, Ferritin, LDH and radiographic evidence of disease expressed as % of unaffected lung. Two main clusters were identified: cluster 1 encompassed almost exclusively COVID-19 cases (92%), while cluster 2 contained 62.5% of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 uninfected controls and 37.5% of COVID-19 cases. Moreover, two subgroups emerged from cluster 1, where cluster 1a was enriched in COVID-19 patients who died ( Figure 1A&B ). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a good separation between COVID-19 cases and hospitalized non-COVID-19 controls with PC1 accounting for 32.7% and PC2 17.4% of the variance ( Figure 1C) . The corresponding loading plot shows that the lung % unaffected score, oxygen therapy requirement and white cell count were the main drivers of PC1 variance ( Figure 1D) .Furthermore, the PC1 score in COVID-19 patients who died was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) compared to patients who survived ( Figure 1E ). This analytical approach grades disease severity as a continuum, allowing the simultaneous integration of multiple clinical parameters of known relevance in COVID-19 outcome.(79/95) of COVID-19 patients exhibited a SARS-CoV-2-specific response ( Figure 2B) . This data concords with several publications demonstrating the presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cells in 20 to 50% of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals Le Bert et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020; Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020) . We observed high variability in the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 CD4 T cell response amongst the SARS-CoV-2 responding participants from both groups; although not statistically significant, the median response in COVID-19 cases was ~ 3-fold higher compared to non-COVID controls (0.17%, [IQR: 0.08-0.55] and 0.05%, [IQR: 0.03-0.36], respectively) ( Figure 2C ). Of note, in the COVID-19 group, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T cells strongly associated with the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG (P < 0.0001, r = 0.61) (Figure S2A ), as previously reported (Demaret et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020) .When cytokine responses were analyzed individually, TNFα was the predominant cytokine produced by CD4 cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides (using a short-term (5 h) whole blood assay) in both groups, with its production being significantly higher compared to IL-2 and IFNγ ( Figure S2B ). Combined analyses of all measured cytokines IFNγ and TNFα) showed that the overall polyfunctional profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific cells in COVID-19 participants was distinct from uninfected controls (P < 0.0001). In COVID-19, the CD4 response was characterized by limited expression of IFNγ and was enriched in cells coexpressing IL-2 and TNFα. Conversely, in non-COVID controls, most SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells were distributed between triple functional cells (IL-2+IFNγ+TNFα+) and cells coproducing IFNγ and TNFα ( Figure 2D ).As expected, the expression of HLA-DR, CD38 and Ki67 on SARS-CoV-2 responding CD4 T cells were significantly higher in COVID-19 cases compared to non-COVID-19 controls (P = 0.005, <0.0001 and 0.004, respectively), likely reflecting ongoing viral replication ( Figure   2F ). The expression of CD38 and Ki67 inversely associated with the time COVID-19 patients spent in clinical care (P = 0.0006, r = -0.39 and P = 0.017, r = -0.27, respectively, data not shown). As previously reported (Altmann and Boyton, 2020; Neidleman et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020) , in convalescent COVID-19 patients (n=9), although the expression of HLA-DR, CD38 and Ki67 in SARS-CoV-2 CD4 T cells was significantly reduced compared to acute COVID-19 patients (reflecting viral clearance), cells maintained an elevated PD1 expression and retained their early differentiated phenotype ( Figure S2C ).Pairwise associations of the functional and phenotypic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 responding CD4 cells identified two signatures: 1) Activated cells exhibiting an early differentiated memory phenotype and preferentially secreting IL-2 and TNFα, characteristic of COVID-19 patients and 2) Late differentiated memory cells with elevated GrB expression endowed with polyfunctional capacities predominantly observed in SARS-CoV-2 responsive CD4 T cells from uninfected individuals ( Figure 2G ). To determine if the overall phenotypic profile of SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells allows discrimination between COVID-19induced and pre-existing cross reactive CD4 responses, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA, Figure 2H ) and hierarchical clustering analysis ( Figure S2D ), including eight parameters (e.g., the proportion of IFNγ+TNFα+IL2+, IFNγ-TNFα+IL2+ IFNγ-TNFα+IL2and cells, the proportion of ED, and GrB, HLA-DR, CD38 and Ki67 expression). Both analyses showed that based on the functional and phenotypic traits of SARS-CoV-2 responding CD4 T cells, COVID-19 patients could be discriminated from non-COVID-19 controls.These functional profiles also related to disease outcome ( Figure 3B , inset). Assessing the phenotypic profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, the following trends were observed in less severe forms of COVID-19 (WHO ≤ 4): increased expression of CD38, Ki67 and GrB;and reduced expression of HLA-DR. However, PD1 expression and the memory maturation profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells were comparable between COVID-19 patients, stratified by their WHO score. (Figure 3C ).Each functional and phenotypic attribute of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells was assessed individually for the strength of its correlation with disease severity (defined by the composite analysis of clinical parameters described in Figure 1C (e.g., PC1 severity)). The highest Spearman rank r values for significant negative correlations were observed between the proportion of IFNγ+IL-2+TNFα+ cells, GrB and Ki67 expression and disease severity, while positive associations were found between the proportion of IFNγ-IL-2-TNFα+ cells, HLA-DR expression and disease severity ( Figure 4A) . Moreover, the global functional and phenotypic pattern of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells described in Figure 2H (PC2 phenotype) associated with patients' WHO ordinal scale score and outcome (survived vs deceased) ( Figure   4B ). Overall, COVID-19 severity (PC1 severity) strongly correlated with the traits of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells (PC2 phenotype) (P = 0.0006, r = -0.43, Figure 4C ), with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity and enhanced HLA-DR expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells.While the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responders were similar between HIV-/aTB-, HIV+/ aTB-and HIV-/aTB+ patients (≥ 83%), in HIV-infected patients with aTB (HIV+/aTB+), only 25% (2/8) exhibited detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells ( Figure   5B ). Of note, amongst responders, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells were comparable between all groups ( Figure 5B ). As HIV+/aTB+ patients are characterized by low absolute CD4 counts (median: 106 cells/mm 3 ), we hypothesized that the lack of a SARS-CoV-2 specific response could be related to CD4 lymphopenia. As recent CD4 count data was not available for all patients, we used the frequency of total CD4 T cells, measured by flow cytometry, as a surrogate measurement of CD4 count, with the lowest frequencies of CD4 T cells being observed in participants with HIV-1+/aTB+ ( Figure S3B ). The frequency of total CD4 cells was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 responders compared to non-responders (median: 25% and 9%, respectively, P = 0.0013) ( Figure 5C ). Moreover, in HIV-infected patients, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells associated with the frequency of total CD4 T cells (P = 0.0006, r = 0.58, Figure 5D ) and absolute CD4 count (P = 0.001, r = 0.59, data not shown). Interestingly, patients co-infected with HIV and aTB also exhibited a limited capacity to generate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with only 3 out of 8 patients having a positive serology of modest magnitude ( Figure 5E ). As for the frequency of SARS-CoV-2specific CD4 response, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies correlated with the frequency of total CD4 T cells in HIV-infected patients (P = 0.0011, r = 0.56, Figure 5F ). Of note, in our cohort, the lack of a SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 response in patients with aTB was not associated with increased mortality, with death being recorded in 4 out of the 8 SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responders and 2 out of the 7 of CD4 non-responders (data not shown).We did not observe significant differences in the memory and activation profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells based on patients' HIV or TB status ( Figure S3C ). However, in COVID-19 patients with concomitant aTB, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells displayed lower polyfunctional capacity, characterized by significant reduction of the cells with three functions, compared to HIV-/aTB-patients ( Figure 5G ). Finally, while HIV infection did not significantly alter the functional and phenotypic profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell, in patients with aTB, the global SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell pattern was significantly different compared to HIV-uninfected COVID-19 patients ( Figure 5H ).Many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, cause a temporary immunosuppressive effect, which could lead to the reactivation of subclinical bacterial infection (Low et al., 2004) . Thus, in a TB endemic country such as South Africa, many concerns have been raised about the possibility that COVID-19 could reactivate latent tuberculosis.To better understand the potential impact of COVID-19 on Mtb co-infection, we compared the frequency and phenotype of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells in COVID-19 patients, hospitalized non-COVID controls and outpatient participants with latent TB (LTBI) or aTB recruited to unrelated studies prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic ( Table S2) . Mtb-specific T cell responses were also assessed using a whole blood assay ( Figure 6A ). As HIV infection is known to decrease Mtb-specific CD4 T cell response and aTB induces significant changes in the phenotype of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells (Riou et al., 2017) , patients were grouped according to their HIV and TB status for this analysis. The proportion of CD4 responders to SARS-CoV-2 and Mtb were comparable in HIV-uninfected COVID-19 patients (~90%). In HIV-infected patients with COVID-19, the proportion of a Mtb-specific CD4 response was significantly lower compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 (48% vs 83%, respectively, P = 0.013). Conversely, in COVID-19 patients with aTB, SARS-CoV-2 responses were only detected in 40% of participants, whilst 14/15 (93%) exhibited an Mtb-specific CD4 response ( Figure 6B) . We did not find any relationship between the extent of CD4 lymphopenia and the absence of a Mtbspecific responses (data not shown). Upon comparison of the frequency of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells between the current cohort and the 2018 pre-pandemic cohort with LTBI, we found that the magnitude of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells was ~5-fold lower in the HIV-uninfected COVID-19 group and a ~2-fold lower in the HIV-infected COVID-19 group compared to pre-pandemic samples (medians: 0.17% vs 0.53% for HIV-, P < 0.0001; and 0.09% vs 0.17% for HIV+, P = 0.052, respectively). However, comparable frequencies were observed in those with aTB (medians: 0.35% for COVID-19 vs 0.53% for pre-pandemic cohort, P = 0.3) ( Figure 6C ). This data suggests that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may diminish the pool of Mtb-specific memory T cell responses.Moreover, in these patients, the memory maturation profile and expression of other activation markers (such as CD38, Ki67 and PD1) in Mtb-specific CD4 T cells were similar between COVID-19 patients and hospitalized non-COVID controls ( Figure S4) . In aTB patients, elevated HLA-DR expression was observed compared to latently infected individuals, as expected. However, while not statistically significant, the proportion of activated Mtb-specific CD4 T cells tended to be higher in COVID-19 co-infected patients compared to the non-COVID-19 group (median: 74 % [IQR: 49-94] vs 57.7% [IQR: 50-77], respectively) ( Figure   6E ). This suggests that acute COVID-19 does not promote the reactivation of latent Mtb infection but could enhance the activation of the Mtb-specific CD4 T cell response during active TB.In this study, using a cohort of acute COVID-19 cases and SARS-CoV-2 uninfected hospitalized patients, we interrogated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response patterns in relation to various measures of clinical disease severity to better understand the immune determinants of COVID-19 clinical course. Moreover, in a subset of patients, we investigated whether HIV and/or tuberculosis co-infections affected the CD4 response against SARS-CoV-2, and conversely whether COVID-19 impacted on the Mtb-specific CD4 response.First, by measuring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 responses, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4 T cells were detected in a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected patients (~34%). This is in accordance with several studies reporting that SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive memory T cells are detectable in 20 to 50% of individuals with no prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (Braun et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020; Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020; Sette and Crotty, 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020) . Limited information is available regarding the phenotype and function of these memory responses. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells were qualitatively different in acute COVID-19 cases compared to uninfected individuals. In the former group, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells almost exclusively displayed an early differentiated memory phenotype and limited capacity to produce IFNγ; while in the latter group, SARS-CoV-2-responsive CD4 T cells preferentially exhibited a late differentiated memory phenotype and were enriched in GrB, suggesting that cytotoxic memory CD4 T cells could be a relevant component in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, as previously described for other viral infections (Juno et al., 2017) . However, to date, the functional role for pre-existing crossreactive T cell memory in COVID-19 remains unproven. In a comprehensive review, Leipsitch et al. describe three possible scenarios outlining potential mechanisms by which cross-reactive memory T cells could confer some form of protection against COVID-19, by reducing the viral burden and/or limiting disease severity or its duration (Lipsitch et al., 2020) .Here, we report on the immune profile of SARS-CoV-2 CD4 response in hospitalized acute COVID-19 patients stratified by disease severity based on multiple clinical parameters of known relevance in COVID-19 outcome. Our data show that the quality rather than the quantity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells may contribute to an efficient COVID-19 immune response as previously described for other viral infections (Seder et al., 2008) . Indeed, more severe forms of COVID-19 correlate with the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 response displaying a limited capacity to produce IFNγ, reduced expression of GrB and Ki-67, and elevated expression of HLA-DR. This accords with other reports also showing that reduced IFNγ production characterizes severely ill patients (Oja et al., 2020; Schub et al., 2020) .Moreover, the overall profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells differed significantly between COVID-19 survivors and patients who died. The altered Th1 profile observed in severe COVID-19, reminiscent of an exhausted phenotype, could contribute to increased inflammation with poorer viral control. It thus remains to be seen whether recovery from COVID-19 would induce long lasting, efficient memory T cells, regardless of the severity of the COVID-19 episode.In this study, we also report, for the first time, the impact of HIV, TB and HIV/TB co-infection on SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis and/or HIV-1 pose an additional health threat. In South Africa, two large epidemiological studies have shown that TB and HIV-1 were independently associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death (Boulle et al., 2020; Davies, 2020) . Although comorbidities associated with HIV-1 and TB may primarily drive COVID-19 severity in these populations, it is also plausible that HIV and/or TB-associated immune dysregulation may contribute to heightened risk.Immunological data on the SARS-CoV-2 response in the context of active TB co-infection is even more scarce (Gupta et al., 2020a) . As both diseases can elicit a hyper-inflammatory state in the lung with overlap in the cytokine and chemokine profile found in broncho-alveolar lavage samples during severe COVID-19, TB or HIV/TB co-infection (Esmail et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2020) , it can be speculated that one disease may exacerbate the other, leading to unfavorable outcomes. Here, we show that active TB co-infection skewed the functional profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, leading to a reduction of their polyfunctional capacity. It is possible that the excessive inflammation triggered by COVID-19 and TB coinfection underlies the premature functional exhaustion of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells.Future studies to specifically examine differences in the inflammatory environment between COVID-19 and COVID-19/aTB patients in blood and in the lung would shed more light on the interplay between the two diseases.Additionally, in countries where the prevalence of latent Mtb infection is high, the profound lymphopenia induced by SARS-CoV-2 and use of steroids as a treatment for COVID-19 could: 1) predispose patients to TB reactivation as a consequence of a transient suppression of cellular immunity and/or 2) increase the risk of progressive primary TB infection by reducing the pool of memory T cells targeting Mtb. We showed in this study that COVID-19 did not induce a concomitant activation of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may not immediately result in progression of latent Mtb to subclinical or active TB disease. However, we found a significant reduction in the frequency of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy pre-pandemic participants with LTBI. As an intact T cell response is an essential component in Mtb control, this decline in Mtb-specific CD4 T cells could impact the ability of the host to control latent or new Mtb infection.Overall, our results show that the functional and phenotypic signature of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, rather than magnitude, associates with COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients. These results further advance our knowledge of the COVID-19 immunopathology, inform potential correlate of protection and could provide a rationale for future evaluation of novel vaccine responses. Moreover, our findings reveal potential mechanisms by which HIV-1 and TB co-infections could exacerbate COVID-19 pathology.CR, EdB, CS, RD and RJW designed the study.

The clinical characteristics of all patients included in this study are presented in Table 1 and the comparisons of the clinical characteristics between discharged and deceased COVID-19 patients are presented in Table S1 . The University of Cape Town's Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study (HREC: 207/2020) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants with the capacity to provide it.Relatives provided proxy consent for those participants without capacity to consent for themselves (e.g., due to decreased level of consciousness). In cases where participants regained capacity, informed consent was obtained from them directly at that time.SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were assayed by the Roche Elecsys ® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). This semi-quantitative electrochemiluminescent immunoassay measures SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG. The assay was performed by the NHLS and interpreted according to manufacturers' instructions (Roche: V 1.0 2020-05). Results are reported as numeric values in form of a cut-off index (COI; signal sample/cut-off), where a COI < 1.0 corresponds to non-reactive plasma and COI ≥ 1.0 to reactive plasma. At 14 days post-SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation, the sensitivity and specificity of the Elecsys ® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay is reported as 99.5% (95% CI, 97.0 to 100.0%) and 99.80% (95% CI, 99.69 to 99.88%), respectively (2020; Favresse et al., 2020; Muench et al., 2020) .Cell staining was performed on cryopreserved cells that were thawed, washed and permeabilized with a Transcription Factor perm/wash buffer (eBioscience). Cells were then stained at room temperature for 45 min with antibodies for CD3 BV650, CD4 BV785, CD8 Table S3 . Samples were acquired on a BD LSR-II and analyzed using FlowJo (v9.9.6, FlowJo LCC, Ashland, OR, USA). A positive response was defined as any cytokine response that was at least twice the background of unstimulated cells.","South Africa","first author","2021-02-20",2

Due to the increasing numbers of morbidity and mortality rates infections among the general populations globally, COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 [1] . Although the fatality rate of COVID-19 is about 2 to 5%, the rate exceeds 10% among the geriatric population aged over 60 years [5] .This disease has extended to over 206 countries with 1,051,635 confirmed cases, and 56,985 deaths recorded as of 4 th April 2020 [6] .The gradual surging of COVID-19 cases has outpaced the capacity of an already-fragile health and disease surveillance systems in Africa to trace, and contain people with suspected infection [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In particular, major shortages of protective clothing and health care workers (there are 2.7 physicians per 10,000 population in Africa and parts of South America compared with 21.5 in North Americas and 32.1 in Europe), laboratory capacity and intensive care facilities (some European countries have 29 beds per 100,000 population, 35 in the USA and 5 or less in many low and middle income countries), hospital beds (> 12 per 1000 population in much of Europe vs. 1-2 in many low and middle income countries) and this situation has placed health institutions under tremendous pressure to contain the spread of COVID 19 [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Mortality rates among infected healthcare workers likely to be higher in many parts of Africa given the limited number of critical care beds [2] .With restrictions on face to face clinical consultations and the increased risk of occupational exposure for medical practitioners delivering patient care, the COVID19 pandemic has catalysed the use of telehealth in providing timely clinical care, education, and healthcare, at a low cost and extensive coverage [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Telehealth, a term sometimes used interchangeably with telemedicine, means ""healing at a distance"" and signifies the use of information and communication technologies to improve patient outcomes by increasing access to care and medical information [26] . It utilises technological solutions such as e-mail, messaging systems, smartphones, tablets, wireless monitors, teleconferencing, video conferencing and other forms of telecommunication technologies [27] . A growing body of evidence suggests that care delivered through telehealth allows patients to be efficiently screened, is both patientcentred and conducive to self-quarantine, and it protects patients, clinicians, and the general community from exposure to COVID-19 [22, 23, [27] [28] [29] . This is particularly important for Africa where health care systems are weak and there are shortages of PPE for healthcare workers.Whilst the potential benefits of telehealth are clear, the uptake of telehealth in emergency situations has been limited [30] . The efficacy and impact of leveraging of telehealth services on clinical outcomes remains scarcely documented [31, 32] . Although quality randomised controlled trials are the standard to demonstrating the effectiveness of telehealth intervention in health care delivery, they may be limited in their generalisability and accounting for intervention adaptations or contextual factors that may influence outcomes in different settings and for different populations [33, 34] . New implementation science methods such as rapid evidence reviews have been noted as providing faster and better research on telehealth implementation and protocols for care coordination [35] . Recent studies also recommend further research into the methods that are best suited for evaluating the different types of telehealth applications, according to their target users and the particular health conditions being addressed [32] . COVID-19 appears to be a rather long term problem and it is urgent to conduct research which feeds into Evidence Based Practice for sustainable long term solutions.We conducted a rapid review in order to evaluate the available evidence with regards to for telehealth consultation and the deployment of telehealth interventions for the diagnosis, contact tracing and optimal care of COVID19 patients in sub Saharan Africa. A review was undertaken to answer the following questions: (1) How effective are telehealth interventions in the diagnosis, patient tracing and care of COVID19 patients ? (2) what lessons/ best practices can clinical decision makers and policy makers' use in the implementation of telehealth interventions in sub Saharan Africa ? This synthesis provides insight into the experience of using telehealth interventions and is useful for researchers and healthcare practitioners in improving patient safety and care and reducing the per capita cost of health care.The protocol for this review was submitted to the University of South Africa Ethics Committee. The findings of this review were reported in accordance with the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement guidelines [36] . The advantage of using this approach is that multiple qualitative studies can pulled together data across different contexts for the generation of new conceptual models, identification of research gaps, and to provide evidence for the development, implementation and evaluation of health interventions. Against the backdrop of a high telephone penetration and need for social distancing, it is quintessential to investigate means for efficacious implementation of telemedicine.Research studies that met the following criteria were included: (i) studies that presented qualitative data, commentaries or reviews on the use of telehealth interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) studies that reported findings for sub Saharan Africa (iii) studies that reported outcomes or observations relating to diagnosis, tracking and optimal care for COVID-19 patients; and (iv) studies that focused on clinical decision makers such as doctors, patients or nurses who use telehealth interventions within COVID19 situations. The exclusion criteria set out for this study excluded non-English-language studies, quantitative studies such as RCTs and quasi-experimental studies conducted in developed countries, unpublished reports (such as grey literature, dissertations or conference abstracts), study protocols and non-intervention studies that report on the use of telehealth for other conditions such as cardiology, dermatology, gastroenterology, oncology and so on.We identified relevant studies published within the period 1 January 2020 through 30 July 2020. The start date of 1 January 2020 was selected because this is the approximate time when articles about the COVID19 started appearing on the research scene on a sustainable basis. The electronic search was conducted in three electronic bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed literature in medical and social science research: MEDLINE, Science Direct and Cochrane Library. In addition, we also used Google Scholar in order to search for missed articles that met the inclusion criteria. The search terms included key word sets of synonyms and variations in combinations of key words relating to telehealth and the related interventions, COVID19 and sub Saharan Africa as shown in Table 1 below.Previous reviews were consulted for the selection of appropriate search terms or key words [37] . A manual search also included a review of articles published in high ranking journals relating to telehealth or among which telehealthrelated articles had recently been published. These included: An initial selection of potential articles was based on the screening of the title and abstract by the primary reviewer (TKM). Given that the title and abstract did not provide sufficient information to determine eligibility, the full-text publications of all potentially relevant citations were downloaded and perused by two reviewers who independently excluded articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria (TKM and MM). The reference lists of all full-text publications were also retrieved and skimmed for eligibility of relevant articles.The articles that met the eligibility criterion were downloaded, read, and analysed and the relevant themes illustrating the effectiveness of telehealth in the diagnosis, contact tracing and optimal care for COVID19 patients and the best practices that clinical decision makers and policy makers' use in the implementation of telehealth interventions in sub Saharan Africa were compiled [ Table 2 ]. To avoid selection bias, the two authors carried out the full-text article review and any disagreements were resolved through consensus The methodological rigor of each selected study was assessed using a set of seven items adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool [38] . The following aspects were taken into account in the evaluation of studies of the selected studies; (i) clarity of aims and objectives; (ii) the appropriateness of the qualitative methodology; (iii) the appropriateness of the research design to the aims and objectives (iv) the appropriateness of the participant recruitment strategy to the research aims and objectives; (v) the relevance of the data collected in answering the research aims and objectives; (vi) the researcher reflexivity (vii) consideration of ethical issues in the study (viii) the rigor of the data analysis (ix) the availability of a clear statement of findings (x) the value of the research. The articles were rated as having minor, moderate, or major concerns based on evaluation of two reviewers (TM and MM).The 7 studies included in the synthesis were conducted in 2 countries [Nigeria (× 1), Zimbabwe (× 1)], and commentaries covering the entire sub Saharan Africa in general (× 4) and to Uganda (× 1). All the included articles and commentaries were published in 2020. The recent timeline is important because the various articles represent the latest thinking regarding telehealth in the research community regarding COVID-19. A study done in Nigeria explored how mobile positioning data technology can be used to reduce the spread of COVID-19 [39] . Another study explored how video calls can be used to address the secondary effects of COVID19 such as social isolation and loneliness [40] . This opens a very interesting linkage to psycho-social support, social work and counselling for COVID-19 patients going through quarantine related social isolation. Three commentary papers included in this synthesis explored how telehealth can be used in the prevention and management of COVID-19 [30, 41, 42] . Another commentary specific to Uganda explored the rising roe of digital technologies in medical service delivery especially within the intra COVID period [43] . One rapid review explored the challenges facing the health sector during the COVID19 period and how telehealth can close in that gap [13] . Five out of seven studies (71.4%) were perceived to have moderate methodological issues and two (28.6%) were considered as having minor issues. Overall, studies rated as moderate did not explore the contextual factors in specific sub Saharan countries that may hinder or enable the successful use of telehealth. Two of the three papers rated as having minor issues reported country specific findings but did not include primary data and participants' verbatim quotes to substantiate findings. Table 2 below provides a summary of the included studies.Five main issues emerged from the studies that reported on the use of telehealth interventions in the diagnosis, contact tracing and care of COVID 19 patients: (1) mobile positioning data significantly improves decision making, capacity and scope of timely response to COVID19 (2) application of teleconsultation is effective for emergency medical dispatching when suspicious symptoms are detected by an individual and thus reduce the risks of infection through personal contact; (3) telehealth interventions are effective as mental health tools for relieving stress among health care workers; (4) lessons for clinicians and policy makers which include standardized guidelines for telemonitoring of patients are necessary and should be based on evidence and best practices to support appropriate safeguards and regulatory oversight and reducing the costs of accessing the telehealth interventions in developing countries; (5) Future research needs to design and implement models for mobile position contact tracing. Researchers ought to envisage the post COVID era as an opportunity to rebuild and to formulate alternative research designs and new research methods such as the using of digital technologies as outbreak investigation platforms and not just as a tool for field data collection.The overarching questions guiding this review were; how effective are telehealth interventions in the diagnosis, patient tracing and care of COVID19 patients and what lessons/ best practices can clinical decision makers and policy makers' use in the implementation of telehealth interventions in sub Saharan Africa. We used thematic analysis to combine the studies reporting on the use of telehealth interventions within the context of COVD19 and we identified key themes from the included studies [44, 45] .Regarding the first question, the findings from the included studies indicate that mobile positioning data can significantly improve decision making, capacity and scope of timely response to COVID19. African countries such as Nigeria are currently using mobile data to monitor and tracking of mobile phones of confirmed cases, suspected patients and known contacts of confirmed cases [39] . Analysis of ready satellite data have also been made available across African countries through the Digital Earth Africa online platform to support decision making by clinicians, It has also been integrated with other information platforms supporting the COVID 19 response in Africa.From these cases, it was apparent that collaborations between the government, mobile network operators and technology companies were utilised for successful mobile positioning data tracing interventions and other African countries can emulate the same. However, policy makers need to ensure that the current guidelines and regulations for data handlers incorporate measures to curb misuse and unauthorized access. Standardized guidelines for telemonitoring of patients are necessary and should be based on evidence and best practices to support appropriate safeguards and regulatory oversight [34] . Continuous efforts also need to be done in order to reduce the costs of accessing the telehealth interventions in developing countries [8] .In addition, the work reviewed suggest that telehealth interventions are effective as mental health tools for relieving stress among health care workers. Recent studies demonstrate that the incidence of anxiety and stress disorder is high among medical staff caring for COVID-19 patients, especially nurses and these conditions undermine their decision making ability and quality of interaction with patients [46, 47] . Under such conditions, social media interventions such the Vula platform in South Africa have been effective in offering mental health support for healthcare workers [48] . Video calls were also noted as effective in addressing social isolation and loneliness especially among the elderly patients who are considered as vulnerable to the pandemic [40] . WhatsApp groups among healthcare workers were also noted as having the potential of providing clinical decision making advice to health care workers and messaging on mental health support [13] .However, the reliability and validity of data sourced through social media remains a challenge [49] . Social media posts consists mostly of voluntary submissions from nonexperts and the applications lack gatekeeping features that identifies inaccurate information. Practioners across sub Saharan Africa and mobile application developers should consider developing mobile applications with security features that detect inaccurate information especially within the context of fake news. Recent studies also note more needs to be done to leverage digital platforms for telepsychiatry and online support for psychological support during times of crisis [49] . Telehealth applications to help patients to deal with the psychological impact of being diagnosed with COVID19 and the subsequent isolation and quarantine were missing from the review [50] . Clinicians and policy makers need to consider such applications for improved care.Thirdly, we established that telemedicine reduces patient contact and thus reduce the risks of infection through social contact. For people not infected with the COVID-19 virus, telehealth provides a convenient access to routine care without the risk of exposure in congested hospitals or in medical practice waiting rooms [30] . A recent study notes that application of teleconsultation for emergency medical dispatching would occur when suspicious symptoms are detected by an individual [51] The use of telehealth allows for national or international experts to give advice from a distance and support to local doctors and thus improving the quality of care. Although African governments face much budgetary constraints, the rate of telecommunications and ICT penetration in Africa is very high with countries like Tanzania. reaching up to 97% of the population having telephone access. This puts the continent at an immediate and sustainable advantage in terms of telemedicine. However, the implementation and overall uptake of telehealth interventions may, however, be challenged by considerable costs in setting up such systems, clinician's unwillingness to adopt telehealth, infrastructural constraints such as an unstable power supply or limited internet connectivity, and a lack of interoperability between digital systems [52] . The exercise will also require high level, strategic buy in from government leaders in order to be successful.Regarding the second question, the key lessons learnt for practitioners are that telehealth has to routinely be used and mainstreamed into the health system in a proactive manner for effective emergency responses and long term outcomes. Some of the strategies that sub Saharan countries can adopt to ensure that telehealth is used regularly, alongside conventional service delivery methods include flexible funding arrangements which adequately covers the cost of providing telehealth, training and accrediting of healthcare workers [50] , modifying protocols for telehealth and redesigning the existing models of care, supporting all stakeholders with an effective communication and change management strategy and establishing systems to manage telehealth services on a routine basis [34] .Whilst clinical practice in developed countries has rapidly incorporated telehealth into conventional health care practice, this cannot be said of sub-Saharan Africa health service delivery systems. Most telehealth applications in sub Saharan Africa are restricted to telephone support and monitoring, with very little evidence of the use of interventions such as, teleconferencing, video conferencing and other forms of telecommunication technologies. Several evidence gaps were identified which require further research to guide. Future research also needs to design and implement models for mobile position contact tracing. Researchers ought to formulate alternative research designs in the post COVID19 era such as using digital technologies as outbreak investigation platforms and not just as a tool for field data collection.The merits of our study are that the use of rapid review enabled us to synthesize available evidence in a timely fashion in order to inform research and practice [53] . Our findings are likely to provide health decision makers such as clinicians, patients and policy makers with timely access information to evidence related to the current COVID19 pandemic. This will bolster sector wide organisational learning in the health fraternity and this results in the incremental improvement of health service delivery. In addition, there is growing recognition of the value of synthesising qualitative research in order to facilitate effective and appropriate health care [54] . The rigor of rapid evidence syntheses was maintained through adhering to most of the general steps of a systematic review process [53] . We considered the collection of primary data as potentially harmful to the participants or to the researcher during the intra COVID period. The use of online tools and approaches such as a rapid review was more appropriate.Our study had a few limitations. First, this study depended on conducting a rapid review in compiling the findings. This approach is a less rigorous approach compared to systematic reviews. The streamlining of some aspects of a systematic review such as the number of search databases and restricting the extent of the synthesis by omitting line by line coding compromised the rigour of the study [53] . Secondly, this study considered qualitative studies and commentaries on the use of telehealth in sub Saharan Africa whose descriptive nature makes the synthesis of the data difficult. Statistical meta-analysis such as randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies that could have dealt with this problem were excluded from the synthesis. However, it should be noted that the limitations stated above do not invalidate the findings of this investigation yet open up areas for future research and areas of improvement by clinical decision makers.In conclusion, it can thus be noted that this study sought to understand the effectiveness of telehealth interventions in the diagnosis, patient tracing and care of COVID19 patients. Lessons and best practices were also drawn from the studies reviewed to guide clinical decision makers, researchers and policy makers' on how best to scale up the implementation of telehealth interventions in sub Saharan Africa. In order to answer the overarching questions guiding this study, a review of studies published in 2020 were done with inclusion of studies based on a laid down criteria. From the review we established that mobile app interventions are effective in providing information for referrals for potential patients infected by the COVID 19 and a convenient access to routine care without the risk of exposure. In countries such as Nigeria, mobile positioning data significantly improved decision making, capacity and scope of contact tracing and surveillance of known contacts of confirmed cases. We noted that collaborations between the government, mobile network operators and technology companies were utilised for successful mobile positioning data tracing interventions for COVID 19 patients. Mobile applications such as the Vula platform in South Africa were also noted as effective in providing psychological support to health care workers attending to patients.Hereunder are a few recommendations for the improvement of the diagnosis, contact tracing and care of COVID 19 patients in sub Saharan Africa:• Policy makers need to prioritise preparing and adopting standardized guidelines for telemonitoring of patients based on evidence and best practices to support appropriate regulatory oversight of telehealth interventions. • Clinical decision makers need to ensure that telehealth is mainstreamed into the health system, alongside conventional service delivery for effective emergency responses and long term outcomes. • Policymakers need to ensure that sustainable funding arrangements are available which adequately covers the cost of providing telehealth, training and accrediting of healthcare workers, modifying protocols for telehealth and redesigning the existing models of care. • An effective communication and change management strategy is required to inform all stakeholders on the protocols for implementing telehealth services on a routine basis • Practioners and mobile application developers should consider developing mobile applications with security features that detect inaccurate information especially within the context of fake news • Future research needs to design and implement context specific models for mobile position contact tracing. • Researchers ought to establish new research methods of conducting clinical research post COVID19 such as the use of digital technologies as an outbreak investigation platform and not just a tool for field data collection.Author contributions MM assessed the selected studies against and inclusion criterion and editing of the final version of the paper, and TM co-assessed the studies included in the paper and was a major contributor in writing the manuscript.

It was found to be caused by a member of the coronaviruses family and was termed coronavirus disease . Subsequently, the virus spread worldwide and was eventually declared a global pandemic. 1 In Egypt, the first case was reported in February 2020. Subsequently, the number of cases has been rising with a reported fatality rate of 4.8%. 2 Starting from mid-March 2020, Egypt imposed a lockdown closing all workplaces (including schools) that provided nonessential services, and all employees and students worked from home. 3 Most COVID-19 infections are mild to moderate respiratory illness that do not require special treatment. However, certain factors were associated with a poorer outcome such as old age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer. 4 It was observed globally that males suffered greater COVID-19 severity and mortality. Researchers proposed delayed viral RNA clearance in males, sex-related immune response differences and hormonal milieus differences contributed to this male preponderance. 5 The rapid spread of the virus globally and the uncertainty about treatment and disease outcome provoked feelings of fear, worry, anxiety, and concern especially among certain groups as older adults, health care professionals and people with chronic diseases. 3, 4 This pandemic also caused life-threatening situations, unemployment, reduced income, and separation from families or partners. 6 Females were reported to suffer greater psychological distress related to COVID-19. 7 The unprecedented pandemic morbidity, mortality, and lockdown measures are expected to affect mental health of the population with possible changes in sexual behaviors. 8 We hypothesized that women being more susceptible to psychological stress will suffer greater sexual stress. We aimed to study the possible effect of COVID-19 pandemic on sexual satisfaction of females compared to males in Egypt and to evaluate possible risk factors.The study protocol of this observational cross-sectional study was approved by the ethics committee of the faculty of medicine, Alexandria University and followed the International Ethical Guidelines for Epidemiological Studies. 9 The sample size was calculated using Epi info version 7.2.3.1(CDC; Atlanta, Georgia). 10 Based on a confidence level of 95%, power of 80%, proportion of sexual dissatisfaction 53.53% 11 ; the minimum required sample size was calculated to be 384 participants.Owing to the COVID-19erelated restrictions on face-to-face recruitment, data were collected online. At the end of March 2020, we started a Facebook page to communicate with our study participants and to enhance study recruitment. We also began an advertising campaign on Facebook. The invitation to participate in the study was displayed on the personal Facebook page of married men and women aged 16 to 75 years with an IP address in Egypt. The survey was administered online through Google Forms. The advertising campaign ended on 27th June 2020 at the end of the lockdown period in Egypt.The questionnaire included a participant information sheet, a consent form, and debrief sheet. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from participants. Sexual performance satisfaction was evaluated by asking if participants were satisfied with their sexual performance before lockdown and during lockdown.The Arabic validated version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was administered to the study participants. 12 The PHQ is a useful screening tool for depression and other mental disorders commonly encountered in primary care settings. The PHQ-9 comprises a 9-item depression module from the full PHQ with each of the 9 items scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). 13 It is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria allowing the measurement of the mood of the patient in the weeks prior to consultation. The validity, reliability and sensitivity of the PHQ-9 has been reported. 14 PHQ-9 is short, can be self-administered taking about 3 minutes to be complete 15 and can be quickly interpreted. 14 PHQ-9 scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 27. 13 The cut points used for the PHQ-9 were minimal or none ( 4); mild or minimal (5e9); moderate (10e14); moderately severe (15e19), and severe depression (20e27). 13 We used the Arabic version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire 12 to assess generalized anxiety scores for the participants during the lockdown period. GAD-7 is a selfreporting questionnaire that takes about 2 minutes to answer to assess the individual's anxiety state based on DSM-IV criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Each of the 7 items is rated on a 4-point Likert scale based on how frequently the symptom has been experienced. Item scores range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), with total scores ranging from 0 to 21. Scores on the GAD-7 were interpreted as follows: score 0e4: no anxiety; score 5e9: mild anxiety; score 10e14: moderate anxiety and score !15: severe anxiety. 16 The Arabic validated version of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) 17 was used to assess the sexual function in the female study participants. It is a self-administered 19-item questionnaire comprising 6 domains to assess sexual desire (questions 1 and 2), arousal (questions 3e6), lubrication (questions 7e10), orgasm (questions 11e13), satisfaction (questions 14e16), and pain (questions 17e19).Each domain is scored on a scale of either 0e5 or 1e5. The score of each domain is calculated through summing up the Sex Med 2021;9:100295 scores of the domain's questions and then multiplying by a factor of that particular domain. Multiplier factors are 0.6, 0.3,0.3,0.4,0.4, 0.4 used for domains 1e6 questions, respectively. The sexual function total score ranges from 2 to 36. 18 Regarding cutoff values, FSFI total score of 26.55 was found to be the optimal cutoff score for differentiating women with elevated risk of sexual dysfunction. The cutoff scores to determine the presence of difficulties in particular domains of the FSFI were as follows: less than 4.28 in the first domain, less than 5.08 in the second domain, less than 5.45 in the third domain, less than 5.05 in the fourth domain, less than 5.04 in the fifth domain, and less than 5.51 in the sixth domain. 19 The Arabic version of the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) was used to assess erectile function. It is a 5-item scale scored from 1 to 5 assessing maintenance ability, erection confidence, maintenance frequency, erection firmness, and intercourse satisfaction. Erectile dysfunction was classified into 5 categories based on the scores: severe (5e7), moderate (8e11), mild to moderate (12e16), mild (17e21), and no erectile dysfunction (22e25). 20We employed the Arabic validated version of the Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS) which comprises 25 items presented on a 7-grade scale. 21 ISS is used to assess different aspects of sexual satisfaction namely, satisfaction with sexual life, expression of sexual emotions towards partners, quality of the sexual partnership, and motivations for sexual intercourse. The final score of ISS are obtained through summing up item points and implementing a special ISS formula. The range of possible total score is from 0 (maximal satisfaction) to 100 points (minimal satisfaction). Higher scores indicate low quality of sexual life and stress in the sexual part of the marital relationship. Clinically significant sexual relationship dysfunctions are diagnosed at a cutoff point of 30. 22 Statistical Analysis of the Data Data were fed to the computer and analyzed using IBM SPSS software package version 20.0. (IBM; Armonk, NY). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify the normality of distribution of variables, Comparisons between the 2 periods for categorical variables were assessed using McNemar test, while Wilcoxon signed ranks test was assessed for comparison between 2 periods for abnormally distributed quantitative variables. Significance of the obtained results was judged at the 5% level.Possible mediation by sexual dysfunction on the association between anxiety/depression and sexual satisfaction was examined. The Preacher and Hayes method 23 was used to test the magnitude and significance of mediation.A total of 484 females and 289 males responded to the questionnaire; however, only 479 females (98.9%) and 217 (75%) males completed the questionnaires in the period between 30th March and 30th June 2020. Around half the males (52.1%) were 35e45 years of age, while just under half of the females (47.4%) were 25e35 years of age. The majority of males (90.3%) and females (95.6%) were residing in urban areas. In nearly one third (30.9%) of the males, marriage duration ranged from 1e5 years and 5e10 years in 35.9% of females. 22 males (10.1%) and 67 (14%) females were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive and quarantined. The majority of males (76.5%) and females (76%) had no associated chronic illnesses. Diabetes mellitus was the most common associated illness in males (9.7%), while females reported other disorders (19.4%). Other reported minor illnesses included allergic conjunctivitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, hay fever, hashimoto's thyroiditis, Helicobacter pylori infection, photosensitivity, discoid lupus erythematosus. Table 1 summarizes the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study subjects.The majority of males (91.2%) responded as satisfied with their sexual performance before COVID-19 lockdown versus only 70.5% responding as satisfied during the lockdown period. This difference was statistically significant (P < .001). About three fourths of females (73.5%) were sexually satisfied before lockdown decreasing to only 56.2% satisfied during the lockdown. This difference was statistically significant (P < .001).Before COVID-19 lockdown, a higher proportion of males (91.2%) were significantly more satisfied with their sexual performance than females (73.5%) (P < .001). During lockdown, 70.5% of males reported being satisfied with their sexual performance compared to 56.2% of females (P < .001).According to the reported PHQ-9 scores, depression was absent or minimal in 20.3% of the males whereas only 2.1% of the females scored as no depression on the PHQ-9 scale. The mean depression score in males (8.8 ± 5.1) was significantly lower than females (13.1 ± 5.3) (P < .001). (Table 2 ).Under half of the males (42.4%) and more than one third of the females (37.4%) scored as mild anxiety on the GAD-7 questionnaire. The mean anxiety GAD-7 score was significantly higher in females (10.3 ± 4.9) than males (7.1 ± 5) (P < .001) ( Table 2 ).The ISS questionnaire scores in females showed that most of the females (70.8%) suffered sexual relationship stress with only 9 of them (1.9%) showing severe stress. Most males (63.1%) on the other hand had no sexual stress and just over a third (35.5%) had stress. The mean ISS score was 28.8 ± 15.4 and 38.9 ± 13.4 in males and females, respectively (P < .001) ( Table 2) .More than half of the male subjects (68.2%) had no ED scores on the IIEF-5 questionnaire while 57 subjects (26.3%) had mild ED, 7 (3.2%) had moderate ED, and only 5 (2.3%) had mildmoderate ED. The mean IIEF-5 score was 21.9 ± 3.2.The majority of females (97.3%) had difficulties in domain 6/ pain, followed by domains 1/desire and 3/lubrication (81.6% and 81.2% respectively). About three fourths of the subjects (77.2%) had difficulties in domain 2/arousal, and more than half of the females had difficulties in domains 4/orgasm (68.5%), and 5/satisfaction (64.7%).The total FSFI scores ranged from 2.6-32. Scores showed that 343 of the females (71.6%) had FSFI scores <26.5. The mean FSFI score was 21.6 ± 7.1 ( Table 3) .IIEF-5 score was significantly negatively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ À0.381, P < .001), GAD-7 (r s ¼ À0.496, P < .001), ISS score (r s ¼ À0.680, P < .001) ( Table 4 ). Domain 1 of FSFI score (sexual desire) was significantly negatively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ À0.276, P < .001), GAD-7 (r s ¼ À0.228, P < .001), ISS score (r s ¼ À0.588, P < .001).Domain 2 of FSFI score (sexual arousal) was significantly negatively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ À0.323, P < .001), GAD-7 (r s ¼ À0.226, P < .001), ISS score (r s ¼ À0.661, P < .001).Domain 3 of FSFI score (lubrication) was significantly negatively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ À0.310, P < .001), GAD-7 (r s ¼ À0.263, P < .001), ISS score (r s ¼ À0.467, P < .001).Domain 4 of FSFI score (orgasm) was significantly negatively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ À0.285, P < .001), GAD-7 (r s ¼ À0.193, P < .001), ISS score (r s ¼ À0.575, P < .001).Domain 5 of FSFI score (satisfaction) was significantly negatively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ À0.322, P < .001), GAD-7 (r s ¼ À0.258, P < .001), ISS score (r s ¼ À0.699, P < .001).Domain 6 of FSFI score (pain) was significantly positively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ 0.175, P < .001), GAD-7 (r s ¼ 0.299, P < .001), ISS score (r s ¼ 0.392, P < .001). Domain 6 of FSFI score negatively correlated with satisfaction scores before (r s ¼ À0.153 , P ¼ .001) and during lockdown (r s ¼ À0.107, P ¼ .019). FSFI total score was significantly negatively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ À0.327, P < .001), GAD-7 (r s ¼ À0.217, P < .001), ISS score (r s ¼ À0.680, P < .001) ( Table 4 ).The PHQ-9 total score positively correlated with GAD-7 (r s ¼ 0.810, P ¼ <0.001) and (r s ¼ 0.608, P < .001) in males and females. ISS total score positively correlated with PHQ-9 (r s ¼ 0.477, P ¼ <0.001) and (r s ¼ 0.320, P < .001) in males and females, respectively. GAD-7 total score positively correlated with ISS total score (r s ¼ 0.477, P < .001) and (r s ¼ 0.244, <0.001) in males and females, respectively.The ISS total score was significantly related to subject's age (P ¼ .014), education level (P < .001), occupation (P ¼ .001, .003 for clerks and the unemployed respectively), sexual satisfaction before lockdown (P < .001), presence of depression on the PHQ-9 total score (P < .001), diagnosis of anxiety on the GAD-7 score (P < .001), and presence of ED on the IIEf-5 questionnaire (P < .001).No significant relation was shown between ISS total score and residence (P ¼ .407), monthly income (P ¼ .314), wife's age The ISS total score in the studied females was significantly related to female's age (P ¼ .001), residence in urban or rural areas (P ¼ .024), occupation (P ¼ .006, .002, 0.002 for clerks, unemployed females and housewives, respectively), husband's age (P < .001), marriage duration (P < .001), presence of chronic illnesses (P < .001), sexual satisfaction before lockdown (P < .001), PHQ-9 diagnosis of depression (P ¼ .006), presence of anxiety on GAD-7 score (P ¼ .043) and diagnosis female SD on the FSFI score (P < .001).The ISS total score was not related to education level (P ¼ .411), manual work (P ¼ .398), monthly income (P ¼ .359) or previous quarantine for being COVID-19 positive (P ¼ .924).Results of the linear regression analysis of factors affecting ISS score in males revealed that level of education as university graduates (odds ratio [OR]: 13.071, P ¼ .035), occupation as clerks (OR:0.020, P ¼ .003), GAD-7 presence of anxiety (OR:112.1, P < .001), and diagnosis of ED on IIEF-5 scale (OR:17.50, P < .001) were significantly associated sexual relationship stress and sexual satisfaction after controlling for other factors (Table 5 ).In females at the multivariate logistic regression analysis, we observed that being a housewife or unemployed (OR:15.515, P ¼ .041), husband's age more than 35 years (OR:3.395, P ¼ .010), marriage duration of 5À10 years (OR:3.672, Mediation analysis showed that sexual function was a significant mediator in the association between anxiety/depression and sexual stress (Figures 1 and 2) .The indirect effect of anxiety on sexual stress via male sexual function is positive and significant: 95%CI ¼ (0.4892, 1.1003). The majority of the pathway between anxiety and sexual stress is mediated by male sexual function (67.4%) ( Figure 1A) .The indirect effect of depression on sexual stress via male sexual function is positive and significant: 95%CI ¼ (0.3442, 0.9022). The pathway between depression and sexual stress is mediated by male sexual function (51.9%) ( Figure 1B) .The indirect effect of anxiety on sexual stress via female sexual function is positive and significant: 95%CI ¼ (0.0803, 0.3560). The pathway between anxiety and sexual stress is mediated by female sexual function (31.7%) (Figure 2A) .The indirect effect of depression on sexual stress via female sexual function is positive and significant: 95%CI ¼ (0.2381, 0.4914). The pathway between anxiety and sexual stress is mediated by female sexual function (47.9%) ( Figure 2B ).Following the rapid rise of the number of detected cases in mid-March 2020, our government decided to suspend schools and universities and impose a curfew from 7 PM until 6 AM, closing all shops and markets from 5 PM and a complete shutdown was imposed on Fridays and Saturdays. All means of public and private transportation were suspended during curfew hours. Flights into or out of Egypt were suspended as well. All sports were interrupted and many social activities banned in an attempt to control the spread of COVID-19. 24 The relatively high mortality in addition to the stressful lock down measures are expected to have an impact on the psychological and physical well-being of individuals.According to the World Health Organization's definition, sexual health is "".not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence"" 25 It is linked with a variety of predictors as mental stress, working hours, pregnancy, and so forth. Sexual satisfaction is a well-known indicator of sexual health and sexual well-being. 26 The effect of mass disasters on sexual function has always been controversial. The pandemic and its containment measures are suspected to lead to behavior anxiety, feelings of fear, and even panic resulting in the precipitation or exacerbation of adaptation disorders and depression. These will have their implications on sexual function and satisfaction. On the other hand, it can be advocated that the availability of more free time in lock down provides the opportunity of sharing more time with a love partner that could positively influence the quality of the sex life. 27 It is known that the differences between males and females in responding to stress may affect their sexual satisfaction differently. 28 The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt during the quarantine period on sexual satisfaction of females in Egypt in relation to males has not been previously studied. Out of the study respondents, more females completed the questionnaire compared to male respondents. As the study was carried out during a period of complete lock down, we believe that this reflects the cultural barriers males face to discuss sexual complaints in public even if for scientific purposes. It is usual that studies addressing sexual function conducted on Egyptian males encounter similar rejection to complete the questionnaires and refusal to openly discuss sexual complaints with the medical personnel. 29, 30 In conservative eastern countries, males with sexual dysfunction or a recognizable sexual problem are considered deficient by their partners and acquaintances. Male sexual function is perceived to be equivalent to masculinity and any declared dissatisfaction is believed to threaten this masculine genital pride and male dominance. 31 Most of the study participants were from urban areas. This again reflects the greater ease subjects have to declare intimate taboo issues in urban than in the more conserved rural society. The majority of the subjects were aged 25e45 years which reflects the expected age for peak sexual activity in eastern societies 32, 33 and hence the interest in participating in the study.About three fourths of females were sexually satisfied before lockdown. This is in agreement with previously reported figures of sexual satisfaction in Egyptian females. 34 We observed that more males responded as being satisfied with their sexual performance than females both and during COVID-19 lockdown. This disproportionate sexual satisfaction between Egyptian males and females is a cause of many sexual problems that might even lead to divorce in many instances. It is suggested that in most cases, this unmatched sexual satisfaction between males and females stems from the couples' ignorance as how to deal sexually with their partner that mainly stems from miscommunication. 35 Laumann et al 36 reported that higher rates of sexual satisfaction are reported in males than females globally. This might be explained by the cultural beliefs and gender differences regarding the importance of sex and sexual satisfaction. This might be even more evident in eastern societies with male dominance giving sexual satisfaction a greater importance in males.More males and females responded sexually satisfied before than during lockdown in this study. We suggest this might be related to the impact of the psychological consequences of the pandemic and the lockdown on sexual function and satisfaction. Just a year earlier to the pandemic, a nation-wide survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in 2018 on a random sample of 22,000 families across the country reported a prevalence of anxiety disorders in 43.7% and depression in 30.1% of the respondents. These figures were alarming and probably were amplified with the pandemic effects. 37 Greater depression and anxiety scores were reported in females than males. This is in agreement with Cocci et al 11 who reported greater depression and anxiety scores in females than males in Italy during the quarantine. This supports the fact that women are more susceptible to develop post-traumatic stress disorders than men. 38 The risk of emotional disturbances as depression or anxiety is believed to be as twice as common in females than males. 39 The total FSFI score revealed that majority of our female subjects were at risk of sexual dysfunction. Most of our females had coitus-related pain, decreased desire and lubrication, difficulties with arousal, orgasm and satisfaction. A previous cross-sectional study conducted before the pandemic reported lower prevalence of female sexual dysfunction risk among Egyptian females. 40 This increased prevalence might be related to the pandemic associated emotional disturbances. Evidence from literature has shown the negative effect of stressful events as natural disasters and wars on female sexual function. 41 Yuksel et al 41 showed that the FSFI total score of their Turkish female sample was lower compared to COVID-19 pre-pandemic total score. All the 6 domains except pain and arousal were significantly reduced in their Turkish sample. It is possible that the greater domains affected in our sample might reflect a sexual dysfunction risk not totally attributed to the pandemic quarantine as baseline prepandemic scores were not available making comparison with previous data not possible.Hamilton et al 42 similarly showed that exposure to chronic psychological stress is associated with lowered FSFI scores. Besides the psychological influences, hormonal disturbances accompanying stress as increased cortisol level that inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis may be responsible for the sexual dysfunction particularly the decreased arousal. Cocci et al 11 on the other hand reported increased desire in up to 40% of their respondents. However, they did not use validated questionnaires to assess desire, which might make comparison difficult.On the other hand, most of the males in our study reported no erectile dysfunction and no sexual relationship stress. The majority of females however were observed to suffer sexual relationship stress on the ISS score. This might reflect the higher depression and anxiety experienced by the females. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the magnitude of sexual dysfunction risk and sexual dissatisfaction in Egyptian females compared to males during COVID-19 pandemic.The positive correlation of depression, anxiety, and sexual relationship satisfaction scores among our subjects proposes that anxiety and depression are modifying factors that can influence sexual satisfaction. Carcedo et al 43 reported previously that higher sexual satisfaction was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety for young Spanish adults. The negative correlation domains 1 to 5 of the FSFI scale (sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm and satisfaction) and positive correlation of domain 6 (pain) of FSFI score with the depression, anxiety, and sexual relationship satisfaction scores emphasizes the interplay between the 6 domains of the female sexual function and sexual and psychological well-being of females.In the current study, sexual function of both genders correlated negatively with depression and anxiety scores and sexual stress emphasizing the importance of sexual function as an important domain of sexual relationship satisfaction. Mediation analysis in agreement showed that sexual function is a significant mediator in the pathway between anxiety/depression and sexual stress. This stresses the influence of emotional well-being to sexual function and thereby sexual satisfaction in both males and females. 44 Previous quarantine for being COVID-19 positive unexpectedly was not related to sexual stress in the current study. This however could be explained by the better knowledge of the disease secondary to contraction of infection and contact with health care professionals ameliorating anxiety and depression. This observation was also reported by Cocci et al. 11 We reported that ISS total score in males was significantly related to subject's age, education level, and occupation (clerks and manual workers). Sexual dissatisfaction by increasing age might be affected by other factors as comorbidities associated with increasing age. Results of the linear regression analysis in males revealed that level of education (university graduates) and occupation (clerks) were risk factors for sexual stress. Data from literature show an association of lower educational levels and male sexual dysfunction. 45 Occupation as clerks were associated with greater sexual stress as this category of workers were among the most affected by the lockdown and labour lay off during the lockdown. Manual workers and the unemployed were supported by a social security grant and thereby more secure economically alleviating some of the pandemic associated psychologic consequences. We report that anxiety and erectile dysfunction were predictors of sexual relationship stress in our cohort of Egyptian males after controlling for other factors Anxiety is independently associated with sexual stress. Male sexual dysfunction is also a predictive factor of sexual stress as sexual dysfunction will prevent males from having satisfying sexual relations. Research showed that there is a direct and meaningful relation between people's sexual performance and sexual satisfaction. 46 On the other hand, we observed that presence of sexual stress (ISS) in Egyptian females was significantly related to female's age. It has been previously suggested that sexual satisfaction possibly declines with age. 47 We also reported that residing in urban areas was associated with greater stress in the studied females as well as those working clerks, housewives, and being unemployed. These subgroups economically dependent on the male partner and are liable to be affected more by the partner's stress and enforced isolation and restriction of activities affecting their economic security.Husband's increasing age, marriage duration, and chronic illnesses were observed to be significantly related to sexual stress in our females. The relation of sexual relationship stress to presence of chronic illnesses might be explained by the effect of disease on sexual functioning either pathologically or psychologically or to male partner's negative attitude towards the diseased wife. However, linear regression analysis for females showed that being housewife or unemployed were risk factors for sexual relationship stress. This might be to the plenty of time not matched by husband work hours and the economic dependency on their partners. Unemployment and financial dependency were reported to be associated with increased sexual stress in different populations. 48, 49 We also observed that husband's age more than 35 years and a marriage duration of 5-10 years were predictive of sexual stress. It is likely that older men and those married for longer durations are not likely to seek improvement in their relationship. It is also likely that with the longer duration of marriage, the couples might get acclimatized to the condition, accept, and are less likely to seek help. It has been previously shown that sexual satisfaction in females can be associated with spouses' age, duration of marriage, and husband's age. 50 Data from 33 countries have reported that sexual satisfaction tends to decrease with longer duration of marriage. 51 Presence of anxiety and FSFI scores suggestive of FSD risk were also significant predictors of sexual relationship stress after controlling for other factors. This emphasizes the impact of anxiety in natural disasters on sexual function and satisfaction.This study tackled sexual function and relationship dissatisfaction which are prevalent, however, infrequently investigated issues among Arab countries generally and Egypt in particular. In Egypt, literature on the prevalence of sexual satisfaction among women is scanty. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the burden of anxiety, depression, and sexual satisfaction in women in particular in Egypt during COVID-19 pandemic. Conducting the study online allowed participants to declare culturally sensitive aspects confidentially in this study. Nevertheless, the results of the present study should be interpreted with recognition of its limitations. The study participants were recruited through Facebook, which may not be representative of the community. Certain groups of people might not be well represented on the Internet, such as elderly people, people from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and lower education. Furthermore, the sampling technique did not allow us to reach illiterate subjects. Facebook advertising however offered an efficient and unique access to hard-to-reach populations specially during the lockdown-imposed limitation on direct recruitment. This study relied on self-reporting of satisfaction before the lockdown which is liable to recall and desirability bias. We did not have FSFI or IIEF-5 scores prior to COVID-19 pandemic making comparisons with baseline values not possible. We recognize that unmarried, separated, or divorced subjects may be more at risk of sexual dysfunction. However, the study only included married subjects and excluded unmarried ones (because of cultural barriers) and those who were separated or divorced (because of the similar cultural barriers that prohibit single subjects who are supposedly sexually inactive to talk about sexuality).Our results indicate that sexual stress is an important public health concern, and emotional problems likely contribute to the experience of these problems. Long-term follow-up of the changes in sexual function and satisfaction after the pandemic is recommended to confirm the results and to evaluate changes over time. We are in need to increase the society's awareness of the importance of acknowledging such complaints so as to put an end to the stigma attached to them. Mental health of women in Egypt needs more attention especially in certain groups as housewives, the unemployed, and those with longer duration of marriage.Corresponding Author: Salma Samir Omar, MD, Faculty of Medicine, Elkhartoum square, Alexandria, Egypt.

These are, but not limited to, frequent handwashing with soap, movement restrictions, keeping physical distancing, avoiding mass gatherings, utilization of personal protective equipment's, alcohol-based sanitizers, case identification and contact tracing. 3 Following these, an extraordinary measure has been taken by the government of Ethiopia to prevent the entrance of the disease. Community mobilization, public awareness creation and education campaigns have been central to the government's effort. 4 Despite this effort, the country has detected and notified its first COVID-19 case on 13th March 2020, 5 reaching 112,740 cases and 1745 deaths as of December 6/2020. 6 Since then, the government further strengthened its prevention and control strategies to halt the spread of the disease in the country. Among the essential strategies implemented are declaration of a state of emergency on April 8/2020, which contains compulsory components on COVID-19 precaution measures, strict regimen of rigorous contact tracing, isolation, compulsory quarantine, and treatment, concreted media campaign, strict passenger screening, house to house screening, scaling up diagnostic tests and treatment centers and local resource mobilization.However, the success of such preventive and control measures is reliant on people's adherence to it, which is affected by their knowledge and attitudes towards the disease. Therefore, it is better to assess individual's knowledge, attitude and their practice on COVID-19, which enables to identify where the gap is and to take remedial actions, based on the identified gaps. Thus, to the best knowledge of the investigators, no published evidence assessed the knowledge, attitude and practices of urban residents through face-to-face interviews in the Amhara region, particularly in the study area. Previous studies conducted in the country have failed to assess the practices of COVID-19 preventive measures through an observational approach. Therefore, we assessed Dessie city resident's knowledge, attitude and their practice on COVID-19. The result is important for public health authorities to redirect their anti-corona efforts towards the identified gaps. It also serves as an evaluation study of the existing communitybased awareness creation campaigns.We conducted a facility-based cross-sectional study from May 17-21/2020.We conducted the study in Dessie city administration health facilities, which is found in the northeast part of the country. It is 401 kilometers far from the capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. The city is divided into 5 subcities with 18 urban and 8 rural kebeles. According to the 2007 Central Statistical Agency report, the city has an estimated total population of 273,305 in 2019/20, of which 49.5% are men. There are 8 health centers, 8 health posts, 2 government hospitals, 3 private hospitals, 38 private clinics, 55 private drug stores, 4 private diagnostic laboratories. Besides, there are two governmental COVID-19 testing laboratories in the city, namely the Amhara Public Health Institute Dessie Branch and Wollo University laboratory center.All Dessie city residents aged 18 years or more were the source populations. We included all individuals ≥18 years that come to the health facilities in the study period as study subjects. We excluded critically ill and health professionals from the study.We determined the sample size using a single population proportion formula, by considering the following assumptions: 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level, and a prevalence of 50%, considering that it is not known previously. After adding a 10% non-response rate, we got a final sample size of 424 individuals who come from the community. Study participants who visited the selected health facilities in the study period for any reason were taken consecutively until we attained the final sample size.We collected data through face-to-face interviews using pretested and a structured questionnaire (Supplementary Material 1). The questionnaire is first prepared in English language and then translated to Amharic version, which is the resident's mother tongue and the national working language. We developed the questionnaire from different works of literature and the World Health Organization resources. The questionnaire addressed information on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19. We assessed practice objectively using some observation items. We collected observational data after we prepared a handwashing facility for clients at the health facility entry site. We observed submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2021:14 participants' physical distancing and face mask utilization in their stay in the facility. Eight health professionals took part as a data collector.Before the actual data collection period, we conducted pretesting of the questionnaire on 22 individuals and we made necessary modification before applying to the study participants and we excluded those who pretested from the actual study. Training was given for data collectors to enable them to have a common understanding of the objectives of the study and each of the questions in the questionnaire. The principal investigator did daily supervision. Four supervisors supervised the data collection process. We validated the questionnaire, and Cronbach's alpha was estimated to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. We find the internal consistency estimate to be in the acceptable range.We entered data into EpiData manager version 4.2 and exported to SPSS 20 for data analysis. Before data analysis, we have done reverse scoring for negatively worded questions. We computed descriptive statistics to describe the data. We conducted logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice on COVID-19. We defined a statistically significant association at a P-value of less than 0.05. We entered a variable with a P-value of ≤0.2 in the bivariate analysis into the multivariate logistic analysis. Finally, we used a backward stepwise regression method. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval were computed to observe the strength of association between the dependent and independent variables.Eighteen questions were used to measure the participant's knowledge about COVID-19 and a score greater than the mean was considered sufficient. To compute the mean score, participants who answered ""Yes"" were considered as correct responses and we categorized those ""No"" and ""I do not know"" responses as incorrect responses.We measured attitude using 12 items, each graded as agree, disagree, and I do not know. Then, we dichotomize it into two categories. Finally, participants who positively reacted to at least seven questions were classified as having a favorable attitude. To calculate the mean score, participants who answered ""agree/yes"" were considered as correct responses while those who answered ""disagree/no"" and ""I do not know"" were taken as incorrect response.We asked twelve questions about COVID-19 preventive measures and participants who scored above the mean were taken as having adequate practice. All participants have heard about the pandemic and 96% of them correctly mentioned its name. Even though the participants have got information from different sources, the most cited ones were television (79%), radio (37%) and social media/facebook (31.6%).Regarding participant's knowledge about COVID-19 symptoms, 78.8% mentioned fever while 68.9% and 23.6% told us dry cough and shortness of breathing, respectively. The most commonly listed modes of transmission were direct contacts like handshaking (94.3%), respiratory droplets (52.1%) and indirect contacts to contaminated inanimate objects (33.3%). Airborne way of transmission is also mentioned by 37.7% of the participants. The most frequently mentioned preventive measures were frequent hand washing (89.6%), physical distancing (82.8%), avoiding handshaking (54.7%), staying at home (44.6%) and face mask utilization (42.7%).Eighty-seven percent of the participants mentioned that all age groups and both sexes are at risk of getting infected with the virus. Besides, the elderly (72.4%) and people with chronic diseases (60.6%) were specified as the most vulnerable groups to become severely ill or die. Concerning the activities following a single COVID-19 case detection, 97.6% mentioned isolation and treatment of the case, while 36.6% mentioned contact tracing and quarantining.Out of eighteen knowledge items, participants score ranges from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 18 knowledge scores, with a mean value of 13.96 ±2.6 SD. Half of the study participants have a knowledge score that lies in the 4th quartile, while 41% in the 3rd quartile (Table 2) .We assessed the participant's attitude using 12 questions. The mean attitude score was 10.8 (±1.8 SD), ranging from 2 up to 12 scores. Most participants (82.8%) score lie in the 4th quartile and 54% answered all the questions positively. Regarding specific attitude items, 91% agreed that the disease can infect African ethnic origins as well, while the remaining 5.7% believe that the disease cannot attack Ethiopians. In line with this, 12.3% of our participants also agreed on the issue that preventive measures are not important for Ethiopians. Besides, 22.2% of the participants agreed on the idea that cultural medications can prevent and/or cure coronavirus. Eighty-three percent of the participants advise their family members about coronavirus, and the same proportion of participants are ready to notify suspected COVID-19 cases to the nearby local authorities. Nine in ten participants (90.6%) have a firm commitment to purchase coronavirus prevention supplies, even at a high cost. The proportion of participants that agrees on the importance of handwashing, physical distancing, staying at home and avoiding mass gatherings in preventing coronavirus infection ranges from 94.6 to 97.6%. Eighty-four percent of the participants believe that coronavirus infection is preventable (Table 3) .The proportion of participants who are washing their hands after touching any other objects was 87%. Meanwhile, 86.6% of the participants reported that their frequency of handwashing has increased with a minimum of two folds as compared to the era of no coronavirus infection. We found the estimated frequency of handwashing to be at least six times per day for 79.2% of the participants. Besides, 85.8% of the study participants were using soap at each handwashing events. Regarding direct contacts like handshaking, 93.2% of the participants have avoided it, while 79% avoided visiting crowded places. On the other hand, 34.7% were implementing staying at home as a prevention method and 89.4% are applying physical distancing strategy. Thirty-four percent of the participants reported that they are using face mask when leaving their home, but we observed that only 21% of the participants were using a facemask at the time of the interview. Similarly, forty-seven percent of our participants mentioned as if they have sanitizers in their home, while only 20% of them have sanitizers at hand during the time of interview. We observed that only 66.3% of the participants washed their hands at the entry to the health facilities. Of those, 95.4% have used soap to wash their Of the twelve practice items, we found the mean practice score to be 6.3 with ± 1.8 SD and ranging from 2 up to 11 scores. Most participants' score falls in the 2nd (50.9%) and 3rd (38.9%) quartiles (Table 4 ).In the 1st regression model, participant's religion, their educational status, occupation, availability of television, telephone, radio, their age category and social media utilization were found to be the predictors of sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 at a P-value of ≤0.2. However, in multivariate analysis, only participant's educational status, availability of television, telephone and radio remains to be significant predictors of sufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Consequently, the odds of having sufficient knowledge are 6.5 times higher in participants with primary education as compared to participants without formal education (AOR: 6.5, 95% CI: 2.0-21.4). Likewise, participants who have a television in their house are 3.8 times more likely to have sufficient knowledge as compared to their counterparts (AOR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.4--10.5). We also find the availability of personal telephone to increase participants' knowledge with over three folds as compared to their counterparts (AOR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.3-9.1). Similarly, participants who have a radio in their house are 4.2 times more likely to have sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR: 4.2, 95% CI: 1.1-15.5) ( Table 5 ).In the 2nd regression model, participant's educational status, their age category, television, telephone and radio availabilities, social media utilization and their knowledge status were found to be the predictors of a favorable attitude towards COVID-19 in bivariate analysis (P≤ 0.2). However, only the participant's knowledge status remains significantly associated with a favorable attitude in the multivariate analysis model. Hence, participants who have sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 are 5.4 times more likely to have a favorable attitude towards COVID-19 prevention (AOR: 5.4, 95% CI: 1.7-17.2) ( Table 5 ).In the 3rd regression model, sex, religion, occupation, educational status, television, telephone, radio, social media utilization and knowledge status were the candidate variables (P-value ≤0.2) for multivariate regression. Thus, participants who have sufficient knowledge are nearly four times more likely to have adequate practice as compared to their counterparts (AOR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.04-13.7). Similarly, participants who have personal telephone are three times more likely to implement COVID-19 preventive measures as compared to their counterparts (AOR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.2-9.2). Conversely, farmer participants are seven times less likely to implement coronavirus prevention strategies as compared to an employed participants. Besides, housewife participants were 72% less likely to have adequate practice as compared to employed participants (AOR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.15-0.5). Students are also 68% less likely to have adequate practice as compared to employed participants (AOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14-0.7) ( Table 5 ).Good knowledge and positive attitude towards an intervention or a new practice by a target group are among the key determinants for adoption. This study was interested in ascertaining the knowledge, attitude and practice of Dessie city residents on COVID-19. Therefore, when the participant's knowledge was assessed, overwhelming majority (92.7%) showed having sufficient knowledge about COVID-19. This result shows that participant's knowledge on COVID-19 is far broader than any time previously. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] and shows that coronavirus risk communication and awareness creation campaign across the country have made a positive impact on the public knowledge of the disease. This finding is much higher than other studies in the northern part of the country those reported 42.9% and 60.7% knowledgeable participants. 12, 13 The variation might be explained by the difference in the characteristics of study participants, change in the study period, inadequate access to COVID-19 information and different knowledge measurement tools used by researchers. Though our study reveals a high level of knowledge among participants, the knowledge varies from one coronavirus transmission and prevention method to another. For instance, the most popular prevention methods known by participants are frequent hand washing and physical distancing, which accounted for 89.6% and 82.8%, respectively. This is comparable with the finding from Addis Ababa city where 85% and 83% mentioned hand washing and social distancing as a COVID-19 prevention measures, respectively. 7 Another online survey conducted in Ethiopia also documented a 90% prevention knowledge of maintaining social distance and frequent hand washing, which is in line with our finding. 14 Avoiding handshaking is the third most popular prevention method cited by participants (54.7%), followed by staying at home (44.6%). In the meantime, the most commonly known mode of transmissions is direct contacts (94.3%), respiratory droplets (52.1%), airborne (37.7%), and indirect contacts (33.3%), which is also comparable with a previous study done in Addis Ababa. 7 Furthermore, a good proportion of participants knew that being elderly (72.4%) and a concomitant chronic illness (60.6%) are among the poor prognostic factors. This result is higher than the finding from Kenya 15 where 64% and 26% of the participants identified the elderly and peoples with weak immune systems as the most high-risk groups to develop severe illness. But our finding is comparable with the 66.6% and 56.6% study finding from northern Ethiopia. 13 The study findings also revealed that television (79%), radio (37%) and social media (31.6%) are the major sources of COVID-19 information. A study from the southern part of the country 16 also revealed that TV/radio is the major source (80.3%) of COVID-19 information.A large majority of study participants (96%) have a favorable attitude towards COVID-19 prevention and control measures. This is because of vast broadcasting about COVID-19 through private and public media and good knowledge of the participants. The result is much higher than previous studies conducted in the country, 16 Uganda (72.4%) and Rivers state Nigeria (80.6%). 17, 18 Yet, 12.3% of the participants disagree on the importance of taking preventive measures, while another 22.2% has a trust in cultural medications to prevent and/or cure COVID-19. Interestingly, 83.7% of the study participants admitted that they could recommend the implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures to a friend; indicating their degree of willingness against the disease transmission. Furthermore, 84.2% of the participant's belief that COVID-19 is a preventable disease provided that appropriate preventive measures are implemented uniformly. Generally, this finding suggests a high level of public willingness to stand with the government in combating the disease and the public acceptability of preventive and control measures. Despite a high level of sufficient knowledge and favorable attitude towards COVID-19, this study found adequate practice only in 44.6% of the study participants; which shows inadequate practice in most participants to halt coronavirus transmission. Thus, the finding is lower when compared with previous studies carried out in the country 9 and abroad, 10, 19 where the overall good practice was 52.7%, 88.1% and 67%, respectively. 9,10, 19 We might relate the reason to more practice questions (twelve) used in the present study and an observation part to measure practice objectively. Still, our finding is comparable with other studies conducted in the country that reported low practices of participants towards COVID-19 prevention. 9, 14, 20 This implies that having adequate knowledge and favorable attitude will not always lead to the adoption of a new practice by a target group. These reminds the government to follow some compulsory regulations on COVID-19 preventive measures despite escalating public knowledge. Regarding specific practices, most participants are washing their hands with soap and water (87%), while 93.2% avoided handshaking, 79% stopped visiting crowded places, 89.4% maintain their physical distancing, and 34.7% staying at home. These specific practices seem high and adequate to prevent COIVD-19 as compared to our pooled practice prevalence which is 44.6%. Our findings are higher when compared with previous studies conducted in other parts of the country 8 that reported a specific practice of 77.3%, 53.8%, 33.2%, 33.6% and 1.6%, respectively. The difference is more likely because they conduct the previous study in the early phase of the pandemic, where most preventive and control measures are not intensified by the government.But even though our participant's specific practice seems satisfactory, we found a big discrepancy between our point in time practice observation and participants' self-report. For instance, the prevalence of handwashing is 87% as reported by participants, whereas the observed handwashing prevalence is 66.3%. Similarly, maintaining physical distancing and facemask utilization is selfreported to be 89.4 and 34.4%, respectively, but 72.2 and 21.2% as per our observation in the health facilities. Likewise, even though 47.6% of the study participants have sanitizers at home, only 20.3% of them were having it at hand. In our observation, we get a relatively low specific practice because of a point in time real data recording procedure or because of over-reporting by some participants on the counter.To determine the predictors of sufficient knowledge, favorable attitude and adequate practice, we run three independent logistic regressions and each produced a unique combination of risk factors. In the first model, the odd of having sufficient knowledge is 6.5 times higher in participants with primary education as compared to participants with no formal education (AOR: 6.5, 95% CI: 2-21.4). This finding is consistent with other studies conducted in southwest Ethiopia 21 and across the world. 19, 22 Similarly, the availability of television in the households resulted in a higher likelihood of having sufficient knowledge (AOR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.4-10.5), which is also supported by our descriptive finding, where 79% of the participants mentioned television as the primary source of COVID-19 information. Likewise, the likelihood of sufficient knowledge is three to four times higher in participants who have telephone and radio. They also documented similar findings in a study conducted in Kenya. 15 Nonetheless, this finding sounds more when we think of those rural residents that did not have formal education, television, radio and telephone and it implies the importance of choosing and designing appropriate communication media for each segment of the population.Participants with sufficient knowledge are five and nearly four times more likely to have a favorable attitude and adequate practices, respectively, as compared to their counterparts. This tells us escalating public knowledge of COVID-19 is the cornerstone and the precursor for effective control of the pandemic. The finding is also evidenced in other similar studies carried out in central Nigeria. 14 Also, even though not surprisingly, farmer participants are seven times less likely to exercise COVID-19 precaution measures as compared to employed participants. Likewise, students and housewives are also three times less likely to have adequate practice as compared to employed. We also find personal telephone utilization to increase the odds of implementing COVID-19 prevention precautions with over three folds. This is more likely explained because participants with telephone are more likely to use social media like Facebook and also receive short voice or text messages from the national telecom. Finally, our study has its own strength and weakness that has to be known to the readers. First, we have tried to incorporate observation part to measure practice besides participants' self-report. Second, this study has tried to avoid the possibility of social desirability bias by actively asking participants to mention the answer under each question rather than telling them the choices and recording their responses. Still, the possibility of false or over-reporting of preventive measures by some participants is not fully excluded from this study.In the study area, the participant's knowledge and attitude are sufficient to halt coronavirus transmission. However, practice in the vast majority is not adequate to combat the pandemic. Educational status, television, telephone, radio, occupation and knowledge are found to be significant factors for successful prevention and control of coronavirus. Despite escalating public knowledge, our finding suggests the government to follow some compulsory regulations to enable the uniform implementation of COVID-19 precaution measures. Furthermore, COVID-19 interventions should consider identified modifiable factors for successful prevention and control of the pandemic.APHI: Amhara Public Health Institute; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019.We have deposited all relevant data on public data repositoriesAlemu, Tefera (2020), ""Mr"", Mendeley Data, V1: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/xk5hg4d5bg.1.We got Ethical approval from Amhara Public Health Institute Ethical review committee (Protocol No: H/R/T/T/D/3/791) and a support letter from the research and technology transfer directorate of the institute to get the permission and cooperation of concerned bodies in Dessie city.

Notre expérience montre que l'enseignement virtuel, bien qu'il ne remplace pas l'engagement en personne, peut être un outil précieux à la fois pour compléter les activités de partenariat lorsque les déplacements ne sont pas possibles, et pour renforcer les partenariats mondiaux pour la santé à long terme. Cette approche peut également faire apprendre la transition d'autres formes de formation médicale vers l'espace virtuel.The Toronto Addis Ababa Academic Collaboration in Emergency Medicine (TAAAC-EM) was established 10 years ago as an educational partnership between the University of Toronto and Addis Ababa University [1] designed to support the development of a community of emergency medicine (EM) specialists in Ethiopia. Here we discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our global health partnership and the innovations that have allowed it to remain effective.Our partnership is built on a curriculum designed collaboratively by University of Toronto and Addis Ababa University faculty. While Addis Ababa University staff lead key parts of the curriculum, many teaching requirements are met by visiting University of Toronto staff and senior residents during 1-month teaching trips in Addis Ababa three times per year. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the first ever cancellations of teaching trips. We needed to quickly identify ways of engaging from a distance. Until now there had been no clear pathway identified in the literature for transitioning an in-person global health education partnership to a virtual space.The pandemic threatened the solidarity and trust we had built over a decade of collaboration. We were motivated to find strategies for synchronous sessions to maintain the interactive nature of our sessions and promote ongoing relationship building. This led to a rapid pivot to virtual education.Our five-step approach to transitioning to a virtual space was inspired by Deming's cycle of change model [2] and is outlined in Table 1 . This was based on a scoping consultation with Addis Ababa University EM colleagues. Each step was conducted through close collaboration between University of Toronto and Addis Ababa University EM physicians.There have been three continuing professional development sessions (in addition to the pilot sessions discussed in Table 1 ): one on point of care ultrasound and COVID-19, one on advocacy and hospital administration, and one on bioethics and its application to the pandemic. We also facilitated three wellness sessions for staff.Once invitations were extended across Ethiopia, attendees from three additional EM sites participated. Based on feedback from Addis Ababa University EM staff, residents will also be invited to most future continuing professional development and wellness sessions, following a grand rounds format.Postgraduate teaching began 2 weeks after the first pilot continuing professional development session, using a similar format followed by an evaluation. We have held 15 postgraduate teaching sessions. Synchronous attendance varied from 2 to 28 residents (out of a total of 30). The number of recording views ranged from 2 to 54 (median 12) per session. Of 27 responses to post-session evaluations, 56% reported at least 1 connection interruption, reinforcing the importance of access to both live and recorded sessions. Most responses (94% not including two missing responses) indicated that residents felt comfortable participating while being recorded. Instructors noted less interactivity than what would be expected in person due in part to limitations in internet connection (not being able to use the microphone or video reliably and relying on the chat function).The estimated cost of $10,000 per trip for two faculty members and one resident was avoided. We incurred a small new expense of $226 for a Zoom business account. Instructors were not compensated financially, and all other administrative costs were unchanged; existing internet access routes were utilized so no additional cost were required for internet connection. Funds not spent on teaching trips due to the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic will be used for future in person teaching and other initiatives.Global health partnerships can continue to grow despite the COVID-19 pandemic. TAAAC-EM's five step approach to transitioning to virtual education emphasizes iterative improvement to maintain consistency with the needs of staff and residents. This approach can inform the transition of other forms of medical education to the virtual space. Through virtual education we have reaffirmed our commitment to the TAAAC-EM partnership. We recognize, however, that virtual education is limited for hands-on learning and cannot fully replace in person teaching [3] . Our next steps are to explore options for procedure and simulation teaching. Once travel to Ethiopia for teaching is possible again, we will use what we have learned to incorporate virtual teaching where it is most effective, allowing us to maximize the value of teaching trips.In-person teaching trips have been central to the success of TAAAC-EM; the cancellation of the first teaching trips in our history due to the COVID-19 pandemic has inspired us to find new ways to support local training of EM physicians in Ethiopia. We offer our experience as a roadmap to other global health partnerships that have been similarly impacted by COVID-19. While not a replacement for inperson engagement, virtual education can be a valuable tool both to supplement partnership activities when travel is not possible, and to enhance global health partnerships long term.

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a highly pathogenic virus. 1 The virus has emerged in China, Wuhan state in December 2019. 2 Following the report from China to the world health organization (WHO), WHO declared the diseases as a public health emergency on January 30. 3 Since its emergence, it becomes a global concern causing 46 million mortality and 1.2 million deaths globally. 4 Developing countries are also suffering from the Covid-19 pandemics. In Ethiopia, the first case of Covid-19 is confirmed on 13 March 2020. After the confirmation of the first case, to mitigate the spread and to safeguard the population, Ethiopia declared a state emergency. In addition to many prohibitions, one of the actions taken by the government was banning the students from face-to-face education and discharging the university students to their home by the closing school. 5 Currently, according to world meter report in-country, there were a total of 121,880 mortality and 1,897 death caused by The virus is spread by small droplets discharged from cases during coughing, sneezing, and talking. It is also transmittable by contaminating the nose and mouth with contaminated hands contaminated surfaces containing the virus. The virus has an incubation period that may range from 2 to 14 days with the main clinical manifestations of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus has no curing antiviral treatment and applying the measures to reduce the transmission remains the mainstay of prevention. [7] [8] [9] Knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) are important in controlling the spread of the disease. Knowing the cause of the disease, signs/symptoms, and the possible methods of prevention can facilitate the proactive application of preventive measures. 10 Students are now being in return to their institutions to continue the banned education with serious application of preventive measures. These groups are at risk, and the existence of a single case can cause pandemics among students. And applying essential preventive measures to reduce such risk in this group is important. But there is a shortage of findings in Ethiopia that identified the KAP among students towards Covid-19. Therefore, this study is undertaken to determine the KAP of students towards Covid-19 in Mizan Tepi University, southern Ethiopia, 2020.The study was conducted in Mizan Tepi University. Mizan Tepi University, Mizan campus is a governmental higher institution located at 568.4 km from Addis Ababa in southern direction. The campus has a total of 2054 graduating students. This institutional-based quantitative cross-sectional study design was conducted from December 1-10/ 2020.All regular graduating class of the Mizan Tepi University, Mizan Campus.Sampled graduating students during the time of data collection were the study participants.All undergraduate students during the time of data collection were included in the study. Students who were severely ill and unwilling to participate in the study were excluded from the study.The sample size was determined by using a single population proportion formula. Based on the assumption of a 95% confidence interval, 5% margin of error, the proportion of knowledge, attitude and practice towards Covid-19 among students to be 50% and 10% non-response rate; a total sample of 422 was needed.First, 10 departments were randomly selected by the lottery method from a total of 24 departments. The proportional allocation was made to 10 departments based on their numbers to get 422 samples. Students list was obtained from their respective departments and a simple random method was used to select the study participants by lottery method.The questionnaire for this study purpose was developed and designed for local context after reviewing relevant studies which were used to assess the similar purpose. 11, 12 This structured questionnaire had four essential components related to participants' socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge-related questions, attitude related questions, and practice-related questions about Covid-19. One day orientation on data collection was given to five data collector lectures. Before actual data collection, pretesting was done on 21 students who did not participate in the study. Based on that, necessary corrections were made. Questionnaires were self-administered and all data collectors and supervisors strictly adhered to the WHO and Ethiopian ministry of health guidelines. Based on that, the data collectors have had gloved hand, worn mask, maintained social distancing, and used hand sanitizers between each questionnaire administration.Thirteen items were used to assess the knowledge of students about Covid-19. The items assess the knowledge regarding the etiology, transmission route, incubation period, susceptibility, clinical manifestations, and methods of prevention. All questions have one correct answer and participants' responses were scored by giving one point to correct answers and 0 for incorrect answers including the ""I don't know"" response. All responses were summed up and it has a possible value of 0 to 13. To classify the respondents as having good and poor knowledge, the mean knowledge score was computed and participants having greater or equal to mean knowledge score were considered as having good knowledge.Similarly, seven items were used to assess the attitude of the students. The item was having rating responses and for each item, 2 points were given if the response is positive, 1 for a neutral response, and 0 for negative responses. Based on that, the participants may have a possible value from 0 to 14. The mean attitude score was computed and participants who scored greater or equal to the mean were considered as having a positive attitude.Practice was measured by 8 items assessing the adherence to preventive measures like wearing mask, washing hands in regular manner with soap, water and disinfectants, practice of proper methods of coughing, limiting of presence in people gathered areas, maintaining social distancing, actions to be taken if contact with confirmed case, actions to be taken if cured cases wanted to contact and actions to be taken if they develop signs and symptoms of Covid-19. Participants' response was scored by giving 1 for possible response ""often or more"" and 0 for ""rarely or less"". Similarly 1 was given for questions requiring proactive measures to be taken and 0 for responses like ""I don't know what to do"". The mean of practice score was computed and participants practice status is dichotomized to good practice and poor practice. In such way that individuals were considered as having a good practice if they score greater or equal to the mean practice score.Data were entered into Epidata 3.1 version after a manual check for completeness, skip patterns, and wrong coding which was corrected in the study site. The entered data were exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Descriptive statistics using a table of frequency distribution were used to summarize the results such as socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, and practice. Then, the data were presented by using sentences, graphs, tables, frequencies, percentages. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the independent predictors of knowledge, attitude, and practice. Crude odds ratio (COR) was used to identify an association between factors and dependent variable at p < 0.25 in bivariate logistics, and to select candidate variables for multivariate logistic regression. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to describe the strength of association between the factors and dependent variables in multivariate logistics at p < 0.05.The study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, and a formal letter was obtained to conduct the study from nursing department, Mizan Tepi University. Confidentiality of the respondents was secured by excluding respondent identifiers like a name. Informed written consent was obtained from the respondents before conducting the study. All of the data collectors were strictly adhered to WHO and the ministry of health Ethiopia guidelines for Covid-19 prevention.Out of 422 participants, 402 were involved in the study and made a response rate of 95.3%. The mean age of the participants was 23.1 ± 1.7 years with a minimum of 19 years and a maximum of 30 years old, respectively. The majority (65.2%) of study participants were male, while 336 (83.6%) were single and 232 (57.7%) of the study subjects were from the rural origin. Two hundred eighty (69.7%) of the study subjects were from none health sciences college, almost half of participants mother or father has neither degree nor diploma educational award and 362 (90.0%) were none smokers ( Table 1) .All of the study subjects have heard about Covid-19. Two hundred thirty (57.2%) have gained information about Covid-19 from mass media, mainly radio or television and only 20 (5%) heard information from family ( Figure 1 ).Three hundred fifteen (78.4%) of the students mentioned the causes of Covid-19 as a virus, 306 (76.1%) stated respiratory droplet and close contact as the method of transmission, the majority (58.2%) identified the correct incubation period and only 153 (38.1%) knew that generally, people are susceptible for Covid-19.Two hundred fifty-seven (63.9%) of the study subjects mentioned fever and dry cough as the main clinical manifestation of the Covid-19, 171 (42.5%) considered that all persons infected with Covid-19 show clinical manifestation, while 244 (60.7%) responded that application of nonpharmacological methods are important for prevention and, and majority (74.4%) knew that wearing face masks can reduce transmission.One hundred seventy-three (43.0%) considered that eating garlic or onions cannot prevent the disease, 162 (40.3%) answered that taking antibiotics is optimal treatment for Covid-19, 205 (51.0%) responded that there is curing or protective vaccine and effective treatment of Covid-19, while 154 (38.3%) considered that global mortality rate from Covid-19 is below 5% and majority (71.4%) knew that Covid-19 can be transmitted by contaminating the eye, nose, or mouth from contaminated surfaces by Covid-19 (Table 2) . One hundred eighty-nine (47.0%) of the study subjects had scored the knowledge score above than the mean knowledge score (7.1) and had good knowledge about Covid-19 ( Figure 2 ).About half of the students agreed that they are worried for might getting Covid-19, 182 (45.3%) agree for preventive measures should be only applied by risk groups and older adults. Two hundred sixty eight (66.7%) agree for visiting the health facility when they develop symptoms, 275 (68.4%) agreed that limit of movement by individuals decreases the disease transmission, and 158 (39.3%) agreed that students living in the campus are vulnerable for Covid-19. Two hundred five (51.0%) agreed that the outbreak has impacted their study, and 184 (45.8%) had agreed that eating raw vegetables and wild animals do not impact the transmission (Table 3) . Overall 217 (54.0%) of the study participants had scored attitude score greater than the mean attitude score (7.4) and had a positive attitude towards Covid-19 prevention (Figure 3 ).Two hundred fifty-eight (64.2%) of the students committed to washing hands regularly, 224 (55.7%) practiced proper method of coughing, while 221 (55.0%) did not wear face mask, and 246 (61.4%) did not gather in areas where the mass of people presented. The majority (60.6%) did not maintain social distancing, 209 (52.0%) of the study subjects did not take proactive measure when contacting the active Covid-19 case, while 265 (65.9%) avoided meeting with cured Covid-19 patients and 206 (51.2%) answered to take proactive measures when developing signs and symptoms of Covid-19 (Table 4 ). Overall 230 (57.2%) of the respondents scored practice below the mean practice score (4.18) and were having a poor practice of Covid-19 prevention ( Figure 4 ).In bivariate analysis sex, being from health science, college or not, income status and parents educational status were significantly associated with students' knowledge at p < 0.25. Likewise, sex, college of the students, income, smoking, and parents' educational status were significantly associated with students' attitudes in a bivariate analysis at p <0.25. Smoking habit, the attitude of the students, knowledge, and residence were significantly associated with the practice towards Covid-19 prevention in a bivariate analysis at p < 0.25 (Table 5) .Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of knowing about Covid-19 health sciences college students were almost 3 times more compared to those none health sciences students (AOR= 2.983, 95% CI (1.869, 4.763)). Except for the students learning college, none of the other variables are associated with knowledge in this study during multiple logistics regression analysis.In this study, the odds of having a positive attitude towards Covid-19 prevention among health sciences students were almost 2 times more than none health sciences students (AOR= 1.86, 95% CI (1.169, 2.970)). Students having at least one parent who had a diploma or degree were almost 55% times less likely to have a positive attitude about Covid-19 prevention than students having both parents with diploma or degree education (AOR= 0.455, 95% CI (0.236,0.878)). Students having monthly income between 1000 and 1500 Ethiopian Birr were almost 60% times less likely to have positive attitude about Covid-19 prevention than students having more than 1500 Ethiopian Birr as monthly income ( Multiple logistics regression analysis showed that students who had positive attitude were almost 3 times more likely to have a good practice of Covid-19 prevention than students having negative attitudes (AOR=2.676, 95 CI (1.745, 4.105)). Students who had good knowledge were almost 2 times more likely to have a good practice of Covid-19 prevention than students having poor knowledge (AOR=1.893, 95 CI (1.232, 2.909)). Also the odds of having a good practice in Covid-19 prevention among students who stayed in rural areas were almost 2 times more likely compared to those stayed in urban area (AOR = 1.740, 95% CI (1.136,2.663)) ( Table 5 ).The study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice of the students towards Covid-19 in Mizan Tepi University. In this study, all of the students had heard about the Covid-19, with the majority (57.2%) gained information from mass media mainly radio and television. This finding was in line with studies done in India, where 99.6% of the study participants were heard about the Covid-19. 12 The study revealed that 78.4% of the study participants replied about the cause of Covid-19 was a virus. This finding is much lower than the study of China, in which 97.3% stated the cause as a virus. 11 The possible reason for this variation may be due to the variation of sample size where larger sample size was used in the china study. Another possible reason may be due to variation of enabling factors of awareness about the exact cause of DovePress the disease which may be influenced by the socio-economic and educational status. This is in fact that socioeconomic status can impact awareness. 13, 14 The finding is however much better than a study from Indonesia, which depicted that only 39% knew that virus causes the disease. 15 The study depicted that 76.1% have known the correct mode of transmission. This finding is almost in line with studies from Indonesia (78.99%) and Palestine (78.5%) of the undergraduate students knew the correct mode of the transmission. 15, 16 This finding is better than a study from India in which 68% knew the correct methods of transmission. 12 However, this finding from the current study is much lower than a study from china that 98.9% knew the correct methods of transmission. The study also showed that more than half (58.2%) of the students knew the correct incubation period of the disease. This finding is much lower than study from Palestine (95.8%) 16 and lowers than study from China (66.4%). 11 The possible suggestions for such variations may be due to variations of sample characteristics, in which the numbers of students from health sciences related field involved in the study from Palestine and China are more than this study.The study also pointed out that 63.9% of students knew the correct sign and symptoms of the disease by stating fever and dry cough. This finding is lower than studies from Indonesia (89.71%), 15 China (98.6%), 11 and India (86.7%). 17 The possible reason for the variations may be due to difference in sample size in comparing with Indonesia and China studies. But the variations compared with Indian study is that, only medical students were involved in India, while both medical and none medical involved in that of the current study. Knowing the sign and symptoms of the Covid-19 is very important for early quarantine to prevent the possible spread among the student community.The study showed that (47.0%) of the students had good knowledge about the Covid-19. This finding is better than studies done in Beret (41.4%) 16 and India (40%). 12 This difference could be due to difference in methods of categorizations to good and poor knowledge, in which the late Indian study used arbitrary cutoff 70% and that of the current study used the mean knowledge score as the cutoff value to dichotomize poor and good knowledge. However, the finding is much lower than a study from China (82.3%). 11 Having knowledge about a given disease very important in applying appropriate effective preventive measures. 17 When doing this, the spread of the disease can be easily tackled, but in this study the knowledge level of the students is low. In the present study college of the students is only the factor associated with the students' level of knowledge and the odds of knowing about Covid-19 among health sciences college students was almost 3 times more compared to those none health sciences students (AOR= 2.983, 95% CI (1.869, 4.763)). This finding is supported by a study from China, 11 in which the odds of good knowledge in medical students were more significant than none of the medical students. This is because medical students can get information about the disease from their education.The study revealed that 50.2% of students agreed that they are worried about being infected by the virus. This finding is inconsistent with the study from China. 11 The possible reason for such variation may be due to the gap in awareness of effective self-protective measures. This can influence the students' preventive behavior in preventing the disease. Two hundred seventy five (68.4%) of the study subjects agreed that the limit of the movement decreases the transmission. This is lower than the study done in India (100%). 12 Overall, 54% of the students have a positive attitude. This finding is lower than the study done in China (73.81%). 11 In this study, student's attitude about the Covid-19 was predicted by variables like being from health science college (AOR= 1.86, 95% CI (1.169, 2.970)), parent having at least diploma or degree (AOR= 0.455, 95% CI (0.236,0.878)), monthly income between 1000 and 1500 ETB (AOR= 0.403, 95% CI (0.189, 0.856)) and being female sex (AOR=0.628, 95% CI (0.405, 0.975)). This finding is supported by a study from Japan, where male sex is positively associated with attitude. 18 But it is opposed by a study from China. 11 None of the studies opposes or supports the rest of the predictors.In the present study, 64.2% washed hands in a regular manner. This is inconsistent with a study from India in which all of the students adhered to regular hand washing. 12 Regular hand washing is one of the effective WHO recommendations for tackling the virus spread. The study also identified that only 45% practiced regular wearing of the face mask. This finding is much lower than the Indian study (91%). 19 Overall, only 42.8% had good practice about Covid-19 prevention methods and taken proactive measures. This is not in line with a study from China (87.9%). 11 The possible suggestion for such variation may be due to the difference in tools used to assess the practice of the students. In this study, factors identified for the poor practice were knowledge, attitude, and residence. In the present study, good knowledge is positively associated with practicing Covid-19 prevention (AOR=1.893, 95 CI (1.232, 2.909)). This finding is supported by a study from China 11 in which students with higher grades showed to practice more. A positive attitude is positively associated with the prevention of Covid-19 in this study (AOR=2.676, 95 CI (1.745, 4.105)). Also being a rural residency is positively associated with the practice (AOR= 1.740, 95% CI (1.136, 2.663)). This contradicting with a study from Japan, where the odd of practices among students from the capital area are more likely than the counterpart. 18 This finding from the current study is suggesting that dissemination of information about Covid-19 has not brought the difference in implementation of prevention, as it is expected that living in rural is easy to access information about prevention than those living in rural.The knowledge, attitude, and practice towards Covid-19 among students were found to be low.

As of the 17 th August 2020, a total of 18118 cases (1177 active cases, 16540 recoveries and 401 deaths [2. 2%]) were declared. 4 This low case fatality rate (CFR) 05 months after declaration of the onset of the epidemic in Cameroon contrasts with an average CFR of 4% globally with in country CFR after the 100 th case ranging from 0% in countries like Bahrain to more than 20% in France 5 . This calls for an analysis of the disease pattern, distribution, and clinical characteristics in the African context. However, so far, most evidence on COVID-19 have been described in high-income settings. [6] [7] [8] [9] In Africa, the epidemiology of COVID-19 may differ from that reported in Europe, Asia, and America for a number of reasons. First, like most other African countries, Cameroon suffers from the double burden of infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria) and non-communicable diseases (e.g., sickle cell diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and renal diseases amongst others) 10 . In addition, confinement was not the hallmark of mitigation efforts in Cameroon. 11 For these reasons, we expected all these factors to contribute to an escalation of the transmission of COVID-19 in Cameroon. This study was aimed at providing a characterisation of epidemiological profile of cases and risk factors associated with COVID-19 infection at the Djoungolo Hospital thereby providing more knowledge of SARS-Cov-2 transmission in the Cameroonian context.Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a wide range of manifestations including olfactory and gustatory symptoms. Findings also imply that the COVID-19 infection is benign in most cases (up to 70%) and fatality varies from country to country, with Italy, Spain and France which experienced very high fatalities when compared with other countries like South Korea and China. Male gender, symptoms like dyspnoea and fatigue, and comorbidities such as diabetes and lung disease are risk factors for COVID-19 severity.The study suggest that HIV infection is also a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection in Cameroon. The findings imply that COVID-19 is benign for most cases in Cameroon with low lethality. These findings call for enforcement of public health measures on prevention of COVID-19 in elderly patients with co-morbidities.Ethical oversight: Ethical clearance (Number 2020/09/1294/CE/CNERSH/SP) was sought from the National Ethical Committee of Research for Human Health in Cameroon. Administrative authorisations were also obtained from all authorities concerned.Study setting and design: Cameroon, located at the heart of Central Africa, is a country with a population essentially made up of blacks and a younger population when compared to that of many Western countries 12 with only 2.7% of people aged more than 65 years. 13 The environment is also distinct with high temperatures and meteorological variabilities. 14 Moreover, the sociocultural context is unique with strong beliefs in traditional medicine. 15 Cameroon adopted public health measures which evolved with the trends of the pandemic. On the 17th March 2020, social regulations were enforced in Cameroon: closure of borders, confinement at home from 6PM, and regulations on transportation means (passengers 1m apart). 11 Towards 13 th April 2020, it became compulsory to wear a facial mask. 16 Specialized COVID-19 treatment centres and laboratories were identified for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in Cameroon. The Djoungolo Hospital, located in Yaounde, the Centre Region, was one of the six COVID-19 treatment centres dedicated officially for the management of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 by the Ministry of Public Health and was supported by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). We used a prospective cohort study design to follow patients admitted at the Djoungolo Treatment Centre for COVID-19 infection from the 01 st April 2020 to the 31 st July 2020. At the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients were discharged from the hospital based on availability of a negative PCR results after 14 days of hospital admission.We included patients admitted at the Djoungolo Treatment Centre for suspicion of COVID-19 and with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR according to national protocols proposed by the Ministry of Public Health. The standard WHO case definition of COVID-19 was used as a checklist for admission 17 . Suspected cases who ultimately had no laboratory confirmation and non-cases were excluded. The study population was organised into age groups as follows: 0 to 17, 18 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69 and more than 70 years. Patients were categorised by disease severity as mild (i.e. symptomatic without clinical signs of pneumonia pneumonia), moderate (with clinical signs of pneumonia without respiratory distress) and severe cases (clinical signs of pneumonia and respiratory distress not requiring invasive ventilation) 17 . Patients who required invasive ventilation were considered critical and had to be referred to specialised centres when possible. We considered mild and moderate severity levels as benign forms of COVID-19. Patients with more than 80% missing variables were automatically excluded from the analysis.Data collection: Socio-demographic and clinical events were recorded on a case-report form (CRF) designed exclusively for all suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients admitted in Djoungolo Hospital. This CRF was conceived using the forms proposed by the MOH, the WHO and MSF/Epicentre. Sociodemographic variables collected included gender, age, religion, profession, residence, risk of exposure (i.e., recent travel, exposure to health facility, exposure to a traditional healer, and any other form of attendance to a gathering), and contact tracing (i.e., contacts traced and tested with corresponding dates). Clinical events were recorded including symptoms and date of onset, comorbidities, patient itinerary (from onset of symptoms to discharge), complications, diagnostic procedure, test results, and treatment provided.Data management and analysis: Continuous variables were expressed as medians and simple ranges, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarised as counts and percentages. Chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables. Epidemic curves were constructed with admission dates at the treatment centre. An onset-to-admission curve was constructed by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of COVID-19 disease and disease severity. To predict risk of disease severity, the glmulti package was used in R for automated model selection and multimodel inference 18 . The fit and plausibility of various models 18 were examined in RStudio, focusing on models which contained none, one, and up to seven (i.e., all) of moderator variables for risk of severity. We used two groups of moderator variables. Group 1 included age groups, gender, comorbidities (i.e., HIV infection, diabetes, lung disease and hypertension). Group 2 included age group, gender and symptoms (i.e., dyspnea, cough, chest pain). We considered models with main effects only. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) 19 was used to choose the most performant model. The Akaike weight for a particular model can be regarded as the probability that the model is the best model (in a Kullback-Leibler sense of minimizing the loss of information when approximating full reality by a fitted model) out of all of the models considered. 19 In other words, the best model was considered to have the lowest AIC with Akaike weights and Kullback-Leibler divergence indicating the highest probability of model accuracy. Data analysis was performed with STATA version 13 and RStudio Version 1.3.1073 for modelling.Time to hospitalisation: the time interval between the onset of the first symptom and the date of admission.Length of hospital stay: time interval between the admission date and the date the patient is discharged or dies.Mass gathering: travel and exposures such as a visit to a church or a mosque, a hospital, a market or Laboratory confirmation: confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR assays is performed in Yaounde by several laboratories in accordance with the protocol established by the WHO 17 .Patient and public involvement: Not considered.Most patients presented with a cough (61%; N=145), fever (53%; N=125), dyspnoea (52%; N=122), fatigue (52%; N=122), and headaches (50%; N=118). Other common symptoms were dysgusia (46%; N=111), arthralgia or myalgia (43%; N=100), and hyposmia/anosmia (39%; N=89). Nasal discharge (4%; N=9) and sore throat (7%; N=17) were the least common symptoms (Figure 4 ).Most patients had benign disease (77%; N=204), some patients had severe disease (15%; N=40) and required a supplemental oxygen supply, and a few patients were critical and required a transfer to specialised centres (7%; N=18). However, it is worth mentioning that only 30% of critical patients who required a transfer were finally transferred as a result of overcrowding in sophisticated COVID-19 treatment centres with intensive care units. Four confirmed cases died, yielding a CFR of 1%. Twenty-nine percent (N=187) had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (20%; N=48), other cardiovascular diseases (8%; N=18), diabetes (6%: N=13), and HIV infection (3%; N=7) ( Figure 3 ). Three out of the 04 patients (75%) who died had hypertension; one patient had both hypertension and diabetes. The deceased cases were aged 53, 66, 68, and 73 yearsThe average length of hospitalisation was 15 days (10-26 days). Length of stay was lowest for male children aged 11 months to 17 years and highest for male patients aged more than 70 years ( Figure 5 ). Time to hospitalisation ranged from 0 to 40 days for some patients, but the majority of patients were admitted 07 to 13 days after symptom onset ( Figure 6 ).All patients received a treatment protocol with oral chloroquine, paracetamol, vitamin C, zinc, amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid, and azithromycin. Depending on severity and comorbidities, some patients received anticoagulants, corticosteroids or intravenous antibiotics. Fifteen percent of confirmed cases underwent non-invasive ventilation (N= 40).We compared groups of confirmed (82%; N=259) cases and non-cases (18%; N= 54). Participation at a mass gathering significantly increased the odds of being diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR=5.47; P=0.03: CI=1. 15-25.88 ). Being aged 30 to 39 (OR= 0.03; P=0.03; CI= 0.01-0.76), a prisoner (OR=0.03; P=0.01; CI=0.01-0.34), retired (OR= 0.03; P=0.01; CI=0.01-0.42), or a student (OR=0.06; P=0.01; CI= 0.01-0.79) were significantly protective factors against COVID-19 in our settings. There was no significant relationship between age (>50 years), male gender, or travel history and a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (Table 1) .The most important variables for prediction of risk of COVID19 severity were: diabetes, lung disease, HIV infection, male gender, and age groups 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and 60-to 69. In our settings, age groups 60 to 69, 50 to 59, 40 to, male gender, diabetes, HIV infection and lung disease were significant predictors of COVID-19 severity (Table 2) . Dyspnoea and fatigue are warning signs of COVID-19 severity (Table 3) . 20 These authors indicated that 19% of patients hospitalised in these countries required non-invasive ventilation, which is quite close to the value found in our setting. 20 The CFR was relatively low at the Djoungolo Treatment Centre (1%) and this can be partially explained by standard operating procedures for management at Djoungolo Hospital which required transfer of critical cases to more sophisticated treatment centres. However, due to overcrowding in sophisticated centres, some critical patients were managed at the Djoungolo Hospital and this accounts for the fatalities reported. Nonetheless, the CFR obtained in this study was similar to the Cameroonian National CFR estimated at 2% as of the 07 th October 2020 4 . Our CFR was also similar to the average CFR reported in South Korea and Germany, while countries like France and Belgium had relatively high CFR (20 and 16% respectively). 5 Grant et al found a CFR of 7% in their meta-analysis. 20 This variability could be due to the difference of age of confirmed cases. As seen in our study, more than 55% of patients in our study were aged less than 50 and the mean age was 44 years as compared to 49 years as reported by Grant et al. 20 Clinical features of COVID-19 infection in our setting were slightly different from those reported by studies in high-income countries. 20 In the same line with Grant et al, gastrointestinal manifestations, sore throat, and nasal discharge were also less common in the current study. In our study, ophthalmic manifestations were not prevalent. Differences in population characteristics (i.e., age, race, genetic make-up or immunity) and even settings (climate and environment) might explain the differences noticed in the findings.In our study, 29% of patients suffered from a comorbidity, while Morgan et al had twice more patients who had at least 01 comorbidity (40%) in a meta-analysis of COVID-19 and comorbidities. Morgan et al synthesized evidence from Western countries including China, South Korea, Australia, and the USA, which have relatively older populations 23 . This difference in ages might explain the higher prevalence of cases with comorbidities in their settings. They also found the commonest comorbidity to be hypertension and the majority of fatal cases had at least 01 comorbidity (74%), in agreement with our findings. They equally observed that diabetes and respiratory illnesses were prevalent in the deceased 23 , which is not the case in the current study where hypertension was identified as common in the deceased.The median length of hospital stay was 15 (10 to 27 days) in this study. In a systematic review of length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients, Rees et al observed that length of hospital stay was generally higher for patients followed up in China. The median range of length of hospital stay ranged from 4 to 53 days in China and 4 to 21 days elsewhere (i.e., Europe, USA and UK). 24 Most studies included by Rees et al were conducted in China (88%) and specifically in Wuhan. Lengthy hospital stays reported by Rees et al can be explained by inclusion of studies analysing critically ill and old patients (average 68-69 years). In our context, long hospital stays were equally observed in patients aged more than 70 years. The speed at which the last negative test for SARS-CoV2 was obtained also explains lengthy stays in our study. With the reduced testing capacity at the beginning of the epidemic in Cameroon, it was a real challenge to obtain PCR results after 14 days. Additionally, length of hospitalization can vary by the culture of clinical practice, as well as by disease severity and logistical constraints, thus complicating comparisons among international settings.Unexpectedly, being aged 30 to 39, being a prisoner, retired, or a student were protective against COVID-19 infection in this study. These findings may be explained by the public health measures implemented a few days after the declaration of the COVID-19 epidemic in Cameroon required closures of schools 11 , which might have been protective for students. Moreover, public health measures to fight COVID-19 epidemic in Cameroon also concerned prisoners and included reduced movement among prisons, reinforcement of hygiene measures, and special authorisation of release for some prisoners 11 . These policies might have impacted the circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in prisons. In addition, retired individuals tend to move less than workers 25 and this might have reduced their exposure to the COVID-19 infection.This study adds to the knowledge gap on COVID-19 in African settings. Despite its original content, our study has limitations inherent to the observational design. Only 50 suspected cases had no evidence of infection with SARS-CoV2, which might have impacted the multivariable analysis of risk of COVID-19 infection. The study was conducted at a single centre, thus generalisability of findings nationwide might not be accurate. Additionally, conducting rigorous research in a context of a novel pandemic was challenging and missing data was common. For instance, incubation periods were not calculated as only 07% had required data. Moreover, in our setting, laboratory and radiological diagnostics could not be systematically performed for patients. Some critical cases were referred to more sophisticated centres as required and this might in part explain the low CFR obtained at the Djoungolo Hospital.","Cameroon","abstract","2021-02-23",2

The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 includes coughing, sneezing, febrile to touch, headache, and difficulty of breathing, within 2-14 days of incubation period. 4, 5 WHO recommended COVID-19 prevention measures such as hand washing, wearing a face mask, keeping distance, make the room ventilated, avoid going to a crowded area, and covering nose and mouth during coughing or sneezing, avoiding close contact with animals and suspected area with coronavirus infections, and avoiding the consumption and handling of raw meat to prevent cross-contamination. 6, 7 Many countries have planned to decrease or prevent the spread of the virus. The plan aimed to reduce and end the transmission, avert outbreaks and give optimized care for every infected person, also critical sick; ease the impact of COVID-19 on the health care system, social services, and financial activities. 8 An international experts and African governments have articulated their concern regarding the transmission of COVID-19 and predicted that over 2 million deaths might happen in sub-Saharan Africa if action is not implemented. 9 Ethiopia, the second populated country in Africa, reinforced COVID-19 prevention and methods with the support of WHO and other partners. The country's health authorities are focusing on surveillance, diagnosis, infection prevention, and control, epidemic response coordination, and community health education to swiftly identify cases and minimize the spread of the disease. The World Health Organization considered Ethiopia as the highest priority, along with 13 African countries for COVID-19 preparedness because of its continued flight to China. 10 Experts believed the pandemic can affect seriously African countries because of the weak health care system, crowded situations, poor sanitation in the cities, and the random movement of people can make the outbreak out of control. 11, 12 The restriction of travel because of COVID-19 also significantly influenced the economy and interrupt the efforts towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in SSA, including Ethiopia that depends on foreign aid. 13 In Ethiopia, with the poor public health systems, deprived public health sectors, and an insufficient number of specialized hospitals, there is little capacity for tracing, testing, confirmation, isolation, and treatment of those infected. By taking experience from previously affected countries, the preparedness, and the current Intensive Care Unit hospitalization capacities in Africa pales compared to the oncoming infections. 14 The World Health Organization identified community transmission in several African countries, including Ethiopia, March 2020, and the rate of spread of the virus is rising for lack of practicing and implementing the principle of social distance, unable to frequent hand washing, unable to stay at home, and the pandemic itself its different symptom of COVID-19 across individual and unclear and contradicting (eg WHO) information about the case among countries and scientist and other factors make pandemic the challenge of controlling and preventing. 15 Ethiopia similar to other developed countries had its own emergency practice project guideline intended for COVID-19-virus. The aim of developing the guideline is to strengthen the government's capacity to prepare and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. 16 Nowadays, no any recommended treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. Studies are limited to this issue in the current study area. Hence, this study aimed to determine the practice of COVID-19 preventive measures and associated factors among Dire Dawa City residents.We conducted this study from Jun 15th to July 15th, 2020, in Dire Dawa City, found 515 km away from Addis Ababa to the East. The total number of population in the city is estimated to be 408,096 (according to the UN population estimates of major urban agglomerations in 2020). The city has nine Kebeles (administrative districts).A cross-sectional community-based research design comprising both quantitative and qualitative approach was employed. The population of the study was all permanent residents of the city.For qualitative: Participants of the study were volunteer groups, police officers, health bureau officials, and other stakeholders. To calculate sample size, 50% of the proportion of practice of COVID-19 prevention measure, 95% confidence interval, 0.04 margin of error, and a 10% non-response rate were used. The sample was determined to be 660. Of the nine kebeles (administrative districts) of the city, five kebeles were selected using a simple random sampling method, and then 660 participants, using the sampling frame of households with house representatives, were selected by systematic random sampling technique.For qualitative data, 16 key informant interviewees were used based on the saturation of data, and the interviewees were purposively selected. They were volunteers working on awareness creation activities, police officers, and health bureau officials"".Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. We developed the questionnaire based on the literature. It comprises different sections such as sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral characteristics, knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention measures. [17] [18] [19] The questionnaire was prepared in English and then translated to Amharic (the working language of the country), and back to English to check the language consistency of the tool. Eight trained nurses were collected the data, and four trained supervisors supervised the data collection process. The respondents filed the questionnaire in a face-toface manner: the nurse read each item for the respondents and put their responses accordingly. For the qualitative data, a semi-structured interview guide was used. The researchers themselves conducted the interviews and were tape-recorded.The data quality was assured by pre-testing the data collection tool on 5% (33 respondents) of the sample size in Kebele 03 before the actual data collection, and we incorporated the correction into the tool. The supervisors and investigators checked the collected data for completeness every day. Then, necessary feedback was offered to the data collectors every morning.The dependent variable is the practice of COVID-19 prevention (Good/poor). The independent variables included (1) sociodemographic factors: age, sex, monthly household income, marital status, occupation, educational status, family size; (2) personal and behavioral factors: alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, khat chewing, history of chronic disease, and (3) knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19.Six questions assessed the practice of COVID-19 prevention measure and each scored 0 and 1 (0 = No, 1 = Yes). Then, those who scored less than the mean points of six questions were measured as they have a poor practice of COVID-19 prevention measure, and those who scored a mean point and above were considered as they have a good practice.There were about 9 (nine) attitude questions, and each question scored 0 and 1 (0 = No, 1 = Yes). We took those participants who answered less than mean points out of nine questions as have an unfavorable attitude whereas those who answered a mean point and above the mean point as having a favorable attitude.Also, there were 12 (twelve) knowledge measuring questions, in which each question scored 0 and 1 (0 = No, 1 = Yes). We considered those study participants who scored below the mean value out of twelve questions as they have poor knowledge and those who scored a mean and above the mean value as they have good knowledge.Data were checked for consistency and entered Epi Data version 3.1 and then exported to the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics like frequency, proportion, mean, and standard deviation computed to describe study variables about the population. Both bivariate and multivariate were used to determine the effect of independent variables on the outcome variables. Variables found to have a P-value <0.25 in the bivariate logistic regression entered/exported into multivariate analysis to identify the predictor variables. Hosmer and Lemeshow's goodness-of-fit test was used to assess whether they fulfilled the assumptions. Finally, the adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI at P-value <0.05 was considered a statistically significant association with the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures. The qualitative data collected was transcribed, reduced, coded, thematized, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis.Ethical clearance was obtained from the Dire Dawa University research ethics review committee. Then, Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2021:14 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress a support letter with this was offered to Dire Dawa administration Health Bureau, and we got permission from each Kebele's administrative. Participation of all respondents was voluntary, and we ensured informed written consent before engaging in the study. We took measures to assure the respect, norms, values, beliefs, culture, and freedom of each individual participating in the study. Information on the purpose and procedures of the study was explained; confidentiality was maintained by omitting their identifications such as names and assured a great deal of care and the information obtained is anonymized to all study participants. This study was conducted by the Declaration of Helsinki.Six hundred forty-four participants were involved, making the response rate of 97.6%. The mean age of the respondents was 30 (SD= 9.2) years. The majority, 303 (47%) and 312 (48.4%) of the participants were 20-30 years old age and Orthodox followers by religion, respectively. Three-hundred (46.6%) of the respondents were attending secondary education, and two-fifth (40%) was a governmental employee (Table 1) .The majority of 515 (80%) the residents had a current history of alcohol drinking without holiday, and 103 (16%) were chewing khat. Only 48 (7.5%), and 80 (12.4%) of the participants were smoked cigarettes, and had a history of chronic disease, respectively.Of the total, 455 (70.7%) (95% CI: 66.3-73.6) of the residents have good knowledge about prevention methods and clinical symptoms of COVID-19. The majority, 620 (96.3%) of the respondents said that currently no effective treatment to cure COVID-19. The majority, 519 (80.6%) and 585 (90.8%) of the respondents were stated as eating or contacting with wild animals are the main source of infection to COVID-19, and respiratory droplets are the main source of COVID-19 transmission, respectively. Most, 619 (96.1%) of the participants believed that the isolation and treatment of an infected person in the place can reduce the spread of the virus (Figure 1 ).Among the total respondents, 387 (60.1%), (95% CI: 56.-2-63.8) of them had a positive attitude about COVID-e majority, 633 (98.3%) and 630 (97.8%) of the study subjects replied that COVID-19 disease is dangerous and stays at home/avoids going to crowded places to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, respectively ( Table 2 ).Out of the total respondents, 262 (40.7%), (95% CI: 37-44.4) of the residents had a good practice on prevention methods of COVID-19. Nearly one-third (32.7%), and 29.7% of the respondents were cover their mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing, and keeping their social distance, respectively ( Figure 2 ). 14)] times more likely to practice COVID-19 prevention as compared to those who had an unfavorable attitude (Table 3) .Sixteen in-depth interviews were done among selected key informants. We merged the result into four thematic areas.Those are COVID-19 prevention activities in the administration, perception towards COVID-19, COVID-19 prevention practices in Dire Dawa Administration, and measures taken to improve the realization of COVID-19 prevention.As of interview participants' reflection on general knowledge regarding COVID-19 prevention measures, there is no consistency in the prevention activities. However, according to some administration health bureau participants mentioned some activities considered as good practices and exemplary achievements in the efforts towards preventing the pandemic. For instance, we have observed financial institutions in the administration implementing prevention measures seriously and consistently (e.g. providing water and soap and forcing customers to wash their hands before entering, making wearing a face-mask mandatory).Regarding attitude towards COVID-19, the interviewees have expressed they do not believe that the administration is not seriously working on the pandemic. They justified that in the early stage of the pandemic, the administration was actively working on it as a campaign. However, as times go, the activities towards prevention and awareness creation have become loose and disorganized.It seems the community has an awareness of the pandemic, but they are not practicing the prevention mechanisms. The interviewees unanimously agreed that the prevalence of the pandemic increasing day to day. An interviewee has said:As to me, the people are undermining COVID-19, believing that they are safe and will not be infected. This might be because significant death cases are not reported as high Some people try to abuse them thinking that government and health professionals over-emphasize the pandemic.Here are some to mention. ""When people see me in face-mask, they think as if I am discriminating them, thus they feel doubtful about me.One more participant has added that ""when you tell somebody to wear a face-mask, for instance, he/she doesn't accept"".Dire Dawa administration has been taking different measures to tackle the spread of the pandemic among these; the lockdown of public gathering, lockdown of school and market place and awareness creation for the surrounding community particularly on frequent hand washing, physical distancing, and staying at home if it is possible, and different humanitarian activities, have been undertaking to address a vulnerable segment of the community by volunteers in the administration. However, it is observed that negligence on behalf of the community towards effective implementing physical distancing and staying at home.The practice of COVID-19 prevention measures in this finding was 40.7% with 95% CI (36.9, 44.5). The qualitative study finding an interviewee supported this finding has said that as to me the people are undermining COVID-19 believing that they are safe and will not be infected. This might be because significant death cases are not reported as high as Europeans and Americans. This finding was higher than the study done in south Ethiopia, which was 20%. 17 This discrepancy might be because in this research all respondents were urban residence was as a study in south Ethiopia more than half of the respondents were rural residence. Since urban residents are near to information regarding COVID-19 and might have adequate knowledge and a positive attitude towards the pandemic that leads to practice COVID-19 prevention.However, the result was lower than the study done in Indian which was 83.7%. 18 This variation maybe because of using different methods of data collection. In our case, we used a direct interview method which includes all populations whereas the study done in India used online data collection which includes only a more educated population. Also, this finding lower than the finding of a study conducted in the Amhara region, Ethiopia which was 62%. 26 The justification might be because of the difference in the study population as our study included a community member with different health and educational background, and the study conducted in the Amhara region included only health care worker that they have better, access information, and closely for COVID-19 prevention measures than our study population.In our study, females were approximately two times more likely to practices COVID-19 prevention methods compared to males. This finding was consistent with a study conducted in Iran. 3 This might be because females spent most of their time at home and they are naturally more prone to practice handwashing. Also, mostly females involved in childcare, food preparation, and other tasks as compared with males. So, preventive measures are more likely to be practiced better among females to protect themselves and others from infection.Married populations were 2.75 times more likely to practices COVID-19 prevention methods as compared to those currently unmarried. A study done in China supported this finding. 20 This could be explained that those married are better economically income that leads to afford the COVID-19 prevention types of equipment. Those who had a monthly income of >10,000 ETB were 7.33 times more likely to practice COVID-19 prevention as compared to those who had a monthly income <5000 ETB. This result was consistent with other studies in Malaysia and the United States, 19, 21 which showed that those populations with low economic status showed poor knowledge of COVID-19 prevention methods. The study in China reported income was statistically significant with the practice of COVID-19 prevention. 22 This is because economic status is the main indicator of behavior and actions for maintaining one's health. This is also supported with the qualitative result, which was the reason for not responding to COVID-19 prevention practice was Economic reasons (not able to afford alcohol, a face-mask, etc., poor socioeconomic status). It implies that low socioeconomic status leads to the difficulty of change one's behavior or condition, and finally inability of performing recommended protective behaviors of COVID-19. 20 Also, an increase in income leads to the possibility of satisfying needs for protecting COVID-19. For example, buying facemask and hand sanitizer is possible when there is adequate income. Individuals with low income will not stay at home, rather prefer to continue their daily submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2021:14 activities to satisfy their basic needs during the transmission period.Those who had good knowledge about COVID-19 were 5.23 times more likely to practice COVID-19 prevention as compared to their counterparts. This finding is consistent with a study in China and Amhara region, Ethiopia. 23, 26 This might be because knowledge is the main modifier of positive attitudes toward COVID-19 preventive practices, and these activities are practiced after having awareness and knowledge of activities to be performed. Knowledge of COVID-19 decreases the risk of infection by improving patient's prevention practices. Knowledge about coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) sign and symptoms, transmission, treatment, and how to prevent infection will increase the prevention practice of individuals and they might be implemented the key messages of the guideline include causes, how to choose and wear face masks, proper handwashing habits, preventive measures at different locations (eg, at home, on public transportation, and in public space), disinfection methods, and medical observation at home. 3 Respondents who had a favorable attitude towards COVID-19 prevention were 3.87 times more likely to practice COVID-19 prevention as compared to those who had an unfavorable attitude. This finding is supported by a study conducted in China. 24 This might be because having a positive attitude leads to more awareness of prevention measures of COVID-19 and leads to more practices.Those participants who had the chronic disease were 3.46 times more practice COVID-19 prevention methods as compared to those who had no chronic disease. This finding was consistent with a study conducted in southern Ethiopia, the Amhara region in Ethiopia, and Thailand. 17, 25, 26 The justification might be those having chronic diseases have a chance of caring for themselves regularly because they are close with a health professional to care for themselves.Those who had no chewing habits were 2.15 times more likely to practice COVID-19 prevention as compared to those chewers. This might be because that khat chewer is more likely going out home to buy khat, group chewing that leads less likely of applying keeping distance. This study has some strengths and limitations. As a strength, our study used both quantitative and qualitative data methods were employed. It was conducted during a critical period, few months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ethiopia, and it included community populations with different sociodemographic characteristics to assess their practices toward COVID-19 prevention measures.However, as a limitation, it did not include rural areas around Dire Dawa City. Since it is a cross-sectional study, it does not show a cause-effect relationship.The practice of preventive measures of the coronavirus was low. Factors such as sex, marital status, monthly family income, history of chronic disease, history of khat chewing, knowledge, and attitude about COVID-19 were predictors of the practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. We recommend the government, concerned stakeholders, and media to work continuously on the spread of COVID-19 to increases the knowledge and attitude of the societies which ultimately results in better preventive practices toward COVID-19. Further, still the governments of Africa and WHO to emphasize preparedness for the practices of COVID-19 prevention measures for Africa.Abbreviations nCoV, novel coronavirus; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; WHO, World Health Organization.All related data are presented within the paper, and its supporting information file.","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-02-02",2

In West Africa, the use of face mask in the public place has been made compulsory in Nigeria, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Liberia, and Guinea Bissau. In contrast, Togo, Niger and Gambia have recommended face masks use in some areas (SWAC, 2020) . In most countries, violators could face periods of imprisonment or pay fines. These policies became necessary, considering that an increasing number of researches have suggested that face masks serve as an efficacious means of controlling the spread of coronavirus. The prime vehicle of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission is through respiratory droplets when an infected or an asymptomatic patient sneezes, coughs or communicates with others. Hence, the mandatory use of face masks (surgical brands or homemade face coverings act as barriers to prevent or limit the viruscontaining droplets from being transmitted from an infected patient to others in public spaces (Aydin et al., 2020; Furukawa et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020) . Presently, protecting public safety and conquering the virus remains the priority of governments and healthcare agencies.However, the measures adopted in stemming COVID-19 must not be misconstrued to mean the license to suspend the war on single-use plastics or the government-backed support to pollute our terrestrial and marine environments with disposable plastics.Africa is the second-largest continent in the world, with a fast population growth estimated at 1.34 billion people for 2020 (Worldometer, 2020) . According to this estimate, Africa accounts for about 17% of the total world population, with an average of 49% of the people living in the urban and semiurban communities. Besides the unprecedented concentration of people in the urban centres, the burgeoning middle-class population in African countries has created vast consumer markets for plastic products (Jambeck et al., 2018; Deloitte, 2014) . In most countries, traditional methods of food products and shop items packaging have been superseded by plastic food packages and plastic takeaway containers. In retail outlets, shops, supermarkets, street and food vending businesses, and major markets across Africa, single-used plastics are widely used for packaging merchandises and food products, thus increasing the consumption rate of plastics in the continent (Adam et al., 2020; Meizah et al., 2015) .In the last few decades, the African continent has witnessed a proportionate increase in plastic production and per capita consumption as its population grows coupled with rapid urbanisation (Jambeck et al., 2015 (Jambeck et al., , 2018 . However, given inadequate facilities to manage the large quantity of plastic waste generated coupled with the existence of weak regulation on municipal waste management, a large number of plastic debris end up as inadequately disposed and littered wastes. These mismanaged plastics wastes are at high risk of polluting rivers, waterways, and the ocean.Since the COVID-19 was discovered and the WHO declared its spread as a public health emergency, several African countries have made it mandatory for its citizens to wear face J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f masks, or face shields especially while in public spaces. Several commercially sold surgical grade masks are manufactured from sheets of plastics intended for use as single-use plastics (SUPs).However, in most countries, these imported surgical grade masks largely made from nonwoven polypropylene are expensive and in short supply. As a result, people have resorted to improvisation and homemade production of cloth face covering or masks, sewed commonly from textiles (mainly cotton). These cloth face masks are mostly reusable and are recommended as a substitute for surgical-grade masks to reduce the transmission of coronavirus (CDC, 2020; Mahase, 2020; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2015) . However, most of these single-use personal protective equipment are mismanaged resulting in indiscriminate disposal and widespread contamination of the terrestrial, atmospheric and aquatic environments. This paper provides a survey of the polymeric characteristics of some commercially available face masks in Africa. We report here the first estimates of single-use face masks generated by countries in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as highlight the potential risks mismanaged SUPs could pose to public health and the environment. The paper has also identified some plastic management challenges in Africa and proposes mitigation measures to address the problem of plastic pollution epidemic in Africa.We collected samples of commercially available surgical-grade (SG) (n = 100) andFiltering facepiece 2 (FFP2) (n = 50) face masks bought from major pharmaceutical companies in Ogun State, while the homemade (HM) (n = 30) face masks were purchased from street J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hawkers in Lagos and Ogun States. The sample collections were randomly done in June 2020.After collection, the face masks were sorted and cut into 3 × 3 cm using a Sparco stainless steel scissors. It is imperative to note that that the face masks used in this work does not represent all the various single-use PPEs in Africa or the multiple products and brands commercially available in African countries. It could however be taken as an arbitrary representative of face masks used and discarded in the continent. To determine the types of polymer in the various face masks collected, a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to characterise the SG, HM and FFP2 face masks samples. The characterization was performed in the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode using the Agilent 630 Cary FTIR Spectrometer equipped with a diamond crystal at a resolution of 8 cm -1 , 32 sample scans and a range of 4000 -650 cm -1 . For measurement of spectra of face masks samples collected, each sample was introduced directly and clamped onto the ATR diamond crystal after performing the clean check. A relative pressure was applied to close the press, and the analysis was done using the Agilent MicroLab® software for the determination of a spectrum of satisfactory intensity. The Agilent polymer ATR library and the Sigma-Aldrich® Online Infra-red Spectrum Table and Chart were utilised to evaluate the absorptions and vibrations for functional groups in each polymer.The acceptable match quality was fixed at ≥ 80%. (Baskaran and Sathiavelu, 2020; Fred-Ahmadu et al., 2020a,b) . The representative spectra for samples of SG, HM and FFP2 face masks polymers are presented in Fig. 2 .The daily single-use face masks generated by each country in Africa is estimated as a function of the total population of a country, daily face mask use per capita and an arbitrary percent of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f facemask acceptance rate by the urban population (Nzediegwu and Chang, 2020) . The total monthly and daily estimated face mask generations were computed according to the following equations: The spectra established that the textile fibres of the face mask brands were characterised by a combination of natural and artificial fibres including polyester fibres (PE), polypropylene (PP), natural latex resin (NL), polyethylene terephthalate, styrene isoprene, and styrene butadiene rubber. The FTIR spectra verified the appearance of the absorption bands that are typical of polypropylene: vibrations linked with C-C bonding (1200 -800 cm −1 ), CH 2 scissor vibrations and CH 3 symmetric deformation vibrations or CH 3 asymmetric deformation vibrations (1453-1356 cm −1 ), and CH 2 and CH 3 symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations (2950 -2830 cm −1 ) ( Fig. 2 ) (Marković et al., 2020; Kostov et al., 2013) .Also, the FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of PE synthetic fibres in the FFP2 (3M) and homemade face masks (Fig. 2) . The spectra showed various characteristic absorption bands associated with polyester fibres including the moderately intense C-H stretching (2840 -3000 cm −1 ), strong C-H bending (723 cm −1 ) and medium C=C out-of-plane bending vibrations of the benzene rings (872 cm −1 ). The absorption bands that appear at 1013 and 3369 cm −1 are linked with the OH out-of-plane bending in the terminal carboxylic groups and intermolecular OH bonded to C=O groups in the polyester chains, respectively, while the peak at 1710 cm −1 indicates the appearance of a strong C=O stretching band for the carboxylic group (Sharma et al., 2020; Kale et al., 2018; Peets et al., 2017) . On the other hand, the spectral fingerprints of natural latex rubber (NL) indicated characteristic absorption peaks at 2952, 2914, 2870, and 2836 cm −1 and are assigned to moderately intense C-H stretching vibration, medium C=C stretching for alkene at peak 1651 cm −1 , while the absorption peaks at 1457 cm −1 and 1375 cm -1 are attributed to carbon-hydrogen deformation for CH 2 group and carbon-hydrogen deformation for CH 3 group, respectively (Bhadra et al., 2019) . Therefore, it is well established that PE, PP and NL were the most dominant fibres in face mask brands.With the current consumption of SUPs especially surgical masks and homemade (fabric) face masks, if people in the urban and semi-urban areas in all countries in Africa used at least one mask each day at the rate 70% face mask acceptance, the estimated volume of face masks generated and disposed of in a day per capita would be about 412 million pieces, with over 100 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Boyle, 2020; Chaudhuri, 2020) .According to our estimations based on the proportion of total plastic wastes (TPWs) in municipal solid wastes, and the quantity of waste generation per capita in African countries, the calculated fraction of mismanaged plastic waste produced by each country is presented in Table   1 . However, it should be noted that the estimated TPWs generation by a country is the quantity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f derived before formal waste management involving sorting, recycling, or incineration. Thus, TPWs does not depict the volume of plastics at risk of polluting the gullies, inland waterways, canals, creeks, rivers, estuarine and the marine ecosystems.The results of this study indicated that 15 out of 57 countries in Africa are major contributors of single-use plastic wastes, contributing about 75% of the TPWs in the continent per year with Nigeria (15%), Ethiopia (8.6%), Egypt (7.6%), DR Congo (6.7%), Tanzania (4.5%),and South Africa (4.4%) topping the list (Fig. 4 & 5) . These countries mostly have extensive maritime coastal zones bordering the ocean. Therefore, the existence of poor or limited waste management facilities in these countries could result in the littering and direct introduction of land-based derived plastic wastes into the beaches and ocean.In most developing countries in Africa, it is a common practice to discard domestic andindustrial wastes in open landfills, wastewater gullies, inland waterways, poorly managed and uncontrolled dumpsites, street bins, drainage canals and paved walkways. Over the years, these dumpsites and landfills have become very problematic to manage, and a rallying point where waste scavengers visit to forage for the recovery of waste recyclables. Waste pickers or hunter are essential players in the informal waste management, especially in developing countrieswhere it serves as a quick source of income for the urban poor (Asim et al., 2012; Sembiring and Nitivattananon, 2010; Ahmed and Ali, 2004) . Informal waste management in most African countries is dominated by landfill scavengers, itinerant waste hunters, and neighbourhood J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f waste pickers who primarily engage in uncontrolled activities of waste collection, sorting and recycling (Oguntoyinbo, 2012; Tremblay et al., 2010; Imam et al., 2007) . The scavenging of littered heaps for potentially recyclable materials is usually carried out without wearing suitable personal protective equipment. In Nigeria, it has been reported that scavengers are engaged in collecting discarded face masks from open dumps for recycling and resale to the unsuspecting public (Folorunsho-Francis, 2020). Although waste picking in third world countries may serve as a means of livelihood and escape from poverty for the impoverished few, it could potentially be a vehicle for the spread of infectious diseases including COVID-19 (Doremalen et al., 2020; Moss et al., 2017; Vasickova et al., 2010) . Recent reports have identified the stability and survivability of COVID-19 virus on contaminated fomites including plastics, banknotes, stainless steel, cardboard, copper, wood, and face masks (Doremalen et al., 2020; Chin et al., 2020) . The studies showed that the infectious viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 is exceptionally contagious and could remain viable on a range of surfaces for several minutes and up to 9 days (Doremalen et al., 2020; Kampf et al., 2020) . Coronaviruses on plastics and stainless-steel surfaces were found to be more viable and stable for 2 to 3 days than cardboard, wood, banknotes and copper (Chin et al., 2020; Doremalen et al., 2020) . Therefore, the spread and infectivity of COVID-19 through inadequately disposed or littered wastes could be filliped by scavengers and informal waste collectors upon exposure to contaminated materials.The question surrounding how COVID-19 virus is transmitted and the strategies to stop the virus from spreading has generated a growing global concern over the use of single-use plastics, thus dampening the war against plastic pollution. Over the past months, millions of people around the world have been compelled to observe the government-issued directives on J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f lockdown as a measure of reducing the spread of the virus. COVID-19 has been described as a zoonotic disease that originated at the end of December 2019 in Wuhan in Hubei Province, China and has spread to over 212 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances (Worldometers, 2020; Mackenzie & Smith, 2020; Bogoch et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020) . As of early July 2020, the outbreak recorded over 12 million confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, with at more than half a million deaths (Worldometers, 2020) . In Africa, over 500,000 and 12,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths have been recorded as at early July 2020 (Fig. 6 , Table 1 ). According to the WHO, SARS-CoV-2 virus is primarily transmitted via saliva droplets or release from the nostril when an infected patient sneezes or coughs (WHO, 2020a).Past investigations have shown that contaminated surfaces are principal vehicles for the spread of viral infections (Jones and Gibson, 2020; Park et al., 2015) . The presence of COVID-19 ribonucleic acid on surfaces of inappropriately released single-use clinical materials has been reported (Chin et al., 2020; Doremalen et al., 2020) . As indicated by reported studies, COVID-19RNA has been discovered to be more stable and potent for 2 to 3 days on plastics and treated steel surfaces than on cardboard, wood, banknotes and copper (Chin et al., 2020; Doremalen et al., 2020) . In addition, the epidemiological information from the studies revealed that coronavirus could be detected on the outer surfaces of face masks for a few minutes and as long as 2.8 days after exposure (Fig. 7) . These data confirm the stability and viability of COVID-19 infection through infected face masks and other clinical wastes (Doremalen et al., 2020; Nghiem et al., 2020; Todd et al., 2009) . Thus, it is imperative to reappraise existing waste J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f management in Africa countries to avoid community infection of people through exposed surfaces and disposed contaminated face masks. Additionally, inappropriate collection and management of COVID-19 wastes, including littering, disposal in uncontained landfills and open dumps may likely exacerbate the current plastic waste pollution in the continent.Plastic pollution has been identified as a growing environmental and public health challenge.The sorption of carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting chemicals onto bulk plastics and micro-, meso-, and macro-plastics in the terrestrial environment and marine ecosystems has been widely reported (Amereh et al., 2020; Benson & Fred-Ahmadu, 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Prata et al., 2020; Trifuoggi et al., 2019; Chae & An, 2017) . However, the magnitude of this problem and the call for measures to address the worsening plastic pollution crises have grown only lately to a higher level of public consciousness, especially since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic.To address the problem of plastic pollution epidemic in Africa, the following recommendations are advocated:a h) Furthermore, we suggest that designated waste receptacles should be provided at marked points in public places, healthcare facilities, shopping malls, markets, banks, worship centres, schools, and residential estates to collect used PPEs. In view of this, periodical emptying and routine decontamination of the waste containers must be carried out by trained hazardous waste handlers in line with laid down guidelines (Africa CDC, 2020; WHO, 2020b; EU, 2020).i) In general, as the coronavirus pandemic continues, a strong recommendation to the government, health workers, medical experts, and the public would be to prevent plastic pollution by being individually, communally and globally responsible.All data used in this study are publicly available and are referenced in the manuscript.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

A fuller analysis will be described in the near future.Given the substantial uncertainties around the true counts of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and prior studies indicating that in many settings the confirmed case count is a small proportion of all laboratory confirmed infections, it is of ongoing importance to obtain credible estimates of the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity (seroprevalence), at the community level (1, 2) .The prime objective of our study is to estimate seroprevalence in South African blood donors. Beyond that, we will pursue additional analyses such as 1) investigating how representative this prevalence is likely to be of community-level prevalence, 2) gathering data about the spectrum of disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 3) considering options for leveraging ongoing surveillance of prevalence into real-time incidence estimates. In the present work, we focus on early seroprevalence estimates.The South African National Blood Service (SANBS -serving 8 of 9 provinces in South Africa) and Western Cape Blood Service (WCBS -servicing the Western Cape) obtained ethics clearance from the SANBS Human Research Ethics Committee to perform a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study among South African blood donors. The protocol allowed for the testing of routinely collected donor screening samples on predefined 'collection days' (7 th , 10 th ,12 th ,15 th ,20 th ,23 th and 25 th January); which were announced to blood centre staff, but without prior notice to potential donors. All donors underwent routine screening through a self-administered questionnaire, one-on-one assessment and a mini-health screening by blood centre staff. Donors who did not meet the routine donor eligibility criteria were excluded from donation and therefore from the study. To date, testing has been performed in the Eastern Cape (EC), Free State (FS), KwaZulu Natal (ZN) and Northern Cape (NC) provinces.Samples collected at the time of donation, were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin nucleocapsid assay on the cobas e411 platform already in use in the blood services. This assay, according to the package insert, has diagnostic specificity in excess of 99.5%, and near perfect sensitivity (point estimate of 100%) at 16 days post PCR positivity. We do not here explore various interesting nuances of how to define and estimate test performance characteristics by distribution of cases (defined primarily by severity of infection and time since infection/symptoms/PCR detection) but note that:• Sensitivity and specificity 'in our hands' was investigated by testing 618 samples from the pre-COVID-19 era (1 marginal false positive precisely at the diagnostic threshold) and 50 samples confirmed as positive in a COVID-19 convalescent plasma study protocol (with 1 false negative). • For epidemiological interpretation, we take seroprevalence as a close proxy of the prevalence of the condition of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at some point. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay appears to have particularly good durability of antibody detection for months post PCR reversion and symptom resolution, with no evidence of antibody waning and seroreversion over more than four months in a US COVID-19 convalescent plasma cohort (personal communication, M. Busch). • We ignore, for now, the effects of 1) the donor deferral rule that people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, or COVID-19-like symptoms, are precluded from donation for a period of two weeks after PCR test and symptom resolution, and 2) deferral of regular donors who were in quarantine due to a positive contact who would not have presented for their routine donation. Given the high rate of asymptomatic infection, this is a relatively minor limitation.We did not perform structured sampling in the sense of a primary or secondary unit of analysis, with steps of random selection of primary sampling units, households or individuals -the study merely observed donors who happen to present themselves at donation facilities on collection days. Prevalence was estimated by typical categorical and continuous predictors (age, sex, race and province) by standard methods, using the R platform for statistical computation. Although we are not aware of any biological basis for expecting racial differences -in South Africa, as elsewhere, race is, for historical reasons, a strong correlate of socio-economic status, living conditions, and social circumstances, and therefore a suspected predictor of prevalence. Provincial weighted seroprevalence estimates are based on population size estimates from Machemedze et al (3), and racial breakdown of provinces according to the 2011 census (4). The level of (dis)aggregation for headline results was chosen based on exploratory analysis described below.During the seven collection days held throughout January 2021, 4858 voluntary non-remunerated blood donors from four provinces (EC, NC, FS and ZN) of South Africa were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The majority of blood donors were from ZN at 2107 (43%), followed by EC at 1457 (30%), FS at 831 (17%) and NC at 463 (10%).There were slightly more male donors (53%). The large majority of donors in our study were White (47%) and Black (34%) with the remainder distributed relatively evenly between the Asian and 'Coloured' -a uniquely South African racial label indicating persons with a significant mix of ancestry from, amongst other lineages, South Asia, Indonesia, Southern Africa and Europe (5) donors. Figure 1 shows the age distribution of donors included in the present analysis, further decomposed by race and province.After categorizing by broad age bins for four provinces and the major race groups (Figure 2) , there was no association between seroprevalence and age; when sex was included (figure 3) there was no association between seroprevalence and sex. Therefore for the remaining analysis we aggregated over all ages and did not disaggregate sex. Figure 4 shows the seroprevalence estimates by the remaining meaningful disaggregation -race and province. The large difference by both race and province are highly statistically significant as well as epidemiologically meaningful. We also show the race-weighted overall provincial prevalence estimates (which we interpret as provincial 'attack rates'), and the official prevalence of having been diagnosed, based on reporting of positive PCR diagnostic test results to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (6). Table 1 shows our provincial estimates of attack rates, as a percentage; the implied number of infections; the number of laboratory confirmed cases according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) (6) which reports on testing performed both in the private and public sector; and the (multiplicative) discrepancy between our estimate and the official count. Note that our estimated number of infections is conservatively based on our estimated prevalence being applied only to the age group 15-69, so these factors are not quite as large as implied by Figure 4 . The estimated seroprevalence ranges from 31.8% in NC to 62.5% in the EC and is at least 8 fold higher than the official case count.Our study confirmed high seroprevalence rates, in excess of 60%, among Black donors, with little sign of significant population level immunity among other race groups. These significant differences most likely can be explained by historically based socio-economic factors which hinder the implementation of COVID-19 preventative measures at a community level. Previous seroprevalence estimates from South Africa, specifically the Western Cape province (not included in our analysis), earlier in the epidemic found: 1) a very high prevalence (30-40 percent) among pregnant women attending state sector antenatal care, and people living with HIV presenting for routine viral load assessment (7); and 2) higher prevalence among workers with lower socioeconomic status (8) . A review of population-based seroprevalence studies in Europe, America and Asia reported a seroprevalence range of <0.1% to more than 20% in the different regions (2).For an indication of the meaning of such high seroprevalence values, in a one year old epidemic, consider: A prevalence of 50%, accumulated over 50 weeks, of a condition with a duration of infectiousness of 1 week, implies an average 'prevalence of infectiousness' of 1% of the population, with inevitable significant elevations above this average value during peaks. For people reliant on public transport, or working in public spaces, it will be difficult to limit close encounters to fewer than 100 people on any given day -i.e. difficult to encounter fewer than one infectious person per day.We do not claim that blood donors are a perfectly representative of the South African population. Firstly, Black and White donors each account for roughly half the total participants of this study, though South Africa's population is about 80 percent Black African and only 8 percent White/European (4). Other population groups are generally insignificantly small except Asian in Kwazulu-Natal (about 20%) and Coloured in the Western Cape (about 50%). Furthermore, repeat blood donors (who supply the majority of donations) are pre-selected to have recently been negative for pathogens included in routine blood safety screening. In South Africa this selection for being HIV negative is certainly relevant, given the country's extraordinary HIV prevalence. Communities which are economically stressed, or without ease of access to blood donor centres, will be under-represented among the study population.Survey dates represented in this analysis are barely past South Africa's 'second peak' in COVID-19 incidence. Deferral rules based on confirmed infection or COVID-19-like symptoms should slightly depress seroprevalence estimates relative to 'true' prevalence. The age weighting we adopted to estimate total infections also produces a face value underestimate for population totals as it assigns no cases in the age range 0-14, which accounts for about 30 percent of the population. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay appears to have particularly good detection sensitivity for months post PCR reversion (9) , though there may be some seroreversion. Therefore, while further investigation of the issue of representativeness will clearly need to be done, our estimates are subject to downward bias by at least some obvious considerations.With due consideration to both the patent and latent limitations of our study, the key observations we wish to make at this point are:• The ordering of the prevalence-by-province and prevalence-by-race is what one would expect, based on official case counts, and an understanding of South African society. • The particularly high attack rates in majority Black communities points to the limitations, thus far, of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the context of economic deprivation and high population density. • The high seroprevalence amongst Black donors also raises interesting and important questions about the level of collective immunity thus far obtained through the two primary infection waves to date -but we caution against simplistic interpretations, given that substantial outbreaks have been seen in cities after the observation of very high seroprevalence (10) , and the recent concerns about vaccine efficacy against new variants. • The low seroprevalence amongst White donors suggests that predominantly White suburban communities lack meaningful collective immunity, and should take infection control measures very seriously for the foreseeable future. • Given the relatively low marginal cost of leveraging the infrastructure of the blood services, we are keen to further probe the representativeness of blood-donor-based seroprevalence surveys, and to see to what extent surveillance in the blood services can be a valuable and efficient ongoing activity during major infectious disease outbreaks.We are mindful of the incompleteness of this project, and the potential to misconstrue the wider ramifications of these findings. We endeavour to proceed rapidly from data gathering to publication, and to offer realistic and grounded interpretations of the findings.

CAD is one of the largest killers in developed countries including Nigeria killing more than 7.4 million people around the world in 2012 and 53,836 persons as of 2014 in Nigeria [20, 21] . It is also estimated that 1 in 7 people in the United States has CAD [3] . The disease is also one of the leading causes of deaths in women, killing more people than cancers [3] . CAD causes more deaths and disabilities in developed nations than developing ones [20] [28] .In Nigeria, CAD causes more deaths due to insufficient knowledge of the negative impact of the disease on humans [5] [23, 24] . In Nigeria, CAD-related deaths reached 53,836 which amount to 2.82% of all deaths that occurred in 2014 [20] [24] . Most of the victims of the disease tend to ignore the early symptoms and consultations with the health workers until they are in a bad or severe condition of the CAD. Therefore, most of these patients die before receiving appropriate medications or medical attentions [5] . There is a huge burden of CAD in most of the West African countries due to limited resources to provide comprehensive health care for the CAD patients and inadequate awareness campaign of the disease. Therefore, early detection and diagnosis of the CAD, being currently one of the deadliest diseases in Nigeria, might be assisting significantly to fight the disease [8, 9] .Medical diagnosis is the process of diagnosing the disease by measuring specific symptoms and signs [11, 12] [22] . The patient expresses symptoms of the disease to medical doctor, while signs of the disease are observed by medical doctor. However, patient may not accurately sometime express the symptoms, and physicians may not always be sure of signs of the diseases due to uncertainty and vagueness in the course of diagnostic decision making [11, 21, 22] . Therefore, various uncertainties and vagueness affect the diagnostic process, and they must be carefully dealt with [7] . Sometime also, physicians often have variations in their decisions due to uncertainty and vagueness of the information they have at their disposal [18, 24, 25] . These uncertainties, complexities and vagueness involved in the diagnostic decision-making process have to be addressed. In this regard, the fuzzy expert systems are being developed to mimic human specialists' diagnostic decision-making processes in order to address the issue of uncertainties, complexities and vagueness often associated with decision making [11, 12, 26] . The fuzzy-based expert system is an advanced artificial intelligence system that uses unconventional thinking to reduce the uncertainty that is often associated with the diagnosis process of diseases [1, 17] [21] [26] . In this study, a fuzzy expert system for diagnosis of coronary artery disease is built with MATLAB, which can easily be integrated into the electronic health record system.In [14] , fuzzy expert system for diagnosing of heart disease based on medical records in Jordan was developed using a visual studio, and system is able to identify CAD patients. In [19] , the clinical support system for treating chronic heart disease using risk factors, most of which are clinical risk factors, has been developed. C4.5 algorithm is used to generate system production rules from the Cleveland heart disease database and system was proved to be very efficient and effective. In [16] , a web-based diagnostic system for diagnosis of cardiac is developed with PHP, HTML, and Java script and MySQL and the system used 15 input variables with seven diagnostic rules. In [1] , an expert system for diagnosing cardiovascular disease with MATLAB was developed, and the system has 94% accuracy. In [13] , an expert system for cardiovascular disease was developed and the production rules of the system were made from the UCI Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Repository of Machine Learning Databases. In [17] , a CAD screening system using clinical parameters was developed and a questionnaire was designed under the medical team's guidance to collect information about patients' clinical parameters based on the risk factors of CAD. The system was implemented using object-oriented technique with one demographic risk factor and eleven clinical risk factors of CAD.Many scholars have developed expert systems for diagnosing CAD. Still, most of these systems, and their production rules, were generated from a repository dataset of CAD, such as the Cleveland Heart Disease Database. Only a few generated datasets from the available medical records. Therefore, developing a Fuzzy Based Expert System for Diagnosis of CAD using datasets generated from CAD patients' medical records in Nigeria is required.The fuzzy based expert system developed in this work, has three (3) major component which include knowledge discovery (data mining), fuzzification, knowledge inference and defuzzification. Figure 1 shows the methods and materials of the study. Diagnostic data of the patients who are suffering from and those who were suspected of having CAD was collected at General Hospitals in Kano State, Nigeria. The data collection was approved by the Kano State Ministry of Health in Kano -Nigeria.Data preparation. The dataset collected was prepared, cleansed and only 506 diagnostic cases were recorded. The dataset has twelve (12) attributes which include age, glucose, blood pressure, chest pain, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), body mass index, creatinine, heart rate, and diagnostic result. Table 1 shows units, range, and data type of each attribute of the dataset.The prepared and cleaned dataset was transformed into Weka readable file format called Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF). Weka is an open-source machine learning software used to uncover useful knowledge from the dataset [25] . An improved C4.5 classification algorithm proposed by [4] was encoded into the Weka to generate the production rules used in the knowledge of the system. The algorithm employed L' hospital rule in the course of the improvement of C4.5 algorithm where it uses average information gain and information gain ratio rather than just information gain ratio used by C4.5 algorithm as the criterion to select the candidate attribute as the root of the decision tree [27] . Let Assume, S is the dataset and B as the set of attributes of the dataset. The information gain of attribute B is computed using Eq. 1 as follows The Gain-Ratio (b) is expressed as followsThe algorithm computes average information gain and information gain ratio using equation. (1) The improved C4.5 algorithm was ran into Weka simultaneously with C4.5 and Random Tree Algorithms respectively. The performance results of the algorithms are shown in Table 2 . The improved algorithm has the highest accuracy of 86.56% among all the algorithms.The decision tree generated by using improved C4.5 was converted into crisp rules. Table 3 shows some of the corresponding crisp rules of generated from the decision tree.Rule Selection Technique (RST) proposed by [2] was adopted to select the crisp rules generated using an improved C4.5 algorithm. The rule selection is based on the notion of the importance measure and supports filtering of the rules, therefore, rules were converted into decision table. The filtering technique is applied to select the rules in order to reduce their number before to apply importance measure to select the most importance ones [2] .Fuzzification is the process of fuzzifying the crisp set of rules generated using an improved C4.5 algorithm. The fuzzification is carried out using fuzzy logic. Unlike traditional logic which has only 0 or 1, fuzzy logic has infinite numbers from 0 to 1. Fuzzy logic is called multivalued logic, unlike the conventional logic set, where an element can either belong entirely to a group or does not belong at all [6, 17] . In the fuzzy theory, A fuzzy set A in X is defined as a set of ordered pairs = , () ∈ Fuzzy sets allow a succession of possible choices. For any element x of the universe X, the membership function μA(x) is equal to the degree that x is an element of set A [27] . This value set between 0 and 1 is considered the order of membership [27] . It is also known as the membershipvalue of the element x in set A. Fuzzy logic is just an expression of ambiguity and uncertainty. The advantage is that they can overlap and avoid the problem of sharp boundaries [15] . Therefore, the attributes of the dataset which are the system's inputs and output were fuzzified in order to address the inaccuracies, ambiguities, and uncertainties associated with diagnostic decision making of CAD' patients [17] .The system input parameters include: age, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, creatinine, body mass index, heart rate, and chest pain, which has been defined with three fuzzy linguistic values and the output variable (diagnosis)with an input parameter chest pain have four fuzzy values. The output variable (diagnosis) has healthy, mild, moderate, and severe fuzzy linguistic values while and chest pain which is an input parameter has typical angina, atypical angina, non-angina, and asymptomatic fuzzy linguistic values. However, there is no ambiguity or overlap in chest pain, and since the patient has only one chest pain at a time. The value of a fuzzy variable is defined by the fuzzy membership grade, which is determined by the membership function. However, a trapezoidal membership function was used for all input variables while for output variable, triangular membership function was used. A trapezoidal membership function distribution is represented as Trapezoidal (x; a,b,c,d) . The membership function value at x = a, x = b, x = c and x = d are set equal to 0.0, 1.0, 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. The trapezoidal membership function expressed in Eq. (6) below (6) trapezoid (x;a, b, c, d) The triangular membership function is donated by Triangle  (x; a, b, c) . The membership function value at x = a, x = b and x = c are set equal to 0.0, 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. The triangular membership function expressed in Eq. (7) below The linguistic variables and membership functions each attribute of the dataset is determined, calculated and visualized using MATLAB. Thus, each crisp value has been transformed or converted into a fuzzy value. As such, all the crisp set rules generated using an improved C4.5 decision tree algorithm were transformed into the corresponding fuzzy set rules. Moreover, after determining each attribute's linguistic variable and converting crisp value into fuzzy values, the crisp set rules generated earlier were converted into a fuzzy set of rules. Table 4 shows the sample of fuzzy rules, Fig. 2 shows membership functions and linguistic of age, Fig. 3 shows the membership function of the linguistic variables of the chest pain and Fig. 4 shows the membership functions of the linguistic variables of diagnosis. A fuzzy Based Expert System for Diagnosis of CAD has three major components which include knowledge base, inference engine, and defuzzification (user interface).The knowledge base has been developed based on the historical data and the experience of cardiologists. Cardiologists were consulted and involved in the stage of data collection, cleaning, interpretation and knowledge generation. Cardiologists verified each rule generated with an improved data mining algorithm, and all the conflicts were resolved. The system employed a production technique for knowledge presentation. The production rules are written in the format of < IF (condition) THEN (conclusion) > . In the present fuzzy system, condition and conclusion are fuzzy variables. These rules are diagnostic rules and are selected by the inference engine of the system. MATLAB is used to implement the system, which has 87 rules. The knowledge base rules are shown in Fig. 5 .Knowledge inference is a mechanism behind inferring new knowledge from existing fuzzy rules available in the system knowledge base. Therefore, new information and conclusions would be deduced from it. Mamdani inference technique is used to stimulate expert physicians' reasoning in diagnosing CAD in this work. Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System is widely used because it provides good results with a relatively simple structure. Mamdani is used to create a control system synthesizing a set of linguistic production rules obtained from experienced human operators [17] . Therefore, the Minimum operator, the conjunction operator is MIN, the t-norm from the compositional rule is MIN, and the MAX operator is used to aggregate the rules. Figure 6 shows the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of System Inference with Mamdani technique.Defuzzification involves transforming the output of the inference engine (fuzzy values) into crisp values. A centroid is employed in this work for defuzzification, called the center of area or center of gravity, where z is the output variable, and (z) is the membership function of the aggregated fuzzy set A referring to z. The Centroid method de-fuzzifies the system's diagnosis result's undefined values, which is the output of the system to crisp values. Figure 7 shows the GUI of Rule Viewer of the system while Fig. 8 shows the Surface Viewer of the system.The expert system was applied to the diagnostic data of 100 people (Healthy = 21%, Mild = 23%, Moderate = 31% and Severe = 25%) who came to Specialist Hospital in Kano, Nigeria for CAD checkup. Information based on one demographic risk factor and eleven clinical risk factors was taken from them and were labelled by cardiologist. The system was applied to find the model predicted risk to these people. For evaluation of the performance of the system, model predicted outputs were compared with the results given by the cardiologist. Table 5 shows the check-up results for each class of patients with healthy, mild, moderate, and severe cases.The system used to diagnose CAD patients based on a demographical CAD risk factor and eleven clinical risk factors. Below are metrics used to evaluate the performance of the system i. Accuracy: is used to evaluate the percentage of CAD patients who were correctly diagnosed by the system. ii. Sensitivity: is used to evaluate the percentage of CAD patients who were abnormal and correctly diagnosed by the system. iii. Specificity: is used to evaluate the percentage of CAD patients who were normal and correctly diagnosed by the system. iv. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) is used to show the relationship between the specificity and sensitivity of the system. Table 6 and Fig. 9 show the system's performance evaluation result based on accuracy sensitivity and specificity as 94.55%, 95.35%, and 95.00%, respectively. ROC shows the relationship between the specificity and sensitivity of the system. The result indicates that the system is reliable and can diagnose both negative and positive CAD patients effectively.The x-axis of ROC is showing specificity while y-axis showing sensitivity as shown in Fig. 10 . The curve shows that the relationship between the specificity and sensitivity and it indicates the diagnostic ability of the system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve shows that, the system can diagnose positive cases than negative cases of the CAD patients efficiently.CAD is no longer one of the deadliest diseases to developed nations but rather to developing countries like Nigeria. Therefore, CAD is a world phenomenon. In this study, a fuzzybased expert system for CAD diagnosis has been designed to complement health workers to diagnose CAD. The improved C4.5 data mining algorithm is used to transfer the human knowledge to the system's knowledge base instead of conventional techniques such as interviews, questionnaires, etc. The performance evaluation system was carried out, and the system has 94.55% accuracy, 95.35% sensitivity, and 95.00% specificity. This shows that system has both higher capability of detecting both healthy and unhealthy CAD patients and it can be relied upon.Ethical approval The ethical approval has been granted by Ministry of Health, Kano State -Nigeria.","Nigeria","abstract","2021-02-14",2

Co-epidemics: Have measures against COVID-19 helped to reduce Lassa fever cases in Nigeria?","Currently, the coronavirus disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus emerging from Wuhan, China has spread across 216 countries, areas or territories of the world as a pandemic with multiple devastating public health and socio-economic implications [1] . One of the public health implications of COVID-19 in West Africa and Nigeria in particular is the continuous Lassa fever epidemic that has recurred unabatedly in the last decades. This period of COVID-19 pandemic coincides with another Lassa fever epidemic comprising a further increase in cases. COVID-19 in Nigeria has reached 56,256 confirmed cases with 1,082 deaths nationwide and a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 1.9% [2] while Lassa fever reached 1078 confirmed cases with 225 deaths and 20.9% CFR [3] .Lassa fever is a severe and zoonotic viral haemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa virus, a singlestranded RNA virus belonging to the Arenaviridae family. Since its emergence in 1968 from Lassa, a town in north-eastern Nigeria, this virus has spread across Nigeria and the West Africa region causing severe outbreaks annually [4] . Human transmission of this virus occurs primarily through contact with contaminated excrements or body secretions of the virus natural reservoir, Mastomys natalensis (Multimammate rat) or secondarily through human-to-human transmission and hospital-acquired infection through contact with blood, secretions and excretions of infected persons [5] . Out of the 36 states in Nigeria, 27 including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are already affected with Lassa fever with the highest number of cases recurrently occurring during the dry season (November-April) [6] . Furthermore, about 300,000-500,000 Lassa fever cases occur annually in West Africa with over 5000 deaths [7] . Within the last decade, there has been a steady rise in the incidence of Lassa fever not only in Nigeria but the entire West African subregion.Together with other nations of the world, Nigeria is currently facing a COVID-19 epidemic, with the index case reported on 27 th February 2020 [2] . Annually, the incidence of Lassa fever tends to increase from the later months of the rainy season and then peaks between March to May. This recurrent temporal pattern associated with Lassa fever means that the COVID-19 epidemic began shortly before Lassa fever reached its seasonal peak in Nigeria thus resulting in COVID-19 and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Lassa fever co-epidemics [8] . During the epidemiological week 9 of 2020 when the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Nigeria, there was already an increase in the number of confirmed Lassa fever cases reportedly affecting 27 states, exceeding the number of cases reported in 2019 during the corresponding week [3] . The increased number of cases from the 2019 Lassa fever epidemic could have possibly resulted in a higher number of cases and the early rise of Lassa fever in 2020, with higher notifications than the average in the preceding year.Epidemiological data obtained from week 9 of 2020 showed Edo, Ondo and Taraba states are the epicenters of Lassa fever, having the highest number of cases (Figure 1 ; Table1). Although Edo and Ondo states are coincidentally among the states worse stricken with the COVID-19 epidemic in Nigeria, however, curiously, after epidemiological week 36 of 2020, there was a significant decrease in the number of Lassa fever cases ( Figure 1 . Table 3 ), coinciding with the implementation and intensification of the COVID-19 prevention and control measures both by the states and federal governments respectively. The decrease in Lassa fever cases in the abovementioned states became noticeable in late April 2020 ( Figure 1 ; Table3), the peak of recurrent Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria [3] .Long before the COVID-19 emergence, the WHO opined that due to weakened infection prevention and control (IPC) measures at the sub-national levels, Nigeria's capacity to effectively manage and control Lassa fever remains suboptimal [6] . However, to effectively mitigate the spread of COVID-19, strict implementation of COVID-19 control and prevention measures including social distancing, national lockdown, improved personal hygiene, avoidance of person-to-person contact, use of face masks, the prohibition of public transport and inter-states travels among others were implemented across the country [9] . The science of the relationship between the intensification, implementation and community adherence to COVID-19 IPC measures and the decrease in Lassa fever cases require further detailed epidemiological studies to fully comprehend such epidemiological relationships and dynamics.All countries of the world are presently battling against COVID-19. Therefore, the further epidemic of Lassa fever in Nigeria will pose tremendous challenges for the effective containment More importantly, the clinical similarities existing in the presentation of patients with COVID-19and Lassa fever including fever, headache, general weakness, malaise, sore throat and cough from the onset of both infections to pneumonia, breathing difficulty, diarrhoea, disorientation, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, tremor, seizures, coma and multiple organ dysfunction at the later or severe stage [5, 14, 15] complicate things further. While some clinical signs and symptoms in a case series scale may initially point to COVID-19 or Lassa fever, this predictive and initial clinical variability should not be misplaced for validly guaranteed laboratory diagnosis. In some instances, the initial clinical manifestation of COVID-19 presents as fever together with joint and muscle pains, and general weakness without respiratory symptoms [16] [17] [18] thus mimicking Lassa fever presentation. Therefore, patients reporting to hospitals must be properly examined and explored for both diseases.Given the abrupt change in the behavior of Lassa fever epidemiological data which is a digression from the annual recurrent trend with Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria, some major hypotheses can be urgently raised. The first and most obvious is the underreporting or undernotification of Lassa fever cases as we observed in our previous work [8] . This sudden decrease of Lassa fever cases could be attributable to the swift change in focus and disease surveillance by the government in mobilizing resources, agencies and personnel to urgently respond to COVID-19 emergence after the confirmation of the initial cases in Nigeria. These immediate steps taken by the governments at all levels could have led to delay or underreporting of Lassa fever cases both at the national and sub-national levels. Furthermore, since Lassa fever and COVID-19 share similar clinical features as such, most of the febrile Lassa fever cases might have overlapped with COVID-19 cases in health centers [5, 14] . Since these 2 viral infections have similar diagnoses including reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and other rapid serological detection assays, the possibility of misdiagnosis of these infections cannot be overemphasized. Pseudo-serologic laboratory resultsfor Lassa fever in COVID-19 patients and conversely could further have led to severe public health implications. Additionally, there is a need for health professionals to report suspected cases of both outbreaks pari passu. An emerging challenge within the Nigerian health care system is the proper understanding of the progression of the ""masked"" or ""underestimated"" Lassa fever epidemic with the simultaneous occurrence of ""overhyped"" COVID-19 epidemic.Another hypothesis is the reduction of Lassa fever morbidity as a result of the implementation of strict COVID-19 IPC measures including social distancing, national lockdown, improved personal hygiene, avoidance of person-to-person contact, use of face masks and prohibition of inter-states travels among others [9] . This could have helped to reduce Lassa fever true incidence in Nigeria hence mitigating the 2020 epidemic. Population movements, social interactions and personal hygiene are known to be major drivers for the sustenance of epidemics [19] . The recurrent Lassa fever outbreaks are often mediated by poor community hygiene which supports rodents' infestation of homes, inadequate personal hygiene, travels to epicenters and Lassa fever prone areas, contact with infected persons, and nosocomially, mostly involving health care workers [5] . The decrease in the incidence of Lassa fever after epidemiological week 36 of 2020 especially from states previously worse stricken may be attributed to decreased Lassa fever morbidity resulting from the COVID-19 IPC measures strictly implemented at the national and sub-national and community levels. The general adoption of these COVID-19 IPC measures across Nigeria may have significantly altered the epidemiological patterns of transmission of the Lassa fever virus hence reducing the number of cases. At the community and population levels, social distancing had been reported to greatly reduce pathogen transmission [20] . The social distancing scenario currently explored potentiates the opportunity of testing this hypothesis which may be used to improve Lassa fever IPC measures at the national, sub-national and community levels. However, in-depth studies during and after the COVID-19 epidemic are necessary to consider the impact of population mobility and interactions data and evolution of the frequencies of Lassa fever cases in Nigeria. From our previous epidemiological study assessing the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19 in Nigeria, 45.3% of the respondents held that prayer is also a potent measure for COVID-19 control and prevention [23] . In a similar study, Olapegba and colleagues [24] reported how the majority of the respondents maintained that prayer and religious beliefs could mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic in Nigeria. This agrees with the stern religious adherence and beliefs by the vast majority of the Nigerian population, making them resort to religious rituals and prayers without reporting suspected cases of disease or seeking medical attention. The observation and reports reinforced the hypothesis indicating a relationship between religious beliefs and the reduction of disease notification and/or reportage. This behavioral pattern noticed among the Nigerian population transcends beyond the COVID-19 epidemic but could be exhibited to other epidemics including the recurrent Lassa fever epidemics.Lassa fever endemic countries including Nigeria are at high risk of increasing cases of coinfection and prolonged co-epidemics so long as COVID-19 and Lassa viruses coexist and actively circulate within the population. Mitigating these viral diseases requires concerted and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f effective public health campaigns and strict implementation of IPC measures with the population eliminating Multimammate rats' infestation of homes, improved community and personal hygiene, use of face masks and the practice of social distancing. Nigerian health care systems should be organized to provide quality care including concurrent diagnoses of both COVID-19and Lassa fever to individuals suspected of having either of these diseases or febrile patients without unnecessary delays due to constraints emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic.None exist.

COVID-19 is highly contagious, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global health emergency on 30 January 2020 , and as a pandemic in 11th of March 2020 (WHO 2020; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019). The person-to-person transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 has estimated to be 1.2-2.2% (Lu and Shi 2020) . Since then, the infection has spread worldwide causing more than 15.6 million cases and 638 thousand deaths. Egypt Ministry of health stated the diagnoses of 90,413 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 4480 reported deaths, in July 2020 (WHO 2020; The Center for Systems Science and Engineering 2020). Symptoms of COVID-19 disease include, fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia and headaches . Although some reports suggest initially that SARS-CoV-2 infection in children appears to be uncommon, but pediatric cases started to be reported first in china and then Italy and worldwide, but with less infection rate (Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi 2020; Istituto Superiore di Sanità 2020).Person to person transmission is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) (Van Soremalen et al. 2020) . Negative attitudes and practices against new infectious diseases can exaggerate the epidemics which may finally result in pandemics (Alahdal et al. 2020) . Awareness, Attitude and practice have been studied in many previous epidemics such as swine influenza (Shilpa et al. 2014) , and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Alkot et al. 2016) . Public health measures include personal protective measures (hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette), environmental measures, physical distancing measures, and travel-related measures. Physical distancing measures apply to individuals (e.g. isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts) or to communities, specific segments of the population, or to the population as whole. These measures are used to combat the global pandemic of COVID-19 (Pan et al. 2020; WHO 2020) .Better awareness of the disease along with positive attitudes and practices towards it have shown to help contain the spread of the causative viruses. So, the aim of this study is to assess the level of awareness and attitude towards COVID-19 among a sample of Egyptian school children.The aim of this study is to assess the level of awareness and attitude towards COVID-19 among a sample of Egyptian school children.A cross sectional survey study, using a web-based questionnaire, it was carried for 15 days, from the 1st till the 15th of July 2020. The study recruited Egyptian school children, their age between 6 and 18 years, who agreed to participate in the study. The survey was conducted in Arabic languages and took about 15 min to be completed by the student himself or with the aid of his parents.The questionnaire was designed in accordance with previously published literature and the survey was pretested for validation designed by our team to collect data including, demographic information, and data measuring students' awareness and attitude towards COVID 19 (Abdelhafiz et al. 2020) .All test data was collected through online model by google form. Communication between the researchers and the participants was conducted if needed. The questionnaire consisted of 3 main domains; the first domain focuses on sociodemographic information such as age, education level, residence and gender of the participants. While the second domain was about the students' level of knowledge about the disease (30 items) which is subdivided into 3 subdomains (risk factors, clinical presentation and prevention precautions) each of them is 10 items. The third domain is about students' practice and it is consisted of 10 items. The possible responses were ""agree"", ""disagree"" and ""don't know"".Approval for the study was obtained from The Medical Research Ethical Committee of the National Research Center (NRC) (Registration no. 20-095). All the participants provided online written informed consent to participate in the study.The collected data was coded, tabulated, and statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software version 22.0, IBM Corp., Chicago, USA, 2013 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007.The answers of responders in each section were evaluated for being correct or false, hence we calculated the scores of each domain by counting the number of correctly answered question, then such number is divided by overall number of questions then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage of correctly answered questions (scores).Descriptive statistics was done for quantitative data as mean ± SD (standard deviation) for quantitative data, while it was done for qualitative data as number and percentage. Inferential analyses were done for quantitative variables using independent t-test. In qualitative data, inferential analyses were done using Chi square test and Fisher's Exact test for variables with small expected numbers. The level of significance was taken at P value < 0.050 is significant, otherwise is non-significant.This study was conducted on 708 students represent different areas in Egypt 378 male (53.4%), 330 females (46.5%); their age ranged between 6 and 18 years. 342 (48.3%) of them in primary school and 147 (20.8%) in preparatory school, 219 (30.9) in secondary school. Their school types have different categories Governmental (250 Student, 35.3%), Experimental (294 Student, 41.5%), private (60 Student, 8.5%), international (104 Student, 14.7%). Among the studied 708 cases, 576 (81.4%) were from urban areas, the remaining 132 (18.6%) were from non-urban areas. As shown in Table 1 All participants claimed that they had heard about COVID-19 except 2 students 0.3%. Regarding sources of information about COVID-19, Internet, media and medical staff were more frequent in urban students but the differences were significant only in internet sources, while family and friends were non-significantly more frequent in non-urban students.Description of knowledge level of studied cases and frequencies of correct answers are shown in Table 2 . Correct responses regarding risk knowledge (no. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10), and Risk score ≥ 50 were significantly more frequent in urban students. Risk score was significantly higher in urban students than in non-urban students.Clinical presentation knowledge score (the percentage of correctly answered questions in this domain) was non-significantly different between urban and non-urban students. However, correct responses for items (9,10) were significantly more frequent in urban students, while item no. 6 was significantly more frequent in non-urban students.Prevention knowledge score (the percentage of correctly answered questions in this domain) was significantly higher in urban students, correct responses for items 1,2,3,4, 5,7, and prevention score ≥ 50 were significantly more frequent in urban students.Healthy practice among the studied cases and according to residence is demonstrated in Table3. Correct responses for items no. 1, 6, 7, 9, 10 and healthy practice score ≥ 50 were significantly more frequent in urban students. Healthy practice score was non-significantly higher in urban students in urban students.COVID-19, is showing dramatic growth all over the world Since the middle of March in 2020. The principal causes of this wide spread of the disease include unawareness of the novel coronavirus, deficient capacity in detection, and delayed policy-making and implementing of appropriate prevention and control means through the early stages of the epidemic (Marzia et al. 2020) . The disease now is in the state of pandemic, with no specific medication and a prolonged vaccines development cycle (Paul and Katherine 2020) , efficient intervention procedures will play an important role, and all the world should cooperate to control the spread of the virus. Accordingly, it is necessary to explore the knowledge and practices of the society towards COVID-19 to initiate beneficial strategies (Zhao et al. 2020) .In this study, we investigated the awareness and precautions practices of school students from Egypt, towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering that, exploration of socioeconomic characteristics of the participant is required, to be utilized in guiding the mapping of awareness campaigns and to find out whether people's knowledge differed according to certain characteristics of the target populations, this study is shedding light on the difference of students' awareness according to their residence whether urban or non-urban.The majority of this study group were from urban residence (81.4%), that could be attributed to the weak internet services in non-urban areas, as this study is webbased. Moreover, internet sources of information about COVID-19, were used more frequent in urban students with a significant difference in comparison to non-urban. Whereas, the main source of information for non-urban students was their families. This finding is strongly supported by similar report regarding Egyptian adults in which the principal source of covid-19 information was found to be the internet and social media (Abdelhafiz et al. 2020) .The majority of the participants in this survey have overall good general knowledge regarding the risk of disease transmission, the common clinical presentations and the preventive measures. However, there were significant differences between urban and nonurban groups regarding several items in each category. Besides the significant higher prevention and risk knowledge scores in urban group. Nevertheless, less knowledge was found regarding some items such as the virus survival on metallic surfaces and presence of abdominal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea) as a part of the clinical manifestations. We also observed some false beliefs concerning the disease transmission from pets and via cooked food.In close agreement with this findings, a similar crosssectional survey study conducted on Egyptian adults reported a good knowledge about covid-19 and a positive § Fishers Exact test *Significant (< 0.050) et al. Bull Natl Res Cent (2021) 45:39 attitude regarding prevention practices. In addition, they found a lower levels of awareness associated with the rural residence and low socio-economic standard (Abdelhafiz et al. 2020) . Similarly, Hager et al. (2020) assessed the awareness of Egyptians and Nigerians adults towards COVID-19, they reported a satisfactory level of awareness, as well in more than 60% of the participants. On another aspect, hand hygiene and wearing of face masks were evidenced to be efficient in preventing the spread of the virus throughout the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Jefferson et al. 2009) . A Chinese study was conducted on primary school children to assess the status of hand hygiene and wearing of face mask amongst them. 42.05% of the primary school children performed a satisfactory practice of hand-washing, whereas 51.60% had a proper practice of mask wearing (Chen et al. 2020) .The prevention practices of the students in our study were very cautious, the mean practice score was 79.4 ± 20.9, with (92.5%) of respondents have ≥ 50 degrees, (93.9%) practiced hand washing directly when coming from outside, and (86%) followed the instructions of staying at home, while 67.8% reported their adherence to wearing face-mask when going outside home.These precautions practices could be attributed to the participants' good awareness of the disease regarding the infectivity of the virus. As several studies have proved the importance of awareness of people to control infection throughout epidemics and pandemics (Alahdal et al. 2020; Almutairi et al. 2015) . Improving the awareness towards pandemics, require governmental efforts to increase awareness among society, using diverse communications routes. In spite of the marked government efforts and the great media role in the health education about COVID-19 in our country still, societies with lower socioeconomic levels may need alternate channels for communication (Hoda 2016) .This study is web based so the poor internet services especially in rural areas of Egypt is considered a main limitation, in addition, young students may need the help of their parents, so people from poor and less educational background, face difficulty in participation, and their awareness level may differ from our findings. Therefore, the results of this study cannot be generalized to the whole Egyptian populations, however, the study provides an initial overview of the awareness level of school children about Covid-19, and indicates the importance of policies that target at risk populations, it also emphasizes the need for larger scale studies with more suitable routes of communications in urban areas.Most of the study participants of school students are knowledgeable of basic information, and have cautious preventive practices towards COVID-19, denoting the efficacy of the public health efforts. However, the study findings revealed lower level of awareness in non-urban areas, indicating a need to intensify the awareness program and address alternative channels to communicate with these populations. School Children especially in rural areas need suitable means to deliver information, it can be represented in the form of children friendly booklets, boosters, role modeling plays, demonstrative cartoon movies, and other routes preferred to children, so that they are improving awareness of data regarding COVID-19 to overcome gap of Knowledge.
