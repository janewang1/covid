This article assesses the prediction of a 'new normal' in relation to Australian public services, which employ 1.2 million staff (Burton, 2020) . The article draws on previous research that identified resistance to working from home in the public sector, and examines the responses of various jurisdictions to the national working from home directive. It questions the likelihood that widespread working from home will remain a reality for public servants into the future, and considers what this might mean for future working arrangements.Working from home can be beneficial for both employees and organisations due to the integration of work and caring responsibilities (Hyman, Scholarios, & Baldry, 2005) , increased productivity (Collins, 2005) , and increased employee engagement (Lee & Kim, 2018) . Although some flexible working practices such as part-time work have been widely adopted over the last several decades (Cassidy & Parsons, 2017) , employers have been more reluctant to facilitate working from home due to uncertain benefits, and pre-pandemic uptake was limited (ABS, 2019). Studies differ on the extent of increases to organisational performance and productivity (Bailey & Kurland, 2002; Collins, 2005; Martin & McDonnell, 2012) , and some question whether the gains outweigh losses due to difficulties in supervision and communication, employee isolation, and decreased commitment (Callier, 2012; Choi, 2018; de Vries, Tummers, & Bekkers, 2019) . Australian public services were early pioneers of working from home, evidenced by the creation of the 1994 Australian Public Service Interim Home-Based Work Award (Dixon, 2003) . Despite this initial commitment, acceptance and uptake has been patchy. In 2013, only 10% of Australian Public Service (APS) employees teleworked to some degree (APSC, undated). By 2019, over a third of executive level (i.e. more senior employees) and very senior managers worked from home to some extent (APSC, 2019). Fewer than 15% of lower level employees worked from home, highlighting that this was not standard practice for these employees (APSC, 2019). Throughout the pandemic, 57% of APS employees were reportedly working from home (Dingwall, 2020) .Research has found continued widespread resistance of managers to enable lower level employees to work from home (Williamson, Colley, Foley, & Cooper, 2018) . Interviews with almost 300 managers across four state jurisdictions found that uptake of working from home was constrained by unsupportive work cultures and attitudes, particularly managerial concerns about trust, productivity, and underperformance. Managers also cited inadequate technology and concerns about compliance with industrial instruments and work, health, and safety policies as reasons for not facilitating these arrangements. Before the pandemic, working from home in the public sector was not a standard working arrangement for most employees.The next section analyses how government employers responded to the sudden need for employees to work from home, finding evidence of continued resistance. It also considers the messaging emerging during the development of transitional arrangements as employees began to return to their usual workplace, in order to assess whether working from home will become 'the new normal'.On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus to be a pandemic. Public service jurisdictions began issuing advice to their agencies on how to enable employees to work from home. The timing across jurisdictions varied, with two jurisdictions moving quickly by mid-March (NSW Government, 2020; Queensland Government, 2020) but others not having policies until the end of March (ACT Government 2020, APSC, 2020a; Government of WA, 2020; NT Government, 2020; Tasmanian Government, 2020; Victorian Government, 2020) or early April (Government of South Australia) .Several jurisdictions adopted a soft human resource management approach that both supported employee health and wellbeing and recognised that this was not the usual working from home -rather, employees had been forced home and were trying to work amidst other constraints such as home schooling. Some jurisdictions ensured staff had enough leave, whether pandemic leave or uncapped carer's leave (Government of South Australia, 2020a; Queensland Government, 2020; Victorian Government, 2020) , whereas others such as the Australian Capital Territory Government (2020) stipulated that employees who could not undertake their whole job from home would not be required to take leave. Several jurisdictions showed particular attention to health and safety, with Victoria encouraging managers to manage fatigue levels (Eccles, 2020; Victorian Government, 2020) , and the Queensland government (2020) providing extensive online resources for managers and employees. The Victorian Government (2020) even provided some funding for home office consumables and utilities.Other jurisdictions were less generous. The NSW suggested that if employees who were working from home were caring for a family member and could not be fully productive, they should take leave. The Northern Territory Government (2020) was quite prescriptive, initially implementing working from home on a 'trial basis'. The Western Australian Government adopted a harder line and stipulated that employees with young children could not work from home, but could work 'less than full-time work hours' (Government of Western Australia, 2020) . This range of responses seemed less related to rates of COVID-19 infection across jurisdictions at the time, but rather indicated varying levels of acceptance or resistance to the practice of working from home.The timing and messaging of the transition out of the pandemic also indicated resistance. The Australian Government (2020) was first off the mark; however, advice appeared to be contradictory. On 8 May 2020, it released a 'roadmap' encouraging employees to continue to work from home, but on the same day also released advice to its own agency heads to plan to transition employees back into their usual workplaces (APSC, 2020b; Australian Government, 2020). Although decisions were to be made at agency level and subject to health and safety considerations, the clear intent was that APS employees should begin to return to their regular place of work. At the end of May, 3 weeks later, most other jurisdictions had not begun this return transition. Only South Australia had a clear policy on transitioning back, although adopted a different approach. This government focused on a staged return according to a 'hierarchy of need', based on factors including whether the employee was essential to service delivery, whether they wanted to return to the workplace, or were a vulnerable person. It also recognised that some employees may wish to continue working from home 'for the foreseeable future' (Government of South Australia, 2020b) . Other jurisdictions did not begin the transition until June 2020.So is working from home likely to become the 'new normal' in the public sector? Prior to the pandemic, there was evidence of considerable resistance to working from home from some managers who had concerns about technology, compliance with employment regulation, and employees' productivity and performance (Williamson et al., 2018) . Many of the technical barriers were swept away by the pandemic, leaving resistance based on institutional cultures and managerial attitudes.Researchers have stated that to mitigate resistance to change, organisations should plan for the change, create a climate of trust, and encourage employee participation (Bailey & Raelin, 2015) . The rapidity of the pandemic meant that few of these factors to counter resistance were in place, magnifying the crisis for both managers and employees. Once the immediate crisis has passed, factors contributing to resistance may re-emerge, based on past behaviour and norms. The public sector is path dependent, and researchers have found that flexible working arrangements have been gained incrementally. They suggest a 'radical' approach is needed to enshrine flexible working arrangements (Lewis & Campbell, 2007) . Because the pandemic is endogenous to the public sector, it may not be the catalyst that will deliver long-term changes in working arrangements.The continued take-up and normalisation of working from home will vary across and within jurisdictions, due to the institutional arrangements for public sector human resource management. New public management reforms have changed the role of central personnel institutions, as public service boards seeking standardisation were replaced with more facilitative institutions, such as public service commissions, that provide a central policy framework for agencies to operationalise (Colley, 2016; Hood, 2000; O'Donnell, O'Brien, & Junor, 2011) . This decentralisation and agency discretion leads to policy differences between agencies, as well as considerable difference on implementation within each agency, although 2018 research identified a common theme or culture of resistance regardless of the type of policy. The recent history of managerial discretion and the resulting resistance and patchy take-up rates for flexible working arrangements (Williamson et al., 2018; Williamson, Colley, & Foley, 2019) , together with the reluctance exhibited during the pandemic, makes continued reluctance likely.A great deal of excitement is being generated that the pandemic is fundamentally changing how we live and work, with predictions that working from home will become 'the new normal'. Based on past practice, however, we question the extent to which large numbers of public sector employees will continue to work from home. For the APS, which was slower to implement working from home during the pandemic and the first to plan the return transition, resistance may continue. Other jurisdictions may be more likely to continue to enable employees to work from home post-pandemic. Although many public servants have client-facing roles, the pandemic provided opportunities to be creative about other forms of service delivery, from online teaching to call centre work undertaken from home. Our future research will review the working from home experience across jurisdictions during the pandemic, at the end of 2020 (hopefully post-pandemic) and in 2 years to identify the extent to which practice has changed.

Optimisation of 121 coupling procedures for non-magnetic and magnetic beads were done separately, due to the larger size 122 of the magnetic beads generally requiring more protein (see Results). To be able to measure all plasma 123 samples at the same dilution, we optimized all protein concentrations by generating a log-linear 124 standard curve with a positive control plasma pool from immune PNG donors (high responders to 125 Plasmodium antigens).Coupling of P. vivax proteins to non-magnetic beads was performed as previously described [10] .Briefly, the optimised antigen concentration (Tables 1 and 2 ) was coupled to 2.5x10 6 pre-activated 129 microspheres, in 100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, using 50mg/ml sulfo-NHS and 130 50 mg/ml of EDC to cross-link the proteins to the beads.

The same correlation analysis was then performed on 272 data converted in R using the standard curves (to account for any plate-plate variation). Strong 273 correlation coefficients were observed for all 12 proteins, including PVX_094255 (r 2 values >0.51, 274 p<0.0001) ( Table 3 , scatter plots in Figure S2 ). For the majority of proteins, the correlation was stronger 275 after conversion (Table 3) . This is expected given the conversion, based on the standard curve 276 generated with a plasma pool from immune PNG donors, is used to account for any plate-plate 277 variation.These results indicate that data generated using this multiplexed assay are highly reproducible in a vivax. Importantly, we also assessed the stability of the coupled beads by running the standard curve 284 10 times over a period of 9 months (intensely for 2 months) ( Figure S3 ). For most proteins the coupled 285 beads were highly stable (11/16 tested over 9-months), with the MFI dropping for three proteins and 286 increasing for two proteins. This is supported by previous research that has indicated the stability of 287 protein-coupled beads [13] , noting that the stability may vary by antigen [15].

Despite established karyopherin interaction, the 23 nuclear trafficking profile of VP24 has not been investigated. We find that VP24 becomes 24 strongly nuclear following overexpression of karyopherin or inhibition of nuclear export 25 pathways. Molecular mapping indicates that cytoplasmic localisation of VP24 depends on a 26 CRM1-dependent nuclear export sequence at the VP24 C-terminus. Nuclear export is not 27 required for STAT1 antagonism, consistent with competitive karyopherin binding being the 28 principal antagonistic mechanism while export mediates return of nuclear VP24 to the 29 cytoplasm for replication functions. Thus, nuclear export of VP24 might provide novel targets 30 for antiviral approaches. HEK293T cells ( Figure S1 ). Thus, GFP-VP24 can localise into the nucleus in complexes with 149 K1, indicating that cytoplasmic localisation, which is required for roles in nucleocapsid 150 assembly/condensation (4, 5, 7), derives from active nuclear export. can diffuse through the NPC and lacks NLSs or NESs, was diffusely localised between the dependent NESs ( Figure 2A , Figure S2A ). Importantly, the Fn/c for GFP-VP241-251 in LMB-169 treated cells was higher than that for GFP alone ( Figure 2C ), indicative of accumulation. Thus, 170 VP24 localisation appears to be dynamic, involving nuclear entry and rapid nuclear export via 171 CRM1 interaction. 172To determine which of the predicted NESs is/are responsible for nuclear export, we generated 175 constructs to express truncated VP24 proteins comprising N-terminal (VP241-88), central 176 (VP2489-172) and C-terminal (VP24173-251) portions fused to GFP; each of these contained one 177 or more of the potential NESs ( Figure 2A ). The truncated proteins were designed to be of 178 similar length and to avoid disruption of key structural elements (e.g. alpha helices and beta 179 sheets), based on the VP24 crystal structure (20). All proteins were predominantly cytoplasmic 180 at steady state ( Figure 2B ). Localisation of the N-terminal fragment was largely unaffected by 181 LMB treatment, and LMB produced only a small (≤ 1.4 fold) increase for the Fn/c of the central 182 fragment ( Figure 2B ,C). In contrast, a consistent and substantial increase (> 2 fold) in the Fn/c 183 for the C-terminal fragment was observed following LMB treatment. VP24173-251 also displayed 184 a consistently reduced Fn/c at steady state compared with the other truncated proteins. Thus, it 185 appeared that prominent discrete CRM1-dependent NES activity is located in the C-terminal 186 region of VP24. 187 9 Notably, only full-length VP24 displayed accumulation into the nucleus following LMB 189 treatment, with all truncated proteins remaining significantly less nuclear than GFP alone. This 190 suggests that the full protein sequence is required for efficient nuclear accumulation, such that 191 truncations remove key sequences or otherwise impact conformation to affect important 192 interactions. The crystal structure of VP24 bound to K5 indicates that three regions contact 193 the K (CL1 and CL2/3, separated by 40-60 residues, Figure 2A induced only a small increase in Fn/c for GFP-UL44NLS-VP2489-172 ( Figure 3A ,B), suggestive 209 of cytoplasmic retention or nuclear export mediated largely via an alternative mechanism to 210 CRM1-dependent export. However, LMB induced substantial nuclear localisation of GFP-211 UL44NLS-VP24173-251 (> 4.6 fold increase in Fn/c; Figure 3B ) that clearly exceeded nuclear 212 localisation of GFP-VP24173-251 ( Figure 2C ), consistent with a classical CRM1-dependent NES 213 counteracting the activity of the heterologous UL44 NLS. The Fn/c for GFP-VP2489-251 was 214 also markedly increased by LMB treatment but did not attain an Fn/c similar to that of full-215 required for efficient nuclear localisation. Nevertheless, these data clearly indicate that VP24 217 contains classical CRM1-dependent NES activity and that the principal NES is within VP24173-218 251.The C-terminal CRM1-dependent NES is the principal sequence mediating nuclear export of 221 VP24 222To confirm that the C-terminal NES is the major sequence driving CRM1-dependent export of 223 VP24, we used site-directed mutagenesis to disable the NES motif. Analysis of the VP24 C-224 terminal region identified residues 241-251 (comprising the C-terminal 11 residues) as 225 containing a sequence strongly conforming to a NES ( To further examine effects of altered VP24 nuclear trafficking on STAT1 responses, we 263 assessed nuclear import of STAT1 using CLSM analysis of COS7 cells expressing GFP-VP24 264 and immunostained for STAT1 following treatment without or with IFN- and/or LMB. In 265 agreement with results of the luciferase reporter assays, we observed that despite substantial 266 re-localisation of GFP-VP24 to the nucleus in LMB-treated cells, IFN--dependent STAT1 267 nuclear localisation remained clearly inhibited ( Figure S3 ). Together, these data indicate that 268 nuclear export of VP24 is not required for inhibition of STAT1 responses, consistent with K 269 binding representing the major antagonistic mechanism. Thus, it appears that active In this study we have shown that EBOV VP24 undergoes active trafficking between the nucleus 275 and cytoplasm involving CRM1-dependent nuclear export via a NES at the VP24 C-terminus. 276The acquisition of active nuclear trafficking sequences is consistent with a requirement for 277 highly regulated/dynamic localisation; furthermore, since VP24 is reported to oligomerise 278 (potentially as tetramers) (38), it is likely that active nuclear trafficking is required for transport 279 of VP24 multimers. The identified NES was not resolved in VP24 crystal structures (20, 47, 280 48) but localisation at the C-terminal end would be consistent with exposure and accessibility 281 to CRM1 (20), and the predominantly cytoplasmic localisation of GFP-VP24 in resting cells 282suggests that the NES is the dominant trafficking signal at steady state. Intriguingly, previous 283 studies indicated that a mutated VP24 protein defective for K-binding was more cytoplasmic 284 than WT protein (49). This would be consistent with karyopherin binding mediating import; 285 one might thus speculate that VP24 would require export mechanisms to enable cytoplasmic 286 localisation/functions. Our findings are the first to confirm this is the case. Notably, the EBOV 287 matrix protein VP40 has also been reported to localise to the nucleus in infected and transfected 288 cells (16, 50); however, a direct role for active trafficking pathways to regulate localisation, 289 distinct from mechanisms such as diffusion or interaction with other host factors, has not been 290 defined. Thus, our data provides, to our knowledge, the first direct demonstration of a filovirus 291 protein exploiting specific host trafficking machinery for nucleocytoplasmic transport, 292 identifying a new mechanism in infection by these highly lethal pathogens. 293 294 Although the nucleus is not directly involved in the replication processes of most RNA viruses, 295 proteins of a number of these viruses are reported to encode nuclear trafficking sequences, 296indicative of a requirement for dynamic regulation or specific accumulation in particular 297 compartments. For example, the RABV IFN antagonist P protein encodes several NLSs and 298NESs (32, 43, 51-53), with regulatory mechanisms including co-localisation or overlap of the 299 sequences, enabling co-regulation by mechanisms including phosphorylation (51-53). 300Although our data identify the C-terminal NES as a principal determinant of nucleocytoplasmic 301 localisation of full-length VP24, the differential localisation and LMB sensitivity of VP241-88 302 and VP2489-172, and the finding that VP2489-251 does not recapitulate nuclear accumulation of 303 full-length VP24, suggest the presence of alternative regulatory sequences/mechanisms, 304 potentially exposed by truncation. For example, VP24 is reported to associate with membranes 305 (38), which might result in tethering within the cytoplasm under certain conditions. 306Interestingly, a recent study reported that sumoylation of residue K14 of VP24 enhances K 307 binding and IFN antagonistic function (54). In contrast, ubiquitination, including at residue 308 K206 within CL3 (Figure 2A ), appears to negatively regulate IFN antagonist activity (54). 309Intriguingly, K14 is distal to CL1-3 but is within a predicted NES motif (Figure 2A) . Whether mechanisms will be of interest in defining the processes controlling immune evasion and 312 replication by EBOV. 313While some viral IFN antagonists use NESs to facilitate immune evasion, including through 315 mislocalisation of associated STATs (33, 34), VP24 uses a mechanism of competitive binding 316 to Ks. Our finding that VP24 nuclear export is not required for STAT antagonism is consistent 317 with this, and indicates that export relates to cytoplasmic roles including in nucleocapsid 318 assembly and transport (4-14). The requirement for efficient translocation out of the nucleus is 319 consistent with interaction of VP24 with K (see above), that underpins distinct functions in 320 immune evasion. This is further supported by our finding that the C-terminal NES motif is 321 conserved among VP24 of several filovirus species that have been shown to bind to Ks or 322 have conserved CL sequences (20, 26, 45), but not in MABV VP24 ( Figure 4E , Figure S2C Thus, targeting VP24 regulatory mechanisms, including its nuclear export, may provide novel 353 targets for anti-EBOV drug design. 354 355The construct to express the minimal NLS from human cytomegalovirus UL44 protein 358 (residues 425-433) fused to GFP was generated by subcloning from pEPI-GFP-UL44425-433 (42, 359 43) into the pEGFP-C1 vector C-terminal to GFP (Clontech).

This will help in reducing costs to the economy over the long term and bringing harmony to the society. Especially, early detection helps in placing strategies and resources for an appropriate and efficient response. On social media, people discuss things that they observe in community [2] They leave traces of their emotions via text expressions [9] . A systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of social media data can give insight into an outbreak. Twitter is one of the most popular micro-blogging social media websites where users express their thoughts and opinions on real-world events [7] . Social scientists have used tweet datasets for various purposes such as investigating public opinion of Hurricane Irene [15] and election result prediction [20] .Recently, the spatio-temporal texts collected from Sina-Weibo (Twitter alike microblogging system in China) was analysed to understand public opinions on COVID19 related topics [10] . The static topic modelling technique (LDA) and Random Forest classifier were used to group tweets into topics for analysis. Studies have also been published to analyse climate change-related tweets and understand what are the topics of discussion, how the tweet volume and sentiment changed over time [1, 3, 7] . Authors in [13] applied topic modelling on a corpus of geotagged tweets collected from the London sphere. Topic modelling has also been used to estimate the similarity between users in a location-based social network [14] and to estimate the relatedness of businesses based on business descriptions [19] .In this paper, we analyse a large Spatio-temporal tweet dataset of the Australian sphere Twitter 1 containing certain keywords relating to COVID19. The methodology included a volume analysis, Dynamic Topic Modelling [5] , Sentiment Detection [16] , and Semantic Brand Score (SBS) [8] to obtain an insight into COVID19 outbreak in different states and cities of Australia over the time.The obtained insights are compared with independently observed phenomena such as government reported instances and news on newspapers. To our knowledge, ours is a first in-depth study of understanding Australian people's perception of this ongoing COVID19 pandemic using a large Twitter data collection. More specifically, this study makes the following main contributions. (a) Investigates how closely the insights into local outbreak match independently observed phenomena in space and time. (b) Understands what topics related to COVID19 have been discussed in communities and how they change over time. (c) Understands the COVID19 related sentiments in communities over time. (d) Investigates the impact of COVID19 related concepts or words on 1 Location of author or tweet or a location mentioned in the tweet is Australia or any of its cities arXiv:2008.12435v1 [cs.SI] 28 Aug 2020 The aim of this study is to use social media analysis to uncover what is happening in communities and to give insight into (a) how the virus and lockdown is affecting community emotions, (2) understand the main topics or themes emerging and evolving in the conversation and (3) impact of different COVID19 related concepts.In this study, we conduct spatio-temporal analysis of volume, sentiment, topic, and impact to a large volume of COVID19 related tweets from the Australian sphere. First, we collect a dataset of tweets from the Australian sphere containing geospatial and temporal values. The dataset is then preprocessed and prepared for volume analysis, sentiment analysis, dynamic topic modelling, and impact analysis. The volume analysis aims to identify basic geospatial and temporal facts from the dataset which will facilitate subsequent analysis such as sentiment and topic into context. Dynamic topic modelling extracts topics present in the dataset and shows how those topics evolve over time. Sentiment analysis determines the sentiment of every tweet to show how community sentiments change over time. Impact analysis generates networks of concepts or words from the text collection and uses those networks to measure how differently the concepts or words impact a discussion. The analytical findings are then discussed and evaluated along with the comparison with independent observations.As we practice social distancing, our embrace of social media gets only higher. The major social media platforms have emerged as critical information purveyors during the expanding pandemic. TwitterâĂŹs number of active users in the first three months of 2020 increased by 23% compared to the end of 2019, which is about 12 million more users.We collected Twitter conversation in the Australian Sphere on Coronavirus since November 27th when the first break out occurred in China. The data collection is done via the QUT facility of Digital Observatory 2 using the Twitter Stream Application Programming Interface (API). The dataset consists of 2.9 million tweets from 27 November 2019 to 7 April 2020. Every tweet in the dataset contains or uses as a hashtag at least one of the following keywords: coronavirus, covid19, covid-19, covid_19, coronovirusoutbreak, covid2019, covid, and coronaoutbreak.The body of each tweet, i.e. tweet message, is used for analysing sentiment, topics and impact. Location and time information of each tweet gives it spatio-temporal dimensions. The location information for each tweet comes from either of three sources based on their availability: (a) tweet location, i.e. the user was in when the tweet was posted; (b) user location, i.e. residence of the user; or (c) a location mentioned in the tweet message. The locations are mapped to capital cities, states, or the country Australia depending on how granular level location information could be extracted. The time information of each tweet comes from the time and day the tweet was posted. Table 1 shows a few examples.For preprocessing, we removed stopwords, punctuations, invalid characters. We dropped any non English tweets. We fixed repeating characters, converted text to lowercase, replaced an occurrence of link or URL with a token namely xurl, and stemmed the text. We used Named-entity Recognition (NER) technique from spacy 3 to extract locations.For sentiment analysis, we collected the sentiment140 dataset 4 from kaggle. This dataset contains 1.6 million annotated tweets. The tweets are annotated for classes of sentiments: positive and negative. We train a classifier model using these tweets to detect sentiment in the collected dataset of 2.9 million tweets. We use the same preprocessing as above to prepare this dataset.Analysing the volume of tweets posted from a particular area at a particular time is an important step of data exploration that can provide interesting insights into observations [7] . We analysis the number of tweets posted in each state and capital in Australia over time.Sentiment analysis is used to identify the emotional state or opinion polarity in the samples. We identify the sentiment of each tweet using our proposed CNN based sentiment classifier. We then aggregate tweets by location and time to obtain spatio-temporal distribution of sentiments. The following section gives a summary of the proposed CNN architecture for sentiment classification. Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of CNN model used to identify sentiments of COVID19 related tweets. The model uses word embedding [4, 18] to represent each word w in an n-dimensional word vector w ∈ R n where the dimension n is empirically set to 200. We represent a tweet t with m words as a matrix t ∈ R m×n utilising word embedding. We apply the convolution operation to the tweet matrix with one stride.Each convolution operation applies a filter f i ∈ R h×n of size h. The convolution is a function c(f i , t) = r (f i · t k :k +h−1 ), where t k :k +h−1 is the kth vertical slice of the tweet matrix from position k to k + h − 1, f i is the given filter and r is a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function. The function c(f i , t) produces a feature c k similar to nGrams for each slice k, resulting in m − h + 1 features. We apply the max-pooling operation over these features and take the maximum value, i.e.ĉ i = max(c(f i , t)). Max-pooling captures the most important feature for each filter. Empirically, based on the Table 1 : Example of tweets in the dataset. Location is extracted, @someone and @something is used to anonymise a person or an organisation mentioned in the tweet, a token URL is used to replace any occurrence of hyperlink or URL. We then pass these features to a fully connected hidden layer with 256 perceptrons that use the ReLU activation function. This fully connected hidden layer learns the complex non-linear interactions between the features from the convolution layer and generates 256 higher-level new features. Finally, we pass these 256 higherlevel features to the output layer with a single perceptron that uses the sigmoid activation function. The perceptron in the output layer generates the probability of the tweet in our data collection being positive or negative sentiment.In this architecture ( Figure 2 ), a proportion of units are randomly dropped-out from each layer except the output. This is done to prevent the co-adaptation of units in a layer and to reduce overfitting. We set 50% units dropout in the input layer, the filters of size 3, and the fully connected hidden layer based on best empirical results. Only 20% units are set to dropout from the filters of sizes 4 and 5. Python code for this model is available online at https://github.com/mdabashar/sentiment_analysis.A variety of subjects or topics are usually discussed in the tweets over time. Knowing those topics and how they evolve is important to understand the dynamics of discussion related to coronavirus. Because of the large size of the tweet dataset, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to read all of the tweets for finding out their topics. We use an unsupervised machine learning technique known as topic modelling [5] to discover subjects topics of discussion in tweets and how those topics evolve over time. Topic models are the most popular statistical methods that analyse the words in a document collection to discover the themes that run through the documents, how those themes are connected, and how they change over time [5, 6] .In general, a topic modelling technique (e.g. Latent Dirichlet Allocation [6] ) uses word co-occurrences within documents for finding topics in a document collection. Words occurring in the same document are more likely coming from the same topics [6, 7] ; and documents that contain the same words are more likely consist of the same topics [6, 7] . We use each tweet as a document to discover topics in our tweet collection.Static topic modelling [6] explicitly treats words exchangeably and implicitly treats documents exchangeably [5] . However, the assumption of exchangeable documents is inappropriate for many collections such as tweets, news articles, and scholarly articles as they are evolving content. For example, tweets published in different time periods may be related to a specific topic namely coronavirus cure but the coronavirus cure can be much different in later stages of time than the early stage. The themes in a tweet collection evolve, and it is of interest to explicitly model the dynamics of the underlying topics.Dynamic topic modelling [5] extends static topic modelling [6] to incorporate topic evolution. Dynamic topic modelling can capture the evolution of topics in a sequentially organised collection of tweets or documents. In this setting, tweets are grouped by weeks, and each weekâĂŹs tweets arise from a set of topics that have evolved from the last weekâĂŹs topics. We use dynamic topic modelling to observe topics of discussion and how they change over time.Choosing a reasonable number of topics is important because too few topics could lead to merging distinct topics whereas too many topics could result in fragmented topics that otherwise could make a cohesive topic together. Therefore, we manually evaluated topic models with topics ranging from 5 to 50, to determine the optimal number of topics. Other hyperparameters are set to the default value in gensim (the Python software library used for topic modelling).To ensure that the topics discovered by dynamic topic modelling are meaningful and not dominated by the same top words, we removed keywords and hashtags (e.g. covid19, coronavirus, etc.) that we used for collecting our tweets. We also removed rare words (i.e. words with a very low frequency) to reduce noise in the topics.The Semantic Brand Score (SBS) estimates the impact or importance of concepts, brands, or entities in a text collection [8] . We use SBS to understand the impact of different COVID19 related concepts or entities on social media discussion.SBS is based on graph theory that combines methods of Social Network and Semantic Analysis using the word co-occurrence network. It is estimated as the standardised sum of three components: prevalence, diversity, and connectivity.Prevalence PREV (c) calculates the number of times a word or concept c is mentioned in a text collection. Prevalence is associated with the idea of brand awareness assuming that when a concept is frequently mentioned increases its recognition and recall for those who read it.Diversity DIV (c) of a word or concept c estimates the heterogeneity of concepts surrounding the concept c. It is the degree of centrality in the co-occurrence network. The degree of centrality is estimated by counting the number of edges directly connected to the concept node c.Connectivity CON (c) of a word or concept c estimates the connectivity of the concept c with respect to a general discourse. It represents the ability of the concept node c to act as a bridge between other nodes in the network. Connectivity is widely used in social network analysis as a measure of influence or control of information that goes beyond direct links. It is estimated aswhere d jk is the number of the shortest paths linking any two nodes j and k, and d jk (c) is the number of those shortest paths that contain the given concept node c.The Semantic Brand Score is estimated aswhere . represents the mean value and std represents the standard deviation.The temporal dimension (27 November 2019 to 7 April 2020) of the tweet collection is discredited by weeks (roughly 17 weeks) or days as appropriate to the nature of the analysis. The geospatial dimension is discredited by Australian Sates and capital cities. The tweet user location that does not list city but lists the country as Australia is categorised as Australia (au). The locations of a small portion of tweets could not be extracted or mapped to our selected categories that we categorise as others (oth). Figure 3 shows a word cloud generated from the entire tweet collection. It gives a quick look into the subjects Australian people are discussing during the COVID19 pandemic. Subjects such as 'stay home', 'work from home', 'toilet paper crisis' 'slow the spread' etc. are commonly discussed. Figure 4 shows the geospatial and temporal distribution of tweet count. The significant changes in tweet counts over the locations and weeks can be noted throughout the time period. For a closer Figure 5a shows the number of tweet counts in states, territories and capital cities in Australia. Figure 5b shows the actual number of COVID19 positive cases in states and territories in Australia. A strong correlation can be noted between tweet counts and COVID19 cases. The more the number of COVID19 cases in a location, the more the number of tweets there. For example, the highest number of COVID19 related tweets were observed in Sydney (syd) (i.e. the capital city of New South Wells (NSW)), where the highest number of COVID19 cases occurred in NSW. The second and the third-highest number of COVID19 related tweets were observed in Melbourne (mel) (i.e. the capital city of Victoria (VIC)) and VIC respectively, where the second-highest number of COVID19 cases occurred in VIC. The same is true for Queensland (QLD). Other cities follow a similar pattern with minor order variations. Figures 6a and  6b shows that the total number of COVID19 related tweets over time is strongly correlated with the number of new COVID19 positive cases by the notification date. Figure 6a shows that when COVID19 hit China on 27 November 2019, there were not many discussions held in Australian space. A noticeable number of coronavirus related tweets started to be posted after 60 days or around eight weeks, i.e. end of January. Next one week the number increased and then started to fall. The main burst of tweets started after another 30 days or 4 weeks, i.e. the end of February. This might be because this time several people in Australia from overseas were identified COVID19 positive. The number exponentially increased for the next 20 days and reached its peak by the third quarter of March. This exponential increase might have occurred because during this time many Australian were identified COVID19 positive and some of them were reported dead. Then it started to fall gradually. This might be because during this time government initiatives and strict social distancing worked and the COVID19 infection death rate started to decrease. The experimental performance comparison of the proposed CNN model and the pretrained language model ULMFiT [12] is given in Table 2 . ULMFiT is pretrained with Wikitext-103 that contains 28,595 preprocessed Wikipedia articles and 103 million words [17] . The model is then finetuned with 1.6 million tweets from the senti-ment1040 dataset without labels. Finally, we add an extra classifier layer at the end of the model and train the model with the 1.6 million tweets from the sentiment1040 dataset with labels. We use the same architecture, hyper parameters and training strategy for ULMFiT as described in [12] . We use 80%, 10%, and 10% split of data for training, validation, and testing respectively. Table 2 shows that the proposed CNN achieves similar performance as of ULMFiT. The performance of the CNN-based model shows that a carefully designed simple model can achieve a similar performance of a sophisticated model when a reasonably sized training dataset is available. The significance of this finding is that sophisticated pretrained language models, such as ULMFiT, are computationally expensive and memory intensive. Effectively using them becomes difficult for monitoring (i.e. classifying) a large tweet collection in a resource-constrained environment commonly available to practitioners. A simple model, such as our posed CNN, that achieves a similar performance can greatly help in this regard. The following results of sentiment analysis are based on the proposed CNN-based model. Figure 7 shows geospatial and temporal distribution of positive sentiment tweet counts vs total tweet counts for an overall observation. As soon as COVID19 hit the world, the positive sentiments dropped sharply (from roughly 85% to roughly 48% on average). The percentage stayed there for up to around 12 weeks. Then it gradually changed for three weeks with a very marginal increment. For the final two weeks, the increment was a bit more than the previous three weeks.A possible explanation of the trend can be explained as follows. As soon as COVID19 hit the world, the online community got shocked by the news. It took some time for world leaders to come up with plans on how to combat COVID19. During this period (12 weeks) people remained stressed. When the world leaders explained their combat plans and ideas, twitter users talked about those positive initiatives during this time period (three weeks). During the final two weeks, the Australian government announced social safety plans, e.g. economic aids to organisations, businesses, and individuals; it announced more strict rules for social distancing and the COVID19 infection curve started flattening. People started to become a bit comfortable and discussed these positive aspects in their tweets. Consequently, the number of positive tweets has increased. All these patterns show that by monitoring conversational dynamics on social media, we can identify how people are feeling during the pandemic of COVID19, and what initiatives are working or making people comfortable.For a closer look into the trend, the geospatial and temporal dimensions are decoupled in Figure 9 and 8 respectively. Figure  8 shows the volume of COVID19 related tweets (total volume), the volume of positive tweets related to COVID19 (positive volume), and their ratio (positive vs total ratio). This figure shows that, roughly at any time, among all the COVID19 related posts, only 50% of them were positive. We see two significant drops in the ratio of positive sentiments, one is at the beginning when the world was hit by COVID19 and the next one is by week seven or third quarter of January 2020. During this period there were not many discussions of COVID19 in Australia. However, the second drop triggered an increase in the number of COVID19 related posts. In other words, this second drop alerted the community about the upcoming danger of COVID19. We can assume that the small number of tweets related to COVID19 might come from the people who are Journalists, social workers, health care workers, or people who are conscious of health issues.During the period when a noticeable number of posts were related to COVID19 (week 8 to 18), there are two small drops in the ratio of positive sentiments. One is in week 10 and another is in week 14. Both falls are followed by a significant increase in the number of COVID19 related posts. Even though these two drops are small in sentiment ratio, but the drops in the number of positive tweets were large enough to initiate triggers. It ascertains that monitoring the positive sentiment tweets can signal us the trigger in the increase of COVID19 related posts. Figure 9a shows how the ratio of the number of positive tweets vs total tweets varies in Australian states and territories. It shows that all states and territories have the positive sentiment tweet ratio of around 0.5 except Northern Territory has a slightly better ratio. This implies there is emotional stress in people over all the states and territories. However, this figure does not clearly capture the positive sentiment drop as cities are averaged over in the states and territories. In reality, some cities are affected more than others by COVID19. Therefore, we add capital cities in Figure 5b along with states and territories. Figure 9b shows the counts of COVID19 related tweets and positives tweets in states, territories, and capital cities. Capital cities and states that have a significant drop in positive tweet count are Sydney (syd), Melbourne (mel), Victoria (vic), and Queensland (qld). A comparison between Figure 9b and Figure 5b shows that these locations had most of the COVID19 cases. A drop in positive sentiment is correlated with the number of COVID19 cases. A drop in positive sentiment is also correlated with early mental health issues, informing that the community might need an allocation of mental health care resources in the near future.Two interesting facts in Figure 9b can be observed in varied behaviour between two pairs of state and its capital city, (qld, bne) and (nsw, syd) pairs. There is a significant drop in positive tweets in qld but not in bne. The majority of COVID19 cases in Queensland happened in Gold Coast and other surrounding areas instead of Brisbane. Again, there is a significant drop in positive tweet count in syd but not in nsw. The majority of COVID19 cases happened in Sydney rather than the other parts of nsw. This again emphasises that a drop in positive sentiment is directly correlated with the number of COVID19 cases. This section shows some of the experimental results on how COVID19 related topics changed over time semantically, morphologically and sentimentally. Figure 10 shows the evolution of five topics; Topic 0: controlling the spread, Topic 1: staying in isolation and working from home, Topic 2: COVID19 cases, Topic 3: racism against the Chinese community, and Topic 4: impact of COVID19 outbreak worldwide.Topics 0, 2 and 4 show a similar trend even though their magnitude and change rate are different. A close investigation shows that these three topics share a high similarity of subject matters. On the other hand Topics 3 and 1 do not resemble any trend. However, they somewhat inversely following each other. It is apparent that all the topics evolved over time in terms of semantics, morphology and sentiment. For example, in Topic 0 that talks about controlling the spread of coronavirus, the words 'need' and 'worker' newly emerged during weeks 11 and 13, whereas the words 'island', 'china', 'travel' and 'ban' lost their significance during week 12, 15, 16 and 17 respectively. Semantic Brand Score (SBS) can capture the impact of concepts or words in text collections that might be useful for monitoring social matters or instances. During the COVID19 pandemic, some social instances were 'stay home', 'positive cases', 'slow the spread', 'wash your hands', 'toilet paper', and 'China'. Figure 11a shows the change of SBS over time for some of the words on these instances. This figure shows that china had the highest SBS score most of the time when compared with other words. A discussion of this SBS is given below. The second highest SBS is counted for the word 'case' (i.e. positive cases). This might be because people were discussing COVID19 positive cases and their implications on health, economy and jobs. Word 'hand' (i.e. wash your hands) had a stable SBS score through the time except for a spike in week 15. Word 'toilet' (i.e. toilet paper) had low SBS but a spike in week 15 when there were some toilet paper related instances in Australia (e.g. toilet paper sold our in most of the stores, people fighting over buying toilet papers, etc.). Figure 11b shows how the SBS score varied in space and time for the word China. In a certain period and some places the word China had high SBS in COVID19 related tweets. This means, China was mentioned in a lot of tweets, in a variety of topics, and a lot of topic of discussion involved the word China. One reason may be many tweets discussed the first detection of COVID19 in China. However, a high SBS also indicates that many diverse topics were influenced by the word China; and many topics (i.e. intense) were discussed in relation to the word China. This might have been influenced by the wrong assumption that China is responsible for the spreading of coronavirus as coronavirus was first detected in China. This kind of assumption can disrupt social harmony. As SBS can identify such incidence in space and time, it can be used for positive intervention such as providing a right information to communities and providing necessary security to the vulnerable community. This research shows that social media data analysis is a powerful method for observing social phenomena relevant to an outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID19. Collecting data through traditional surveys and clinical reports are time consuming and costly, and can have a time lag of few weeks between the time of medical diagnosis and the time when the data become available. Unlike traditional methods, social media data analysis is time and cost-effective that can uncover momentum and spontaneity in conversations. Besides, it can be done systematically and can be generalised a wide range of objectives. This study analysed the discussion dynamics of COVID19 on Twitter from geospatial and temporal context using various methods. The analysis methods were found effective in capturing interesting insights and directly correlated with real-world events.The overall coronavirus related discussion on Twitter represent negative aspects. People were concerned about jobs, economy, and isolation in addition to health and safety. However, initiatives such as government subsidies had a positive influence on the discussion. For example, there were changes in published tweets and negative sentiments when the new coronavirus cases were found or deaths occurred. The peaks in positive sentiment occurred during positive initiatives taken by leaders or any positive development in the health care sector. When the spread of new cases started to decline, the number of coronavirus related posts declined and the positive sentiment increased. Our observations show how social media platforms can influence the publicâĂŹs risk perception, their hope and reliance on different organisational initiatives. Even it can change real-world behaviour that can have an impact on control measures enacted to mitigate an outbreak.Dynamic topic modelling discovered a wide variety of topics in discussion, covering consequences, initiatives, impacts and peoples' behaviour with coronavirus. These topics evolved and their significance changed over time. Topic analysis provides an understanding of community discussion of COVID19 with a reasonable objectivity, precision and generality. We found that most of the COVID19 related discussion has a high concentration around a relatively small number of influential topics. For example, at the beginning most discussion was related to COVID19 outbreak in China, then the COVID19 cases in Australia and health care, then stay home and job loss. Topic modelling uncovered racism instances and SBS identified the impact in discussion. For example, our analysis showed that COVID19 pandemic created fear and that fear leaded for racism to thrive that disproportionately affecting marginalised groups.The findings can help government, emergency agencies, clinicians, health practitioners and caregivers to better utilise social media to understand the public opinion, sentiments, social and mental health issues related to COVID19. Such an understanding will enable proactive decision making for prioritising supports in geo-spatial locations. For example, timely disseminating and updating information related to social issues by the government can contribute to stabilising social harmony.Advanced analysis of social media data related a pandemic such as COVID19 is critical to protect public health, maintain social harmony and save lives. By leveraging anonymised and aggregated geo-spatial and temporal data from social media, institutions and organizations can get insights into community discussion to understand and act based on how COVID19 spread is affecting people's lives and behaviour. Specifically, the government and emergency agencies can use the insight to better understand the public opinion and sentiments to accelerate emergency responses and support post-pandemic management.","Australia","abstract","2020-08-28",8

In information retrieval and natural language processing, efforts have concentrated on building datasets and tools for efficiently managing the growing literature on COVID-19, historical coronaviruses, and other related diseases (Hutson, 2020) . One of the main stimuli for the creation of new technology was the release of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) , a regularly updated collection of coronavirus-related publications and preprints. But while many tools have emerged for the purposes of article retrieval and question answering, 1 relatively less work has been devoted to designing systems that go beyond returning a list of (relevant) documents, and that attempt to leverage domain knowledge to organise and present information found within the literature. With our work, we aim to fill this gap by making available a web application that combines a search 1 A non-exhaustive list: cord19.vespa.ai, discovid.ai, covidex.ai engine for COVID-19-related literature with different visualisation techniques, that make it easy to see and explore salient topics, concepts and concept relations in the documents.We build on observations about the relevance of exploratory search, and the need to combine learning and investigation with direct retrieval for information seeking (Marchionini, 2006) , specifically designing a tool to support the health information seeking behaviour observed by Pang et al. (2015) of alternating between exploratory and focused search. We further draw on the insights from research in information visualisation that demonstrate the value of multiple coordinated views of documents, with a specific emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities (Stasko et al., 2008; Görg et al., 2010) .We designed our tool to support medical experts and other researchers by way of literature discovery. A typical usage scenario in COVID-SEE begins with a textual query over CORD-19, providing the researcher with: (i) a list of retrieved documents, and (ii) a visualisation dashboard. The user can then select the documents of interest and save them into a briefcase for later use. Once the user has populated the briefcase with relevant articles, it is possible to set the briefcase as the current active collection, and further explore those articles.In both the retrieval and visualisation components, we adopt several well-established NLP techniques. Article retrieval is powered by an existing neural search engine specifically developed for the CORD-19 dataset (Zhang et al., 2020) . The results are shown as a list of document hits with metadata about the articles. Separately, the dashboard represents the current active collection with three distinct interactive views. The first is a relational concept view in which we employ Sankey diagrams to organise the medical concepts found in the articles according to broad, clinically-relevant PICO categories (Richardson et al., 1995) , such as population, intervention and outcome. In this view, more salient relations carry more weight, and once a relation is clicked, the corresponding articles are revealed. We use an example based on the query incubation period of COVID-19 to illustrate this functionality (Fig. 1) . The second, topic view ( Fig. 3) , is more thematic and shows representative topics for the current collection. For this component, we trained a global topic model on medical concepts extracted from CORD-19. Our third component is a concept cloud view (Fig. 4) , showing the most salient concepts for each active document.3 System overview 3.1 Information retrieval After submitting a query, a list of retrieved documents is shown. Each document entry can be expanded to display the entirety of the abstract as well as metadata (authors, journal, source, year, license). The user can also filter by criteria such as year and source. Articles can be selected and added to the user's briefcase. This briefcase represents the set of documents that the user wishes to keep track of, and can be visualised, versioned, and exported.We make use of an existing information retrieval system for the CORD-19 dataset, available at covidex.ai (Zhang et al., 2020) . This provides us with a well-performing retrieval system-by our analysis, in the top 30% of submissions to the TREC-COVID shared task (Roberts et al., 2020) . Given a collection of retrieved documents, the user can directly proceed to the dashboard to explore the collection. A key view over the collection is via a Sankey diagram frame, which organises the identified medical concepts into PICO categories (Population, Intervention/Comparator, Outcome), and shows how they interact. The diagram displays relations between pairs of medical concepts, where the strength of a relation corresponds to the number of supporting abstracts in which that concept pair is attested. To obtain the PICO concepts, we follow a two-step procedure, as described below. dataset (Nye et al., 2018) , which contains ∼5,000 MEDLINE 3 abstracts of reports of randomised clinical trials annotated with textual spans that describe the PICO elements. As pretrained word representations for the model, we use 200-dimensional word2vec embeddings induced on PubMed abstracts and MEDLINE articles (Hakala et al., 2016) . We observe a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.69 on the EBM-NLP test set, and report the full results in Table 1 ; these are comparable to those reported in Nye et al. (2018) . For our purposes, getting the textual span exactly correct is less important, as our final representations are not the snippets but the medical concepts that occur inside them. The PICO identification step is applied to all abstracts of the CORD-19 dataset. Recognition of PICO concepts In this step, we recognise medical concepts that occur within the identified PICO spans. This is part of a larger concept recognition procedure that we describe in more detail in Section 3.3. Here, we take the terms corresponding to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), 4 which is a structured vocabulary maintained by the National Library of Medicine. We use MeSH due to its transparent hierarchical structure, making it easy to control term granularity. Additionally, it is also an established way to represent keywords found in medical articles indexed by PubMed. A few examples of extracted PICO concepts are shown in Table 2 .Establishing relations The output of the previous two steps is the extracted MeSH terms for each article, typed by their respective PICO category. In the Sankey diagram, we then display pairwise relations between Population-Intervention and Intervention-Outcome concepts. Two concepts are related when they are found in the same abstract. We also include the strength of the connection, corresponding to the absolute frequency of that concept pair in the entire dataset. The user can select a concept relation link of interest, browse the relevant articles containing that relation, and save them to the briefcase for further exploration. The rendering of the diagram is dynamic. This means that whenever a document collection selected by the user changes, the diagram is updated. In addition, the Sankey view is interactive, allowing the user to click on any relation to highlight the relevant part of the diagram and show the supporting documents. A planned future release of our tool will support semantic search, which will enable the use of PICO-typed MeSH terms as search criteria.To allow for more conceptual representation of the documents, we transform them into an unordered set of Unified Medical Language System 4 ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh (UMLS: Lindberg et al. (1993) ) concepts. These concepts are extracted using MetaMap 5 from the document's abstract, or, if it is absent, from the first two paragraphs. This choice of representation is motivated as follows: (1) it avoids splitting multi-word concepts (such as degenerative disease of the central nervous system) into less meaningful units (of , the, central, etc.), as would happen in the case of token-based representation; and (2) it maps different lexico-grammatical variations of a given term into a single concept, thus reducing noise in the data, and highlighting important keywords. For example, concept C0000731 occurs in the articles as abdominal distension, abdominal distention, bloating, distended abdomens, swelling of abdomen, etc., which would not be captured by typical approaches to text normalisation such as lemmatisation, stemming, or n-gram overlap. We represent each MetaMap-disambiguated concept by the lexicalisation that occurs most frequently in the document collection, as distinct from the MetaMap ""preferred term"", which is often a technical description rather than its lexical form (e.g. we use colon instead of preferred term Colon structure (body structure)). As the last step, we remove stopwords based on PubMed's stopword list 6 and the 100 most frequent tokens in the dataset. The resulting representation (Table 3) forms the foundation of the remaining analysis and visualisations.To enable document exploration based on common semantic themes, we provide a topic modelling view. We use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) to learn topics over the whole dataset, and represent the topic mixtures for a given subset of articles (based on the briefcase) as a 2dimensional map using principal component analysis (PCA) via the pyLDAvis package. 7 LDA represents each document as a mixture of topics, and each topic as a mixture of words. We choose the 5 metamap.nlm.nih.gov 6 ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/ porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) causes severe diarrhea and vomiting in affected piglets. the aim of this study was to establish the basic, in vitro characteristics of the life cycle such as replication kinetics, cellular ultrastructure, virion morphology, and induction of autophagy of pdcov.C4038448 C1314792 C1443924 C0042963 C0392760 C2948600 C0557651 C0040363 C0443211 C1527178 C2827718 C1521970 C0023675 C0598312 C0022702 C0007634 C0041623 C0042760 C0332437 C0857127 C0004391porcine deltacoronavirus, causes, severe diarrhea, vomiting, affected, aim, study, to, establish, based, in vitro, characteristics, life cycle, replication, kinetics, cells, ultrastructural, virion, morphology, induction, autophagy Final terms porcine deltacoronavirus, causes, severe diarrhea, vomiting, affected, aim, establish, in vitro, characteristics, life cycle, replication, kinetics, ultrastructural, virion, morphology, induction, autophagy (20) based on the C v topic coherence measure (Röder et al., 2015) . After learning the topic distribution for the whole dataset, we display only those topics which are representative of the selected subset, that is, ones for which the average weight across the selected documents is over a threshold t, which we set to 0.05. Thus, the topic selection is dynamic for each set of selected documents.For each of the documents in the user's briefcase, we display a wordcloud 8 containing the 20 most representative concepts. We regard each of the articles in the briefcase as a target corpus, and the remainder of the articles in the briefcase as a background corpus, and compare concept distributions using the log-likehood test (Rayson and Garside, 2000) . This highlights concepts that differentiate a particular document from others in the briefcase, even if they discuss similar topics and have the same set of frequent terms. For instance, if the briefcase contains articles regarding mechanical ventilation and we choose one of them, 9 the top 10 concepts chosen by log-likelihood will be similar to 10 most frequent concepts, but with two visible differences (Table 4) : the log-likelihood results do not contain common terms as mechanical ventilation, frequently used in all documents in the briefcase; on the other hand, they include more document-specific concepts as ai (avian influenza)). Table 4 also shows how operating at the concept level captures multi-word terms such as mechanical ventilation and admitted to intensive care unit.8 github.com/chrisrzhou/react-wordcloud 9 pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18440440All data is stored in a graph database (neo4j 10 ). The front-end of our web application interacts with the database via the Cypher language and the py2neo 11 library. The website was built with React 12 and Flask 13 , and topic visualisations are supported by pyLDAVis 14 . Core analysis was done in Python.In the first months of the COVID-19 crisis, many tools were released to support literature exploration.We present here the systems that, like ours, focus on the visualisation of concepts and relations for retrieved documents, or that use concept information to guide search. We provide a summary of the existing tools and their functionalities in Table 5 . AllenAI's SciSight Faceted Search (Hope et al., 2020) 15 is a tool for exploring how authors and topics interact over time. The user can select the desired topics from different PICO-like categories, which act as a filter for the shown articles. It also provides a co-mentions view with chord diagrams, which displays associations between diseases and chemicals, or between proteins, genes and cells. This is conceptually similar to our goal of representing concept relations, but their diagram view does not support PICO.The identification of PICO elements in SciSight is based on DOC Search, 16 , where a user constructs a query by accepting auto-suggestions based on an ontology. The selected terms can be combined with a variety of Boolean and ontological operators. The user can then use the data visualisations to further narrow down the search results. DOC -cov, airborne, mechanical ventilation, people, countries, killed, required, medical, community, threat mechanical, airborne, ventilation, respiratory, people, countries, killed, required, intensive, care Loglikelihood epidemic, sars-cov, airborne, people, killed, community, threat, ai, countries, required, admitted to intensive care unit airborne, people, killed, infectious, diseases, caused, community, ai, will, countries COVID-19 LOVE 18 from the Epistemonikos project organises the literature according to study type (systematic reviews, broad syntheses, primary studies), as well as PICO categories and question types (e.g. diagnosis, prognosis), but is not based on automatic analysis or on the CORD collection, and does not provide visual exploration.Trialstreamer (Nye et al., 2020) finds and summarises new clinical trial publications, registrations, and preprints in both COVID-19-related and broader literature. PICO snippets of text are shown, together with the key findings and an indication of the risk of bias. Evidence maps link interventions to outcomes, and predict a trial's findings.Other systems include: NIH's LitCovid (Chen et al., 2020) 19 , which provides-based on human verification-categorisation of papers according to diagnosis, treatment, etc.; WellAI's tool 20 for concept search, enabling retrieval of documents via highly associated concepts; SemViz (Tu et al., 2020) , using a knowledge graph from Blender Lab 21 to create interaction plots and word clouds for chemicals, genes and diseases; and COVID Intelligent Search 22 , which offers filters for various medical categories (e.g. drugs, indication), and suggests textual extracts as queries. Le Bras et al. (2020) present work on coarse-to-fine exploration of literature based on hierarchical topic models, however not visualisation of arbitrary sets of articles. Ahamed and Samad (2020) a graph from entity co-occurrences that enables centrality-based ranking of drugs, pathogens and biomolecules.COVID-SEE has been designed to facilitate more interactive exploration of the COVID-19 literature, through integration of sub-collection thematic analysis, document-level visual concept summaries, and PICO-structured concept relations. It does not currently support semantic search based on PICO-style queries; a natural extension would be to add this functionality utilising the PICO and UMLS concept pre-processing. A recommendation system for articles which have similar topic distributions could be added. In terms of visual representations, we will experiment with expanding beyond the MeSH term vocabulary to include more specific terminology, and use of the hierarchical relationships that exist between terms. Finally, we are planning a user study with medical professionals to evaluate the potential of COVID-SEE as a knowledge discovery tool.","Australia","first author","2020-08-18",8

Authors' reply","We acknowledge the concern outlined by Deniz et al in regard to the possible detrimental effect of pneumococcal vaccination on a patient with probable or co-existing COVID-19 due to the potential for progression to cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome and death as a result of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and consequent hyperinflammatory response. 1 Triggering the NLRP3 inflammasome by intracellular viral pathogens may lead to excessive production of IL-1β with potentially pathological consequences. 1 However, we wish to reiterate that our recommendations regarding pneumococcal vaccination for patients with IBD centre around optimising as many modifiable factors in patients who are likely to be, or due to be, immunocompromised. 2 This is especially important given that bacterial co-infection, includingStreptococcus pneumoniae, has been described in up to 50% of patients with COVID-19 and has been associated with significantly reduced survival. 3, 4 Patients with IBD are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. 5 Current recommendations for patients with chronic inflammatory diseases maintained on immunosuppressive medications state that inactivated vaccines should be administered to this population. 6 In regard to pneumococcal vaccine, PCV13 (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated) should be administered to patients with chronic inflammatory conditions being treated with immunosuppression. 6 PPSV23 (pneumococcal purified capsular polysaccharides) should be administered to patients with planned commencement of low-or high-level immunosuppression. 6 It is the shared responsibility of the specialist and primary care provider to ensure that appropriate vaccinations are administered to immunocompromised patients as per current guidelines. 6 The authors' declaration of personal and funding interests are unchanged from those in the original article. 2 ","Australia","first author","2020-08-14",8

Many suffering the resultant ""unknown pneumonia"" were initially admitted to Wuhan hospitals; the predominant symptoms included pyrexia, malaise, dry cough, and sore throat. A fraction of the patients reportedly suffered the complications which culminated in acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, or multiorgan failure, and death. By the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak as a public-health emergency and later, on March 11, declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. Interestingly, the Australian government had declared COVID-19 as a ""disease of pandemic potential"" on 21 January, 1 ahead of WHO. By May 12, 2020, confirmed cases worldwide 2 had totaled 4,277,720 with >50,000 new cases registered daily. Meanwhile, our understanding of the pathogenesis, prognosis, symptoms, and case-fatality rate of COVID-19 is still limited but growing fast. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic inevitably led to realistic, mandatory restrictive countermeasures in many countries, causing uncertainty for millions of people with resultant unprecedented effects on economy and morale-importantly livelihood and job losses-which will require many years to recuperate. Thus, eliminating the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the social fabric, morale, and psychosocial and economic wellbeing is critical. Developing prophylactic vaccines or antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 will perhaps require few years of research, testing, and clinical trials. 12 Some drugs (e.g., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) have been touted to be effective but have been shrouded with controversy. 13 Because respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, transmit from person to person by virally loaded aerosols, any effective measure to disrupt this transmission mode will reduce the chance of infection.Quarantine has historically been effective in mitigating and managing contagious epidemics. Thus, many countries have barred mass-gatherings and encouraged self-isolation, in-house quarantine, and study or work from home to lower the chance of viral transmission. More than 210 countries, except Sweden and partially the United Kingdom, had mandated such strict measures. Social and religious ceremonies have been barred or postponed. In Australia, for example, public gatherings were limited and distancing principles, including 1.5 m between individuals and 4 m 2 area per person, have been mandated if unrelated people come together. 14, 15 Further, sporting events have been cancelled orThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved postponed; for example, the Champions League has been cancelled, and the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games postponed. Scientific research, schooling, and universities have been profoundly affected in many countries. 16 The resultant economic and morale repercussions demand new solutions to fighting the pandemic and minimizing its negative impacts because the dynamic and evolving nature of the pandemic may hint that the counterstrategies may not be efficiently maintainable. Presuming that an effective drug or a preventive vaccine for COVID-19 is distant, one may ask, ""how long must the counterstrategies continue globally?"" We do not intend here to undermine the importance of developing antiviral drugs or vaccine projects, but to highlight the importance of public's behavioral, cultural, and habitual changes for the pandemic's duration and in the immediate future when some restrictions potentially gradually ease in some countries, e.g., Australia 17, 18 and New Zealand. 19 Upholding the strict quarantine/isolation rules, social distancing, respiratory and hand hygiene, and wearing the protective masks is important for the future. Physical distancing while keeping regular contacts with family members and friends will help with maintaining psychosocial wellbeing and morale. Physical distancing is needed during uncontrolled outbreaks, when contagion rate, the risk of an epidemic, and the case-fatality rates of confirmed cases are high. Though compliance may differ from culture to culture and nation to nation, the countermeasures are seemingly effective in reducing the viral spread from asymptomatic carriers or from patients to healthy individuals. For example, face-masking reportedly efficiently protects against SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 20 We admit that any recommendation in controlling the pandemic should be based on growing evidence experienced by different nations. We propose that the restrictive countermeasures should continue for at least 8-12 months until normal social activities can phase in. Even afterwards, the rules of social/physical distancing, frequent handwashing, respiratory hygiene, and face-masking will remain utterly critical.The compliance with such measures should be encouraged through public education and awareness campaigns to ensure such behavioral, habitual, and cultural changes into the future.","Australia","first author","2020-08-09",8

She was admitted to hospital and underwent a surgical revision of the fistula that evening.Despite her upper respiratory tract symptoms, the patient appeared well, was afebrile, and all her vital signs were within normal limits. She reported no epidemiological criteria for COVID-19, including no close contact with a confirmed case or recent travel, but received a nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 as part of theatre protocol.The next evening, she spiked a fever of 39.4 degrees Celsius and was commenced on intravenous Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for a community-acquired pneumonia. On day 2, whilst undergoing dialysis through her revised fistula, she had more fevers associated with rigors and complained of severe ""bone pain"". Her antibiotics were changed to intravenous Piperacillin-Tazobactam, Azithromycin and Vancomycin to cover for possible bacteraemia post-AVF revision. She was lymphopaenic at 0.4x10 9 /L (reference 1.0-3.5x10 9 /L), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 80mg/L (reference <5mg/L). Influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus PCR, urine atypical pneumonia screen, serial blood cultures and urine were unremarkable. Chest radiograph revealed mild left perihilar interstitial type opacity as well as left upper lobe opacity consistent with developing consolidation ( Figure 1A ). That evening, the patient became hypoxic, with oxygen saturations dropping to 89% on room air, febrile at 40.3 degrees Celsius, and hypotensive with a blood pressure (BP) of 87/50 mmHg (baseline systolic BP around 110mmHg). She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for inotropic support.Two SARS-COV2 PCR swabs returned positive and the patient clinically deteriorated rapidly requiring intubation on day 6 of admission, at which time nasogastric feeds were also commenced. Chest radiographs demonstrated rapid daily progression and increased volume of bilateral extensive consolidation with subpleural sparing, suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ( Figure 1B ). Around day 7 of admission, her CRP rose to 624mg/L (reference <5mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was >100mm/hr (reference 5-20mm/hr), interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was significantly elevated at 1959.7pg/mL (reference 0.0-149.0pg/mL), ferritin was 5293ng/ml (reference 30-500ng/ml), fibrinogen 7.8g/L (reference 2.0 -4.5 g/L) (Figure 2, Figure 3 ) and she desaturated to 73% on 100% supplemental oxygen at 40L/min with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15cmH2O. The clinical picture and investigation results were consistent with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the patient was critically ill.After a multi-disciplinary discussion involving the Renal, Haematology, Infectious Diseases and ICU teams, she was administered two doses of Tocilizumab 8mg/kg (450mg) intravenously 12 hours apart as well as Hydroxychloroquine 400mg BD. The latter was ceased 3 days later due to QTc prolongation (490ms). She was also commenced on Nitric Oxide up to 40ppm and prone positioning was used for 12-16 hours from day 8. At the peak of her inotropic supports, the patient required 30 microg/hr of Noradrenaline with 2.4units/hr of Vasopressin to aim for a mean arterial pressure of 65mmHg. While the initial target for fluid balance was negative 3L, this could not be achieved without further incrementing the inotropic requirement. Thus, the aim was changed to an even balance, but even this was proving challenging despite continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration.At 9 hours post the first Tocilizumab dose, the CRP had already fallen from 624mg/L to 576mg/L. Within 72 hours (day 11), the CRP fell to 72mg/L (Figure 3) , oxygenation improved to 96% with FiO2 30% and oxygen flow of 50L/min, and sedation was able to be weaned off. Inotropic supports were weaned off on day 18, and the patient was extubated. She was discharged from ICU to the ward on day 21, saturating at 99% on 2L of oxygen by nasal prongs. Other minor issues during the ICU admission included anaemia requiring intermittent blood transfusion in the setting of withheld erythropoietin stimulating agent, and the development of a Stage 1 heel pressure ulcer.On discharge to the ward, she required physiotherapy and alternate-daily haemodialysis with BP support using pre-dialysis Midodrine at 5mg and 20% concentrated albumin for fluid overload. The patient walked out of hospital 6 weeks post admission, and has had two negative COVID-19 PCR tests 8 weeks from her initial positive result.COVID-19 caused by SARS-COV2 has affected more than ten million cases with 500,000 deaths worldwide as of 4 July 2020 1 . While most patients experience mild respiratory illness, 15% present with moderate to severe pneumonia and 5% require intensive supports for critical illness 2 . A recent meta-analysis demonstrated chronic kidney disease to be associated with greater risk of severe COVID-19 infection 3 .While management is largely supportive, many disease-modifying treatments such as anti-virals and immunosuppressants are in investigation, but not yet adopted into formal guidelines for treatment in Australia as per the National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce.Tocilizumab, a humanised anti-IL-6 antibody, has been used safely and effectively in the treatment of rheumatological conditions, as well as to deter CRS caused by CAR-T cell antibody-based immunotherapy 4, 5 . The rationale for use in severe COVID-19 comes from autopsy assessments of ARDS-related lung damage in COVID-19 as well as blood samples of critically ill COVID-19 patients indicating CRS to be a major culprit 6, 7 . CRS is an excessive, unregulated inflammatory response, with increased production of cytokines such as IL-6. Pathogenic Th1 cells and inflammatory monocytes (with high expression of IL-6) have been isolated from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, and in larger numbers in critically ill patients 8 . The most dramatic period of clinical deterioration in our patient coincided with the highest CRP, ferritin, and IL-6 levels, strongly indicating the role of CRS in her illness trajectory. Her mortality at this point would have been high, based on the findings of a retrospective, multicentre study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China. They showed that higher levels of ferritin (mean 1297·6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614·0 ng/ml in survivors; p<0·001) and IL-6 (p<0·0001) were associated with higher mortality 9 . A prospective trial in Italy with 100 patients with COVID-19 needing ventilatory support who received Tocilizumab either in ICU or on the ward (when ICU beds were to capacity), found an improvement or stabilisation in respiratory condition in 77% of patients, and worsening in 23% patients, of whom 20% died 10 . COVID-19 in dialysis patients is not as well described or understood. A case series in Italy recorded a very high mortality of 41% in a haemodialysis population, compared with a mortality of 10% in nonchronic kidney disease (CKD) patients 11 . Postulated reasons for increased risk of severe COVID-19 infections in CKD patients include cardiac and other comorbidities, as well as a relative immunocompromised state 12, 13 . Perhaps CKD patients are also prone to CRS due to their chronic inflammatory state, making them more susceptible to severe disease. Severe cases in the Italian case series were treated with Hydroxychloroquine and/or antiretroviral therapies based on the discretion of an infectious diseases specialist, but none of the patients received Tocilizumab.A haemodialysis case in the United States managed with Tocilizumab had a successful outcome, but its use coincided with the introduction of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may have been a confounder 14 . In the case of our patient, the only significant therapeutic change in the 9 hours between the peak of her CRP and the first detected fall in CRP, apart from use of nitric oxide, was the introduction of Tocilizumab.There are case reports 15, 16 emerging of the use of continuous renal replacement therapy with extracorporeal blood purification technology to remove inflammatory cytokines such as CRP, IL-1 and IL-6, instead of the use of Tocilizumab, which is IL-6 specific. These strategies have had some reported success. Our case did not use this technique. A retrospective observational study has just completed in China, and results are awaited 17 .In conclusion, we describe a case of successful recovery from CRS secondary to COVID-19 with Tocilizumab in a critically ill elderly patient on longterm haemodialysis. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, may be useful as a rescue therapy for CRS secondary to severe COVID-19 even in haemodialysis patients, who have severely elevated inflammatory markers including CRP and ferritin, and increasing ventilation requirements such as our case. We await current and future randomised controlled trials to shed further light on this. ","Australia","first author","2020-08-10",8

Crisis-natural or human-causes damages and casualties; crisis also propels changes and reforms that translate into opportunities. A crisis-opportunity dialectic is sometimes attributed, mistakenly, to the ancient Eastern philosophy. For example, the Chinese word 'crisis' comprises two characters meaning 'danger' and 'opportunity' respectively. Similar thinking is also evident in the Western wisdom, as reflected in sayings like 'every cloud has a silver lining'. Many great inventions in our social systems and technologies have been triggered by our responses to crisis. This crisis-opportunity thinking can be applied to approaching the COVID-19 pandemic too. COVID-19 presents an extreme circumstance under which we have to experiment with certain practices and ideas that could not be possible otherwise, and we have to revisit some old practices to inform a reformist thinking about the post-COVID-19 world.In this essay, I employ a crisis-opportunity perspective to examine the disruptions in the way we work and the way use space in COVID-19. Based on this examination, I draw some reflections on the future opportunities of practising smart work and creating collaborative space in the post-COVID-19 era. This essay is organised as follows. In next section, I outline several megatrends of economy and technology, which contextualise this essay's concern on the crisis-opportunity of smart work and collaborative space in COVID-19. In the third section, I compare my personal experiences in SARS 2003 and COVID-19-17 years apart-to reveal several economic and technological differences that have shaped the different ways the two crises were perceived and responded to. In the fourth section, I examine smart work in normal and crisis scenarios respectively, based on a survey before COVID-19 and personal experiences and observations in COVID-19. In the last section, I conclude with some reflections on a new normal of smart work and collaborative space, possibly as a sort of opportunity deriving from the COVID-19 crisis.I use an endogenous-exogenous framework to underpin the propositions for transformative smart work and space in COVID-19. Certain endogenous trend follows its own evolutionary logic and trajectory. During its evolution, this trend encounters an exogenous crisis, in the forms of intervention, shock, or disruption that is external to the endogenous trend. As a result, the endogenous trend has to respond and adapt to the exogenous crisis, a process that may have a tendency of generating innovation. This innovation, once established after being tested and widely applicated, will forge a new paradigm and become a new normal. In understanding and applying this framework, it is important to note the underlying endogenous-exogenous relationship: the endogenous trend may evolve into a paradigm shift in due course by itself; the exogenous crisis functions as a triggering factor or an enabler that intervenes into the evolution and expedites the shift, which would otherwise take longer time or might even follow a different trajectory.Several megatrends are evolving and influencing the way we work, and the way we use space. Of them, the rise of the knowledge economy and the advancement of information technology, two mutually reinforcing forces in a post-industrial era, are disrupting many norms established in an industrial era (Hu, 2019) . Accelerated evolutions of them are heightening the degree of the disruption exerted by them. Here I highlight the distinct attributes reflective of the latest developments of them: the knowledge economy is digital, innovative, and collaborative; the new technology is interconnected, ubiquitous, and synchronous. These attributes are enabling smart work-working anywhere and anytime (Hu, 2019) . Smart work is not new. Its early form of telework dates back to the 1970s (Nilles, 1975) , and debates about its pros and cons and efforts to practise it have experienced booms and busts. The recent surge of interest in smart work has directly resulted from the latest technological advancement and a growing dominance of the knowledge economy.Access to interconnected, ubiquitous, and synchronous information is revolutionising the work for the knowledge economy that is digital, innovative, and collaborative. The capability of working anywhere and anytime is disrupting our perceptions and practices of space uses and regulations-legacies of an industrial era-and calls for new spatial cognition that is post-industrial and post-functional. Spatially-based urban functions are blurred or co-exist, and new functions and spaces are created (Marino & Lapintie, 2017) . These trends of work and space, in terms of both perception and practice, are emerging. Attitudes towards smart work are mixed: there are advocacy and resistance; there are certainty and uncertainty. But a general positive belief in its future is growing, and more pilot practices have been undertaken in both private sector and public sector.COVID-19 imposes a compulsory practice of smart work, regardless of any prior acceptance or rejection of it. This crisis is a test to the adaptability and resilience of smart work in addressing an external shock. This crisis is also triggering an opportunity of revisiting our perception and practice of smart work and its viability in the long run. It further presents an opportunity to critically reflect on the conventional space use and design that is based on an industrial, functional thinking.I compare my personal experiences in SARS 2003 and COVID-19 to seek the differences with regards to work, technology, impacts of crisis, and adaptability to crisis (Table 1 ). In early 2003, I lived in Beijing, a hotspot of SARS. It seems that SARS was more fatal but less infectious than COVID-19. Beijing was not locked down during the SARS period in the same way as Wuhan and many other cities during COVID-19. I was a business manager of property development in Beijing; the nature of my work then was knowledge intensive, to a lower degree than my current academic work although. Technological readiness was far less sophisticated than today: not every household in Beijing had internet connection. I established internet connection at my home during SARS, when I had to spend more time staying home, not for work purpose but simply for entertainment. Smart work was an alien concept and practice, although it was possible to request working from home on an occasional basis, for example, to concentrate on writing up a business report. I never made such a request, however. The disruption of SARS to my work was very high. The office was closed-a corporate decision-and the work totally paused. Overall, the adaptability to the SARS crisis was at a low level, in terms of technological readiness and smart work.When COVID-19 became a global pandemic in 2020 I live and work in Canberra, a contrast to Beijing in city scale and structure. I am an academic-a knowledge intensive job for disseminating and creating knowledge. Information technology permeates our work and life in an unprecedented manner, and smart work, a buzzword of debates and advocacy, is a growing practice in many knowledge sectors. The university campus where I work was closed in the middle of semester. The teaching was moved completely online within one week, technically and logistically, although the teaching and learning experiences and pedagogical implications await to be reviewed and reflected on. The majority of other university businesses were also moved online, in a reasonably smooth manner. COVID-19 impacted the arrival and recruitment of international students, and put most Australian universities, which heavily rely on international students for income, in a financially difficult situation. But the disruption of work seemed to be tackled reasonably well, in great part thanks to technological readiness and the knowledge intensive nature of university business. Compared to my experiences in SARS 2003, so far, the overall adaptability to COVID-19 is at a much higher level. However, SARS lasted for several months only. The world is still in the mid of combating COVID, with great uncertainty and challenge ahead in months or even years to come. So, this comparison between SARS and COVID-19 is personal, experiential, and tentative.Australia's capital city Canberra, where I live and work, provides an interesting setting to test some propositions for smart work. According to Australian Census 2016, the city had a resident population of 396,857 and an employed workforce of 215,588 (ABS, 2016) . Within the national urban system, Canberra is smaller than those state capitals such as Sydney, Melbourne, Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide. Despite being a small city in size, Canberra boasts of being a knowledge city: it ranks after Sydney and Melbourne only in a knowledge city index that measures the knowledge capital and knowledge economy of all Australian cities-large and small (Pratchett, Hu, Walsh, & Tuli, 2017) . Among the major Australian cities, Canberra's economic base is the most knowledge intensive and its workforce has the highest levels of education and income on average: these economic and human capitals make the core of the city's competitiveness (Hu, 2015) . In recent years, smart work or similar flexible work modes have attracted growing attention in the city, and many pilot programs have been in place. While the private sector is quicker and readier to embrace smart work like elsewhere, the public sector is slower and more hesitant. Smart work is especially a debatable issue in Canberra, caught between the city's role as the seat of government and an imperative to diversify the local economic base and capitalise on the opportunities of a digital economy (Blakely & Hu, 2019) .I undertook an online survey to investigate the practice and perception of smart work in Canberra in 2016, through the Australian Capital Territory government. This survey received 300 responses in total. As many as responses were solicited through recurring emails and networks, at a cost of calculating accurate response rate. I present the breakdowns of perceived benefits and barriers of smart work (Figs. 1 and 2) . The choices of these benefits and barriers were developed through a focus group within an Australian government department. For these reasons, the survey design and results are more reflective of Canberra's normal as a government city. A broader nationwide backdrop is that participation in smart work in the public sector is lower than the national average as well as the private sector (Blakely & Hu, 2019) . In the knowledge city index for Australian cities, Canberra performs at a lower level than the national average in smart work only, as a result of the high presence of public sector in the city (Pratchett et al., 2017) . These backdrops underline the survey results.In terms of benefits of smart work, work-life balance and increased productivity are top two factors, far ahead of the other factors (Fig. 1) . In terms of barriers of smart work, the top two factors are poor ICT infrastructure and resistance to change-one technological factor and one cultural/attitudinal factor respectively (Fig. 2) . One survey question asked about the respondents' willingness to utilise smart work arrangement. Of the 300 respondents, 119 skipped this question, and 181 answered it: 118 indicated 'yes', 56 indicated 'not sure or maybe', and 7 indicated 'no'. Choices of 'not sure or maybe' and 'no' account for nearly 35 per cent of the responses to this question. From these survey results, a major takeaway is the respondents' attitude towards smart work. Smart work is an emerging trend, and its benefits are clearly identified and appreciated. However, resistance to change is a major barrier for its acceptance and one third of respondents did not indicate an interest in it. This cultural/attitudinal factor has been one of the focal debates about smart work in Canberra, and probably elsewhere as well.COVID-19 disrupts a normal of smart work with a crisis. I do not have a survey on the disruption of COVID-19 and have to rely on personal experiences and observations to comprehend it. The practice of smart work in COVID-19 is not new or disruptive by itself. But COVID-19 presents an exogenous shock, intervening into the smart work trend-an endogenous process in evolution-without any precaution or leeway for preparation. It renders smart work-working from home to be specific-the only alternative mode of work for knowledge workers with or without prior readiness or acceptance. A study during COVID-19 estimated that 39 per cent of all jobs in Australia can be done from home, and Canberra has the highest proportion of workforce for this 'teleworkability' (Ulubasoglu & Onder, 2020) . COVID-19 removes all the barriers to smart work in normal to test its viability in crisis and expose its attributes in an extreme situation-a social experiment that could exist in theory only if it were not for COVID-19. In this sense, COVID-19 brings an opportunity-an unplanned, unwanted opportunity albeit-of expediting a test to the possibility and potential of smart work in the knowledge economy to inform post-COVID-19 implications.The COVID-19 experiences bring to the fore the creation of two types of collaborative spaces through smart work: a virtual collaborative space and a physical collaborative space, which are interrelated and mutually enabling. We establish a virtual collaborative space not only to replace the normal workplace but also to expand a borderless realm with multi-scalar outreach-local, regional, and global-for knowledge-based activities. This mode of collaborative activity-working anywhere (at home in COVID-19) and collaborating electronically-presents a scenario of 'working alone together' (Spinuzzi, 2012) , an oxymoron capturing this physical-virtual integration in facilitating collaboration. This essay is a product of an international webinar forum organised by this journal during COVID-19. This forum attracted a dozen of speakers and around 50 participants across the world-my first experience of its type and the largest audience that I ever witnessed at an international conference seminar. COVID-19 propelled me to become a fond user of those digital tools and has significantly enhanced my connectivity with people for work, no matter where they are, in frequencies that I could not imagine if it were not for COVID-19. Before COVID-19, I had nearly all the enabling factors for smart work but a push that I have to do it.Smart work under COVID-19 also expedites a rethinking of physical collaborative space, ironically, in an environment of social or physical distancing. If we can work from home-or from anywhere as conceptualised for smart work, and the cultural/attitudinal resistance from both employers and employees is not a barrier-an idealised scenario as tested in COVID-19, we need to systemically revisit the way we plan and design space and the way we perceive space use in the post-COVID-19 world. An increasing spatial disruption, as a result of the sharing economy and digital revolutionisation, is already challenging the conventional land use and space use classification and coding systems established in industrial cities (Hu, 2019) . In an age of the knowledge economy and new technology, collaboration defines both the virtual space and the physical space, and an integration of them. This collaborative nature of knowledge work is changing the nature of design to stimulate innovation (Wagner & Watch, 2017) . Consequently, we have seen home office at home; we have also seen homey office in office; and we have also seen increasing work activities in those third spaces traditionally not for work. This practice is not fully exposed in COVID-19 given the restriction of staying home-on the contrary, it is Journal of Urban Management xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx constrained. However, COVID-19 signifies the possibility of a spatial trend that may be accelerating in the post-COVID-19 era, exploring the potential of collaborative spaces through working anywhere for knowledge-based activities.I draw some reflections on smart work and collaborative space as possible opportunities triggered by the crisis of COVID-19, combining some observations during the pandemic and some imagination about the future. I argue that these evolving trends, after being expedited in the crisis, are likely to forge a new normal in the way we work and the way use space in the post-COVID-19 world.Smart work is blurring the temporal and spatial divisions between work and life for knowledge workers. Its defining attribute of temporal-spatial flexibility, hinged on the nature of the knowledge economy and enabled by information technological advancement, challenges our conventional perception of time and space-a path dependence from an industrial age. History has shown a technological-cultural divide: in the progression of many inventions, technological advancement was leading, but people's acceptance was often lagging. COVID-19 is disrupting a resistance to the change of smart work through imposing an unusual circumstance under which it may work, or it must work. COVID-19 may last longer than anticipated or wished-its geography and duration already surpassed SARS 2003. It is likely to be long enough-an undesired scenario-not only to expedite a change, but also to establish, culturally, a path dependence on a COVID-19 normal in the post-COVID-19 world. This new normal will challenge the existing organisation and management norms and workplace culture, and demand reform and change.Smart work is reinforcing the making of collaborative space in two senses. First, aligned to its defining attribute of temporalspatial flexibility, smart work is disrupting the spatial divisions classified by codes of land uses and space uses. In doing so, smart work signals the coming of a smart design paradigm that incorporates this spatial disruption and creates collaborative space to enable innovative knowledge production. Second, this collaborative space further goes beyond a physical dimension and integrates both the 'space of flow' and the 'space of place', as proposed by Manuel Castells (2000) to capture the spatiality in a network society, in knowledge production, consumption, and sharing. A physical-virtual integration in space uses and knowledge activities informs a rethinking of many modernist norms in urban planning and development, including a binary of urban and suburban, separation of working and living, and infrastructure provisions associated with these spatial norms. This new normal will naturally establish a dialogue with the wicked problems of sustainability, climate change, and social inequality confronting contemporary cities, and may raise more questions than provide ready answers.We are still in the middle of fighting COVID-19. Grave uncertainty and challenge lie ahead. We do not know yet when and how this crisis will end; it is a test to the collective intelligence, adaptability, resilience, and collaboration of human beings. In human history, those grave crises were often great opportunities for new inventions-technological or institutional-to advance human society and wellbeing. This little essay, hopefully, drills out some opportunities out of the COVID-19 crisis.No conflict of interest is declared.","Australia","first author","2020-08-13",8

The latest novel strain appeared in Wuhan, China in 2019 and was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 infection could be asymptomatic or could show mild to severe pneumonia like symptoms [2] . The commonly noted symptoms include fever, dry cough, tiredness, less common symptoms include headache, chest pain, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis or other aches and pains [3] . A noticeable feature of the disease is its highly contagious nature and, while the virus outbreak is still under investigation, there are views that the spread can happen person-toperson due to close contacts, airborne particles, and contact with contaminated surfaces [4] . Additionally, the high risk group of the COVID-19 is different from recent pandemics with the current strain particularly deadly for older individuals (Tang et al., 2020). Thus, while the world has confronted multiple epidemics in recent times and different countries have had several preparedness plans in place following their past experiences (Henry, 2019; Itzwerth et al., 2018; Jennings, 2009), the current pandemic has come as an unprecedented context in many countries. Indeed, even after different public health measures instituted by the governments, the virus has continued to spread across countries. As of 1 st June 2020, WHO Situation Report identifies over 6 million positive cases globally and close to 4 hundred thousand deaths from the disease [5] .Despite the uniqueness of the COVID-19 context, there have been multiple commonly adopted public health measures and recommendations across countries. These include staying at home, social distancing, contact tracing, exercising, and wearing masks, washing hands more often, wearing gloves and using hand sanitiser. There have also been public and media communications to increase public awareness. However, as experiences from the recent pandemic shows, individual behaviour during an Thus, with many COVID-19 cases being asymptotic, leading to people carrying on with their daily life as normal and thereby acting as virus carriers and threat especially to elderly people, it is interesting to explore the public behaviour and their understanding of the risk associated with COVID-19 spread. This can guide policy makers on adjusting measures to reduce the risk of further outbreaks. In this study, we analyse data from Japan to understand on what level people implemented these guidelines and the impacts of socio-demographic status and personal attributes had on their behaviour. Further, while existing studies on pandemics have generally utilised traditional statistical approaches, we apply in this research the Classification and Regression Tree (CART), a machine learning algorithm, for a robust analysis.Implementing large scale lockdown and social distancing was difficult for high populous nations such as Indonesia, however, modelling shows early interventions have saved thousands of lives [6] . A WeChat survey of 3083 participants concludes that people living in cities have a better understanding of the disease compared to those in rural areas [7] . The study also demonstrates males (OR: 0.544, 95% CI: 0.440-0.673), younger adults (1.844, 1.466-2.320), and subjects with higher education (2.200, 1.780-2.718) exhibited better behaviours when protective measures such as washing hands, wearing masks or exercising were given [7] . This finding indicates that health education should be strengthened among adults living in rural areas where access to medical services is limited. A survey of 976 university academics and students of the Iraqi Kurdistan region revealed that the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 infection, serious illness and death (26.9%, 29.7%, and 41.7%, respectively) is low in the participants [8] . Similarly, a Bangladeshi cross sectional study of 320 adults identified people living in the urban area (p<0.01), high education (p<0.01), rich (p<0.01) and joint family (p<0.01) had the most contributions to good practice [9] .The reception of general public plays a key role in controlling an infectious disease such as COVID-19. The best example of this is Singapore where the disease was very well controlled compared to other countries. The key factors of this success come from the experience that the Singapore government and its public have experienced during their outbreaks. In 2000, 2003 and 2009 they experienced hand-foot-mouth disease, SARS and H1N1 outbreaks respectively [10] . They learnt that response to such a pandemic has to be well-coordinated and multi-stakeholder approach including participation from public.The issues that were caused by COVID-19 are unparalleled and unprecedented. This generation has not seen anything like it. It has been argued that the road to full recovery will be very long and multiple waves of infection are predicted [11] . Hence governments face myriad of multi-dimensional challenges including surge in demand for public health system, economical and mental issues of the public. Therefore, this study analyses the effect of personal attributes, age, social and demographics on public behaviour and their perception about the spread of the disease and means to control it.This study used an open-source research dataset that was made available by Yamamoto [12] . This dataset consists of the survey responses of 11,342 Japanese who were recruited through a crosssectional approach from a pool of 1.2 million registered individuals. A non-probabilistic quota sampling was followed in this survey so that the sample distributions among gender (male or female), age group (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s) and employment status (regular employee, non-regular employee, selfemployed and not working) become the representative ones compared with their respective national statistics [12] .From the research dataset, this study considered one question to quantify its three dependent variables -""Have you ever conducted anything to prevent novel coronavirus infections or outbreaks?"" [12] . For the response of this question, each respondent needs to select one of the five options ('Very true', 'True', 'Neither', 'Not true' and 'Not at all') against each of the 21 activities. A very recently published article on the same dataset focused on the same question to characterise the Japanese citizens' behaviour across three government recommended measures [13] . We consider the same question and items are labelled exactly as in the research dataset [12, 13] . However, our approach in assessment of pandemic protection behaviour is different. The published work examines the citizens' behaviour and attitudes through a common umbrella of social distancing and personal etiquettes and focuses mainly on 12 items separately within the same question [13] . We, by contrast, utilise all 21 items and group these activities across three customised pandemic protection behaviours -'social distancing', 'personal protection behaviour' and 'social responsibility behaviour'. Table 1 details the 21 activities grouped across the three dependent variables. More precisely, rather than considering the items in general, we interpret the meaning and impacts of the respective behaviour to form the grouping. For example, stockpiling masks or food can be interpreted as socially irresponsible behaviour especially if the general populace misses out on essential goods due to mass buying by some individuals. While eating nutritious diet or getting rest and exercise may be interpreted as personal behaviour, we consider the social side of the impacts of such behaviour and the need for a healthy societythus, these items are also grouped under social responsibility. Similarly, behaviours like avoiding closed but ill-ventilated spaces, not speaking in close proximity, avoiding mass gathering, and related practices are grouped under social distancing behaviours; while taking measures to disinfect surroundings, wearing masks, avoiding travels for any reason when having cold, and related practices are deemed as personal protection behaviours.…… Please place Figure 1 here…… RIDIT is a statistical method for analysing subjectively categorized response variable, i.e., ordered qualitative measurements often called as ordinal data [14, 15] . For example, if the response variable has subjective scales with ordered categories, such as -""never smoked"", ""smokes sometimes"", ""smokes every day"" or ""minor pain"", ""moderate pain"", ""severe pain"" etc., then they may not be adequately analysed by chi-square-or t-test-based statistical methods. RIDIT analysis is often used to transform the response variable by allocating scores relative to the identified (or reference) distribution of the data.The term RIDIT stands for ""relative to an identified distribution integral transformation"" and this was termed by Bross for its analogy with other statistical transformation methods such as probit and logit [16] . Essentially, the process of RIFIT analysis can be summarised in the following steps:Step 1: Select the categorical response variable whose response values are categorical, subjective and in order. For example, for the survey question -""how often do you smoke"", the response values are -""never"", ""sometimes"" and ""daily"". Respondents giving the same response is called a group.Step 2: Choose references or identified distribution data. Based on this set, the non-reference data will be baselined. For this reference set, each group is assigned a score or weight. Thus, each of the response values or categories are transformed into a score. Let us assume, a response variable has ordered responses in the reference set marked as -1 , 2 , 3 , … , .denotes the total number of responses for ( = 1 + 2 + ⋯ + + ⋯ + ). Then, RIDIT for response will be,Here ( ) is the probability of choosing response in the reference set.CART (short for Classification and Regression Trees) is an umbrella term [17] for referring to two types of decision trees -""classification tree"" and ""regression tree"". Decision tree or decision tree learning is a widely used predictive modelling approach used in machine learning, data mining and statistics. Given a dataset with multiple observation of an outcome variable with respect to one or more input (i.e., independent) variable, the decision tree essentially generates a binary tree to predict the outcome variable based on the input variable. The binary tree starts at the single root node and keeps splitting in every non-leaf node into two branches based on a logical comparison of an input variable, e.g., ""if income > 800$: Yes/No"", ""if sex is male: Yes/No"", etc. The leaf nodes indicate an outcome as the prediction result of the decision tree. Thus, the outcome of a set of input variable values (of future observation) can be predicted by simply following the decision tree logic and reaching towards a particular leaf-node. Now, if the outcome variable has discrete values, i.e., discrete classes such as sex (male, female), disease outcome (benign, malignant), etc., then it is a classification tree. And, if the outcome variable is a continuous variable (price, age in years etc.) then it is a regression tree. CART is a modern term that encompasses a range of algorithms to generate both types of trees.For the CART implementation in our research, we generated three CART trees (regression trees as the outcome is a continuous number) based on three outcome variablessocial distance, personal protection behaviour, social responsibility awareness. In each case, nine independent or input variables are used. Now, when CART generates the decision tree, we applied pruning on the tree to reduce the number of input variables and subsequently reduce the number of splitting in the tree to generate a smaller tree and avoid overfitting of the data. The variables that are finally present in the resultant trees are used in the next step of the analysis.Multiple regression is used to explain the relationship between one continuous dependent variable with two or more independent variables. It is an extension of simple linear regression. The result of the multiple regression indicates whether the outcome or dependent variable can be predicted from the independent variables, the accuracy of the prediction, model fits and statistical significance. Multiple regression has several assumptions on the data that should be tested to find whether the method is suitable for the dataset. These assumptions [18] aredependent variables should be continuous and linearly dependent on independent variables, at least two or more independent variableswhich can be either continuous or categorical and should not be highly correlated, independence among the observations, homoscedasticity in the data and normally-distributed residuals.In this research, we generated three multiple regression models for each of the dependent variables -social distance, personal protection behaviour, social responsibility awareness. After applying CART in the previous step, three independent variables are excluded from the overall nine independent variables. Thus, each of the three multiple regression models has six independent variables age, sex, marital status, child, drinking frequency and smoking frequency. Table 2 provides a summary of the research dataset of this study. As notable, the dataset contained a balance of male and female respondents and different demographic attributes. Table 3 shows the corresponding RIDIT scores for the five responses against each of 21 activities. The survey respondents reported these activities in response to a survey question (i.e., ""Have you ever conducted anything to prevent novel coronavirus infections or outbreaks?""). The responses of these activities were considered to quantify the three dependent variables (Social distance, Personal protection behaviour, Social responsibility awareness) of this study.…… Please place Figure 2 here…… …… Please place Figure 3 here…… …… Please place Figure 4 here…… Table 4 shows the three regression models developed for each of three dependent variables of this study. Three attributes (Child, Marital status and Sex) have significant positive impact on each of the three dependent variables (Social distance, Personal protection behaviour and Social responsibility awareness). The 'drinking frequency' attribute does not have a significant impact on any of the dependent variables. The 'smoking frequency' has negative impact on all dependent variables but this impact is not significant for the 'personal protection behaviour' variable. The 'work status' attribute has significant positive impact on the 'social distance' variable but significant negative impact on the 'personal protection behaviour' variable. It does not have a significant impact on the 'social responsibility awareness' variable. We also considered VIF (variance inflation factor), which is a statistical measure that can detect the presence of multicollinearity in a regression analysis. In regression analyses, multicollinearity is a phenomenon which is used to explore the presence of any linear relations among predictor variables [19] . In general, a VIF value of >10 indicates a high presence of multicollinearity. As revealed by the VIF (variance inflation factor) values indicated in Table 4 , multicollinearity is not present in our regression analysis.…… Please place Table 4 here…… As revealed in Table 4 , females are more likely to follow COVID-19 preventive practices than males. During the regression analyses, the numerical values of '1' and '2' are used for males and females, respectively. So, a positive coefficient in Table 4 for the 'sex' attribute indicates a higher adherence of females in following the preventive practices. As mentioned earlier, the 'child' attribute has also a positive impact on each of the three preventive measures of this study. We further categorise the survey respondents based on their 'sex' and 'child' information and, using t-test, explore the difference in abiding by the COVID-19 preventive practices among those categories. As outlined in Table 5 , regardless of having a child, females tend to adhere preventive practices more than males. …… Please place Table 5 here…… Further to the socio-demographic attributes, this research focused on personal attributes including smoking and drinking frequency. While 'drinking frequency' appears non-significant for the considered models, the 'smoking frequency' attribute reveals a negative impact on each of the three COVID-19 preventive measures of this study. This indicates that a lower value of this measure is more desirable since such values will lead to a higher possibility of following preventive practices. As outlined in Table  2 , the possible values for the 'smoking frequency' attribute have been placed in ascending order (i.e., '1' for 'never smoked', '2' for 'used to smoked but not now', '3' for 'sometimes' and '4' for 'everyday'). Thus, a negative coefficient for the 'smoking frequency' attribute indicates that individuals who are non-smoker or smoke less frequently are more likely to adhere COVID-19 preventive measures. Thus, a negative coefficient for the 'smoking frequency' attribute relates to non-smoking or infrequent smoking behaviour, and which is apparently linked to more adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. Research notes that smoking and non-smoking behaviour can characterise the practice of seeking health support for influenza types of diseases in the USA [25] . Another study finds smoking behaviour as a contributing factor towards vaccination against H1N1 among pregnant women in France [26] . Thus, this study's finding of 'smoking behaviour' of Japanese citizens shaping their adherence to COVID-19 restrictions affirms this personality attribute as a factor to consider in pandemic management.This research considered three constructs (social distancing, personal protection and social responsibility awareness) that are commonly suggested and followed across the world to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In quantifying these three constructs, the 21 different responses of a single survey question were used. These 21 responses were grouped into three equal-sized (i.e., seven) groups for these three constructs. These groupings are statistically reliable, as revealed in the corresponding Cronbach's alpha values of Table 6 . The seven responses of each group are closely related to each other. Cronbach's alpha is a measure of internal consistency and reliability used to explore 'how closely a set of items are related' when they are used to quantify a construct [27] . In general, a value of 0.70 or more is considered as 'acceptable' in most social science research situations.…… Please place Table 6 here…… Both 'child' and 'marital status' have significant positive impact on each of the three COVID-19 preventive measures considered in this study. This indicates individuals who have a younger child and are not married are more likely to adhere these preventive practices. In our research dataset, on average, married individuals (1.95) have more younger children than 'not married' individuals (1.58). The 'not married' status includes both 'unmarried' and 'married but divorced' individuals. Since only a small percentage of Japanese children are born to unmarried mothers [28] , most of the 'not married' respondents in the research data are more likely to be divorced individuals. In recent years, divorce tendency has become more common in the USA and many other developed countries including Japan [29] . So, our findings related to 'child' and 'marital status' should be considered carefully in developing COVID-19 preventive practice policies for countries where single parenting is historically low due to cultural and religious reasons (e.g., India).This study assesses the behavioural perspectives of population differentiated by socio-demographic and personal attributes when confronting a pandemic situation. Using a publicly available and recently collected data on Japanese citizens during the COVID-19 early outbreak and exploiting both CART and regression analysis, the study notes that socio-demographic and personal attributes of individuals indeed shape the subjective prevention actions and thereby the control of spread of a pandemic. Three sociodemographic attributessex, marital family status, and having childrenappear to have played an influential role in Japanese citizens' abiding by the COVID-19 protection behaviours, especially with women having children being noted more conscious than the male counterparts. Among the personality attributes, smoking behaviour appeared as a contributing factor with non-smokers or less-frequent smokers more compliant to the protection behaviours. Work status also appears to have some impact especially concerning social distancing and personal protection behaviour.There are some limitations of the research. The conclusions drawn are dependent on information recorded in the publicly available dataset. Thus, the study may have sustained the same limitations as the data collector including limitations due to self-reporting by participants, not covering all age groups, random sampling, and timing of data collection [13] . Further, the way the items for the considered questionnaire have been interpreted and grouped across the three behaviours can be subjective, as is not uncommon in qualitative coding. Despite the limitations, the findings provide useful insights especially concerning the need for public policy campaigning to account for variations in responses and protection behaviour due to socio-demographic and personal attributes during a pandemic. Such consideration, rather than a general campaign, may lead to more effective pandemic managementan issue to be explored in future research.","Australia","first author","2020-08-24",8

The focus of clinical interventions has been on urban and metropolitan locations (somewhat driven by the disease infection, severity and mortality rates that may occur in high-density areas). Despite this, there is a difference with respect to pandemic planning and action in rural areas. 3 In particular, describing the role and function of rural PHC teams in such emergencies has the potential to inform rural health system preparedness to all-nature of hazards of biological, chemical and radio nuclear varieties, whether naturally occurring or not. 4 Our aim was to draw on our collective expertise in rural public health, clinical and academic knowledge, to provide a commentary as to our perceptions of the activity and experiences of the rural PHC sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered this would be applicable for informing future pandemic policy and planning and ensuring that national responses are tailored to rural contexts. We particularly drew on experiences from Canada and Australia, as two countries with similar health systems, geography, and rural population distributions. In order to do this, we first discussed the pandemic response we observed in our own country's rural and remote communities to draw out three themes representing interacting phases that were common in both countries: risk, resilience and response. The working definitions for these are summarised in Table 1 and explored in the paper as follows.Despite the recognition that effective pandemic management requires specific attention to at-risk populations, there is very little literature concerning the nature of risk for rural populations. 4, 5 Although many rural people are affected by COVID-19 around the world, the focus tends to centre on population risk and disease severity in highdensity urban communities. Anecdotally, much of the media coverage about case counts and deaths also revolves around urban areas and city hospitals, with limited demarcation of what is going on in rural places. Despite this, nearly half the global population lives rurally and has specific risks related to transmissible infections (Table 1) . 6 Many rural communities entered the current pandemic already chronically under-serviced, facing inadequate healthcare infrastructure, limited clinical resources and equipment, and healthcare personnel shortages (56% lacking critical healthcare access). 7-10 With respect to their populations, rural communities include more aged, First Peoples and socio-economically disadvantaged people, many with higher levels of pre-existing chronic illnesses. 8 Some rural and First Peoples face extreme socio-cultural barriers related to access to healthcare as well as housing, basic services and digital infrastructure, affecting lower levels of health service access and use relative to their needs. 11, 12 Pre-existing unmet needs may exacerbate pandemic risks unless the healthcare response is adequate, culturally and socially relevant.Further, despite the concept that rural communities are safe from pandemic exposures, the high levels of interaction between rural communities, with metropolitan areas and with international communities is an important factor to consider within pandemic policies. Some rural communities have strong patterns of using fly-in fly-out workers and short-term rotating locum staff. [13] [14] [15] In Australia and Canada, around 40% and 30% of the rural medical workforce is overseas-trained, many of whom visit their home country and have regular family visiting. 16, 17 Moreover, in rural communities, goods and services are often traded in a relatively informal economy through local entrepreneurship and reciprocity as a vital part of sustainable development. 18 Commodities available in one community may not be in another, only reinforcing travel between communities. Rural populations may also rely on more multi-site employment (intra-rural and rural to urban) and educational models, including boarding schools, posing other infection risks. 19, 20 Rural locations may also experience significant numbers of people visiting holiday homes (sometimes to get away from pandemics 'hot spots'), as well as mobile tourist groups including many ""grey nomads"", people who are post-retirement, taking lengthy holidays, some of whom may be trapped in rural locations by border closures during a pandemic. 21, 22 Together, the patterns of rural mobility increase the threat that rural communities will be exposed to infectious diseases, with potentially dire consequences unless specifically acknowledged and managed.With respect to the risk of community transmission, the conditions in rural areas may pose particular challenges. First Peoples have high rates of short-term inter and intra community movement patterns within regions (around 39 trips per year, often related to kinship), and are subject to over-crowded housing (18.3% of housing considered not adequate for the number of people per dwelling). 23, 24 Mainstream policies to promote or mandate self-isolation during pandemics may be impractical to implement and work against the goal of reducing the rate of infection in rural and remote settings. Instead, rural communities may need to identify specific ways to respectfully adjust normal community movement patterns and consider ways to provide safe sheltering options for isolating unwell people. These considerations must address the social, economic, and cultural determinants of health in order to be effective. Chronically under-serviced, with higher rates of chronic illness and limited clinical resources and equipment and health personnel.Communities of a high fly-in-fly-out workforce over diverse borders, high levels of overseas-trained health workers.Inter-community sharing of goods and services.Multi-site employment, boarding schools, tourists and particular industries.Host of a number of holiday homes and roving tourists.Inter-personal interaction between community members and mobility between First Peoples visiting family/kin on-country.Co-location of hospitals and aged care services. Overcrowded personal spaces (housing), make it challenging to isolate unwell people.Risk communication challenges, related to lower education levels, different language groups and potential stigma of illness.Diverse population with greater access to employment, education and health services.Mostly within city population movement, using a higher proportion of locally available healthcare workers.Visitors may include more ""short-stay"" individuals, often related to employment.Fewer students leaving home to attend rural boarding schools.Large gatherings more common, high-density community and over-crowded communal spaces and office buildings that need to be managed.Hospitals, a potential source of exposure.Risk communication tailored to more educated population.Resilience The potential of the system and population to withstand possible ill-effects from the threat/hazard. Within-city networks and transfers rapid.Administrative staff capacity sound.Policies already tailored to setting so easier to apply.Long-term staff and staffing stability.Less staff burnout and impact of staff isolation policies as overall numbers of trained health workers and PHC teams greater.Stockpiles required, but supply chains turn on more rapidly.(Continued) Perceived and real risks may be exacerbated unless risk communication accounts for the lower education levels of rural populations, different language groups and the potential stigma related to illness in rural and remote communities. Failing to do so may also reduce perceived risk and compliance with public health information and negatively impact health service use. 25, 26 Finally, in rural areas, health services may be colocated with other human services, in multipurpose centres, which operate as part of networked and integrated service models that aim to support health and human services for people as close to home as possible. 27 These potentially place long-term aged care residents within proximity of infectious patients, warranting site-specific risk assessment and adjustment. Mindful of different risks in rural settings, mainstream policies for health services, border control, population monitoring, self-isolation and closure of essential services require rural tailoring.The mainstream population health and health service resilience to COVID-19 has largely centred on building hubs for testing, upscaling tracing and isolation activity along with building hospital service capacity including equipment and intensive care unit beds. But rural resilience relies on the availability of strong qualified PHC teams covering services most relevant to the population's needs. 28, 29 The focus on strong PHC is essential as most rural towns have small (<10 bed) (minimal high dependency care), or no hospitals and more remote communities rely on community clinics, nursing stations or visiting primary healthcare teams (Table 1) . [29] [30] [31] [32] These are connected to a network of rural hospitals some distance away by road or air, demanding rural people undergo significant personal travel or use retrieval services. 29,32 When patients need higher-level care elsewhere, this imposes substantial financial, cultural and emotional burden on rural people whereby the PHC team aims to optimise prevention and early intervention to mitigate infection and minimise the need for patients to travel. 33 Resilience is challenging as many rural PHC teams are small and need to sustain a high workload and strong community leadership during a pandemic response. An Australian national survey of general practitioners (GPs) working during the COVID-19 pandemic identified that GPs in rural areas were more likely to maintain or increase patient numbers relative to GPs based in urban areas (where patient numbers dropped). 34 This may be because small rural PHC teams absorb any pandemic clinical services on top of their normal workload with few buffers from other doctors in town. Further, there may be a much higher administrative burden on PHC leaders to digest and implement rapidly evolving policies and guidelines. These policies may be inadequately tailored to the rural context. One study identified that guidelines from various official agencies involved in healthcare may be in direct conflict with each other, making it challenging to interpret the correct course of local action needed. 35 A real-time system allowing rural PHC staff to pose questions and receive rapid answers (such as the one recently set up by project ECHO, University of New Mexico, USA), may be suitable to use within each nation's pandemic response. Potential impacts on the mental health and fatigue levels of PHC staff are also probable in rural settings. Although there are no rural-specific figures, a national cross-sectional survey of Australian doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic identified that 11.5% of GPs reported felt ""tense, restless, nervous or anxious or unable to sleep at night because his/her mind is troubled all the time"" a lot more than usual. 34 Some stressors may be concerns about being exposed to infection as a frontline healthcare worker, despite the strength of screening and triaging processes. Of all occupations, healthcare practitioners have the highest likelihood of exposure to diseases. 36 Other stressors relevant to rural PHC teams may relate to any overlapping and conflicting patientprovider relationships they may experience around rising rates of community mental illness, job losses and poverty, domestic violence or crime during pandemic periods. 37 These may have strong effects on rural healthcare workers whose professional lives are intertwined with their personal connections to people in their community.Resilience in rural areas strongly depends on local PHC teams spending time analysing the strengths and opportunities of their local healthcare networks and patching any gaps. This may require the development of new collaborative frameworks to build resilience in various regions or local populations. 38 To some extent, these depend on the level of pre-existing community trust they have and their relationships with other health services. This is enabled when primary healthcare workers have been working in the same area for some time. However, for many small rural and remote communities, poor stability of the workforce is a threat to resilience. PHC staff turnover is more common in more remote locations than in regional and urban centres and there is a stronger reliance on locum or other short-term staff (for example, in Australia's remote primary care clinics only 20% of nurses continue to work in the same remote clinic 12 months after commencing). 39, 40 In the event of pandemic responses becoming quite protracted, rural resilience may also be threatened by the potential burnout of rural PHC workers, a group that already works more hours and has higher turnover than its urban counterparts. 41 Burnout threatens rural community health and local health system leadership because of the small number of health workers in rural settings. 37, 42 Surge policies to provide additional staffing to rural PHC teams could be activated early in pandemic situations to embed more capacity of ""super-numeri"" staff within the response, and enable viable rosters for PHC workers to get enough rest. This arrangement also serves to allow any exposed/unwell staff to undergo self-isolation, without impacting the rest of the team and the community's access to care.Whilst states/provinces and nations clamber to find enough personal protective (PPE) and other infection control equipment during pandemics, this infrastructure becomes increasingly centred on large hospitals and cities facing the most progressive levels of illness. This may leave many rural PHC providers unprotected, sometimes with no assurance they will get PPE. The lack of PPE poses a critical threat in rural settings where the pool of available PHC workers is precariously small and serves an undifferentiated caseload of infectious and non-infectious people dispersed across large geographic catchments. If sufficient protective equipment cannot be obtained, then rural PHC teams strongly depend on non-contact treatment methods and community support for making their own protective gear or using home-grown methods of sterilizing. 43 Ideally, some assurance by government that sufficient baseline supplies and any scaled up resources will be provided where needed, would buffer the resilience of individual PHC units. In the same vein, an additional resilience factor for rural communities is having access to adequate clinical testing capabilities and relevant treatments. A study of the perspectives of First Nations Peoples about the 2009 influenza pandemic identified that ""supplies"" (ordering, maintaining and providing pandemic supplies) were a key ""overlooked"" aspect of existing pandemic plans. 44 Finally, rural resilience depends on PHC teams and the community having specific advice about sensible systems for patient retrieval for higher level care. PHC teams are well placed to understand the best pathways for patient transfer but this may require government support for negotiating the guarantee of transport and higher-level services accepting unwell rural patients. Feeling resilient depends on knowing that this plan will allow for situations where the local caseload may rapidly rise. Such continuity business planning has been described as essential in other pandemics. 45 Meanwhile, other research has identified that those communities with rural hospitals, should bolster their capabilities to manage infected individuals for interim periods, where transferring acutely unwell patients to larger centres is not feasible, nor immediate enough. 3The healthcare response to COVID-19 has anecdotally been portrayed in the media as hospital care. However, in rural areas, the response phase related to PHC teams introducing of a differentiated range of treatment services for infectious and non-infectious members of the community as well as adopting new preventative clinics that are readily accessible by rural populations (Table 1) . This often involves delivery of more ambulatory clinical services, including new in-and out-of-clinic services, collaborating with community public health services and introducing innovative triaging and testing systems for unwell people. Unlike urban models which are fixed, rural PHC services are highly needs-based and flexible and this is exacerbated in line with emerging pandemic and local conditions. 46 Other than treating regular clients and managing potentially infectious patients, new or revamped preventative clinics may be needed, including targeted vaccination clinics, prescription services by phone and advanced care planning. These serve to better position the community and free up the available primary resources for responding to new infectious cases. There is some potential that these add to the service loads of rural PHC teams, and this should be explored and linked to the notion of workforce surge needs.Historically, many governments have restricted funding for telehealth to non-primary care doctors, such as referred specialist medical services which are the least accessible medical service in rural areas. 47 However, new government policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and Canada started to fund rural PHC teams to use telephone and video consultations. This funding is in recognition of the role that telehealth plays in PHC in non-contact healthcare for protecting health workers and the community from infection. In rural settings, it has also provided a potential option to surge rural workers to overcome staff shortages, staff isolation (due to exposure) and border closures. Telehealth availability, funded in phone and video formats, has provided for unprecedented capacity to grow and diversify models of PHC services fit for rural communities, using a wider choice of platforms of choice. Further, the flexibility to deliver services via video-or -phone assists to deliver consultations through a simple base of interaction where this is a better fit.As a model, telehealth, and the blend of phone and video used, still requires evaluation within the rural context to establish where it offers the most utility for providers and patients. This is because its long-term use may require a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care. 48 It is imperative that such models do not add excessive demand for mobile technology and at-home medical devices that rural and remote people and rural PHC teams may find hard to access. More work is needed to determine the proportion and nature of PHC services that fit telehealth delivery and how these are optimally complemented with in-person consultations. Rural PHC teams and rural health services researchers are possibly best placed to explore this topic given they have the most in-depth knowledge of the dynamic and complex environment of rural and remote settings.In the rural system, the capacity to overlay telehealth largely depends on the stability of a trained PHC workforce in rural areas, their equipment and adequate broadband internet services. One national cross-sectional survey during COVID-19 identified that GPs in the most disadvantaged areas, and GPs in rural areas used less telehealth. 34 This perhaps reiterates the imperative of understanding the context of use in rural areas. Like in urban areas, telehealth is a potential adjunct service in rural areas. But it may have less capacity or more dire consequences if replacing face-to-face services for disadvantaged and socially isolated groups in the community. This is because in rural settings, there are likely to be differences in the patient's approachability and acceptability of online health services including for aged, disadvantaged, culturally diverse and First Peoples and seeing the doctor may provide better quality of care and social contact (and therefore health benefit). 49 The potential for digital inequalities (at the supply and demand side) is an important issue for rural communities to adopt technology-based healthcare solutions. 50 Many rural places continue to lack stable internet service networks, particularly when more people may be working or self-isolating at home during pandemic periods. A high proportion of rural areas may experience broadband connectivity issues resulting in weak or no access to the Internet meaning that phone-calls remain a central back up system. 51, 52 Further, some rural communities may incur high costs associated with high-speed broadband Internet use as another limitation. 51 In conclusion, the specific needs of rural communities may inadvertently be overlooked within rapid mainstream pandemic planning. However, these communities have widely different contexts from urban settings. This commentary highlights that specific preparation is needed for addressing nuanced rural risks, building community resilience, and fostering a coordinated and supported rural PHC response. Critically pandemics present an enormous risk to a small critical mass of rural PHC teams, and the communities they serve. This is particularly in relation to their smaller staffing and infrastructure, serving a diverse population with higher pre-existing healthcare needs. This perspective identifies clear opportunities to continue to future-proof rural PHC systems for surge events.This article did not require ethical review as it used available published literature.The authors report no conflicts of interest for this work.Risk Management and Healthcare Policy is an international, peerreviewed, open access journal focusing on all aspects of public health, policy, and preventative measures to promote good health and improve morbidity and mortality in the population.

Diminished GDM care must also be considered a risk for increased pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, shoulder dystocia, birth trauma and postnatal depression. [4] [5] [6] One aspect of GDM of immediate concern is the use of the 75 g two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to diagnose GDM during a time of social isolation and risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion.The aim of this report is to summarise the options and the rationale behind recommendations designed to minimise the risks to pregnant women.Close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 are most at risk. 7 CoV-2 was detected for up to 72 and 48 h on plastic and stainless steel surfaces, respectively, and remains viable in aerosols for 3 h with an exponential decay in virus titre over time. 8 Each visit to a pathology centre may therefore represent a risk during pregnancy, particularly if a stay in excess of two hours is required.Current Australian recommendations require 1.5 m between persons and 4 m 2 area for each person in an enclosed space. 9 However, it is unknown whether a greater risk to the pregnant woman ensues from a single 2.5 hours visit to a pathology collection centre or from multiple short visits. Beyond implementing the standard SARS-CoV-2 contagion control recommendations, the general principles are, therefore, to minimise the need to attend a pathology centre (ie one attendance rather than two), the duration of attendance (ie single sampling rather than multiple sampling), and the number of women likely to attend at once (eg fasting sample).The need to diagnose GDM using an OGTT, which assesses both fasting and post-prandial glycaemia, is now considered best practice by all relevant international organisations, with the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) diagnostic criteria for GDM (fasting glucose ≥ 5.1 mmol/L, one hour ≥ 10.0 mmol/L, two hours ≥ 8.5 mmol/L) most used in Australia. 10 Table 1 summarises the disadvantages of each alternative option. These alternatives either exclude an assessment of postprandial glycaemia (fasting blood glucose (FBG)) or are dependent on a variable prandial state (random blood glucose (RBG)), erythrocyte physiology (HbA1c) or albumin turnover (fructosamine).OGTT profiles and the HbA1c. At 24-28 weeks gestation in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study, the proportion of women diagnosed by the fasting criterion alone ranged from 26% in Hong Kong to 74% in Barbados. 11 Therefore, dependence on FBG alone is problematic in multiethnic cities, such as Sydney and Melbourne. Even where populations are of largely European descent, a significant proportion (40-50%) of women with GDM will be missed with use of FBG alone. The FBG is particularly problematic in early pregnancy when it drops over time, making threshold definition difficult. 12 The HbA1c is also affected by ethnic differences in glycation and individual variation in red cell turnover 13 and has remarkably low sensitivity for IADPSGdefined GDM in both early and late pregnancy 14, 15 and for adverse pregnancy outcomes (as shown in the HAPO study 16 ).There have been several attempts to reduce the time burden of the OGTT, including either dropping the two-hour timepoint, which will miss ~12% of women with IADPSG-defined GDM, 17 or using an algorithmic approach to the FBG results. 18 temporary guidelines (Table 1) . Differences between 'optimal' thresholds using different datasets from different populations may at least partly explain this difference. Further issues with the FBGbased algorithm based approach arise from the need for rapid laboratory turnaround to prevent a return visit to the pathology centre requires a capability improbable in most centres. Therefore, two-step algorithms are associated with both delayed treatment and a proportion (estimated at 10%) not returning for the OGTT. 20 The use of point-of-care testing has been suggested, 18 but most glucose meters are relatively imprecise during pregnancy. 21 Table S1 shows some of the current temporary international guidelines for diagnosing GDM during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 19, [22] [23] [24] [25] Various options for the diagnosis of early/booking GDM are recommended, including HbA1c, RBG and immediate self blood glucose monitoring (SBGM). In early pregnancy, all recommend the use of HbA1c ≥ 5.9% (41 mmol/mol), with RBG and FBG as possible alternatives. The purpose of early testing is to identify undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. In Australia, ADIPS 19 also targets milder forms of hyperglycaemia in early pregnancy, although without defining the exact thresholds for diagnosis/treatment, currently the focus of the Treatment Of Booking GDM (TOBOGM) randomised controlled trial. 26 25 whereas ADIPS recommends an FBG-based two-step algorithm. 19 Unpublished data from four Sydney public hospitals with multiethnic catchments indicate sensitivities of 38-64% for RANZCOG's approach, and 60-80% for ADIPS' approach, the latter of which is anticipated to reduce the OGTT rate by 82% (Table 1) .Both the pre-SARS-CoV-2 Canadian and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence diagnostic approaches were already substantially less sensitive for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes than the IADPSG/ADIPS criteria used in Australia. 17 However, unless laboratories are able to perform an FBG with fast turnaround, the ADIPS approach falls FBG to the diabetes specialist clinic for 1-2 weeks of SBGM. This approach will lead to a proportion of women without GDM undertaking SBGM (a relatively costly activity) and increased work for diabetes specialist teams (although women with past GDM will already be familiar with SBGM and will need less time/input).Post-partum testing policy in Australia and Canada is generally to await the end of the pandemic before re-testing, unless women have a high short-term risk of type two diabetes, in which case, ADIPS recommends measurement of HbA1c 4-6 months post-partum if undertaking an OGTT remains a risk.All organisations are to be commended for releasing guidance within weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Each has attempted to reduce contagion exposure through combining F I G U R E 1 Alternative pathway if OGTT not appropriate (eg lab crowding) or declined. GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; FBG, fasting blood glucose; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; RGB, random blood glucose different non-OGTT testing approaches, which will inevitably reduce the sensitivity of diagnosing GDM. The reliance on the HbA1c, a low sensitivity, high specificity test, is likely to have a particular impact in this regard. [12] [13] [14] [15] Conversely, of the women with prior GDM, 30-70% will be commenced on SBGM despite GDM not being present, with resultant increasing costs, diabetes service workload and potentially over-medicalising some pregnancies. 27Australia and it is recommended that more emphasis be placed on encouraging organisations and practitioners, in collaboration with the women, to choose the GDM diagnostic pathway that best suits their population and situation. In many collection centres, there is sufficient room for adherence to social distancing rules and for the OGTT to occur.Two major refinements could be made to the temporary ADIPS guidelines for women who decline the OGTT and/or where risk of contagion is significant (Figure 1) . Firstly, adding an RBG ≥ 9.0 mmol/L or FBG ≥ 6.1 mmol/L 12 to early HbA1c testing would ensure that more high-risk women are identified. 28 Secondly, at 24-28 weeks gestation, while the temporary ADIPS guidelines are the most sensitive, they still require the woman to return for an OGTT if the FBG is 4.7-5.0 mmol/L. A better approach might be to ask the woman whether she would prefer (after advising that there is a possibility of the diagnosis being missed with any of the abridged forms of testing):• The full OGTT with attendance of 2-2.5 hours (100% sensitivity).Women could perhaps be allowed to wait outside the collection centre, such as in their own car, which may reduce the sensitivity (inaccurate timing and physical activity) but may be more acceptable to some women. (Some laboratories may also baulk at not being able to observe women for adverse effects of a glucose load.)• A one-hour 75 g OGTT with attendance of just over one hour (88-91% sensitivity based upon unpublished data from two hospitals in Greater Western Sydney and HAPO 11 ).• An FBG only with attendance of <15 minutes (38-64% sensitivity;current RANZCOG advice) with a need for 18% of women to return for an OGTT (60-80% sensitivity; current ADIPS advice).Offering such options may be particularly difficult for those women who do not have English as a first language, or with health literacy or cultural barriers, but could be supported by a pictorial guide. Organisational/ clinician decision-making can be supported by a risk guide (Table 2) . Alternatively, each organisation may decide to select one of these as the default option most appropriate for their population and logistics. FBG, fasting blood glucose; GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; SBGM, self blood glucose monitoring. †Assumes 10% GDM: number needed to treat to avoid one severe adverse perinatal outcome (death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture, and nerve palsy) was 1:34 in the Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study in Pregnant Women Trial (5) ‡Particularly in Asian communities.During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we need to find a balance between reducing the exposure of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and still enabling early screening for 'diabetes in pregnancy' and 24-28 weeks screening for GDM, both of which we know lead to improved pregnancy outcomes. Where pathology centres can allow sufficient social distancing, the OGTT remains the gold standard for diagnosis throughout pregnancy and, as ADIPS suggests, should still be offered to all women. If social distancing requirements cannot be observed, there are alternative diagnostic approaches, which should identify the majority of women with GDM while limiting the potential within-laboratory exposure to the virus. It is essential that organisations and practitioners be supported to choose the GDM diagnostic pathway which best suits their population and situation.","Australia","first author","2020-08-10",8

The Royal Flying Doctor Service, Queensland Section 6. The Royal Flying Doctor Service","The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in Wuhan China, and spread globally affecting millions of people. The major symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include fever, cough, muscular soreness, and dyspnea, 1 with most deaths occurring in older patients with at least one comorbidity. 2 The current median reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 is estimated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be 1.95, however recent studies indicate it could be closer to 2.79. 3 The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11 2020. 4 COVID-19 rapidly spread throughout the world, with 118 319 cases reported on March 11 rising to more than 17 million by the end of July 2020. 5 The rapid spread of COVID-19 led to many countries to close their borders to international travel and impose social distancing and lockdown isolation measures, aimed at reducing or minimising community transmition. 4 Lockdown measures differed slightly between geographic areas throughout Australia, however generally included: closures of non-essential business, working from home, national/state border closures, interpersonal social distancing, curfews, limitations on outdoor activities, school closures, personal hygiene measures, and recommendations associated with the use of PPE. Fines were issued for any major breeches.The public health measures associated with controlling the virus, led to widespread economic disruptions, 6 and potentially positive environmental impacts, 7, 8 such as reduce carbon emissions due to reduced travel. The global lockdown has also effected population health in other ways, such as reduced influenza transmission, 9 reduced accidents and injuries, 10 and potentially reduced preterm labour. 11 Many of these reports are anecdotal observations, however it is likely that changes in the work environments, social interactions, and a focus of improved hand hygiene, has reduced overall exposure to other non-COVID infectious diseases.To date there has been little research that considers whether nationwide lockdowns contributes to changes in patient diagnostic reasons, including those who require emergency aeromedical retrieval.-whether the diagnostic proportions during the COVID-19 social lockdown/restriction period differed to patient diagnostic proportions seen in 2019.During the COVID-19 pandemic the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) has been tasked with transferring confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients throughout Australia, in addition to its normal activity of 30,000-35,000 aeromedical transfers per year. 12 Australian spans 7.69 million square kilometres, with the majority of the 2018 Australian population (n= 24,992,860) residing in major city areas (n = 18,003,544; 72.0%) or inner-regional areas (n = 4,445,356; 17.8%), with the remainder living in outer-regional (n = 2,052,366; 8.2%), remote (n = 291,213; 1.2%), and very remote (n = 200,381; 0.1%) areas. 13 With a fleet of 74 aircraft the RFDS provides extensive aeromedical retrieval for patients requiring treatment in innerregional or major city hospitals. 14We conducted an observational study with retrospective data collection to investigate the diagnostic reasons patients were accessing aeromedical services throughout Australia. This analysis included all aeromedical retrievals conducted by the RFDS from the 26 January to the 23 June 2020. To determine whether this pandemic period differed to the same period in 2019, we included data from the 26 January to the 23 June 2019 to allow comparison.An aeromedical retrieval was classified into two main categories, including primary evacuation (PE) (also known as primary retrieval) and inter-hospital transfer (IHT) (also known as a secondary retrieval). All repatriations were excluded from the analysis. A PE generally includes and medical doctor and a nurse, while an IHT generally only includes a nurse.To investigate the association between the time and differences in the rates and diagnostic reasons for people requiring aeromedical retrieval throughout Australia, each patient interaction was allocated to either pre-restriction, restriction/lockdown, and post-restriction time period depending on the date they received treatment. All three periods were chosen to last for 7-weeks and were defined as follows: pre-restriction chosen as the baseline period (28 January to 15 March); restriction from the time that Australia went into lockdown (16 March to 4 May) and post-restriction where restrictions were gradually eased (5 May to 23 June).The outcome measures were the number of patients across the 3 categories (each 7-weeks duration) were reported, and the proportions and percentages for the ICD-10 diagnosis and patient demographics, across the 3 periods studied.Continuous variables were summarised as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs).Categorical variables were summarised as counts and proportions. The association between the time period and the likelihood of requiring aeromedical retrieval due to a specific diagnostic reason in 2020 was investigated using logistic regression with magnitudes of association reported as odds ratios (ORs) with respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using prerestriction period as a reference category. No p-values for individual diagnostic categories are reported due to the number of categories investigated. 95% CIs that do not include 1 are indicative of statistical significance at two-sided threshold of 0.05. The frequency distribution of the air ambulance retrievals across the three studies were compared between 2019 and 2020, using Chi-square test. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 15IC statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) with graphs implemented in the statistical software package R version 3.5.1.This project was deemed a low-risk quality assurance project by the RFDS Clinical and Health Services Research Committee (CHSRC), which provides oversight for RFDS research projects.As this project involved routinely collected data, specific patient consent forms were not required.There were 16981 aeromedical retrievals throughout the 2020 study period including 1959 (11.5%) PEs, and 15022 IHTs (88.5%), as compared to 18125 retrievals consisting of 2337 (12.9%) PEs and 15788 (87.1%) IHTs during the same date range in the year 2019.The 2019 activity consistently increased across the 3 time periods from 5793 (32.0%), 6140 (33.9%), to 6192 (34.2%). However, in the pandemic study period there were observed differences in the distribution, in terms of the number of retrievals, with 5927 (34.9%), 5121 (30.2%), and 5933 (34.9%), prior, during, and following social isolation restrictions, respectively. The 2020 pandemic period resulted in a reduction in overall activity, as compared to the same time period in 2019. Historical trends were expected to increase with the Australian winter months (June, July, August), however the lockdown period resulted in a reduction in activity as compared to the same timeframe in the prior year (see Figure 2 ).The median population age during the 2020 pandemic study period was 52 years old (interquartile range [IQR] 29.0-69.0). There were 8283 (49.0%) males, 6399 (38.0%) females, and 2299 (13.5%) missing gender, with the male median age being 55 (IQR:55-70) and the female median age being 47 (IQR: 26-67) years old, with the female median age reflecting that many of the retrievals were related to pregnancy (n=639; 3.8%).The leading retrieval reasons throughout the study period included diseases of the circulatory system (n=3082; 18.15%), injury (n=2768; 16.3%), and diseases of the digestive system (n= 1535; 9.0%). The period of social isolation had significantly lower numbers of aeromedical retrieval (n= 5121; p<0.05), as compared to the pre-isolation period (n=5927). See Table 1 for diagnostic trends.There were 6 confirmed and 209 aeromedical COVID-19 cases, with the majority (n= 114; 53.0%) conducted during the social isolation period.Cardiovascular retrievals decreased in overall number during lockdown (n=945; 18.45%) however started to increase in number during the post-lockdown period (n=1143;19.3%).There was a decrease in number of retrievals for respiratory diseases during restriction and an increase in number during post-restriction. There were significantly lower odds of retrieval for respiratory diseases in the post-restriction period compared to pre-restriction, indicating a relative decrease of respiratory system retrievals compared to other reasons (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.67-0.93). The restriction (n=21; 5.5%) period had lower rates, while the post-restriction period had higher rates (n=31; 6.7%) of respiratory priority 1 patients, as compared to the prerestriction period (n= 30; 6.4%).The number of retrievals for diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue were similar in the restriction period, however in the post restriction period the number was higher than in the two prior periods as were the odds of retrieval (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.62-0.98) indicating a relative increase of retrievals in the post-restriction period. The number of retrievals for neoplasm were similar in the restriction period, however in the post restriction period the number was higher than in the two prior periods as were the odds of retrieval (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.04-1.64) indicating a relative increase of neoplasm retrievals in the post-restriction period.There was lower number of retrievals both in the restriction and the post-restriction period for the endocrine and metabolic diagnostic groups. The odds of retrieval for this diagnostic group in the restriction period was significantly lower than the odds in the pre-restriction period (OR 0.72 95% CI 0.53-0.98), indicating relative less retrievals for this diagnosis in the restriction period compared to the pre-restriction period.The number of retrievals for congenital conditions diagnosis was low across the three periods, however higher in the restriction and post-restriction period than in the pre-restriction period.The odds of retrievals for congenital conditions during the restriction period were significantly higher than in the pre-restriction period (OR 2.56 95% CI 1.39-4.71). The restriction (n=6; 1.6%) and post-restriction (n=3; 0.7%) period also had slightly higher rates of congenital priority 1 patients, as compared to the pre-restriction period (n= 2; 0.4%).As an essential service, the RFDS provides emergency aeromedical support throughout Australia, as reflected in recent COVID-19 activity reports. 16 The main findings from this paper indicated that there were relatively more retrievals for diseases of the circulatory system, and congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities, during the social isolation period compared to the pre-isolation period. During the post-isolation period there was an increase in number of retrievals for diseases of the circulatory system and for neoplasms, however a reduction for respiratory disease, and skin conditions. The increases of cardiovascular and neoplasm treatment during this period indicate a rebound effect in patients subsequently seeking treatment following social isolation. Furthermore, the decrease in respiratory and skin infections during the post-lockdown period may indicated that social distancing is also influencing other disease transmission rates, such as influenza.Many of the retrievals for the circulatory system were for ischaemic heart disease, such as acute myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. It is unclear why there were relatively less circulatory cases however a higher proportion during the lockdown period. This may reflect patients delaying early invention due to social isolation measures and limitations in accessing primary healthcare services. 17, 18 This appeared to be the case, as there were more circulatory system cases during the post-lockdown period.Future research should consider whether the overall numerical reductions in cardiovascular disease were due to less clinical cases, or a result of less people seeking treatment. Attention to the higher rates of congenital malformations of the circulatory system should also be considered in the context of future paediatric research. Future research should also consider social isolation trends within primary healthcare.","Australia","first author","2020-08-19",8

Helminth infections are known to be powerful modulators of the human immune response, and numerous studies now highlight the effects this may have on human infectious, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. We believe, however, that any interaction between pre-existing helminth infection and the subsequent severity of COVID-19 need not necessarily be a negative one, and theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that helminths may indeed have a mitigating effect.One of the clear predictors of severe COVID-19 that has emerged during the pandemic has been the presence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients contracting the virus. [2] These conditions are associated with the second week ""cytokine storm"" phenomenon [3] that often results in the need for ventilatory support and increased mortality, including in younger patients. These metabolic diseases are characterised by an inflammatory milieu, with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, many of which are also implicated in the severe form of COVID-19. Elevated levels of acute phase reactants and proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, IL-27, and TNF have been shown to be predictors of clinical deterioration and the onset of severe disease. Lymphopaenia (and, in particular, a reduction in regulatory T cells [Treg] numbers) and eosinopaenia are also closely associated with disease severity. [4] Epidemiological studies over the past decade have consistently reported an inverse relationship between a variety of chronic helminth infections and the presence of metabolic syndrome and T2DM, particularly in transitional societies in which both conditions are prevalent. [5] Recent reports have shown reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-23, IL-27, G-CSF, and GM-CSF in subjects with coexisting helminth infection and T2DM and a partial reversal of this effect following treatment of the worm infection. [6] In addition, chronic helminth infections are associated with increased numbers of Treg cells, M2 macrophages, and eosinophils. It is therefore feasible to propose that a reduced capacity for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and increased numbers of regulatory immune cells due to the immunomodulatory effects of pre-existing helminth infection could result in a reduced risk of severe COVID-19. Although the interaction between helminth infection and viral pneumonia is poorly defined, there is some evidence that helminth infection may moderate the process of pulmonary inflammation in viral infections. Some studies have suggested that helminth infection may impair responses to viral immunization [7] and viral infection [8] , but no clear clinical evidence exists that it acts to worsen outcomes. [9] The increased levels of IL-4 and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokines associated with chronic helminth infection) found in some studies [10] need not represent a virus induced pathological response but could instead reflect the normal regulatory and tissue-repair response to inflammation.Epidemiological studies of the prevalence of severe COVID-19 in societies in which helminth infection is common would clearly be of great interest, but currently, no reliable data exists. The pandemic has been most active in developed countries where helminth infection is rare, and the data coming from less-developed societies may be difficult to interpret given the early phase of the pandemic, the lack of extensive testing, unreliable information regarding case fatality rates and cause of death, and their generally younger populations with lower prevalence of metabolic disease and obesity. The numbers currently emerging from the WHO do not indicate a widespread increase in case fatality rates in the developing world, with the number of reported deaths being generally low. [11] We believe that, as the understanding of the mechanisms of severe COVID-19 evolves, there may be a case for exploring the possible effects of experimental helminth infection (EHI) on COVID-19 severity in a study setting. This is particularly so should the mechanism of severe disease rest principally in endothelial invasion and vascular injury secondary to unchecked inflammatory responses, rather than ongoing viral replication. [12] Although the outcomes of trials have been mixed [13] , experimental inoculation with the hookworm Necator americanus has been established as both practical and safe for use in study settings and has been successfully deployed in trials involving atopic and autoimmune disorders. [14] Importantly, no data exists studying the effect on metabolic outcomes, but one study is currently underway examining the effect of EHI on individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome. [15] In the present crisis, a prospective study examining the effect of EHI on subsequent severe COVID-19 could produce valuable insights into the immunology of this condition. Clearly, the design of such a study would pose considerable ethical and practical challenges. Experimental coronavirus infection would seem impossible, particularly given that the trial would logically target those at most risk of severe disease. A case-matched cohort study conducted at multiple locations around the world would require large numbers of subjects and would be dependent on the unpredictable future course of the pandemic. Nevertheless, such a trial could demonstrate a potential mitigation of severe disease in susceptible individuals and give some evidence-based guidance on how to best manage the helminth elimination programs currently operating in many countries as the pandemic unfolds over coming years.","Australia","first author","2020-08-17",8

The misery has been compounded by economic dislocation, including interruption of services and massive unemployment, bringing much social life to a halt and raising the possibility of widespread homelessness and starvation, even in wealthy, developed countries. The lockdown has kept elderly people alone and isolated in their homes; families are separated; children can't see their parents, and grandparents can't see their grandchildren. Schools and cultural and sporting activities have been suspended. As all this has happened, the police have been granted unprecedented powers. Citizens going about their business are stopped and questioned. Houses are raided. Democratic freedoms formerly taken for granted are suspended.These are, of course, all seriously negative outcomes, even if it is accepted that the extreme risks posed by the pandemic justify such exceptional measures. Further, it is widely agreed that both disease and the measures to respond to it will generate effects that most likely will endure long after the epidemic itself has passed. The mourning processes will take time, shattered lives will have to be pieced together, and the common spaces of economy and culture will need to be reconstructed. It may be that not all the freedoms and rights, many of them established out of years of struggle, will be restored. At the least, what will endure is the realization that a social order that had once seemed stable, predictable, and secure-if not just and equitable-is actually fragile and ephemeral. Many things will never be the same again.But perhaps this is not completely bad. It is possible that a rupturing of entrenched systems and processes, a challenging of certainties that seemed beyond question, a breach in the apparently inexorable continuity of the familiar, will not only interrupt pathways and passages we know well but also reveal hitherto obstructed, or obscure and hidden, new ones. Perhaps the disruption itself can open the way to an unexpected, even welcome, destabilization of old assumptions, habits, expectations, and values.Since the origins of modernity it is has been feared that the grey predictability of the everyday imposes a stultifying blanket over ethical life (Flaubert 2005 (Flaubert [1881 ). Despite the belief that the endless supplies of commodities have generated an irrefragable consensus comprising all levels of society, the relentless production process with its unceasing routines has created a weary sense that life has been drained of challenge, risk, renewal, and discovery. According to this view, the more organized and codified our lives become the more limited are our moral choices (Nietzsche 1974 (Nietzsche [1882 ; Marcuse 1964) .Despite its cultural force, however, this claim has never been true. It has never been the case that ordinary life has been completely stripped of the keenness of danger and unexpected challenges. Even in the morass of suburban conformism, people have still faced death and suffering, bereavement, and loss. They have still fallen in love, made love, betrayed and experienced betrayal, fallen ill, suffered desperately, and grieved for their loved ones, who themselves may have experienced great tragic loss. They have been called upon to display courage, and sometimes heroism, and to draw meaning out of the depths of despair. Even in the midst of suburban conformity, the tawdriness of the traffic jams, and the dullness of the routines, protocols, and neoliberal imperatives, a rich, if recondite, moral life has always survived (Komesaroff 2014, 254ff.) .Heroism may have survived within everyday life, even if it has remained constrained within the strict limits of the assumed consensus. But what is striking about COVID-19 is that it is precisely this consensus that has been disrupted, along with the stable order associated with it. An epidemic is commonly thought to be primarily a medical event, on a large scale: a mass collection of symptoms-of fevers, coughs, myalgias, advancing shortness of breath-linked to heroic technical interventions, followed by recovery or death. In reality, it is also a cultural phenomenon that acts on our relationships with each other and within and between communities. It can cause mass suffering and shared grieving, and it may also provoke large-scale local, national, and global turmoil.The complexity goes even further than this. An epidemic is an assemblage of different kinds of objectsbiological, social, cultural, and political. It is encountered at multiple levels, by individuals and their communities, at the level of knowledge and deep affective experience. And it can unleash wild forces which propagate like shock waves across multiple domains, destroying old structures, posing new challenges, and potentially opening the way for new, previously uncharted, possibilities. This is indeed the experience of the present pandemic. The sheer force of its impact has precipitated an unprecedented regime of authoritarian reaction. At the same time, however, it has also offered the hope of breaking the grip within which contemporary global society has been held. Its pure, unbounded excess of horror and death holds the promise of opening up new domains of moral experience, raising new questions and options. As in other times of exception, such as states of war, siege, or social upheaval, lines of cleavage are exposed in what had appeared to be an impregnable panoply of money and power. For a moment at least, an opportunity arises for renewed courage and imagination, moral restoration, a refreshment of the goals and purposes of ordinary life. In this way, it can provide a ""breath of light emerging out of the darkness"" (Blanchot 1980) . It may seem perverse to try to draw out positive outcomes from an unspeakable disaster, but new possibilities are being uncovered around the world. We have witnessed an upsurge of community action involving people for whom the concept of a social movement may formerly have been very foreign. Young people have committed themselves to prepare and deliver food to elderly, isolated, and homeless people. Groups have formed to ""adopt a grandparent"" (Mather 2020) , and to provide physical care and support, to offer hope and reassurance, to bake bread, and to make available shelter and accommodation for those in need (Bicycle NSW 2000; Cunningham 2020; Ellis 2020) . There are battles in supermarkets, but there is also generosity (Covid-19 Mutual Aid 2020; The Guardian 2020). Online parties, support groups, exercise classes-expressions of solidarity and resistance-have flourished (Butler 2020) .In many countries, healthcare workers, often viewed as well-paid functionaries of a cold and thankless system of power and privilege, have displayed devotion and personal courage, frequently risking their own lives to care for those affected, all too often at great personal cost to themselves and their families. In some places, the dullness of suburbia, rendered even more desolate by the bleakness of lockdown, has been enlivened by rooftop music and dance, sending sounds of joy mixed with defiance echoing through the streets (Agence France-Presse 2020; Langley and Coutts 2020; Kozlowska and Todd 2020) . In many countries, religious communities, sometimes accused of preaching anodyne ideologies characterized by hypocrisy and ressentiment, have on many occasions distinguished themselves by overcoming cultural and other barriers and displaying selfless service (Anglicare 2020; Press Trust of India 2020; Food Tank 2020).Old conflicts have been interrupted, with new possibilities of dialogue and reconciliation, in some cases previously considered unimaginable, opening up. The vicious drug trade in the favelas of Rio and elsewhere in Latin America has given way to solidarity and community protection (RioOnWatch 2020; Watson 2020; Semple and Ahmed 2020). ""People's peace talks"" have been attempted in Israel and Palestine (Dateline 2020).In these ways, in many places, seemingly against all the odds, the exigencies of disaster and lockdown have generated a rediscovery of the very values thought to have been mercilessly drained from social life. A moment of transcendence, considered by many to have been irrevocably extinguished, has been reignited (Marcuse 1968) . The consequences of this are yet to be elaborated. It is just possible that, in a bizarre and paradoxical way, COVID-19 will open a new space from which the thrall imposed by the globalized economy and the culture associated with it can be broken. Perhaps within this space, matters previously immune from questioning can be reopened to critical gaze. The refusal of governments to take effective action to limit climate change, long justified on the basis of supposed impossible risks to global political and economic relationships, has been exposed as unfounded. Indeed, the pandemic itself has cleared skies around the world (McMahon 2020), reduced pollution of waterways, and even returned dolphins to the canals of Venice (Pentreath 2020) , raising for many questions about which parts of the old regime should be restarted once the epidemic has come under control (Latour 2020) .It has to be admitted that the opposite is also true. It is not necessary to quote the many counterexamples to the positive threads listed above. Racism, xenophobia, narrow political ambition and expediency, profiteering, and exploitation undoubtedly still flourish-indeed, in many cases, especially in the United States, supercharged by extreme right-wing reactions to the public health restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the virus. Governments and economies dependent on violence, cruel exploitation, and naked military power continue to flourish, in some cases drawing even greater strength from the emergency. This is not the age of social movements, and there can be no suggestion that a brief upsurge of magnanimity and solidarity, even widely publicized through the power of social media, is likely on its own to acquire political force. There is no obvious pathway whereby momentary flashes of moral renewal can be converted into a process to unpick and unravel the Gordian knot of neoliberalism and managerialism.Maybe the most we can expect is that, proceeding from the unthinkability of despair (Adorno 1966, 385) , the crisis will bring to visibility a few things previously hidden from view and allow a few forgotten questions to be posed. If in this way the epidemic can deliver even a few ecstatic moments of possibility, if it may kindle through small sparks a slow fire that sustains the idea that we can live differently, then at least some hope may be preserved of a world more attuned to the needs of the vast majority of those who inhabit it.","Australia","first author","2020-08-25",8

Reviews describing the virus responsible for FIP as well as issues with diagnostics and therapeutics are available [1, 2] , providing an explanation as to why re-purposing drugs used in human medicine has been largely unsuccessful in treating FIP infected cats [1] . Recently, the use of antiviral therapies to alter the replication of virulent forms of feline coronavirus known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) has shown enormous hope for clinicians [3, 4] . However, veterinary access to these antiviral treatments is currently limited, leading to the global emergence of expensive, unregistered versions of these drugs without the necessary quality control assurances [4, 5] . Accordingly, the need for inexpensive, safe, antiviral medications to treat FIPV-infected cats remains.PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236754 August 5, 2020 1 / 10 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111Mefloquine is currently used for both prevention (as a monotherapy) and treatment (either alone, or in combination with artesunate) of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in humans [6] [7] [8] . It also has been shown to reduce the viral load of FIPV and feline calicivirus (FCV) at low concentrations in infected Crandell Rees feline kidney cells without cytotoxic effects [9, 10] . Using an in vitro assay, our team demonstrated that while mefloquine undergoes some phase I metabolism in cats, it does not undertake phase II glucuronidative metabolism in this species [11] . In anticipation of conducting in vivo clinical trials of mefloquine to treat FIPV-infected cats, mefloquine's plasma concentrations must be monitored to optimise the dosage regimen. Knowledge of the amount of drug bound to plasma proteins is also important when optimising dosage regimens as only the unbound (or free) fraction is therapeutically active [12, 13] . Although the plasma protein binding of mefloquine has been determined to be > 98% in humans [14] , its binding percentage in cats has not been reported. This information is particularly germane in any investigation of a potential FIP antiviral as FIP-affected cats have altered concentrations of the plasma proteins albumin (decreased) and globulins (elevated) compared to clinically normal cats [1, 15] . Consequently, the aim of this study was two-fold: first, to develop and validate a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method to detect mefloquine in feline plasma, and second, to determine the in vitro plasma protein binding of mefloquine in both clinically normal and FIP-affected cats.Mefloquine hydrochloride and verapamil hydrochloride (as the internal standard [IS]) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). HPLC grade methanol, HPLC grade acetonitrile, phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) and triethylamine were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia).Mefloquine and verapamil were quantified in feline plasma based on modified HPLC method [16] . The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-20AT delivery unit, DGU-20A3 HT degassing solvent delivery unit, SIL-20A auto injector, SPD-20A UV detector and CTO-20A column oven. Shimadzu LC Solution software version 1.24 (Kyoto, Japan) was used for chromatographic control, data collection and data processing. Chromatographic separation was performed with a Microsorb-MV C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5.0 μm; Varian, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia) with a 1.0 mm Optic-guard C18 pre-column (Choice Analytical, Thornleigh, NSW, Australia) under a pressure of 1,900 psi at 25˚C. The isocratic mobile phase consisted of a mixture of 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 1.0% triethylamine adjusted to pH 2.5 and acetonitrile and methanol (50:25:25, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 10 μL per sample. The diode array detector was set at a wavelength of 220 nm. The retention times of verapamil and mefloquine were approximately 8.5 and 14.5 minutes, respectively.Stock solutions of mefloquine and verapamil were prepared in 100% methanol and 100% acetonitrile, respectively, both at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Further working solutions of mefloquine were prepared in 100% methanol to achieve final concentrations of 500, 1,000, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000 and 50,000 ng/mL. Similarly, working solutions of verapamil were prepared in 100% acetonitrile to yield final concentrations of 12.5 μg/mL for the validation study and 5.0 μg/mL for the plasma protein binding study. Stock solutions and working solutions were stored at 4.0˚C prior to use. Blank, clinically normal, feline plasma was pooled (n > 5) and stored at -20˚C prior to use for preparation of standards and quality control (QC) samples. The origin of the plasma samples is described below. Mefloquine standard samples (50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,500 and 5,000 ng/mL) and three quality control samples (QC) (250, 1,000 and 5,000 ng/mL) were prepared by spiking 10 μL of prepared working solutions of mefloquine into 90 μL of blank feline plasma. The proteins within the plasma samples were extracted through simple protein precipitation. Specifically, 100 μL of acetonitrile, containing either 12.5 μg/mL of the IS for the validation study or 5.0 μg/mL of the IS for the plasma protein binding study, was added to the 100 μL feline plasma samples. The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for ten minutes to remove any particulates. The supernatant was injected into the HPLC system.Assay selectivity was established by analysing pooled (n > 5) blank, clinically normal, feline plasma to ensure that there were no endogenous interference peaks around the retention times of mefloquine and verapamil. Mefloquine concentrations were measured via standard curves performed on three replicates of each concentration of mefloquine (100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,500 and 5,000 ng/mL) on three consecutive days. A weighting factor (1/x) was used to assign the relative importance of the observations in the regression; in this case, to ensure that larger observations were not over-fitted. The theoretical lower limit of detection (LLOD, the lowest analyte concentration that can be distinguished from the assay background noise) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ, the lowest concentration at which an analyte can be reliably detected at a specified level of accuracy and precision) were estimated as follows [17] : LLOD = 3.3 x σ /S, where σ is the standard deviation of the y-intercepts from the regression lines and S is the mean slope of the calibration curves. Thereafter, the LLOQ was calculated using the formula LLOQ = 3 x LLOD. Acceptance criteria for the LLOQ was defined as precision with a CV � 15% and accuracy within ± 20% of nominal concentration with repeated analyses [18] . Intra-and inter-day precision, expressed as CV (%), were analysed from triplicates of QC samples (250, 1,000 and 5,000 ng/mL), both within a single day and on three consecutive days, respectively. Intra-and inter-day accuracy, expressed as bias, were determined by a percentage difference between the estimated value and the nominal value of mefloquine as follows: Bias (%) = 100 -(estimated value / nominal value × 100). Absolute recovery of mefloquine and IS were determined by comparing the peak area of pre-spiked plasma samples (n = 9) at concentrations of 250, 1,000 and 5,000 ng/mL with corresponding concentrations of mefloquine and IS in mobile phase. Each assay was conducted in triplicate.The linearity of the data was assessed through linear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism software version 8.1.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA).With owner verbal or written consent, blood was collected from both clinically normal and FIP-affected cats. The use of the residual plasma from this patient for this study was approved by The University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee (protocol: 2016/1027). The animals were considered clinically normal based on inclusion criteria modified from that of Norris et al. (2007) [19] . Specifically, the cats designated for inclusion as clinically normal subjects were systemically well and had their blood collected for purposes other than investigating a current illness. Examples of clinically normal cats included those presenting for annual examinations, routine vaccinations or for routine screening tests prior to sedation or general anaesthesia for de-sexing, grooming, routine dental scaling or radiography post-acute trauma [19] . In contrast, a cat's FIP status was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence of effusion samples and immunohistochemistry on tissue samples (n = 5), or simply immunohistochemistry (n = 5) using methods outlined by Worthing et al. (2012) [20] . Additionally, other haematological tests were performed including quantification of albumin: globulin which was consistent with the hyperglobulinaemia observed with cats infected with FIPV [15] . All plasma samples were stored at -20˚C prior to analysis. Plasma samples from both clinically normal and FIP-affected cats were provided by the Paddington Cat Hospital (Sydney, NSW) and the Veterinary Pathology and Diagnostic Service, Sydney School of Veterinary Science.The in vitro plasma protein binding (PPB) of mefloquine was determined by the rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) method. The RED assay was performed according to manufacturer's (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Macquarie Park) instructions. Pooled plasma samples (n > 5) were assigned to one of two experimental groups, depending on health status, i.e., either clinically normal cat plasma or FIP-affected plasma. Prior to experimentation, the pH of the pooled plasma (approximately pH 8) was adjusted to pH 7.3 [21] , to mimic the physiologic pH of cats. Likewise, the total protein (TP), albumin and globulin concentrations of the pooled plasma samples were quantified prior to the assay by the VPDS using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Konelab PRIME 30i analyzer (Scoresby, VIC, Australia) employing conventional protocols.For each experimental group, two final concentrations of mefloquine (either 5,000 or 10,000 ng/mL) were tested using three replicates for each concentration. These concentrations were selected as they are comparable to the 10 μM concentration (10 μM = 3.78 μg/mL or 3,780 ng/mL) tested by McDonagh et al. (2014) [10] in FIPV-infected Crandell Rees feline kidney cells. Accordingly, 300 μL of plasma pre-spiked with mefloquine was added to the redringed chamber of the RED device whilst 550 μL of PBS was added to the white-ringed chamber. The unit was covered with sealing tape (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby, VIC, Australia, Product No. 15036) and incubated on an orbital shaker at 250 rpm for four hours. The temperature was set at 38˚C to mimic the normal body temperature of cats. Following incubation, 100 μL of post-dialysis samples were removed from the red-ringed chambers. These samples were then placed in separate microcentrifuge tubes and precipitated using 100 μL of chilled acetonitrile pre-spiked with the IS (5.0 μg/mL verapamil). After vortexing, the mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for ten minutes. The supernatant was injected into the HPLC system. Similarly, 200 μL volumes of post-dialysis samples were removed from the whiteringed chambers. These samples also underwent HPLC analysis. All samples were prepared and analysed in triplicate. The PPB of mefloquine was determined by the following equation:%Free ¼ ðConcentration buffer chamber=Concentration plasma chamberÞ � 100% %Bound ¼ 100 À %FreeStatistical data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 8.1.1 (Graph Pad Software, Inc., CA, USA). Prior to parametric testing, a Shapiro-Wilk normality test performed on the mefloquine PPB data indicated a normal distribution. Likewise, an inspection of a normal quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of this data further corroborated its normality. A twoway ANOVA evaluating the effects of health status and drug concentration on mefloquine PPB was performed. Results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.Based on the UV spectra, the greatest area under the mefloquine peak was at a wavelength of 220 nm. The retention times of the IS and mefloquine were approximately 8.5 and 14.5 minutes, respectively. No endogenous interference was observed at the retention times of mefloquine and the IS. Chromatograms of feline plasma pre-spiked with mefloquine and the IS as well as blank feline plasma are shown in Fig 1. Selectivity. Pooled blank feline plasma and feline plasma pre-spiked with mefloquine (250, 1,000 and 5,000 ng/mL) and the IS (12.5 μg/mL) were used to check the selectivity of this method. Due to the limited volume of FIP-affected feline plasma available, only blank plasma of clinically normal cats was used. As demonstrated in Fig 1, no endogenous plasma components interfered with elution of analytes. Linearity, LLOD, LLOQ, accuracy and precision. The plasma peak ratio (area of mefloquine divided by the IS area) versus the concentration was plotted and determined to be linear for the concentration range used (100 to 5,000 ng/mL). The mean regression standard curves (n = 3) for mefloquine were described as y = 9.374 e-005 x + 0.001417, with a weighting factor of 1/x. The correlation coefficient value (r 2 ) for each curve � 0.97. Estimated from standard curves, the LLOD for mefloquine was 20.5 ng/mL and the LLOQ was 61.5 ng/mL. However, as mefloquine concentrations < 250 ng/mL were not accurate (>20% accuracy), the LLOQ was set as 250 ng/mL. Intra-and inter-day precision expressed as CVs ranged from 5.30 to 8.74% and 3.77 to 6.32%, respectively. Intra-and inter-day accuracy expressed as a percentage of the bias ranged from -12.67 to 13.96% and -15.01 to 9.04%, respectively. These values satisfied the guidelines regarding assay reliability [18] . Intra-and inter-day precision and accuracy are summarised in Table 1 .Drug recovery from plasma. The absolute recovery rates of mefloquine expressed as percentages ± standard deviation (S.D.) from the 250, 1,000, and 5,000 ng/mL QC samples (n = 3) were 107.82 ± 5.93; 99.91 ± 5.58; and 105.21 ± 6.32, respectively. The absolute recovery rate of the IS expressed as a percentage ± S.D. was 123.74 ± 3.77 (n = 9).In vitro plasma protein binding of mefloquine in healthy and FIP-affected cats. The measured concentrations of total protein, albumin and globulin in the pooled plasma for the respective experimental groups are provided in Table 2 . Although reference intervals (RI) vary depending on the laboratory and the methodology used for quantification, reference intervals from Cornell University's Animal Health Diagnostic Center [22] were used as none were provided by the testing laboratory.The results of in vitro plasma protein binding of mefloquine in clinically normal and FIPaffected cats are provided in Table 3 .A significant difference was found between the plasma protein binding of mefloquine in clinically normal and FIP-affected cats (p = 0.0004), even though mefloquine was determined to be highly plasma protein bound (on average > 99%) in both groups. Moreover, a significant interaction effect between health status and mefloquine concentration was identified (p = 0.0007). In contrast, no significant difference was discovered between the plasma protein binding of the two concentrations of mefloquine (p = 0.11).There has been recent interest in the suitability of mefloquine as an antiviral treatment for FIP [9, 10, 23] . The majority of publications that detect and quantify mefloquine use liquid chromatography. Liquid chromatography demonstrates good sensitivity (i.e., it can detect low concentrations of mefloquine), is highly specific and the machinery is affordable for veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Although an HPLC assay to detect mefloquine in an in vitro matrix has been reported [23] , in contrast, this study describes an assay to quantify mefloquine Table 1 . Intra-and inter-day precision and accuracy for the QC samples (250, 1000 and 5000 ng/mL of mefloquine) tested in triplicate for each concentration. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of mefloquine PPB in a non-human species. This study provides the novel finding that mefloquine is highly plasma protein bound in cats. In humans, mefloquine is also highly plasma protein bound (> 98%) [14] , which may account, in part, for its long half-life of approximately three weeks in healthy human subjects [24] . High plasma protein binding can result in the drug-protein complex acting as a reservoir for the physiologically active free drug concentration and consequently prolonging its duration of action [12, 25] . Likewise, it should not be assumed that a drugs' PPB is constant across species [25] . In a comparative species study investigating the plasma protein binding of 574 compounds, drugs tend to be slightly more bound in human plasma proteins in comparison to the plasma proteins of rats, mice and dogs [26] . Some of the compounds that showed significant interspecies differences in plasma protein binding included diazepam (98% PPB in humans versus 84.8% in rats), prazosin (94.7% PPB in humans versus 65% in rats versus 63% in dogs) and sildenafil (93.6% PPB in humans versus 74% in dogs) [26] .Diseases, such as FIP, can alter the concentrations of plasma proteins and in turn impact upon a drug's plasma protein binding and ultimately its therapeutic efficacy [27] . For example, in humans, the proteins albumin and α 1 -acid glycoprotein (AAG) provide the largest contribution to the protein binding of drugs [27, 28] . Yet, with acute falciparum malaria, serum concentrations of AAG in non-immune human patients increase two-fold within 24 hours whereas plasma levels of albumin decrease by 30% [29] . Likewise, in FIP-affected cats, common serum protein abnormalities may include elevated AAG [30] and globulin levels [1, 15] as well as decreased albumin levels and a low A: G ratio [15] . Here, as described in the literature, the confirmed FIP plasma samples demonstrated elevated globulin and decreased albumin levels as well as a low A: G ratio.Mefloquine has a high affinity for AAG binding, preferentially binding to AAG over albumin [27] . Thus, if more AAG is present in FIP-affected cats, it may be preferentially bound by mefloquine. Yet, small changes in the unbound drug fraction of highly protein bound drugs can have a significant therapeutic impact [28] . For example, the reduction of PPB from 99.9% to 99.8% can lead to a doubling of therapeutically active unbound drug concentration in plasma [28] . Here, although a significant difference was found between the plasma protein binding of mefloquine in clinically normal and FIP-affected cats, due to the unknown biological variability of the assay, it is likely that this difference is equivocal. Fundamentally, it is difficult to generalise from two pooled plasma samples to two populations of individuals since the biological variability in each population is unknown. The variability (standard deviation) used to evaluate differences in PPB were derived from the assay method and do not represent biological differences. Yet, it is also unlikely that further in vitro mefloquine feline plasma protein binding studies will resolve this issue. On the contrary, observing the clinical response of mefloquine in FIP-affected animals ultimately may decide mefloquine's therapeutic efficacy in this patient population.In vitro studies to quantify plasma protein binding have some limitations. Whilst the major advantage of the RED method include its speed, simplicity, reliability and cost-effectiveness [31] , its drawbacks, which also serve as limitations to this study, involve nonspecific membrane binding of the drug [31] as well as changes in oncotic pressure leading to an overestimation of unbound drug concentration [32] . Moreover, in vitro PPB may not mirror in vivo PPB in the live animal as the structure of the plasma proteins and their affinity to bind substrates can vary with age, disease and /or presence of competing endogenous and exogenous compounds such as dietary constituents or other therapeutic drugs [33, 34] . Furthermore, the drug-protein dissociation rate, which can also greatly affect highly PPB drugs [35] , was not determined in this study. Likewise, an additional limitation to this project was the scarcity of confirmed FIPaffected plasma as this impacted upon its availability for use in both the HPLC validation and PPB protocols. Finally, given mefloquine's purported mechanism of action as a schizonticide, another potential limitation concerns the effects of the intraerythrocytic accumulation of mefloquine on plasma protein binding. However, previous studies have demonstrated that red blood cells do not serve as a significant depot for mefloquine [36, 37] .Recently, the broad spectrum coronavirus protease inhibitor, GC376 [38] , and the adenosine nucleoside analogue, GS-441524 [3, 4] have been shown to be safe and efficacious antiviral agents for use against FIPV. Yet, as neither of these agents has obtained registration for veterinary use, investigations into more readily available drugs with anti-FIPV activity, such as mefloquine, are urgently required for this invariably fatal disease. This study has validated an accurate and reliable assay to detect mefloquine in feline plasma and demonstrated that mefloquine is highly plasma protein bound in both clinically normal and FIP-affected cats. Further studies describing mefloquine's pharmacokinetic profile in the cat should be progressed. ","Australia","first author","2020-08-05",8

In response to this decision, teaching of all practical based content was moved online for all students. The first question was, how do we teach practical content online? And secondly, how do we teach handson skills? The first question was addressed using a suite of online simulations, progressively developed since 2013. Simulations are widely used and shown to be useful as teaching aids in STEM. A total of five simulations were introduced each covering key aspects of laboratory practice, including fundamental mathematical skills, reading, and setting a pipette, basic Biochemistry assays, protein quantification, and enzyme kinetics. The second issue of teaching hands on skills was addressed once restrictions were eased. Students were invited to attend the laboratory to learn the kinesthetic skills with instructor guidance. Both approaches used proved to be highly effective and can be readily adapted not only to teaching Biochemistry, but any aspect of science education.biochemistry education, undergraduate, using simulation and internet resources for teaching At the University of South Australia (UniSA), Biochemistry is a second year undergraduate course. The student cohort is diverse, with students enrolled in courses with a laboratory focus, such as Laboratory Medicine, Medical Science, Nutrition and Food Science and Pharmaceutical Science. The course is taught in a traditional manner, with weekly lectures, fortnightly tutorials and three practical sessions. In response to the growing numbers of COVID-19 cases, in mid-March the University leadership moved to cease face-to-face teaching. By this time, 58 of 96 students had completed the first two (of three) face-toface laboratory practicals. In response to this decision, teaching of all practical based content was moved online for all students. The first question was, how do we teach practical content online? And secondly, how do we teach hands-on skills? The first question was addressed using a suite of online simulations, progressively developed since 2013. Simulations are widely used and shown to be useful as teaching aids in STEM. 1 A total of five simulations were introduced each covering key aspects of laboratory practice, including fundamental mathematical skills, reading and setting a pipette, basic Biochemistry assays, protein quantification and enzyme kinetics. The second issue of teaching hands on skills was addressed once restrictions were eased. Students were invited to attend the laboratory to learn the kinesthetic skills with instructor guidance. Both approaches used proved to be highly effective and can be readily adapted not only to teaching Biochemistry, but any aspect of science education.The first simulation developed in 2014 for teaching Biochemistry covered enzyme kinetics. Since its introduction, no student who has used the simulation has failed the written practical report. 2 Thus, there existed a robust evidence-base demonstrating that a simulation was educationally effective in teaching Biochemistry. Student feedback also showed that the simulation was valued as a learning resource: ""The sim was great, it's a new way to learn compared to what I am used to"" (Student comment). To deliver the remaining practicals, students used the simulations to complete the practical report sheets which had been populated with experimental data. These were then submitted and marked independently by two teaching staff.By late April, teaching restrictions were relaxed so there was an opportunity to teach hands-on skills. By this stage, all students had completed the online practicals, and their reports had been assessed. Practicals were repeated so students could learn hands-on skills that could not be taught using the simulations alone. Student feedback was highly encouraging with 12 students indicating they would attend. Overall, the two-staged approach worked very well, with all students completing the practicals. The background information provided in each simulation proved valuable since some of the content had not yet been taught in lectures (e.g., enzyme kinetics). When the scores for the practical one report were compared, there was no significant difference between students taught face-to-face (7 ± 1, mean ± SD, n = 55) compared to those that only used the simulation (7.3 ± 0.84, n = 28). For practical two, again no significant differences were noted (7 ± 1 and 7.1 ± 0.92), respectively. The use of simulations as an alternative to traditional teaching has broad applicability, with the simulations being used by academics from the University of Adelaide, University of Otago and University of Genoa. Student feedback from the hands-on session was highly positive, with students pleased to be offered a chance to learn important practical skills.In conclusion, the experience at UniSA has demonstrated that online simulations can be effectively used to teach Biochemistry laboratory concepts when face-to-face teaching is not possible. While online learning is becoming more widespread, we should not forget that students still value the provision of hands-on learning.ORCID Maurizio Costabile https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2162-6497","Australia","first author","2020-08-19",8

In tap water, the T 99 (99% or 2 log 10 reduction) of both human CoV 229E and FIPV 142 were lower at 23°C (7-9 days) than 4°C (87 days). The inactivation rates of both these viruses were 143 greater in filtered tap water compared to unfiltered tap water at 23°C, suggesting increased protection There are critical gaps in our understanding of the persistence of enveloped viruses, and in 152 particular, SARS-CoV-2. The goal of this study was to compare the decay characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and MHV RNA using RT-qPCR, with attention to the effect of: (i) the water matrix (untreated 154 wastewater, autoclaved wastewater and dechlorinated tap water); (ii) environmentally relevant 155 temperatures (4, 15, 25 and 37°C); and, (iii) wastewater microbiota (comparison of untreated 156 wastewater and autoclaved wastewater) on the decay of the virus RNA.

Frail and elderly members of our community deserve to, and should, be looked after in the best possible way. (The Hon Richard Tracey AM RFD QC, Chair of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety.)Internationally residential aged care facilities (RACF) have emerged as 'ground zero' for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1 Residents often depend on prolonged close physical contact with caregivers, and many are cared for in close proximity to other residents. Facilities around the world are reporting overburdened, inadequately trained staff who may work at multiple facilities, increasing both their own risk of exposure and their capacity to transmit the highly contagious virus. The physical infrastructure of RACF seldom allows isolating and there are reports that appropriate isolation has occurred only after a significant number of deaths. 2 Finally, older people can present with atypical symptoms and those with cognitive impairment may be less able to communicate their symptoms leading to a delayed diagnosis.More than 200 000 Australians currently live in RACF. 3 There are more than 2500 RACF in Australia, operated by private for-profit, government or community-based/charitable providers, funded by consumer contributions and $12.2 billion from the Australian Government annually. 4 Half of all facilities house over 60 residents. 3 In Australia there is no mandatory minimum qualification to work as a personal care worker in an RACF and there is no guarantee that a nurse will be on duty at all times. 4 Community concern about the care provided by the sector prompted the recent Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety (the Commission). In October 2019 the Commission released its Interim Report in which aged care in Australia was described as a 'Shocking Tale of Neglect'. The Commissioners found that a fundamental overhaul of design, objectives, regulation and funding of aged care in Australia is required. 4 This system now has to meet the challenge of COVID-19 with a funding increase of less than 3% to protect the most vulnerable Australians. 5 RACF residents who are at risk of becoming infected are more likely to develop severe illness or die due to age, medical comorbidities and frailty. Data from overseas demonstrate between 24-84% of all deaths from COVID-19 have been residents of RACF, the large variation due to inconsistencies in testing and reporting. 6 Locally there have already been several outbreaks, the most significant of which at the time of writing was at Newmarch House in Sydney, with 37 residents and 34 employees infected, including 17 residents' deaths. 7 The cause of this outbreak is under investigation.There are lessons from overseas experiences to prevent, prepare for and manage COVID-19 outbreaks in Australian RACF. Acknowledging that the physical environment and staffing of aged care facilities overseas varies, we have chosen to refer to all overseas facilities as RACF. One of the first recorded outbreaks in an RACF occurred in the US State of Washington. 8 Due to increasing numbers of cases almost all of the 82 residents at the facility were tested 14 days after the first case was identified. Of the 23 residents who tested positive, only 10 were symptomatic at the time of testing. A further 10 developed symptoms a week after testing. Widespread testing in Belgian RACF revealed that 73% of employees and 69% of residents who tested positive to COVID-19 were asymptomatic at the time of testing. 9 These studies suggest that strict infection prevention measures are needed even before a case of COVID-19 is identified clinically. Another US study demonstrated benefit from serial asymptomatic testing. Two asymptomatic cases were identified 2 weeks after transferring all residents with positive tests, excluding all staff who tested positive and implementing strict infection prevention measures. 10 In Italy, authors from the Observatory of Long Term Care reported that public and government attention was directed towards acute hospitals with little attention given to RACF. 11 This group identified three main issues leading to failure to contain the outbreak: first, inadequate communication and management guidelines for RACF; second, delay in the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to the sector; and third, failure to control the spread of the virus within facilities. As of 30 April 2020, 95% of people who died due to COVID-19 in Italy were aged over 60. 12 However, there are no accurate data on the proportion of these that were RACF residents.The UK government strategy to support RACF during the COVID-19 pandemic prioritised easing pressure on acute hospitals. Facilities were instructed to accept both new and returning residents despite their COVID-19 status and to institute appropriate infection prevention measures. The strategy included instruction on how to ensure adequate supply of PPE. 9 Despite this, RACF workers reported inadequate PPE supply in facilities that had accepted COVID-19 positive patients. 13 COVID-19 cases have occurred in over 2000 RACF in the UK with almost 15 000 deaths. 14 Singapore appears to be a success story with very low transmission rates within facilities and only four deaths at the time of writing. 15 Measures employed to prevent spread include the restriction and pre-screening of visitors and reduction in unnecessary transfer of patients between health facilities. All employees of RACF have been tested for COVID-19 and testing of all residents is underway. Facilities have been instructed to refer all patients with fever and respiratory illness to acute hospitals where they are isolated while awaiting testing. Documentation is required to confirm that returning residents do not have COVID-19. Over 2500 staff have been accommodated in hotels to reduce their interaction with the community and therefore their risk of exposure.At present there have been no infections or deaths in RACF in Hong Kong. Officials have postponed all nonurgent medical services, supplied all facilities with PPE at no cost and restricted residents' movements within facilities. 16 A special allowance has been paid for workforce support, recognising more staff are required due to decreased family care visits and to account for increased sick leave during the pandemic. Each facility has a trained 'infection controller' who oversees infection prevention. 14 Residents who have attended hospitals are unable to return until they have undergone a strict quarantine.As social and physical distancing changes, there is an urgent question of how to protect and care for Australian aged care residents. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia has released National Guidelines for the Prevention, Control and Public Health Management of COVID-19 Outbreaks in Residential Care Facilities. 17 The guidelines state that it is the primary responsibility of the RACF to manage a COVID-19 outbreak. The vast majority of RACF in Australia are private entities but holding individual facilities primarily responsible must be interpreted in the context of the Commission's recent finding of a system that 'lacks transparency in communication, reporting and accountability', 4 three essential features of disease outbreak management. The guidelines clarify that 'state health authorities will act in an advisory role to assist RACF to detect, characterise and manage COVID-19 outbreaks'. 17 This is profoundly inadequate due to the high rate of asymptomatic transmission and the limited capacity of RACF to manage outbreaks. There is currently no enforcement of the sector's compliance with published guidelines and there are concerns that visitor restrictions have further reduced oversight of the sector.There are concerns about the sector's ability to care for sick and dying residents, as highlighted by disturbing international reports of RACF residents being left abandoned or dead in facilities. 16 The Commission's Interim Report comments on inadequate staffing leading to 'basic standards often not being met', a concerning finding when health facilities are expecting absenteeism of up to 30% at the peak of an outbreak. 4 There are also concerns about how RACF will care for confused, wandering or aggressive COVID-19 patients given the high rates of restrictive practices described in the Commission's Interim Report.Our discussion focusses on suggested changes to the workforce, testing and location of care.Current workforce practices in the aged care sector present challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in RACF. Overseas experience suggests that staff should only work at one facility and should not be involved in community care. If this is not possible, staff should be required to complete a register of all facilities at which they work. A centralised government-funded pool of appropriately trained staff skilled in both infection prevention and care of the elderly would have been useful to deploy at Newmarch House during the outbreak as many of their staff were required to quarantine. 18 All RACF staff must receive education about the importance of not attending work while unwell and should have access to paid sick leave if required to quarantine including those employed on a casual or temporary basis.There needs to be widespread testing with a low threshold to test and accessible on-site testing. If a single case of COVID-19 is confirmed, all staff and residents should be tested regardless of symptom status. Consideration should be given to testing of asymptomatic staff even in the absence of a case. Testing of asymptomatic residents could also be considered. Use of contact and droplet precautions for all residents should be implemented when a resident has been tested until results are available. Because of this, there must be centralised coordination of PPE acquisition and delivery to ensure each facility has a stockpile of appropriate PPE available on site. All staff require frequent training in the use of PPE including simulating care in isolation rooms.Current Australian guidelines recommend transfer of a RACF resident to hospital only if the resident's condition requires it. This recommendation is now worth reconsidering for two reasons. First, it is clear from international experience that inadequate outbreak management in an RACF is likely to lead to high mortality and broader community transmission. This may lead to a higher burden on hospitals than accepting the care of RACF residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Second, our acute care setting now has additional capacity and far greater expertise in infection prevention and management than RACF.There are three options for management of COVID-19 infections in RACF residents. The first is to transfer all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases to an acute hospital setting. This overcomes the limitations of the physical infrastructure of RACF and places the burden of prevention of spread of infection on expert services. The potential harm to the individual (i.e. falls and delirium in an unfamiliar hospital environment) must be balanced against benefit to the community. When reviewing advanced care plans with residents, health care workers should make residents and their families aware of their facility's capacity to isolate them effectively in the event of acquiring COVID-19 so that any transfer to hospital is anticipated. The South Australian Government has recently announced that all COVID-19 positive residents will be transferred immediately to hospital by ambulance. They have considered Advanced Care Directives as not binding in the event of a pandemic emergency. 19 Residents confirmed to have COVID-19 could remain in hospital until they have completed their isolation period unless the health service and RACF are confident they can be effectively isolated at the RACF.Two other options could be considered if the health care system were to become overwhelmed and rationing required limiting access to hospitals: cohorting to specific COVID-19 facilities and cohorting within the resident's own RACF. Both would require a highly trained, mobile workforce available to be deployed at the beginning of an outbreak. Cohorting to a specific COVID-19 facility would require exposing residents to new unfamiliar environments as they would be if transferred to hospital. Cohorting infected residents within their own facility would not completely remove the risk they pose to other residents. There are multiple examples now that local cohorting places a vulnerable population at great risk for significant morbidity and mortality. Should our health services be overwhelmed by a pandemic wave, specialist facilities established in collaboration with hospital services could care for COVID-19 positive residents.RACF are required to provide skilled care for a unique, highly dependent population, making physical distancing impossible. Facilities have not been designed with infection prevention strategies in mind and staffing ratios are highly variable. The catastrophic outcomes of this infection in RACF around the world parallel the outcomes seen from cruise ships and urgent action is required to protect RACF residents, workers and the community at large.","Australia","first author","2020-08-10",8

By 1 June 2020, there were more than 6 million infections worldwide and over 371 100 deaths. 1 These figures are increasing daily and crude global mortality is estimated at 3-4% by the World Health Organization. 2 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characteristically presents with fever, cough and fatigue. A severe case is defined by progression to pneumonia with hypoxia, occurring in approximately 14% of infections. 3 In 5% of cases, this progresses to critical illness, with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock or other systemic complications, and usually requires mechanical ventilation. 3 The Australian Government introduced strict physical distancing measures in mid-March; since then the rate of new infections has been steadily declining. As of 1 June 2020, there were 7204 recorded cases and 103 deaths in Australia 4 -a mortality rate of 1.4%. While almost all Australian deaths have occurred in people aged 60 or older, the highest total number of infections exists in the 20-29-year-old age group 4 which overlaps with women of reproductive age. Clinical presentation in pregnancy, maternal outcomes and neonatal outcomes of COVID- 19 infection are yet to be thoroughly understood. Furthermore, the potential for SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is currently uncertain.Other viral illnesses in pregnancy have shown disproportionately high rates of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. In 2010 a US study revealed that 5% of all deaths to H1N1 influenza occurred in pregnant patients, while 23% of infected pregnant women required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 5 Seasonal influenza also poses an increased risk of preterm birth 6 and hospital admission, 7 particularly if contracted during the third trimester of pregnancy. 8 Severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS) exhibited a mortality rate of around 25% in pregnant women, with up to 50% of infected pregnant women requiring ICU admission. 9 In pregnancies complicated by Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS), fetal death in utero occurred at a rate of 30% while 33% of ongoing pregnancies were delivered preterm. 10 There is no evidence of in utero transmission from either SARS or MERS. 9, 10 The aims of this review are to: (i) describe what is known about COVID-19 clinical disease in pregnant women; (ii) discuss obstetric outcomes; (iii) describe the risk of vertical transmission; (iv) use this data to highlight management issues in the pregnant population; and (5) identify gaps in the existing knowledge.The EMBASE and Medline Ovid databases were searched on 18April, 18 May and 23 May 2020 using the keywords and Boolean terms 'coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR COVID 19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR n19-CoV' and subject headings 'pregnancy outcome' and 'pregnancy complications'. The full search strategy for both databases is listed in Data S1. A broad search of the World Health Organization 'Global literature on coronavirus disease' database was also conducted using the keywords 'pregnancy' and 'pregnant'. These platforms collectively returned 911 papers of intersymptomatic patients, fever was the most common sign, occurring in 10-100% of cases both at admission and postpartum. Only one study compared clinical symptoms between COVID-19 positive pregnant and non-pregnant groups: fever was less prevalent in pregnant than non-pregnant patients (44% vs 100%, P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in cough, dyspnoea or fatigue incidence. 34 Six studies universally tested all pregnant women at presentation with nasopharyngeal swab: Sutton et al. 12 , Gagliardi et al. 42 , Khalil et al. 43 , Vintzileos et al. 44 , Doria et al. 45 and Miller et al. 46 These papers reported asymptomatic infection in 43.5-92% of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.Maternal, obstetric and neonatal outcomes of rtPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients are listed in Table 2 . Of the 13 cohort studies that reported on disease severity, severe COVID-19 illness (pneumonia requiring oxygen support or noninvasive ventilation) occurred in 0-18% of patients. Critical disease (defined as progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis or acute organ dysfunction) was reported in 0-5% of cases.The exception to this was Pierce-Williams et al. 47 where severe and critical COVID-19 were, respectively, described in 69% and 31% of cases. A total of 111 severe and 40 critical cases were reported across the 13 cohort studies.Extrapulmonary complications occurred in some severe and critical patients, including cardiac impairment, renal failure and coagulopathy. 18, 40, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] Cardiomyopathy with global hypokinesis and moderately reduced ejection fraction on echocardiogram was reported in two patients. 49 Unless stated otherwise, all symptoms occurred at presentation.

Caesarean section was performed for over 40% of deliveries in all but five studies. 24, 39, 50, 57, 60 Nineteen neonates were SARS-CoV-2 positive, based on rtPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Three of these were febrile, 15 were asymptomatic and one was born at 31 +2 weeks; he developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) but was recovering at the time of publication. There were no reported deaths of SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates. Six neonates had Apgar scores of less than seven at either one or five minutes postpartum. Five of those were preterm while one was term and SARS-CoV-2 positive. Six deaths of SARS-CoV-2 negative neonates were reported, due to:multiple organ failure and DIC (n = 1), 61 preterm birth (n = 2), 48 severe neonatal asphyxia (n = 1), 52 pneumonia (visualised on chest X-ray) (n = 1) 18 and for unknown reasons (n = 1). 18 There were seven reported stillbirths: two for unclear reasons, 51,60 three following spontaneous labour in mechanically ventilated patients, 48 one due to acute maternal hypoxaemia necessitating delivery 48 and one due to preterm rupture of membranes. 48 There were five spontaneous miscarriages. Two occurred at 8 +0 weeks 54 and 17 +0 weeks, 62 while gestation was not reported for the other three. 48 The possibility of vertical transmission was assessed with rtPCR of neonatal nasopharyngeal secretions, placenta, cord blood, amniotic fluid and breastmilk (Table 3) where no evidence of vertical transmission exists. 74, 75 The timing of sampling and contact with the infected mother may be pivotal to ascertaining when this transmission occurred. Only Khan et al. 23 and Patane et al. 55 swered, and further systematic reviews will be required as more data is accumulated in this rapidly evolving pandemic.","Australia","first author","2020-08-10",8

HCoV are now known to be associated with several serious respiratory diseases, i.e., bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia, especially affecting elderly people and immunosuppressed patients. They have also been prevalent in nosocomial viral infections [1] . At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease was reported from China [2] . The virus causing COVID-19, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), quickly spread across the globe. As of early July 2020, more than 12 million people have been infected with more than 500,000 deaths [3] . The burden of the disease is increasing and impacting the global economy severely [4] . The absence of any vaccine to control COVID-19 has introduced numerous challenges for governments and health organisations [5] . Hence, the impact of such a pandemic has severely affected not only the economy but also the health systems of a large number of countries. The demographic attributes of any country such as population size and density, age structure, gender balance, etc., and socio-economic factors such as income, expenditure, and education can ultimately dictate not only how a virus may spread in a pandemic but also how effective each country's response is against the virus [6] . The prevailing infrastructure in a country will influence how well it is able to mitigate the impact of the virus and save lives. The development of a country's response or its required infrastructure is dependent upon the adoption of an overview or holistic ""risk"" analysis using each contributing factor, thereby enabling relevant agencies in those countries to pre-empt interventions or upgrades in specific areas and be better prepared to manage the pandemic. Therefore, the primary research aim of the analysis described in this paper was to determine or assess the level of mortality risk (both current as well as expected) of COVID-19 on a global scale in evolving circumstances using a multi-factor weighted strategy, where risk is defined as the probability and consequences of an unwanted and negative sequence of events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) exacted upon a country [7] .In prior literature, a number of interesting case studies have been presented that analyse the numerous demographic and socio-economic risk factors that influence the epidemiology of various pandemics or epidemics other than COVID-19. For example, population density is considered as a risk evaluation or ""forecasting"" measure in infectious diseases, driving economic growth and spending, impacting spatial spread [6] as well as dictating how practical social distancing measures can be in various regions [8] . The various strains of the influenza virus have been thoroughly studied in light of these and other socio-economic factors. Income, race, education, and spatial characteristics (such as where patients live; specific country, region, or suburb) have been shown to significantly be associated with the death rate of influenza (Type A) [9, 10] .Drops in temperature and rainfall have shown to correlate with the rate of increase in influenza (Type A) cases [11] . An independent study undertaken on the spread of pandemic influenza on board a New Zealand troop ship indicated that the age group of 25-34-year-old sailors displayed an increased mortality risk compared with those under 25 years of age [12] . Standard of living is also an important risk factor linked with the spread of an epidemic, as seen in the case of tuberculosis [13] or HIV [14] . Similar outcomes were observed with Ebola [15] where a comprehensive set of indicators, including social, economic, and cultural factors were proposed to create a risk evaluation and assessment framework for the virus. Such socio-economic risk factors are also understood to play a significant role in the emergence of other non-contagious conditions such as obesity [16] . With the rapid spread of COVID-19, different countries have adopted different response strategies to contain the spread and minimise the death toll. The efficacy of these interventions and the impact of COVID-19 is strongly associated with a number of socio-economic factors such as the vulnerability of the population [17] . Therefore, the aim of the work presented in this paper is to assess the mortality risk level of each country to COVID-19 as determined by a collage of static socio-economic factors, in combination with a range of dynamic epidemiological indicators.Prior work has attempted to understand the correlation between certain risk elements such as demographic variables and certain specific socio-economic factors (such as GDP and population density) towards COVID-19. Whilst this work was only restricted to specific regions or continents such as China [18] or Europe [19] , ultimately a global overview can be very insightful and telling. In the latter study for example, the predictive power of 10 socio-economic and demographic factors was analysed at different times in March 2020 for different European countries. Although this temporal layer is very welcome, a pre-COVID baseline risk determination is absconding. A similar study was conducted for Africa [20] . Therefore, as far as it is understood, a global overview or mortality risk evaluation of COVID-19 is absent with respect to a diverse range of socio-economic factors coupled with dynamic factors. Consequently, the aim of the analysis presented in this manuscript was to model a change in risk to establish whether countries were currently at a level of mortality risk consistent with their expectations.An analysis of prior work in the area of multi-criteria and factor association on pandemics revealed that demographics, economy, and health attributes were amongst the most commonly-used predictors of risk. Hence, three primary categories of factors were selected, namely: Demography (including total population, ratio of elderly above 65, population density, and disability-adjusted life years), economy (including gross domestic product, health expenditure), and health infrastructure (including total hospital beds, total physicians, and total nurses). This provided a total of nine static risk factors. These static indicators were used to compute a base mortality risk on a global scale. Further in the analysis, these risk factors were complimented with an additional six dynamic factors related to current COVID-19 spread (as at 13 May 2020), including current active cases, current susceptible population, three growth rates (recovered, confirmed, and mortality), and the prevailing stringency level imposed by the government in the country of interest.In this section, data collection and modelling aspects around the multi-factor weighted spatial analysis are described. The methodology of this paper is grounded in prior work, where regression and multi-factor analysis were used to assess the importance and risks of numerous variables in an epidemic [21] .Data was collected from multiple international organisations including the World Bank (WB), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Johns Hopkins University and Medicine (JHU), and Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). The dataset of the latest world political boundaries was downloaded from ESRI and prepared in ArcGIS environment with ISO-2Alpha and ISO 3-Alpha country codes. The primary data source for multiple socioeconomic indicators is the World Bank Data Centre [22] , which manages global data for each country in the form of more than 2000 development indicators. After reviewing the literature, GDP per capita and Current Health Expenditure (% of GDP) were chosen as measures of Economy. For the strength of health infrastructure, hospital beds (per 1000 people), physicians (per 1000 people), and nurses (per 1000 people) were considered. As a representation of demography, population and the most vulnerable segment of the population, i.e., population ages 65 and above (A65abp) were selected. Data were also collected for disability-adjusted life year (DALY) from [23] , which represents burden of diseases for every country. The urban population density for each country was also measured. In this regard, boundaries of urban areas from ESRI and a population density grid of 1x1 km from NASA [24] were downloaded. The average population density for each urban area was summarised and calculated and then the average of all urban areas in each country was computed. Disease vulnerability composite indexes (such as those mentioned in [20] ) were not pre-selected as they mainly relate to the spread of diseases and not the mortality risk. COVID-19 data as of 13 May 2020 was acquired from JHU [3] , which included four variables (active cases and three growth rates: Confirmed, recovered, and mortality). It was realised that these growth-related variables would effectively map COVID-19 current risk in a temporal sense as well. The fifth dynamic factor recognised was the susceptible population, which was considered as the percentage of the total population who was not infected yet.In order to capture governmental intervention strategies, the stringency index proposed as the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [25] was utilised as the sixth dynamic factor. This is defined as ""a policy stringency index (calculated) by combining 13 policy indicators, including school and workplace closures, travel bans, as well as fiscal policy measures"". To allow for the measures to take effect, and to give increased importance for measures taken earlier rather than later, the modelling considered a weighted average stringency level for 13 May 2020 based on a formula provided in literature [26, 27] . A total of 153 countries were represented in the analysis.In order to avoid scale diversification, prior factor normalisation is a common technique [28] . Normalisation was applied in three steps in the presented modelling setup. First, each variable other than the stringency and susceptible cases was converted into per capita or a larger unit of the population, such as per one thousand or million people. In the second step, Box-Cox transformation [29] was applied in R [30] for reducing the skewness in the data. Later in the third step, in order to manage the direction of association of factors with the mortality risk, 10 bins of each transformed variables were created. The bins were labelled on a 1-10 scale based on the direction of the significance to the risk (where 1 represent the lowest risk and 10 shows the highest risk). For instance, the higher the value of a factor represents a higher risk, so the labelled values follow the same trend i.e., lowest value of factor = 1 (the lowest value on the scale) and highest value of factor = 10 (the highest value on the scale). Conversely, based on the reverse relationship, labelled values are in the opposite direction i.e., the lowest value of a factor = 10 (highest value on scale) and the highest value of a factor = 1 (lowest value on the scale) (e.g., hospital beds). When a socio-economic or demographic factor was missing, it was replaced with its real value through a manual search of appropriate sources. All of the collected and transformed data were organised in ArcGIS and Excel files for easy interoperability between analytical and visualisation software.The model was executed as a three-step strategy. Firstly, in order to visualise a base mortality risk assessment (or pre-COVID mortality risk scenario) a multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) [31] was used to compute weights (relative importance) for the nine static indicators. The pair-wise comparison in AHP is a common technique to assess the significance of each indicator [32] with a tolerable degree of inconsistency in each pairwise comparison [33] . The first and second author independently evaluated the relative importance of the factors and the discrepancies were accordingly resolved. The relative importance of weights was handpicked in accordance with the analysis of research literature, which has established the impact of various indicators on COVID-19 mortality [26] . The computed weights are summarised in a table (see Table 1 ). The baseline scenario represented the health risk in general terms without focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. It showed the strength of each nation based on their economy, health infrastructure, and demography. Secondly, a multivariate linear regression model was conducted where the dependent variable was a normalised COVID-19 mortality for a country as of 13 May 2020. The independent variables were the nine static socio-economic factors described earlier. Thirdly, the regression model was repeated as mentioned in the second step but this time with the on-top addition of the six dynamic factors associated with COVID-19, giving a total of 15 independent variables. The third scenario that included COVID-19 related data alongside stringency data and static variables provided a reflection of the current pandemic state of the world.For the regression models, the regression predictors were then assessed for relative importance via assigning of weights using the relaimpo package [34] . Lastly, the weights obtained from the modelling were aggregated with their ranks in the form of a weighted sum (see Equation (1)):where, w = weight, a = rank value, i represents each country, and j represents each factor value of ith country. The main elements of the analysis are discussed using the results from the three steps in the modelling. Firstly, a spatial map was visualised to model the base risk on a global scale (see Figure 1 ), such that the base risk was computed using weights derived from the Analytic Hierarchy Process or Pairwise comparison. Countries such as Japan, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, and Finland were deemed to be at the highest mortality risk due to their large ratio of elderly population, emanating from the higher weight to the A65abp indicator in the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Several African countries were deemed to be less of a mortality risk due to their lower life expectancy and consequently lower proportion of elderly in the population. These countries included Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan, Senegal, etc. The second stage of the analysis was a linear regression model using nine static variables as independent factors and a COVID-19 normalised mortality on 13 May 2020 as the dependent variable. The results are referred to in a table (see Table 2 ). R 2 was such that it could explain 69% variance in the entire dataset. The ratio of the elderly in the population (or A65abp) emerged as a significant predictor. The GDP of countries and number of hospital beds were nearing that significance. Consequently, these predictors were also assigned higher relative weights by the relampo package in R; 19% for A65abp and 22% for GDP. As a means to check multicollinearity, the variance inflation factor for all predictor variables was lower than nine. Table 2 . Regression results for risk of mortality where for p-values ""***"" represents p < 0.001 m, ""**"" represents p < 0.01, and ""*"" represents p < 0.05. For the third step in the analysis, the regression modelling was repeated with the addition of six dynamic variables associated with COVID-19, giving a total of 15 independent variables. Then, the model was able to explain up to 88% variance in the data. The dynamic variables tended to heavily dominate over the static socio-economic factors with three dynamic factors having significant predictive power. The ratio of the elderly was yet again a significant predictor towards COVID-19 mortality risk as was the number of nurses. Furthermore, the government-enforced stringency level did not emerge as a significant predictor in this model. As a means to check multicollinearity, the variance inflation factor for all predictor variables (except GDP) was lower than 7. A table (see Table 3 ) is presented that summarises the top 10 countries sorted on the basis of the current mortality risk and their predicted risk ranking (both pre-COVID and on 13 May 2020) and the latter using the modelling analysis comprising of both static and dynamic indicators. The table shows that at least for this subset of 10 countries, they are at a COVID-19 mortality risk level where they were anticipated to be consistent with their baseline risk assessment. A spatial map illustrates the mortality risk of COVID-19 as predicted by the third step of the analysis (see Figure 2) . A spatial map was also drawn based on the change from baseline in COVID-19 mortality risk as projected from the linear regression modelling technique, which used a conglomerate of both static and dynamic factors (see Figure 3 ), essentially a difference between Figure 2 and 3) . The map clearly indicates that most countries were at a level of expected risk or lower risk on 13 May 2020 compared with what was originally predicted in the base scenario (noting how most countries are coloured in shades of yellow, orange, or green, which refers to a reduction or equivalence in risk from what was expected). All materials related to the modelling such as R code, output and base data is provided in the form of a supplementary file. The results show that only 44/153 countries experienced a more than 20% increase in COVID-19 related mortality risk as at 13 May 2020 when compared against their pre-COVID mortality risk assessment. Therefore, in general it can be ascertained that most countries have already experienced the worst of the pandemic and are now passing through lower levels of mortality risk. Eventually, either health systems have caught up with medications established, immunity has increased, or lockdown measures and quarantining has taken full effect resulting in a stability or decrease in mortality rate [35] . Furthermore, interesting yet subtle differences were observed in COVID-19 mortality risk in Western Europe. The pre-COVID base mortality risk showed that countries such as Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland were at a higher risk. However, the change in the mortality risk spatial map shows that most of these countries are now in a state of decreased risk. Countries such as Norway, the United Kingdom, and Spain also witnessed a decrease in mortality risk but not as extensive as other Western European countries. The nuances of social, cultural, and economic patterns in mainland Europe have been discussed in prior work [19] , where not only is the ratio of the elderly in the population emphasised but their social habits and family structure are also emphasised (that is, living alone or in a larger family, where both can lead to contagion). In summary, the results show that the ratio of the elderly appears to be a strong predictor for eventual COVID-19 mortality risk. However, this may be considered in light of household layout or ""co-residence patterns"" [27, 36] , where in countries with inter-generational cohabitants, indirect infections and deaths may occur.The risk change spatial map indicated that Central Africa was deemed to be in a position of higher risk and this may simply be that the peak of the pandemic was yet to hit in this region and had passed in regions such as Western Europe, North America, and far-Eastern Asia [37] . If developing countries such as those in Africa do not learn from the fate of those countries who suffered just recently due to the pandemic of COVID-19, they would be in further risk due to a lack of resources and weak health infrastructure. Prior work indicates through simulations that even though African countries may diagnose fewer absolute cases, they may face a higher mortality risk in comparison to European countries [27] . It is also noted that the predictive power of the regression model increased when a suite of both static and dynamic factors were used. The lower predictive power of the static socio-economic factors (only A65abp emerged as significant) highlights the need for a customised and tailored composite index for a risk assessment related to COVID-19, particularly for mortality. The weighted stringency level on 13 May 2020 of the countries in the sample was also not a significant predictor and this may have been due to the lower variation in the range of stringency globally. Around mid May, most countries had entered or were already in a state of advanced lockdown.Like any study of this nature, there are limitations to the analysis, which is susceptible to any abnormalities and uncertainties in the data. For example, testing rates and measurement protocols differ across each country. All COVID-19 data were acquired through JHU where micro level data of COVID-19 patients are not available for all countries. If available, indicators such as the number of ventilators available would also be very useful and significant. Similarly in the future, including cultural aspects such as the diversity in ethnicity or what vaccines [38] are prevalent in the country may reveal new association trends with the risk of COVID-19. Furthermore, as with any global overview, a micro-level discernment of trends is dearly missed as countries that are complex in their makeup are placed together, as if homogeneous in one regression model. This was evident, as in the subtle mortality risk differences across mainland Europe. It is important to also acknowledge certain susceptibilities of the modelling. The risk assessment is only seemingly applicable as of early May 2020 and cannot control for secondary peaks of COVID-19 cases, which would lead to a transition of risk. In addition, the risk modelling originated from the weighted strategy of nine static indicators. Although there has been an effort to control for biases and follow an informed process, the method may be considered as subjective. Lastly, the paper presents an assessment of risk that is based on levels and not probabilities and this can also be addressed in future work.In this paper, a mortality risk-based evaluation of COVID-19 on a global scale using data as at 13 May 2020 is presented. Using a multi-weighted approach, a range of unique scenarios using a mixture of static and dynamic variables were incorporated. The main finding was that the ratio of the elderly in a population clearly emerged as a significant mortality risk predictor for COVID-19, however this must be considered in light of the residency makeup of individual countries. In addition, a conglomerate of static socio-economic factors and dynamic factors associated with COVID-19 growth and spread had higher predictive capability. The current stringency of government-imposed restrictions was also not observed to have an impact. In general, as on 13 May 2020, from a spatial perspective the current mortality risk projections of COVID-19 may be considered as lower or as expected for most countries around the world.

Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8 + T-cell memory to shared peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2. Following re-infection, cross-reactive CD8 + T-cells enhance recovery and diminish clinical severity. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Nucleocapsid and Membrane proteins led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + and CD4 + Tcells in vitro, with CD4 + sets being typically robust. For CD8 + T-cells taken directly ex vivo, we identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, A2/S 269-277 and A2/Orf1ab 3183-3191 . Using peptide-HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of the A2/S 269 + CD8 + and A2/Orf1ab 3183 + CD8 + populations indicated that the more prominent A2/S 269 + CD8 + set was detected at comparable frequency (∼1.3x10 -5 ) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01 + patients. But, while the numbers were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01 + donors (∼2.5x10 -6 ), they were low when compared with frequencies for influenza-specific (A2/M1 58 ) and EBV-specific (A2/BMLF 1280 ) (∼1.38x10 -4 ) populations. Phenotypic analysis ex vivo of A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells from COVID-19 convalescents showed that A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells were predominantly negative for the CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1 and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8 + T-cells were granzyme and/or perforin-positive. Furthermore, the bias towards naïve, stem cell memory and central memory A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV2 infection may be compromising CD8 + T-cell activation. Priming with an appropriate vaccine may thus have great value for optimizing protective CD8 + T-cell immunity in COVID-19.The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has, as of August 2020, infected more than 21 million people, caused at least 700,000 deaths (1) and paralysed economies globally. Although the majority of infections are mild-to-moderate and short in duration, ~12-18% of COVID-19 patients develop severe disease requiring hospitalization, ~5% are critical (2) (3) (4) , and others who are less severely affected, and even asymptomatic, may still have some underlying pathology (5) . These are still early days, and there is much that remains unknown about both the innate and adaptive immune responses in COVID-19. An urgent need is to develop a better understanding so that any immunopathology can be managed, and vaccine design and immunotherapies optimized.So far as adaptive immunity is concerned, we do know that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies can be found in ∼95% of convalescent COVID-19 patients (6, 7) and that titres determined in virus neutralization assays correlate well with spike-protein-binding immunoglobulin (Ig) levels measured by ELISA (8, 9) . High serum neutralizing antibody titers tend to be more prominent in severe COVID-19, which could be characteristic of prolonged antigen stimulation due to delayed virus clearance. Otherwise, the duration of SARS-CoV2-specific IgG persistence in serum is far from clear, and we have much to learn about the CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses.Virus-specific CD8 + T-cells are generally thought to be involved in the elimination of virus-infected cell 'factories' in the acute response to respiratory viruses with, where there is established CD8 + T-cell memory, that response being enhanced in both rapidity and magnitude to provide a measure of protection against the development of severe disease following secondary virus challenge. Survivors of the 2002-3 SARS outbreak still maintain CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell populations reactive to the SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid protein (10) and evidence of sustained T-cell memory has also been found for MERS (11) . Furthermore, it is possible that there may be some cross-reactive T-cell memory for COVID-19 in people who have been infected with these viruses and, perhaps, more broadly, with the previously circulating common cold coronaviruses (12) .For SARS-CoV-2 there is growing evidence that virus-specific T-cells are indeed being generated. Our early COVID-19 case study showed that both CD4 + T-follicular helper cells and activated CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8 + T-cells appeared in patient's blood at 3 days prior to recovery, suggesting that they played a part in the resolution of COVID-19 (13) . Recent communications from others also reported the presence SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells in both acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients (14, 15) . More disturbing is, however, an analysis suggesting that at least a proportion of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cells recovered from peripheral blood may be showing as an 'exhausted' phenotype (16) . Clearly, it is a matter of urgency to develop a better understanding of the integrity of the acute CD8 + T-cell response in COVID-19 and how this impacts on disease outcome.Here, we utilized a combination of peptide prediction and in vitro peptide stimulation with overlapping peptides from the Spike, Nucleocapsid and Membrane proteins to identify two novel SARS-CoV2 epitopes restricted by HLA-A*02:01 (A2/S 269 and A2/Orf1ab 3183 ) in individuals with COVID-19. Using peptide-HLA-I tetramers, we performed direct ex vivo tetramer enrichment to define the frequency and activation profiles of the responding SARS-CoV2-specific CD8 + T-cells in acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients and in prepandemic PBMCs, tonsil and lung tissues from uninfected donors.This study of 18 COVID-19 cases included one person who remained asymptomatic, 10 who were symptomatic but were cared for at home, and 7 who were admitted to hospital including 2 requiring supplemental oxygen (Supplementary Table 1 ). Control cells were tested from another 17 uninfected individuals who formed a control group (Supplementary Table 2 ). All COVID-19 patients (median age 54 years, 55.6% females) seroconverted for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) ELISA (17) and 12 were HLA-A*02:01expressing individuals. As controls, we analysed pre-existing A2/CD8 + T-cell responses in pre-pandemic PBMC and tonsil samples from 12 HLA-A*02:01-expressing subjects across three age groups: children (median age 9.5 years), adults (median age 51 years) and the elderly (median age 66.5 years) with 44% being female (Supplementary Table 2 ). Additionally, we tested pre-existing A2/CD8 + T-cell populations in lung tissues from 5 HLA-A2 individuals (median age 42 years).We first probed for SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells in convalescent COVID-19 donors using a standard 6-hr intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay using peptide pools containing 15mers, overlapping by 11 amino acids, which spanned the entire Nucleocapsid (N) and Membrane (M) proteins and selected regions of SARS-CoV2 Spike (S) protein. The PBMCs were stimulated with one peptide pool and expanded for 10 days before the assessment of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells by ICS for intracellular IFN-γ, TNF and MIP-1β, plus staining for CD107a and perforin ( Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig 1A) using individual peptide pools. The responding CD4 + T-cells all stained for IFN-γ, TNF, MIP-1β, CD107a and perforin, while the CD8 + T-cells were predominately positive for perforin ( Fig 1AB) . The CD4 + T-cells showed significant staining for IFN-γ, with 5/6 subjects generating IFN-γ + CD4 + T-cells responses to at least one of the SARS-CoV-2 peptide N, M or S pools, indicating that convalescent COVID-19 patients have solid SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 + T-cell immunity. However, while CD8 + T cells from 3/6 donors were perforin-positive, evidence of modest IFN-γ + activation for the CD8 + set was found in only 1/6 donor. It thus seems that IFN-γproducing SARS-CoV2 specific CD4 + T-cells expand to a much greater extent than the CD8 + set following in vitro peptide stimulation (Fig. 1C) .Peptide sequence conservation analysis for these SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides was extended to previously circulating coronaviruses. Reference protein sequences for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS plus the 'common cold' human CoV (hCoV) strains 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43 were obtained from NCBI. Using the Virus Pathogen Resource (www.viprbrc.org), SARS-CoV2 S 269, S 976 and Orf1ab 3183 peptide sequences were compared to their respective protein sequences within each CoV strain (Supplementary Table 3 ). Our data showed that SARS-CoV2/Orf1ab 3183 and S 976 lacked any sequence similarity to hCoV or MERS strains, but each shared 100% sequence identity with SARS-CoV1/Orf1ab 3160-3168 (FLLNKEMYL) and S 958-966 (VLNDILSRL), respectively. SARS-CoV-2/S 269 shared 78% and 67% sequence identity with MERS/S 317-325 (KLQPLTFLL) and SARS-CoV-1/S 256-264 (YLKPTTFML), respectively. Evidently the A2/SARS-CoV-2 CD8 + T-cell epitopes identified may be cross-reactive for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, while they did not share homology with the common cold hCoVs that circulate in Australia.To further analyse the SARS-CoV-2-specific A2/CD8 + populations from COVID-19 patients, we generated tetramers for the A2/S 269 and A2/Orf1ab 3183 epitopes. Tetramerassociated magnetic enrichment (18, 19) was then used to determine the ex vivo frequencies of A2/S 269 + CD8 + and A2/Orf1ab 3183 + CD8 + T-cells in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01 + cases. During the acute phase of COVID-19, A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells were readily detected after ex vivo tetramer enrichment at a mean frequency of 1.44x10 -5 (n=3) in the CD8 + set, while the values for the A2/S 269 + CD8 + and A2/Orf1ab 3183 + CD8 + T-cells from COVID-19 convalescents were 1.28x10 -5 (n=14) and 1.77x10 -6 (n=6), respectively ( Fig 3AD) . There was no significant difference in the frequency of A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells between acute and convalescent COVID-19 donors, while minimal A2/S 269 + CD8 + and A2/Orf1ab 3183 + CD8 + Tcells were detected in either unenriched or flow-through samples ( Supplementary Fig 2) . Indeed, while too few T-cells were available to test other specificities concurrently for the COVID-19 patients, these frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cells were significantly lower than those found for influenza A virus (IAV)-specific (1.39x10 -4 for A2/M1 58 ; n=6) and EBV-specific (1.38 x10 -4 for A2/BMLF 1280 ; n=6) memory T cell populations from uninfected controls (Fig 3BD) , and as per previous publications (19, 20) .Are SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cells present in uninfected people? Using ex vivo tetramer enrichment with pre-pandemic PBMC, tonsil and lung samples taken from HLA-A*02:01-expressing unifected individuals (Fig. 3CiD) , naïve SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + Tcells directed at A2/S 269 were detected in all the PBMC and tonsil samples (n=12), while CD8 + T-cells directed at A2/Orf1ab 3183 were found in only 33% of individuals (n=12) and the lung tissues were uniformly negative (Fig. 3CiiD ). Both the A2/S 269 + CD8 + and A2/Orf1ab 3183 + CD8 + were found over a broad range of ages (A2/S 269 : 5-68 years; A2/Orf1ab, 11-65 years). Moreover, the A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cell frequency of 2.5x10 -6 (mean, n=12) in pre-COVID-19-healthy individuals was significantly lower than that found for COVID-19exposed individuals (p=0.0064; Fig. 3D ). It thus seems that the A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells are indeed being activated and clonally expanded during SARS-CoV-2-infection. In contrast, there was no significant difference in frequencies for the A2/Orf1ab 3183 + CD8 + T-cells from the pre-pandemic and COVID-19 groups (p=0.4121) (Fig 3D) .The activation profiles of A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells tested directly ex vivo from acute and convalescent patients were assessed by CD27, CD45RA and CD95 staining to determine the prevalence of the naïve (T Naïve ) (CD27 + CD45RA + CD95 -), stem cell memory (T SCM ) (CD27 + CD45RA + CD95 + ), central memory (T CM )-like (CD27 + CD45RA -), effector memory (T EM )-like (CD27 -CD45RA -), and effector memory CD45RA (T EMRA ) (CD27 -CD45RA + ) subsets ( Fig 4A) . Acute COVID-19 donors displayed the highest proportion (mean of 92%) of T CM -like A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells and a low proportion of T EM -like CD8 + T-cells. The A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells from the convalescent versus acute subjects had a lower prevalence of T CM -like (mean of 50%) cells, and larger proportions of the T Naïve (mean of 27%) and T SCM (mean of 15%) sets, indicating that A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells expressing the optimally responsive T CM phenotype fall off rapidly in blood sampled after the infection has resolved. Conversely, the majority of A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells within pre-pandemic children and adults were naïve (T Naïve ; mean of 68% and 77%, respectively), while this subset was less prominent (mean of 46%) in the elderly. Interestingly older, uninfected people had a mean of 38% T CM -like A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells, similar to the frequency found for COVID-19 convalescents (mean of 50%), but less than that for IAV A2/M1 58 (mean of 66%).The expression profiles for HLA-DR, CD38, PD-1 and CD71 were also determined for tetramer + A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells from the COVID-19 patients (Fig 4B) . Only T cells from acutely-infected donors were positive for these activation markers, with the majority coming from one individual (COVID-19 #2). In contrast, the A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells from prepandemic and COVID-19 convalescent subjects were characterised by minimal levels of HLA-DR + CD38 and PD-1 + CD71suggesting that, while the A2/S 269 + CD8 + set can be activated during the acute phase of the infection, it does not persist into short-term memory. Overall, our data suggest that naïve A2/SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cells can indeed be expanded ∼5-fold and activated during the acute phase of COVID-19 but that, atypically for what we know for other readily resolved infections like influenza, both the extent of T-cell proliferation and the persistence of activated T-cells in the blood is low for (days 37-101 post disease onset) convalescent individuals.To further investigate the suboptimal activation of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + Tcells in COVID-19, the killing capacity of A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells was assessed by staining for granzyme A, B and K, and perforin directly ex vivo. Surprisingly, the majority of A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells at both acute (mean of 77.2%) and convalescent (mean of 72.4%) stages of COVID-19 expressed 3-4 cytotoxic granzymes/perforin (Fig 4C, Supplementary Fig  3) , indicating their activation status. However, a similarly high expression level of granzymes/perforin was also found on the majority of total CD8 + T-cells (69-82.5%), as per our previous case report (13) , but not on non-CD8 + T cells (mean of 15-21%). As it is highly unlikely that ∼80% of all CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood during primary SARS-CoV-2 infection were antigen-specific (even if directed at several CD8 + T cell epitopes), this suggests that a high proportion of CD8 + T cells are activated via some 'bystander'As the research community drives forward to design and evaluate novel vaccines and immunotherapies for COVID-19, concurrent efforts directed at understanding how immunity works in this disease process are largely focused on patient studies. Applying our established expertise in the analysis of T-cell-mediated immunity, we found here that the CD4 + 'helper' T-cell response looks relatively normal when compared with what happens in, for example, people who have been infected with an influenza A virus. However, when it comes to the virus-specific CD8 + T-cells that play an important role in ameliorating disease severity and driving recovery in other respiratory infections, our findings for COVID-19 are less encouraging. Though we were able to identify two SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cell epitopes associated with the ubiquitous (in Caucasian) HLA-A*02:01 MHC-I glycoprotein (A2/S 269-277 and A2/Orf1ab 3183-3191 ) and found evidence for T-cell responsiveness, the results were not what we expected.Our findings show that, while 'early memory' CD8 + T-cells can be detected in convalescent HLA-A*02:01 COVID-19 patients at frequencies ∼5-fold higher than those from pre-pandemic samples, the SARS-CoV-2-specific response was ∼10-fold lower than that found regularly for CD8 + T-cells directed at IAV or EBV epitopes. In general, there was an over-representation of SARS-CoV-2-specific tetramer + CD8 + T-cells expressing cell surface phenotypes that are considered to be characteristic of 'stem cell memory' and naïve precursor status, suggesting that the infectious process is in some way limiting both clonal expansion and differentiation of the 'classical' effector and central memory sets. An alternative explanation is, of course, that T-cell effectors are being generated but are localised to, and perhaps 'consumed-in' (driven to apoptosis?) sites of virus-induced pathology.Even so, it is the case that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cells were found in all COVID-19 acute and convalescent donors, and in stored pre-pandemic PBMC and tonsil samples (but not lung tissues) from HLA-A*02:01 children, mature adults and the elderly. As the frequency of these naïve, pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cells (∼2.5x10 -6 ) was numerically comparable to that found for naïve HIV (Gag 77-85 , SLYNTVATL), cancer (Survivin 96-104 ) or HCV (NS3 1073 )-specific CD8 + T cell populations in healthy HLA-A*02:01 + individuals (19) (20) (21) , both their presence and the fact that they were not readily expanded following in vitro stimulation suggests that they were not a product of prior exposure to some cross-reactive epitope. In fact, these are likely the naïve precursors that would be stimulated by appropriate prime-and-boost vaccine strategies.Earlier experiments in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-1 showed that a conventional, CD8 + T-cell-targeted prime-and-boost approach indeed established substantial pools of memory SARS-CoV-1-specific CD8 + T-cells capable of driving protection against lethal SARS-CoV-1 infection (22) . The fact that the frequencies of A2/S 269 + CD8 + T-cells in COVID-19 patients increased ∼5-fold suggest that these SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cells proliferated to some extent during primary COVID-19, however not to the level of wellestablished memory CD8 + T-cell populations directed at other viral epitopes like IAVspecific A2/M1 58 and EBV-specific A2/BMLF 1280 . Further studies are obviously needed to understand why this is so. In addition, as our acquaintance with this novel CoV continues, we will be able to determine if there is long-term survival (at least at >1 year) of SARS-CoV-2specific CD8 + memory T-cells following primary COVID-19 along with whether, in now healthy survivors, they can be activated and clonally expanded following challenge with an appropriate vaccine.It remains unclear whether this is broadly representative of primary CD8 + T-cell responses in COVID-19 or specific to the epitopes analysed here. There is a possibility that there are other HLA-A*02:01-restricted immunodominant epitopes, or even immunodominant epitopes restricted by other HLAs in HLA-A*02:01 + COVID-19 patients. The A2/S 269 epitope identified in our study was, however, also independently reported in a recent pre-print (26) , suggesting it is a common HLA-A*02:01 epitope. Moreover, it is also possible that CD8 + T cells directed towards other HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes might have expressed high levels of PD-1 and thus had an impaired capacity to expand in vitro due to their exhausted phenotype. Further identification of CD8 + T-cell epitopes across a broad range of HLA class I alleles and SARS-CoV-2 proteins is needed to provide a more detailed landscape of CD8 + T-cell responses in COVID-19, their ex vivo frequencies and activation profiles. In-depth analysis of epitope-specific T-cell responses in severe and critical cases is also essential if we are to understand whether the activation profiles of early CD8 + T-cell memory reflect disease severity. And, as the range of candidate vaccines that are tested through phase 1 trials expands, it would also be of great benefit to determine whether the characteristics of memory CD8 + T-cells generated in the absence of active infection look more optimal than those described here.Stimulation with overlapping peptides led to the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells in vitro, although CD4 + T-cells dominated the response. This might support, at least partially, the previous elegant study showing that CD4 + T-cells but not CD8 + T-cells were of a greater importance in primary SARS-CoV-1 infection, as depletion of CD4 + T-cells (but not CD8 + T-cells) led to delayed viral clearance from the lungs, associated with reduced neutralizing antibody and cytokine production (27) . It is also important to note that the Spike peptide pool from Miltenyi Biotec used here spans only selected regions (304-338, 421-475, 492-519, 683-707, 741-770, 785-802 and 885-1273) rather than the entire protein, thus some CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell responses could have been missed. Recent evidence revealed that Th2 and Th17 cytokine profiles in COVID-19 patients can be associated with differential disease outcomes (28) . Our analyses focused on Th1 cytokine responses for CD4 + T cells, leaving Th2 and Th17 cytokine responses unknown. Different cytokine profiles of epitope-specific CD4 + T-cells should be investigated in future studies, especially when SARS-CoV2-specific CD4 + T cell epitopes are identified.We thank all the participants involved in the study, Robyn Esterbauer, Hannah Kelly, Jane Batten and Helen Kent for support with the cohort. We thank Jill Garlick, Janine Roney, Anne Paterson and the research nurses at the Alfred Hospital. 35 subjects were recruited into this study. Acute and convalescent COVID-19 were recruited via the Alfred Hospital, University of Melbourne or James Cook University. Seven of the donors were admitted to hospital during their active infection (Supplementary Table 1 ). Acute COVID-19 cases were admitted to the hospital ward, with two patients requiring oxygen support (Supplementary Table 1 ). Healthy donors were recruited via University of Melbourne or buffy packs obtained from the Australian Red Cross LifeBlood (West Melbourne, Australia) (Supplementary Table 2 ). Tonsils were obtained from healthy individuals undergoing tonsillectomy (Tasmania, Australia). Lung samples were obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic via the Alfred Hospital's Lung Tissue Biobank. All blood and tonsil donors were HLA typed by VTIS (Melbourne, Australia). Peripheral blood was collected in heparinized tubes and peripheral blood monocular cells (PBMCs) were isolated via Ficoll-Paque separation.Experiments conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Code of Practice. Written informed consents were obtained from all blood donors prior to the study. Lung tissues were obtained from deceased organ donors after written informed consents from the next of kin.

Outbreaks in contained environments full of 23 older individuals, such as cruise ships and nursing homes, create a problem 24 of heightened transmission rates and severe cases, and modeling them can 25 show us the best way to mitigate an outbreak in a closed environment. In this paper we show that quarantine on a ship with COVID-19, even 68 with a majority of crew and passengers having immunity, either acquired or 69 through vaccination, will lead to disease spread. However, we also show that 70 a disease similar to influenza, even with a ship with a fully susceptible crew 71 and passengers, could be contained through quarantine measures. The goal 72 of this paper is to highlight preventive and quarantine measures for a disease 73 with a less pervasive spread that may not lead to an explosion of cases. The discussions and further studies on quarantines in closed systems, especially 76 regarding the role of uninfected care givers. We address the idea of reduc-77 tion of disease spread through a minimization of contact between potentially 78 infected passengers and crew members. Appropriate means to reduce this 79 contact without compromising care will still need to be addressed, but we 80 hope to bring forth discussions of airdropping sufficient personal protective 81 gear or following the lead of the quarantine of exposed sailors in Guam with 82 minimal interactions with self sufficient quarantined people. In addition, we Recently, the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 on cruise ships has been modeled 87[17], but without the separation of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. 88 Retrospective reviews have been completed to see the comparison of mild 89 to severe cases on the Diamond Princess, as well as statistical analyses to 90 estimate the number of asymptomatic passengers [18] , [19] . There is also ev-91 idence that asymptomatic people can transmit the disease to others [20] and 92 that 17.8% of the infected Diamond Princess passengers and crew members 93 were asymptomatic and did not develop any symptoms [21] . 94 We highlight the importance of a multi tiered model containing two are susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infectious (I A ), symptomatic 104 infectious (I S ), and recovered with temporary or permanent immunity (R).In the model we can assume that the disease behaves nearly the same 106 in the crew members and passengers, modeled with the shared parameter 107 values, in order to capture the difference in disease spread by shipboard 108 role. Since the average passenger, age 70, being older than the average crew hope to examine isolation and quarantine in a closed system in order to find 114 the conditions to reduce transmission rates. In the model we assume that 115 symptomatic passengers and crew members are confined in their quarters, 116 although with a mean of 1.98 passengers per cabin and 1.73 crew members 117 per cabin [3] they are not truly isolated. The system we examine is not 118 entirely closed, since we allow seriously ill passengers to be evacuated.In this paper we explore the spread of COVID-19 and an influenza-like 120 illness in relation to different isolation and quarantine levels on a cruise ship. 121 We have chosen to compare COVID-19 to H1N1 since the recent pandemics: Table 1 .While it is true that not all crew members interact with the same fre- Table 5 in Appendix A has the 176 infection data for the Diamond Princess cruise ship with the results for the 177 passengers and crew members combined [1] for February 5-20, 2020. Table   178 6, also in Appendix A, has the test results for February 4-9, 2020 with the [22] . This indicates that the spread was must likely crew-crew in that 186 cluster. However, we do not know more about the primary contact that Since only interactions with infected individuals spread the disease, we 219 model just these contacts. In Figure 1 we illustrate the interactions with 220 infected individuals with dashed lines and the transmission rate listed by the 221 dashed lines. In Table 2 we define the parameters, where β is the trans-222 mission probability per contact, ξ is the reduction for asymptomatic infec-223 tiousness as compared to symptomatic, and κ XY represents the interaction 224 rate of population X with population Y .

Since initially no one had immunity to SARS-CoV-2 we can approximate the total number of susceptible individuals to be the total population when using data from initial infections in Guangzhou, China, South Korea, and New York city. With this assumption one can use the exponential modelto calculate βκ by using data values for I n and I n+1 .First we need to approximate the average number of contacts per day, κ, where x represents the symptomatic transmission probability.

We use our results to determine the importance of each parameters in achieving disease free equilibrium on the ship. In our case, we use sensitivity analysis to point out the highest impact on the transmission of COVID-19 in which could be used to help determine strategies for preventative and quarantine measures. Sensitivity indices measure the percentage change of a key quantity, such as the reproduction number, in response to a percentage change of a parameter in that quantity.

Evidence shows that medical students are particularly vulnerable to poor mental well-being and have higher rates of mental illness and psychological distress compared to the general population. 1 Meta-analysis shows that depressive symptoms among medical students are high, with a 27.2% prevalence reported by Rotenstein (2017) . 2 A number of factors contribute towards medical student stress. Commonly reported stressors identified from the literature include academic factors such as feeling unprepared for exams; the organisational structure of medical courses including timetabling, inadequate and delayed feedback of assessment results; and poorly organised placements. 3, 4 Psychological distress often persists throughout medical school and can have adverse consequences such as academic burnout, an increased risk of dropout and sleep problems. 4 The recent COVID-19 global pandemic has affected students' lives on many different levels and had significant effects on delivery of the teaching curriculum across the University of Western Australia (UWA) 4-year graduate Doctor of Medicine (MD) course. The speed at which the community lockdown and subsequent changes to the medical course occurred resulted in many students COVID-19 and the mental well-being of Australian medical students: impact, concerns and coping strategies used struggling to adjust to online learning and other curriculum changes that were implemented in response to government lockdown measures. The abrupt cancellation of previously timetabled face-to-face tutorials, clinical placements and patient contact further contributed to disruption of normal studies.In addition to teaching-related changes, other impacts such as loss of peer interaction and social connectedness, and financial stressors including loss of part-time employment caused by the economic consequences of the pandemic have potential to impact negatively on student well-being and cause further psychological distress, disrupt daily life and medical studies. It is important to actively assess and monitor this to mitigate negative impacts and provide appropriate support to students. The study aimed to: (a) determine the impact of COVID-19 on mental well-being of UWA medical students; (b) determine specific concerns of students and (iii) determine activities and strategies used by students to help with the COVID-19 situation.An online cross-sectional survey using the Qualtrics platform was designed. The survey was developed in collaboration with academic staff and student representatives. Survey questions included demographic information; self-rated assessment of current mental well-being; the Kessler 10 (K10), questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on various areas of life, concerns about COVID-19 and activities and strategies used to help with the situation. The questionnaire is available on request.All MD students were eligible to participate. The survey was promoted through the learning management system and social media. Participation was voluntary and completion of the survey implied consent. No identifying details were collected. To avoid multiple responses submitted from the same subject, the survey was configured so that it could only be taken once.Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 26). Descriptive statistics analysed demographic characteristics, and assessed the impact of COVID-19 on students' life and concerns about the COVID-19 situation. K10 data were analysed descriptively. A one-way ANOVA tested significant differences between mean K10 score and MD year group. K10 scores were grouped into low, moderate, high and very high distress categories. Differences in levels of psychological distress between MD years was tested using the Kruskal-Wallis H test.The study was approved by the UWA Human Research Ethics Committee.Across the four MD years, 297 students participated with a 37.5% response rate. Overall, 46% of first year students (MD1) responded, 39% of second year students (MD2), 36% of third year students (MD3) and 34% of final year students (MD4). The mean age of respondents was 24 years, range 20-46, median 23 years. In terms of location prior to commencement of medical studies, 61% were from the Perth metropolitan area, 24% from rural/ regional areas, 8.5% were international students and 6.5% from interstate.To analyse K10 data, Australian Bureau of Statistics cutoffs were used, where a score of 10-15 indicates low psychological distress; 16-21, moderate distress; 22-29, high distress; and 30-50, very high distress.Across all years, the mean K10 score was 20.6, indicating a moderate level of psychological distress. MD1 students had the highest mean score, 23.1, and MD3 students had the lowest, 19.8. The mean score for MD2 was 20.1 and for MD4 students 20.6. A one-way ANOVA found no significant differences in mean K10 scores between year groups, F(3, 290) = 2.394, p = 0.69. An independent t-test found that the mean K10 score was significantly higher for female students (21.3) compared with males (19.4), t(291) = −2.47, p = 0.014.K10 data were categorised into low, moderate, high and very high psychological distress. The majority of students across all year groups were in the 'moderate' category (37%). However, 11% of students scored in the 'very high' category. MD1 had the highest proportion of students in the 'very high' category, 24% compared with 10% of MD4 and 9% for both MD2 and MD3. Table 1 shows K10 results.In terms of self-reported change in mental well-being since COVID-19 onset, a worsening of well-being was reported by 68% of students, 26% reported no change and 6% improved.Respondents were asked to rate the impact of COVID-19 (negative impact, no impact, or positive impact) on different areas of life. As shown in Figure 1 , the main negative impacts were on social connectedness, medical studies and stress levels. The main positive impacts were around family relationships, exercise and sleep.Respondents also reported their concerns regarding COVID-19. Across all years, the main concern was the impact on studies (81% of respondents), followed by uncertainty about a return to normal (72%). Other concerns were family member testing positive (62%) and being in self-isolation (42%). Table 2 shows each area of concern, the number and percentage of respondents in each year group who selected each choice. Concerns about graduation differed between years with only 10% of MD1 students expressing concern about this compared to 20.5% of MD2 students, 42% of MD3 and 67.5% of MD4 students. Concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on studies were highest among MD1 students (81%). MD3 students expressed more concern about uncertainty of when things would return to normal (80%) compared with students of other years.Additional comments about concerns regarding the COVID-19 situation were provided by some students. These included issues around teaching and learning, for example worries about level of clinical skills and experience, and being unprepared for the workplace; concerns regarding their mental well-being; concerns specifically related to COVID-19 -for example, potential exposure while on placement or people in the community not adhering to social distancing regulations; and concerns about loss of social contact with family due to lockdowns.Students were asked about activities and strategies used to help with the COVID-19 situation. Video chats and social media apps were the most commonly reported strategies -87.5% and 62%, respectively. Mindfulness and meditation were used by 36%. Some additional comments were also provided. These included exercise and fitness, such as jogging, cycling, indoor exercising; taking up new hobbies and revisiting old hobbies; focusing on routine and goal setting; creative activities such as playing and listening to music, reading, watching movies; cooking and baking; playing video games; attending online church services and prayer. Table 3 shows these results. Results of this study have shown that students are currently experiencing moderate levels of psychological distress, and two-thirds reported a deterioration in mental well-being since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (mid-March 2020). While psychological distress is common among medical students, particularly females, K10 results from this study show that more students were scoring in the 'very high' distress category compared with other studies, including the 'beyondblue' survey of doctors and medical students. 1, 5 Inevitably, an elevated level of stress has impacted negatively on their lives and medical studies and raised legitimate concerns regarding graduation, fears around self-isolating and uncertainty about returning to normal.In these challenging times, improving student mental well-being has become a greater priority in order to reduce the known consequences of ongoing psychological distress and minimize any negative effects of the pandemic on mental health. In the medical student literature, effective factors in alleviating stress include resilience training 6 ; having social support and emotional resilience 5 ; proactively participating in self-care activities such as exercise, good diet and engaging in fulfilling interpersonal relationships 7 ; and having personal character traits such as joy, self-efficacy and optimism. 8 The presence of these factors can buffer against stressful and emotional situations, especially students who are prone to mental health problems.From the study results, we know that, despite these adversities, our students have been proactive in many domains and are motivated to engage in a wide range of activities to stay busy and socially connected through difficult times. However, while many students have the capacity to adopt protective strategies and behaviours, some remain vulnerable to ongoing stress caused by the pandemic. The Medical School, in conjunction with the Western Australia Medical Students' Society, has sought to allay students' concerns by providing regular communications and updates regarding changes to teaching delivery (lectures, tutorials, placements), assessments and the resumption of clinical placements.Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional design and relatively low response rate (37.5%), meaning that the full range of impacts and concerns relating to the pandemic may not have been captured. This is a longitudinal study and students will be re-surveyed over the coming months to gain a long-term perspective of the COVID-19 impact.In conclusion, this study has provided insights of the impact of COVID-19 on our students' well-being and provided an opportunity to address their concerns. We hope that results help other medical schools by raising awareness of how the pandemic impacts on well-being, thus enabling the provision of appropriate support. Ongoing research to monitor student well-being over time as the effects of the pandemic endure, will be important to minimize its negative impacts.The authors report no conflict of interest.

During this time, people were asked to remain in their homes and only leave to access essential goods and services, to receive or provide care, to exercise, or to attend work or education where these activities could not take place at home. This approach was largely successful; at the end of the lockdown period, Australia had recorded 6,914 cases and 97 deaths [1] , numbers that pale in comparison with those recorded elsewhere [2] . However, Australia is not immune to the social and economic hardships the pandemic caused, nor the impact on the provision of and access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH).In March, one of the largest condom producers in the world warned of a global shortage [3] , potentially impacting the sexual health of millions. Domestic travel restrictions in Australia exacerbated an already complicated abortion care system with patients and providers unable to travel to seek or provide care [4] . Marie Stopes Australia warned of an increased risk of unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmissible infections (STIs) as contraception and abortion, as well as pregnancy and STI tests become less accessible [4] . Plan International reported on the impact on menstrual hygiene, highlighting the significant impact of the pandemic on the ability of menstruating people to manage their periods safely and hygienically [5] . News outlets reported predictions of a falling fertility rate as couples reassessed desires to reproduce during a health crisis and amidst the resulting social and economic hardships [6] .We are conducting serial cross-sectional surveys to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the SRH of people living in Australia. In this paper, we report on the results from the first survey and explore the impact of Australia-wide lockdown on reproductive health including pregnancy intentions and contraception access.Data reported here were collected as part of the Sexual and Reproductive Health during COVID-19 survey open from 23 April-11 May 2020. People aged 18+ who were living in Australia were eligible to participate. Repeat waves will be conducted throughout 2020, and a cohort analysis undertaken for participants who respond to multiple surveys. The survey comprises three sections: demographics, sexual practices and reproductive health. In this paper we report on data pertaining only to the baseline survey and for those participants who completed the reproductive health section. The study was approved by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (ID: 2056693).Participants were asked about changes in sexual practices, intimate relationships, contraceptive use and access, pregnancy intention and access to and use of SRH services. Several questions investigated whether during lockdown, participants had difficulty accessing contraception, SRH products like pregnancy tests, lubrication and feminine hygiene products. They were also asked about their healthcare access during lockdown, including whether restrictions had impacted their ability to access emergency contraception or termination of pregnancy. Free-text responses to a question regarding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy plans were also collected.Analysis was limited to reproductive aged women (<50 years). Descriptive statistics were used to describe socio-demographic characteristics, pregnancy intentions and contraception use. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to investigate factors associated with healthcare access and difficulty in accessing contraception, SRH products and feminine hygiene products. As this was an explorative analysis, regression modelling to examine the impact of confounding on associations was not undertaken. Chi square tests and t tests (where appropriate) were used to investigate factors associated with providing free-text responses. As not everyone completed all questions, missing data were excluded, but denominators are provided to place missing data in context. Responses to the free-text question were imported into NVivo qualitative analysis software [7] . Utilising thematic analysis [8] , we took a largely descriptive and semantic approach to the data, looking for the overt meaning of the comments.Patients and the public were not involved in the development of this study; however, the survey was pilot tested with several people not involved with the study and their feedback incorporated into the final survey. A lay summary will be available to participants on our website [9] upon publication of our results.A total of 1187 people consented to participate of whom 965 (81.3%) answered the questions on sexual practices and 625 (52.6%) answered questions on reproductive health. Of these 625, 518 (82.9%) reported that they were female and aged <50 years and were included in the analysis. There was no difference in average age between those who completed the reproductive health questions and those who did not (25.7 vs 27.0 years, p=0.12). Among participating women, 55.4% (287/518) were aged 18-24 years, 36.7% (397/518) were in a cohabitating relationship and 32.2% (167/518) reported being single. Overall, 397 (77.2%) were living in urban areas of Australia and 61.1% (315/516) were employed at the time of the survey. A small proportion reported that they or their partner was pregnant (1.9%, 10/516) and most (76.1%, 379/498) indicated that they were trying to avoid pregnancy. Nearly 20% (101/514) reported they were not using any contraception, with the oral contraceptive pill being the most common single method used (20.8%; 107/514) and condoms and the pill (6.4%; 33/514) being the most common dual method used (Table 1) .Univariate analysis found that women aged 25-34 years (OR=0.4; 95%CI 0.1, 0.9) compared with women aged 18-24 years and those employed (OR=0.4; 95%CI 0.2, 0.7) had less trouble accessing contraception during lockdown. No factors were associated with accessing SRH products. Women aged 25-34 years (OR=0.4; 95%CI 0.3, 0.7) or 35-49 years (OR=0.3; 95%CI 0.1, 0.6) were less likely to experience difficulty accessing feminine hygiene products than those aged 18-24 years. Those in a non-cohabitating relationship (OR=1.9; 95%CI 1.1, 3.1) and those living with parents (OR=2.4; 95%CI 1.5, 3.8) were more likely to have difficulty accessing feminine hygiene products than those in a cohabitating relationship (Table 2) .Univariate analysis found that women aged 25-34 years (OR=1.6; 95%CI: 1.0, 2.5 compared with women aged 18-24 years were more likely to have accessed healthcare for their SRH reasons, and single women (OR=0.6; 95%CI: 0.3, 1.0) were less likely to have accessed services compared to women in a cohabitating relationship. Women aged 25-34 years were more likely to have accessed online healthcare services than women aged 18-24 (OR=1.6, 95%CI: 1.0, 2.4). No factors were associated with accessing emergency contraception or termination of pregnancy services (Table  3) .We also explored the impact of COVID-19 on plans for pregnancy, and participants were asked to respond to a free-text question about this (Has the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic impacted your future plans for pregnancy? Please tell us about it in the box below). In total, 217 participants provided a comment. Participants who chose to respond to the free-text question were older than those who did not provide a response (26.8 years vs. 25.1 years; p<0.01). They were also more likely to be in a cohabitating relationship than those who did not provide a response (47.9% vs. 28.4%; p<0.01). Participants who responded to the free-text question were more likely to be trying to get pregnant (6.5% vs 0.0%; p<0.01), or at a stage where they did not mind getting pregnant (17.6% vs 4.6%; p<0.01) than those who did not respond to the free text question. Participant responses largely fell into one of four key themes. These themes are presented below, and illustrative quotes can be found in Table 4 .Well, we're actually saving money due to COVID, so we might be able to afford another baby sooner than we thought. (36yrs, metro)Being completely alone has made me want a baby more (19yrs, metro)The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions have clearly impacted the ability of Australian women to access reproductive healthcare and products. While most participants reported little difficulty in accessing their usual contraceptive methods and appeared to continue to access healthcare as needed, nearly a third reported difficulties accessing their usual feminine hygiene products. Many also reported delaying plans for pregnancy due to the pandemic. Although our findings should be considered within their limitations, namely the homogeneity of our sample, our findings offer unique insight into the SRH impact of COVID-19 on Australian women.Our findings show that most participants were able to continue to access their usual contraceptive method during the first lockdown in Australia. However, of those reporting difficulties accessing their usual contraceptive method, younger women, and women who were unemployed were more likely to report difficulties. Recent analysis examining those hardest hit by the economic fall-out from COVID-19 show that women and young people are most adversely affected, largely due to their disproportionate representation in industries adversely impacted by the pandemic to-date [10] . While there are many contraceptive options available on the Australian market, the most effective methods require a prescription by a healthcare provider and out-of-pocket costs from the user to purchase [11] . While switching to a different, potentially cheaper method sounds feasible, in practice, women often spend a significant amount of time finding a suitable contraceptive method, and even switching between different brands of the oral contraceptive pill can bring new, unwanted side effects [12] .Accessing one's preferred contraceptive method is also essential to the prevention of unintended pregnancy. Most participants in our study reported intentions to avoid pregnancy, with few reporting actively trying to conceive. Importantly, many reported delaying or indefinitely putting plans for pregnancy on hold due to the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 on pregnant and birthing women has been profound. While the limited research thus far suggests that pregnant women are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing more severe symptoms [13] , the increased stress and anxiety experienced by these women as they navigate care under strict COVID-19 regulations is becoming clear [13] [14] [15] . It is perhaps unsurprising then that women are delaying plans for pregnancy in the current environment. What impact this might have on the Australian fertility rate in the future is unclear although, at least for the participants in our study, it seems that a post lockdown baby-boom is unlikely.","Australia","abstract","2020-08-11",8

As of May 21 2020, there were more than 4.8 million cases worldwide. Diagnosis is primarily by detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA by nucleic acid testing (NAT), but this has limitations, including the possibility of false-negative results due to low virus load in patients with minimal disease, inadequate respiratory tract sampling or mutations in the target sequence, and false-positive results due to contamination or nonspecific amplification.Assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in serum or plasma can be used to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19 or to make a retrospective diagnosis in individuals who have already recovered from the acute illness and are no longer NAT positive [1] , which can be critical for outbreak investigations [2] . Such assays also permit estimates of the proportion of a population who have been infected by testing unbiased collections of sera in population-weighted serosurveys. In addition, serology assays are needed to establish the effectiveness and durability of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, for correlating humoral immune responses with disease severity [3] , for facilitating studies of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin as therapeutic or prophylactic interventions [4] , and for investigating vaccine strategies.The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM and IgA, and apply it to document the serological response in individuals with confirmed COVID-19.Since the start of the epidemic in Australia, the Public Health Laboratory Network recommended collecting acute and convalescent sera for serological assays on individuals being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to respiratory tract samples for NAT, though this has not been universally adopted [5] . Individuals with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection having both respiratory A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 tract samples for NAT and serum samples for serological testing referred to the public health laboratory at the NSW Health Pathology-Institute for Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead from 22 th January to 6 th May 2020 were prospectively included in this study. In addition, discarded blood samples collected for routine biochemistry from patients with NAT-confirmed COVID-19 managed at Westmead Hospital were utilised as individual seroconversion panels. A specificity panel consisting of samples positive for rheumatoid factor (n=18), human influenza A virus (n=18) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=8) antibodies collected during June to August 2019 were used to separately assess cross-reactivity.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed on respiratory tract samples and viral culture supernatant using established methods [6, 7] .SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a sample collected on 24 th January 2020 from an individual who acquired COVID-19 in Wuhan was utilised for the serological assays. The isolate belonged to SARS-CoV-2 linage A using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages Tool (Pangolin [8] ) and the consensus genome sequence has been submitted to GISAID (Accession EPI_ISL_407893 [9]).The virus was inoculated into Vero-E6 cells and examined daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) in a BSL-3 laboratory. Growth of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by the presence of CPE and the detection of SARS- Samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 IFA underwent SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV IFA using commercially available slides (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by microneutralization using established methods [10] .Samples from individuals with NAT-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that demonstrated seroconversion by IFA were used to determine the 'window period' for appearance of SARS-CoV-2- Positive reference cases were defined as persons with clinically suspected COVID-19 who had SARS-Cov-2 detected by NAT. Positive reference cases with an IFA titer of <10 beyond the observed upper range of the serologic window period were classified as having false negative serology, otherwise they were classified as true positive if an IFA titer of ≥10 was detected at initial or follow-up testing.Negative reference cases were defined as persons with suspected COVID-19 who had one or more negative SARS-CoV-2 NATs. Negative reference cases were classified as having false positive serology if an IFA titer of ≥10 was detected on initial or follow-up serology, otherwise in these cases an IFA titer of <10 was classified as true negative.Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values and confidence intervals were calculated using medcalc (https://www.medcalc.org/). Confidence intervals for mean 'window periods' were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2013.Of 2753 individuals with suspected COVID-19 were included in the study (Figure 2 ), 1685 (61·2%) were female, and the median age was 38 years with an interquartile range of 28-51. Two thousand five hundred and seventy-seven individuals had a single serology test performed, 176 had two or more. One hundred and twenty-six individuals were SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive (prevalence 4·6%).A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7Fifteen individuals had appropriately timed serum collections for calculation of the serological window period. The mean window period from symptom onset to seroconversion of one or more SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody classes (IgG, IgA or IgM) was 10·2 days (95% CI 8·7-11·7) with an upper range of 14·4 days. Window periods for individual or combinations of antibody classes are shown in Table 1 .Of 126 NAT-confirmed cases, 115 had antibody from one or more classes detectable by IFA within 14 days of illness onset (sensitivity 91·3%%; 95% CI 84·9-95·6). The sensitivity and specificity, negative and positive predictive value of individual antibody classes and their combinations are shown in Table 1 .The 11 cases classified as false negative serology results were predominantly from individuals with one positive and several negative NAT tests (Supplementary Table S1 ). When the 73 cases with only a single NAT positive test were excluded, the calculated sensitivity of serology increased to 96·1% (86·5-99·5). Two individuals had multiple positive NATs but no SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detected beyond the 14-day window period. One had severe COVID-19 and died on day 15 of illness, the second had mild disease with prolonged RNA shedding to day 26 of illness, no detectable antibody at day 17 of illness but IgA detected at a titer of 10 on day 26. The median antibody titers in each of the four-day intervals up to 28 days, followed by weekly intervals to 7 weeks, after illness onset were used to plot the dynamics of the antibody response using 425 samples from the 126 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Figure 4) . The peak antibody response was seen in the third week post-illness onset, with IgA and IgM titers declining after this time point, and IgG titers declining in the sixth week after illness onset. By the seventh week, the proportion of individuals who still had detectable IgG was 84%, but only 53% for IgA and for IgM. The maximum recorded IgG titer was, on average, higher in those who were hospitalized (486, 95% CI 331-641) compared with those who were managed as an outpatient (179, 95% CI 117-242, P=0.0001). There was no correlation between antibody titers and sex, age or duration of viral RNA shedding (supplementary figures S2-S5).We show that our in-house developed IFA is a reliable diagnostic method for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The sensitivity of this assay is greater, and window period shorter, than those reported for many other SARS-CoV-2 serology assays [1, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . This may be because the antigen utilised in this IFA assay is whole virion-infected cells rather than one or two purified or recombinant viral proteins. Complementing the high sensitivity is the high specificity of our IFA, with minimal cross-reactivity against other coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV (also described in other studies [12, 16] ). The absence of reactivity in the vast majority of cases without SARS-CoV-2 infection also suggests that cross-reactivity with common endemic coronaviruses such as CoV-229E and CoV-OC43 is minimal, as has been described for SARS-CoV [19] . False-positive cases were associated with low titers of one antibody class only. The IFA assay has the advantage of being quantitative so changes in titer can be observed on paired samples which aids in interpretation of results and helps A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 time the onset of infection. Timing of sera collection after illness onset is important, and we recommend an acute sample in the first few days after illness onset and a second sample 14-28 days after illness onset to reliably detect seroconversion.There may be a small but important incidence of false-positive SARS-CoV-2 NAT results, which are not always easily identified [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . This can be particularly significant in jurisdictions where the incidence of COVID-19 cases is low. We recommend serological follow-up of unexpected NAT positive cases in these circumstances in an attempt to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19.We found that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA provided better performance characteristics than IgM with higher sensitivity, equivalent specificity and higher titers at all time points after illness onset. This is consistent with findings in other respiratory tract infections, and has been observed previously forWe chose to report any reactivity as positive in the IFA test, since the best way to resolve falsepositive results is to collect a second sample to observe a rising titer. Low antibody titers that are associated with true positive cases will generally demonstrate a rising titer on a second sample, c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 has occurred. As with SARS-CoV, the appearance of IgG antibodies appears to be simultaneous with, or even occurs before, the appearance of IgA and IgM [13, 29] .While the association between serological response, humoral immunity and protection from reinfection remains to be established for SARS-CoV-2, it is concerning that the kinetics of the antibody responses demonstrated in this study suggest that antibody responses may be short-lived, at least when measured by IFA. Whether this translates to early susceptibility to re-infection is a priority research area.The investigations into the association of antibody response with disease severity in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections have yielded inconsistent results. Some studies have shown early, robust antibody responses to be associated with mild disease [29, 30] , while others have indicated that severe disease is associated with higher antibody titers which may indicate a role for disease-enhancing antibodies in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 [11, [31] [32] [33] . Our study found that antibody titers were higher in individuals who were hospitalized for management of COVID-19. It is possible that certain antibody subsets are associated with protection against severe disease while others are associated with poorer outcomes [34] . Poorer immune responses may be associated with prolonged viral shedding, and the presence of antibody does not always correlate with viral clearance [35, 36] . We were unable to demonstrate associations between age, sex or duration of viral shedding and antibody titer.This study has several limitations. NAT was utilised as the reference standard for comparison to serology -false-positive and false-negative NATs may have resulted in under-estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of IFA. Antibody testing by neutralization is a more appropriate reference standard, but was only performed on a subset of samples due to the technical challenges associated with this method. Furthermore, samples classified as reference standard negative may have been collected from individuals who had an earlier, undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection but who were now presenting with a second, unrelated respiratory tract or febrile illness. Such individuals may have A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 12 had negative NAT tests with persistent positive serology and would have been classified as false positive serology tests. We did not assess for cross-reactivity with other endemic coronaviruses, however, if this were to be significant we would have expected more false-positive results given that these other coronaviruses circulate commonly. The median age of participants was 38 years, with those at extremes of age being under-represented so our results may not be readily generalizable to these age groups.IFA testing is a relatively specialised technique, and while robotic instruments can be utilised for slide preparation and incubation, the reading of results is a relatively manual process requiring well trained laboratory staff. Commercially produced serology tests designed for high-throughput automated platforms such as chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays may be more suitable than IFA for many laboratories settings, but will need to be subject to robust evaluation.Measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody by IFA in serum is an accurate method for retrospective diagnosis of COVID-19. Serological testing should be selectively incorporated into diagnostic algorithms for SARS-CoV-2 infection for use in identifying additional cases where NAT was not performed, and to help resolve cases where false-negative and false-positive NATs are suspected. IFA, along with neutralizing antibody testing, will serve as appropriate comparators for other SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody assays. This includes for assessment of rapid point-of-care antibody tests, which have been shown to be less sensitive and specific [37] . Future research is awaited to further define the duration of the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to understand the serological correlates of protection from re-infection. Antibody assays will play a major role in the understanding of COVID-19 epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunity and immunotherapeutics. ","Australia","first author","2020-08-27",8

First reports in late December 2019 described a cluster of patients with pneumonia, linked to a live animal market in Wuhan, China [1] [2] [3] . To date, laboratory testing has comprised detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus using reversetranscriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays, predominantly from patients meeting specific epidemiological criteria. However, the immense scale of RT-PCR diagnostic testing has placed extraordinary demands on laboratories, with challenges relating to supply chains of swabs, laboratory reagents, and the human and financial resource required to support population-level testing.Over the past 2 months, there has been rapid development of serological assays for COVID-19 in a number of countries [4] . Serological tests rely on detection of specific antiviral antibodies (immunoglobulin M [IgM], immunoglobulin G [IgG], immunoglobulin A [IgA], or total antibody) in patient serum, plasma, or whole blood. The broad array of serological tests now available vary both in analytical performance and in their particular utility in the overall public health response to COVID-19. The most publicized serological tests for COVID-19 have been lateral flow immunoassays, also known as serological point of care tests (PoCT), which have been manufactured and deployed in several countries. Most available PoCT involve detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies through binding to immobilized antigen (generally domains of the spike [S] protein) attached to colloidal gold, followed by detection of the conjugates by an anti-human IgM or IgG antibody. In addition, a control line is usually included in the assay, which helps determine whether the test result is valid. The relatively cheap and simple nature of lateral flow assays means that production is suited to scaling-up for increased testing capacity.In many countries, including the United States and Australia, the rapid development and implementation of COVID-19 diagnostics has meant that normally stringent regulatory criteria have not been applied to all tests, with limited published data supporting assay performance in clinical settings. Here, in order to inform the deployment of PoCT in Australia, we compared the performance characteristics of 5 commercially available PoCT with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a recently described surrogate virus neutralization assay (sVNT), using samples from (1) patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19; (2) patients who were RT-PCR negative but presented with respiratory symptoms during the peak of the pandemic in Australia, and (3) patients before the COVID-19 pandemic.A testing panel was specifically developed to test PoCT devices for this study (Supplementary Material), consisting of 3 patient populations: (1) sera from 91 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-PCR from upper and/or lower respiratory tract specimens; (2) sera from 36 patients with seasonal coronavirus infections or other acute infections (eg, dengue, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus); and (3) serum from a random cohort (56 patients) of the Australian population obtained in 2018.One of the devices was also tested against serum samples from 1217 patients who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative but presented to a hospital emergency department between 6 February and 15 April 2020, spanning the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.Serum samples were obtained from a large academic hospital in Melbourne, Australia (Royal Melbourne Hospital, RMH), or the Victorian state reference laboratory for virology (Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, VIDRL). Convalescent patients were followed up at home by the RMH@ Home Hospital in the Home Team. Information on each cohort is provided in the Supplementary Material.Cases were classified clinically as mild (not admitted to hospital), moderate (admitted to a hospital ward, but not the intensive care unit [ICU]), or severe (admitted to ICU). Of the 91 cases, 71 were mild, 17 were moderate, and 3 were severe.SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the Coronavirus Typing assay (AusDiagnostics), a 2-step, heminested multiplex tandem PCR, with 7 coronavirus RNA targets plus a proprietary artificial sequence as an internal control. All positive samples underwent additional confirmatory testing for SARS-CoV-2 at VIDRL, using previously published primers [5] .Serological PoCT devices were tested exactly as per the manufacturer's stated instructions for use, including use of plastic droppers and buffers provided in the kits. Devices were provided through the Australian Government Therapeutic Goods Administration, based on device availability at the time of the study (Supplementary Table 1 ). In brief, 10 μL of serum was added to the device, with addition of between 60 and 100 μL of the manufacturer's provided buffer. Devices were incubated at room temperature according to the time period defined in the instructions for use (generally 10-15 minutes). All results were read as per the instructions for use. Testing was performed by laboratory technicians, all of whom had undergone competency training in the use of lateral flow assays. Testing of each sample in the serum panel was performed in duplicate, with a triplicate deciding test for discordant results. Any faint line present at test termination was considered a positive result. Results were recorded in a password-protected database available only to study investigators. All patient samples were deidentified.Five ELISA testing was performed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, a commercially available ELISA (Supplementary Table 1 ). The assay involves semiquantitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA or IgG antibodies in serum through binding to a recombinant structural antigen (S1 domain of the Spike protein) fixed to reagent wells. If test sera contain anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a second incubation step using enzyme-labelled anti-human IgA or anti-human IgG will catalyze a color reaction, detected by an optical density reader. Semiquantitative results were reported as a ratio as per the manufacturer's instructions for use and interpreted as follows: To further assess antibody response, we used a recently described sVNT, that detects circulating antibodies directed against the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in an isotype-and species-independent manner, based on antibodymediated blockage of interaction between the ACE2 receptor protein and the RBD [6] . In brief, 10 μL of test serum was diluted with 90 μL of sample dilution buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (HRP-RBD); the test solution was added to wells coated with fixed ACE2 receptor. The degree to which test serum inhibited binding of the HRP-RBD to ACE2 receptors, compared to control serum, was determined by optical density reading, with 20% inhibition and above considered a positive result. Sera tested in the sVNT included samples from 110 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and 142 samples from 142 control patients, of which 36 samples were from patients with seasonal coronavirus or other acute infections, and 106 samples were from a random cohort of the Australian population obtained in 2016 and 2018 (Supplementary Material). A first round of testing on all samples followed the instructions for use; subsequently, samples within the 10% coefficient of variation (CV) range as stated in the instructions for use (inhibition cutoff of 18%-22%, n = 21) were repeated in duplicate to assess for interrun variation.An in-house microneutralization assay was performed at the University of Melbourne. SARS-CoV-2 isolate CoV/Australia/ VIC01/2020 [7] passaged in Vero cells was stored at −80°C. Serial 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated plasma were incubated with 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour and residual virus infectivity was assessed in quadruplicate wells of Vero cells; viral cytopathic effect was read on day 5. The neutralizing antibody titer was calculated using the Reed/Muench method as previously described [8, 9] .All statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 3.6.3) or GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.2). Binomial 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all proportions. Differences in nonnormally distributed numerical data were calculated using the Wilcoxon Rank sum test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.2).Ethical approval for this project was obtained from the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee (RMH HREC QA2020052).The overall sensitivity for either IgA or IgG detection was 67.9% (95% CI, 59.4%-75.6%) and specificity was 72.8% (95% CI, 62.6%-81.6%) ( Table 1 ). The sensitivity for IgA or IgG detection increased to 93.8% (95% CI, 85.0%-98.3%) when only samples collected >14 days post symptom onset were considered (Table 2) , and a significant rise in signal/cutoff ratio was observed for both IgA and IgG over time (P < .001) ( Figure 1 ). ROC AUC analysis was performed for both IgA and IgG. Overall, the IgA ROC AUC was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69-0.81) and the IgG ROC AUC was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.59-0.72) (Supplementary with seasonal coronavirus (2 HKU1, 1 NL63, and 1 OC43) were positive for IgA. Neither of the 2 samples with anti-MERS-CoV antibodies displayed cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgA or IgG, but 1 sample with anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG (ratios 3.81 and 1.26, respectively; Figure 2 ).We compared the sensitivity and specificity of 5 PoCT devices, using RT-PCR as our reference standard, and interpreting PoCT results as positive when either an IgM or IgG result was read as positive. Overall, the sensitivities ranged from 51.8% (95% CI, 43.1%-60.4%) to 68.6% (95% CI, 60.1%-76.3%), and specificities from 95.6% (95% CI, 89.2%-98.8%) to 100.0% (95% CI, 96.1%-100.0%) ( Table 1 and Figure 3A and 3B). When only samples collected >14 days were considered, the sensitivities ranged from 78.5% (95% CI, 66.5%-87.7%) to 93.8% (95% CI, 85.0%-98.3%) ( Table 2 ). Using the OnSite device (for which there was a surplus of kits), additional testing was conducted on 1217 samples from patients who presented with respiratory symptoms but tested RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. In total, 39/1217 (3.2%) samples tested positive for IgM and/or IgG. On further testing, 6/39 samples (15.4%) tested positive to IgA and/or IgG using the ELISA assay, of which 1 was confirmed by sVNT (inhibition 63.9%) when an inhibition cutoff of 20% was employed (see below). In addition, this sample was confirmed as positive using a whole-virus microneutralization assay. This patient presented 21 days following symptom onset, with significant epidemiological risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, and likely represents a true infection.Using the highest performance device characteristics (sensitivity 68.6% [Wondfo] and specificity >99.9% [Hightop] ) and lowest performance characteristics (sensitivity 51.8%[VivaDiag] and specificity 95.6% [OnSite]) as hypothetical best and worse scenarios, respectively, the performance of PoCT was assessed across a range of SARS-CoV-2 population prevalence estimates (0.1%, 1%, 5%, and 10%; Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 1) . With the best performing PoCT characteristics at an estimated SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence in Australia of 0.03%, the positive predictive value was only 17.1%.In total, 311 samples were also tested using the sVNT assay. Applying a 20% inhibition cutoff and using RT-PCR as the reference standard, the sensitivity of sVNT was 62.7% (95% CI, 55.0%-70.0%); this increased to 91.2%% (95% CI, 81.8%-96.7%) when only samples collected >14 days post symptom onset were considered (Table 1 and Table 2 ). Specificity was 94.4% (95% CI, 89.2%-97.5%), with cross-reaction observed for 8 samples (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 2 ). Increasing the inhibition cutoff to 25%, or repeating samples with an initial inhibition score between 18% and 22% improved the specificity to 99.3% (95% CI, 96.1%-99.9%) with little change in sensitivity (Table 1 and Table 2 ). The % CV for the in-house control sample with respect to the percentage inhibition was 10.8% between runs and 5.8% within run.Accurate laboratory testing is integral to the prevention and control of COVID-19. The unprecedented scale of diagnostic testing has led to the rapid development and implementation of a large range of diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2, including serological tests. However, there are limited peer-reviewed data on the performance characteristics of serological tests, and in order to best inform the implementation of these assays, high-quality postmarket validation data are urgently needed to guide laboratories, public health agencies, and governments in the appropriate and responsible use of such tests [10] .In this study, we assessed the performance characteristics of 5 serological PoCT, a commercial ELISA, and a commercial novel sVNT against a large serum panel from a cohort of over 100 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. In keeping with other studies [11] , the sensitivity of all assays was low (<70%) when all sample collection time points were considered. However, as expected given the reported antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, sensitivity increased considerably when samples collected >14 days post symptom onset were assessed [12] , with the majority achieving sensitivities over 90%. Our findings provide further support for recent commentary suggesting that current serological assays have limited, if any, role in the diagnosis of acute COVID-19, with RT-PCR remaining the gold standard for diagnosis in the acute setting [13, 14] . Specificities for PoCT ranged from 92.4% to 100%; it is possible this may reflect differences in the antigens used in each assay, although specific information about the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigen used in the assay was not described for most PoCT. In keeping with previous reports [15, 16] , when both IgA and IgG components of the ELISA were considered, specificity was low (72.8%), but considering IgG alone, specificity increased to 97.8%.This study is one of the first to utilize a recently described sVNT assay [6] . Previous work describing the development of this assay reported a 95%-100% sensitivity and 100% specificity using cohorts in Singapore and China [7] . In our cohort at >14 days post symptom onset the test achieved sensitivity of 91.2% (95% CI, 81.8%-96.7%) and specificity of 94.4% (95% CI, 89.2%-97.5%). Although limited clinical data are available on the cohort used to develop and validate the assay [6] , it is possible that our relatively mild clinical cohort may generate lower antibody titers than a more severely unwell cohort, potentially influencing sensitivity of the assay [12, 17] . Of note, the majority of our nonspecific (false positive) samples in the sVNT assay recorded inhibition just over the 20% cutoff. However, specificity improved when either (1) a higher inhibition cutoff was used or (2) samples within an arbitrary range (based on the instructions for use reported % CV of the assay) were tested in triplicate. In our low-prevalence setting where the test is more likely to act as a confirmatory assay, raising the inhibition cutoff to 25% increased the specificity to 99.3% (95% CI, 96.1%-99.9%), thus improving clinical utility. Alternatively, introduction of an equivocal range for the assay with repeat testing for samples within this range, would be another approach to mitigate potential assay variation. In contrast to acute diagnosis, there are settings where highquality serological assays will have utility, including (1) defining antibody prevalence in key populations such as frontline workers; (2) determining the extent of COVID-19 infection within the community; (3) identifying individuals for further evaluation of therapeutic immunoglobulin donation; and (4) vaccine development and evaluation. For (3) and (4), it is essential to have a good quantification of the functional neutralizing antibodies among donors or vaccines and the PoCT and ELISA assays do not provide an endpoint titer. However, in order to appropriately deploy serological testing, it is critical to understand the limitations of test performance in the epidemiological context in which tests are used. This is particularly important in a setting such as Australia, which, based on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 (8001 cases as of 2 July 2020), has an estimated COVID-19 period prevalence of 0.03% [18] . As such, even with highly sensitive and specific serological tests, the majority of positive results are likely to represent false positives. When considering the use of serology to inform policies relating to relaxing of physical distancing interventions, specificity of the assay becomes critical. If the majority of those identified as immune are actually false-positive results, then the threshold to maintain immunity within the community will not be achieved [19] .Analogous to HIV testing in low-prevalence settings [20] , serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 may require a 2-step approach, whereby a sensitive high-throughput screening assay is followed by a high-specificity assay for confirmation (eg, neutralization testing or western blot). This approach could facilitate seroepidemiological studies in low-prevalence settings, which are required to better understand the extent of COVID-19 infection at a population level. Ongoing questions remain, however, about the duration and type of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, particularly around the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies against future reinfection [12] . Accordingly, the concept of an ""immunity passport"" that facilitates return to workplaces or school should be interpreted with caution, and the World Health Organization currently recommends the use of PoCT immunodiagnostic assays in research settings only, and not for clinical decision making until further evidence is available [21] .A key strength of this study was our systematic collection of convalescent samples. By establishing a community collection platform, we tested over 50 patients who were more than 21 days post symptom onset. Ideally, validation of serological assays should be performed against a testing panel that includes samples from (1) patients at acute and convalescent stages of infection (to assess sensitivity), and (2) patients with other human coronavirus infections (to assess specificity). Given the range of serological assays now available, there is a critical need for standardized protocols, including reference standards, across laboratories when conducting evaluations of emerging serological assays. Further, the relatively recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 means there are limited data on the sensitivities of serological assays at 3-6 months post infection. Future work should assess any potential drop in sensitivity at varying time points post infection.In summary, our data describe the performance characteristics of 5 PoCT devices, a commercially available ELISA assay, and a newly developed sVNT. Overall, our findings are in keeping with recent position statements that note serological assays have limited, if any, role in the diagnosis of acute COVID-19 infection. Our data strongly suggest that current PoCT devices should not be used in the diagnosis of acute COVID-19 or as the sole assay in population-level serosurveys. Nevertheless, there are settings where high-quality serological assays will have clinical utility. The curated panel of samples assembled for this study is being expanded and provides a valuable repository for rapid validation of new serological assays as they become available.Supplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

These measures range from relatively mild requirements like wearing face masks, washing hands, or avoiding close contacts to school closures and imposed isolation that are likely to have a detrimental and unpredictable influence on social and economic life. 1 Despite their significant impact, the introduction of many of these measures was not supported with high-quality evidence.First, conducting RCT would not be feasible for both ethical and practical constraints. Second, significant differences between the coronaviruses that caused the SARS and MERS outbreaks and SARS-CoV-2 (such as the likely airborne transmission 2 and asymptomatic infectiousness of the latter 3,4 ) undermine extrapolation from the data gathered during these previous epidemics. Finally, the current pandemic has not lasted long enough to gather observational data in the amount and quality sufficient for the assessment of the efficacy of alternative public health interventions, since the first reports were published just weeks after the first measures were introduced. 5 One of the many ways to address the issue concerning the impracticality of conducting RCTs and observational studies in the context of an ongoing pandemic is through scientific modelling, in particular epidemiological modelling. Here, we focus on the so-called agent-based modelling (ABM) approach, which differs from more traditional epidemiological modelling in several ways.ABMs are a form of computational modelling strategy where agents are treated as entities interacting with each other and their environment in a locally defined fashion described by a set of rules.The overall dynamics of the system are then computed, allowing for the simulation of complex patterns and an understanding of how these patterns arise. 6, 7 ABMs are used in many scientific contexts, including modelling the spread of infectious diseases, and have proven successful in informing policy decisions before. For instance, Eisinger and Thulke 8 modified and then applied a previously developed ABM of the spread of rabies, generating a rule-based model that represented specific spatial and behavioural characteristics of the fox population (eg, with fox families represented as moving within home ranges and young foxes engaging in long-distance migratory behaviour). 6 Whereas the classical differential equation models predicted that vaccinating at least 70% of the fox population would eliminate rabies, the ABM indicated that a successful vaccination strategy could do with much less than 70% of the population being immunized once the spatial arrangements of fox hosts were explicitly considered, saving millions of Euros as a result. Moreover, the ABM also suggested that the classical strategy would fail more often than not, and was successfully applied to deal with the rabies problem. However, despite the promising record of using ABMs in effective epidemiological interventions, its use in informing proposed measures against the novel coronavirus epidemic has raised criticism. [9] [10] [11] Unfortunately for the assessment of healthcare interventions based on this type of epidemiological models, standard evidence hierarchies exclude agent-based models altogether and include theoretical or mechanistic inferences at the lowest level of the hierarchy.For example, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 12 and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE guidelines) 13 include theoretical and mechanistic reasoning but agent-based models fall beyond their scope. This can be explained by the novelty of agent-based modelling and the limited trust of EBMers in theoretical and, to some extent, also mechanistic reasoning, which, despite being used implicitly to assess the possibility of confounding and the quality of results, 14 is downgraded or rejected as either subjective or fallacious. 15 However, such a view has been challenged by a group of philosophers advocating for improving the practices of evidence assessment in medicine by putting more weight on mechanistic reasoning in causal inference. [16] [17] [18] The position of the EBM+ program [16] [17] [18] is encapsulated by the normative reading of the Russo-Williamson Thesis, 19 which states that causal claims should be based on both difference-making and mechanistic evidence.The causal claims supported by agent-based models have been interpreted inconsonantly: either as being in line with the potential outcome approach (POA), 20 as delivering theory-driven understanding 21 or as providing mechanistic evidence. 22 Below, we show that all of these apparently inconsistent interpretations are correct, because the best contemporary ABMs bear a resemblance to the actual mechanisms and therefore allow for the counterfactual assessment of intervention efficacy in the target while also delivering an understanding of the phenomena of interest. Our argument proceeds by Apart from the compartmental SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) framework and its derivatives [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] or regression analysis, 29, 30 most advanced models of the spread of the novel coronavirus are transformed versions of agent-based influenza pandemic models. 11, 31 Such models have been used as evidence for introducing (sometimes severe) public health measures, 32 with the recent change in British policy being the prime example. In this section, we illustrate this approach to modelling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with an agent-based model of the epidemic in Australia 31 based on AceMod.Developed as a ""framework for studying influenza pandemics in Australia"" 33 (p. 412) . AceMod is an influenza spread model that addresses the need for simulating interventions responding to the outbreaks of future respiratory diseases. While the 2009 swine flu pandemic was the motivation for constructing AceMod, the model was not intended to accurately represent the outbreak of the H1N1 strain, but rather as a generalized framework for studying how an infectious disease spreads through the social interactions of Australians. AceMod utilizes census data to ascribe realistic spatial and social characteristics to almost 20 million agents inhabiting the model world. These agents are divided into different social groups of varying characteristics, with households differentiated proportionally according to statistical data on the prevalence of different types of families (singles, single parents and couples with or without children). These features are ascribed to agents stochastically in a way that replicates the aggregate structure of statistical data. During the daytime, children and students meet in classrooms and at schools, adults go to work and pensioners stay at home. During the nighttime, the agents encounter contacts at households and in their neighbourhoods (eg, at supermarkets, theatres).The disease can be contracted by an agent in the event of meeting an infected individual in one of these settings. The probability that an agent i contracts the disease in a given step t depends on the number of sick individuals met in that step and the contagiousness of the disease, scaled by K. The modellers assume that the infectivity of the disease decreases linearly over time. Asymptomatic cases are assumed to be 50% less infectious than symptomatic ones, and the flu lasts 5 days within the model. After this period, recovered agents cannot infect others. Additionally, those who experience symptoms do so after an incubation period lasting approximately 3 days. The influenza epidemic is started by agents coming to Australia via international airports and seeded into communities living near the airports at random.To represent an epidemic of a particular strain of influenza with AceMod, the model requires calibration. Modellers can proceed with this step in two ways, depending on the accessibility of data. In the case of well-studied influenza strains, their infectivity and the ratios of transmission in different contexts are well-recognized, and parameter values can be chosen based on empirical studies. However, if these data are missing, then parameter values have to be calibrated using statistical procedures such as simplex or genetic algorithms to maximize the fit of the model to a benchmark. After constructing and calibrating AceMod, modellers run simulations to obtain the estimates of prevalence, incidence and attack rates, and choose the most common outcome (due to stochasticity, different runs of the model may lead to obtaining slightly different results).Chang et al 31 ABMs such as AceMod can be seen as consisting of two parts: the rules specifying the behaviour of agents and the creation of the model society, as well as the assumptions characterizing the infectivity of the pathogen causing the epidemic. Given that AceMod is based on 2016 census data and a major change in social behaviours is unlikely to have occurred since then, the model accurately represents the social interactions of present-day Australians. Hence, the former part of the model has been left mostly unchanged, beyond increasing the number of agents to over 24 million to adjust for the growing population. In addition to introducing a social structure sufficiently resembling the contact network of the present population, obtaining accurate predictions of epidemic development and policy assessment requires inputting data on transmission likelihoods that are true for the pathogen causing the modelled epidemic. 34 Most changes in the model are concerned with the assumptions specifying the infectivity of the disease. Even though several features of influenza epidemics are similar to the epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus, they differ with respect to infectivity and attack rates, mortality rates, the average duration of disease, the reproductive number R 0 and the distribution of asymptomatic cases. Therefore, these parameters in the model required recalibration.The transmission probabilities remained mainly as specified in the The length of the generation period was calibrated to 6.4 days to reflect this difference in the model. Additionally, the likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV-2 but staying asymptomatic was set to be agedependent, and equalled 1/3 for adults while minors were set to be five times less likely to suffer from symptoms than adults. While this assumption is in agreement with the empirical findings that children represent a minor fraction of symptomatic cases, the calibration aimed at reproducing aggregate epidemic curves and may diverge from the actual chances of developing symptoms.Within the AceMod framework, the reproductive number R 0 is not one of the assumptions inputted into the model. Rather, its estimate results from a simulation of the scenario described by the rules and assumptions, some of which are stochastic. The assumptions considered and, particularly, the parameter denoting contagiousness of the disease (K) have been calibrated such that R 0 stays within the limit of (2.0-2.5), that is, in agreement with empirical estimates of the reproductive number at the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. 35, 36 The set of parameter values that result in the estimate of Before proceeding to our argument, let us first make several general remarks about modelling. These remarks should prove essential in clarifying the main issues that are often raised with regard to using simplified models, particularly in the context of policy decision-making. First of all, ABMs are instances of mechanistic models, for they clearly fit the general, also called the minimal, characterization of what a mechanism is: a set of entities whose activities and interactions are organized such that they are responsible for the phenomenon. [37] [38] [39] This definition is broad enough to conceptually unify the debates on biological and social mechanisms under a single notion of a mechanism. Furthermore, such definition leaves open the possibility of integrating biological and social aspects into a mixedmechanism model. 40 It should also be noted that much like any other kind of model, ABMs serve as simplified representations of their target phenomena.As the AceMod case clearly shows, modellers introduce various simplifications by which they purport to adequately capture the core dynamics of the modelled phenomenon. In this process, they first abstract away from the complexities of the real system by ""extracting"" certain features that they believe to be of crucial importance and that will then be the focus of modelling, whereas other features that may or may not have a causal influence are disregarded in these early stages. Modelling is an iterative process during which the merits of the model's assumptions are continuously being evaluated, and if required, the assumptions are refined and additional assumptions added. More importantly, some of those extracted features are distorted to the extent that, if taken literally, they would misrepresent the actual state of things. However, introducing such distortions is often made in full awareness, with the ultimate goal of finding out whether the consequences they have for the behaviour of the system make a difference and to what degree. Philosophers often refer to the former-that is, the set of properties retained in a model-as an abstraction, while the latter case-that is, the distortions of the system's features-is called an idealization. 41 However, abstractions and idealizations do not exhaust the conceptual toolbox available to modellers. A popular way to attempt to model a given system realistically is to introduce various approximations. Although there are noteworthy differences between approximations and idealizations, we cannot afford to go into any detail here. In summary, models often effectively disregard, distort and otherwise simplify possibly important details. In light of this, many wonder whether we can gain insight into the modelled phenomenon at all, and if so then how.Although the SARS-CoV-2 ABM is fairly detailed and precise, it cannot do without some of the simplifications discussed above. Consider some of the following assumptions introduced in the model. On Consequently, we concur with Andersen's claim that ""no mechanism model can include all the actual, much less the potential, causal relationships in which such a mechanism may engage in a system"" 51 (p. 995). This pessimistic view on simplified models has inspired the method known as exploratory modelling. 52 In cases when the values of parameters and assumptions inputted into the model cannot be established with certainty, researchers can simulate multiple possible worlds to discover the dependencies that are stable across the set of different models. In cases when only a fraction of assumptions are uncertain, researchers conduct sensitivity analyses to check if changes in the values of the parameters lead to changes in their conclusions. 53 The results that remain unchanged despite minor adjustments to assumptions are considered to be robust. 54 This, in turn, leads to choosing those interventions that are most effective across different sets of parameter values, known as robust decision-making. 52 Others prefer to think in terms of the distinction between howactually and how-possibly modelling, referring to models that describe an actual mechanism or a possible mechanism, respectively. 55 There are two general ways to unpack the concept of a how-possibly model. Here we argue that, notwithstanding the simplifications introduced in the discussed influenza and SARS-CoV-2 ABMs, the epidemiologists are, in fact, providing representations of actual mechanisms of the spread of the viruses. This can be supported by exploiting the relevant similarities 56,57 between the SARS-CoV-2 ABM and the actual outbreak. The respects in which an ABM can be judged similar to its target concern the features retained in that model, while the degree(s) of similarity concern the extent to which the model's fea- Two remarks are in order here. First, one may oppose the claim that what is being represented is the actual mechanism by arguing that the mechanism underlying the beginning of the outbreak and the fully-fledged epidemic are distinct. Changes in social behaviour or genetic mutations could undermine the behavioural adequacy of the model. Second, it is possible (at least in principle) that the model represents a false mechanism, but is calibrated to the relevant benchmark such that it reproduces it. For example, there is no data confirming (or disproving) the assumption that children are asymptomatic five times more often than adults. As the modellers admit, this assumption was made not only to account for the lower attack rate among minors, but also to make the model adequate to aggregate-level data. This approach to calibration resembles the estimation of statistical parameters (a.k.a. curve fitting) and is considered dubious. The main line of criticism highlights that it is in principle possible to construct a model that represents a possible mechanism and, using calibration, adjust parameter values so that it reproduces the represented phenomenon, that is, obtains behavioural adequacy despite being false. However, while this criticism is indeed justified regarding models of mechanisms that are epistemically inaccessible in other ways (such as mechanisms in the social sciences 59 ), it is not so in the case of epidemiological mechanisms whose transmission mechanism can be studied empirically and compared to the mechanism represented by the model. This can establish that the mechanism represented by the model is similar (in relevant aspects and to relevant degrees) to the mechanism that generates the outbreak, that is, achieves mechanical ade- Given that AceMod fulfils Glennan's criteria for behavioural and mechanical adequacy, considering our current understanding of the novel coronavirus, we can conclude that Chang's et al 31 model represents the actual mechanism of the spread of the disease in Australia.Given this, the claims assessing the efficacy of the mitigation measures under consideration are likely to be accurate not only within the model but also about its target. We claim this with several caveats in mind to be discussed in the next section.It is also important to note that the ABM integrates the biological aspects, expressed by the parameter of infectivity, and the social aspects such as daily interaction regimes. As a result, the ABM should be construed as an instance of a model of a mixed mechanism, a concept elaborated by Kelly et al. 40 Due to exposure patterns, population-level phenomena such as infectious disease epidemics are crucially dependent on human behaviour and social practices. In cases like the current pandemic, effective interventions may best be aimed at the societal level and therefore mechanistic models that integrate social factors, human behaviour and biological aspects (something that the ABM discussed here attempts to do) are arguably best suited for providing understanding and suggesting policy decisions.Our study defends using ABMs for informing decisions regarding miti- had limited influence on the severity of the epidemic, considering that just one cluster was located at a school. 68 We believe that, considering the diversity in the number and patterns of social interactions across countries, the quality of evidence from ABMs should be assessed on the case by case basis. To do so, one can employ the approach of Parkinnen et al 17 (p. 79) developed initially to evaluate the quality of evidence for biological mechanisms.In that case, one should consider (a) the quality of the method (ie, con- Additionally, ABMs, much like the compartmental models, are dependent on the assumptions of the modellers. 10 Our claim that AceMod calibrated for SARS-CoV-2 bears similarity to the actual mechanism of the epidemic depends on the accuracy of the empirical results used as an input for this model. We need to repeatedly acknowledge the provisional nature of these empirical results, given the novelty of the pathogen. If the parameter values in AceMod were miscalibrated, then the assessments of intervention efficacy could be wrong. This implies that neither the virus can mutate nor that people can significantly and unpredictably change their behaviour since ""the efficacy of implementation depends on people's reactions, [the stability of] pre-existing social norms and structural societal constraints."" 9 Furthermore, the effects of epidemiological agent-based modelling are highly dependent on social structure and carefully calibrated to social and economic characteristics. Therefore, the epidemiological ABMs are geographically localized and their conclusions should not be extrapolated beyond their target systems, 71 unless the models and their predictions are calibrated to particular settings. Finally, while AceMod is well-documented in the two publications discussed throughout our paper, neither its code nor detailed documentation regarding its use is published (this unfortunately also applies to some other ABMs of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic). Given these limitations, the models should be carefully checked for coding errors and other possible flaws before applying their implications in the policy context.In summary, we have argued that, despite the criticism raised against models being the appropriate vehicle for informing policies, the SARS-CoV ABM is suitable for this purpose because the mechanism described by the model sufficiently resembles the mechanism at work in the real world. Thus, our best contemporary epidemiological ABMs are representations of the actual mechanism of the spread of the virus.Unfortunately, such models have been left out from methodological discussions and are not explicitly listed by evidence hierarchies. While the need for appraising mechanistic reasoning in medicine is also voiced by EBMers, 72 there is no broadly-accepted view on how to amalgamate evidence of different types. Further research is needed to assess the risk of bias in the epidemiological models that deliver both difference-making and mechanistic evidence. However, considering the current situation and pressing need for rapid and accurate decisions regarding mitigation measures, policymakers should take to heart the advice that ""if no randomized trial has been carried out […], we must follow the trail to the next best external evidence and work from there"" 73 (p. 74 ). In the current situation, accurately calibrated epidemiological ABMs are the best existing evidence.","Australia","abstract","2020-08-21",8

As the virus and its impact spread, healthcare systems around the world have responded with innovative, large-scale protective measures, reallocation of resources and changes in service delivery. Medical imaging has played an essential role in diagnosis, assisting in prognosis and evaluation of treatment interventions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. [1] [2] [3] [4] On 31 December 2019, an epidemic consisting of cases with unexplained low respiratory tract infections was detected in Wuhan, China and reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO). 5 It would be later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 6 The WHO announced that this disease was caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020. By the 11 March 2020, there had been 118,000 cases in 114 countries and over 4000 deaths, prompting the WHO to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. 7 At the time of writing (30 June 2020), the WHO had reported over 10.1 million confirmed cases, with 502,278 deaths in 216 countries worldwide. 8 Australia's first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in late January 2020. 9 At 30 June 2020, Australia had recorded a total of 7834 cases, 104 deaths and 7,037 patients recovered. 10 Over 60% of Australian cases have been traced to overseas sources of infection. 11 Australia's approach to responding to the pandemic was to 'flatten the curve'. Based on modelling of different transmission rates, the 'curve' demonstrates the likely number of people who would contract COVID-19 over a period of time. 12 The main intention behind flattening this curve was to keep demand for healthcare resources as low as possible, ideally below the capacity of the healthcare system to provide them. This was achieved by various physical distancing and contact tracing activities. Strategies implemented in Australia included, but were not limited to; international and state border closures, closure of non-essential businesses, local lockdown measures particularly in aged care, physical distancing, working from home and closures of education facilities. 13, 14 Figure 1 15 demonstrates the success of these strategies in slowing down the spread of COVID-19. This enabled the healthcare system sufficient time to prepare, diversify and build capacity to cope with the likely increase in demand from patients presenting with suspected COVID-19. Preparations included procurement of equipment, resource deployment, logistical arrangements and operational planning and were guided by experience and evidence in a collaborative and agile manner.The purpose of this commentary was to offer Australian medical imaging departments (MIDs) several operational perspectives on how different services responded to the COVID- 19 pandemic. Furthermore, it explores considerations for reviewing existing processes and preparing for a possible secondary COVID-19 surge or similar future pandemic. This article sought the operational responses of five medical imaging departments within public hospitals in South East Queensland. These views and recommendations derive from the authors' experiences, a review of current literature and resources, many of which are referenced throughout this commentary. Some recommendations are based on untestable assumptions, any of which may be reasonably challenged. The authors propose specific priorities for the purpose of preparing a medical imaging department for a pandemic. Implementation of these strategies should be carefully considered in line with local laws, prevailing conditions, organisational objectives and strategies.In Queensland, public healthcare services are categorised into 6 levels, as outlined by the Clinical Skills Capability Framework (CSCF) which proposes minimum requirements for the provision of health services. 16 Table 1 presents the CSCF levels of hospitals whose MIDs contributed to this commentary. Each contributing hospital has a designated MID with a full suite of general diagnostic modalities and varying levels of subspecialty, nuclear medicine and interventional radiology capabilities. Staff that contributed to this pandemic response included managers, radiologists, radiographers, nuclear medicine technologists, nurses, medical imaging assistants and administrative support staff.Following an initial online (via Microsoft Teams) discussion and serial emails, all sites detailed numerous aspects of the changes and considerations in their response to the pandemic. From these, four pertinent themes emerged; infection control, resources, communication and change management.All authors agreed that the primary operational goal at the onset of the pandemic was infection control, specifically pertaining to the protection of staff and noninfected patients, to ensure their safety. Staff were consistently reminded of their role regarding physical distancing (within and outside the workplace), cough etiquette and hand hygiene. Reminders were delivered via regular emails, informative posters, physical demarcation on the floor and barriers outlining suitable physical distancing in clinical and non-clinical areas.At the start of the pandemic, several staff were overseas and then returned to Australia. In complying with government direction, 17 these team members were required to enter self-isolation and undergo COVID-19 testing before returning to their workplaces. Staff were also encouraged to consider whether they met specific criteria as being 'vulnerable staff'. These criteria were designed to identify those at high risk from the effects of COVID-19, due to existing health conditions and/or personal circumstances. 18 Staff that identified as vulnerable were re-deployed to lower risk areas within the MIDs to mitigate exposure, or elected to not attend work on medical advice. This ensured their safety was prioritised.The provision and safe use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was a major concern for MID staff. The rapid rollout of mandatory PPE training for all employees ensured its appropriate and safe use whilst alleviating confusion. Training was limited to being non-practical, due to requirements to preserve PPE by minimising nonessential usage. Staff were commonly unable to 'don and doff' 19 until in a clinical scenario that required it, relying on written, pictorial or video learning resources to gain competency and reassurance. The utilisation of 'spotters' provided support, allayed fears and afforded important redundancy within this safety system. Clear, visible and accessible procedures regarding donning and doffing, room preparation, patient flow and post-examination cleaning were vital, as staff were required to respond to rapidly changing information.The potential for PPE breaches was of constant concern for staff performing medical imaging for patients infected with COVID-19. Clear identification of patients who were confirmed or suspected of being COVID-19 positive was paramount. Several sites used colours such as green (non-suspected COVID-19) and purple (suspected COVID-19) to identify patient COVID-19 status. Furthermore, sites allocated specific zones for patients suspected of being COVID-19 positive. These clinical workflow strategies further reduced staff exposure and PPE use. The management of staff potentially exposed in the clinical environment was defined through local protocols developed by local infection control teams. All sites adopted documentation logs of all suspected COVID-19 patients and staff involved in their imaging, for contact tracing purposes. All PPE breaches were followed up to provide reassurance or advice once the COVID-19 status of the pertinent patient was determined.Some services considered alternative rostering arrangements to reduce the risk of exposure within departments, and the impact on operational capacity should a team member have become infected. Government advice required all close contacts of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to isolate for 14 days. Therefore, a single positive test within a team could potentially have greatly reduced departmental service capacity, a scenario identified as catastrophic for smaller MIDs. Multiple options for developing team-based rosters were considered by contributing sites. Shift overlap was approached differently between MIDs, with some removing it whilst others maintained it. Skill mix, staffing levels (particularly overnight), on-call capability of staff and managers and the ability to work in pairs were all options considered throughout the 24-hour period of service. A key challenge in developing a team-based roster was the trigger for implementation. Factors included, number of unavailable staff (e.g. COVID-19 contact/ positive, school closures) and numbers of cases presenting to each site. None of the contributing MIDs were required to trigger their full pandemic rosters.Staffing and equipment resource contingencies were considered by all contributing MIDs during the pandemic. Some services rapidly on-boarded casual staff to prepare for potential shortfalls. Queensland Health also invited expressions of interest for healthcare workers, for rapid deployment if required. Many staff also cancelled leave, boosting staff levels and operational capacity.At the height of the pandemic, PPE access was a significant challenge. This was intensified in smaller sites where management was often required to advocate for their staff to ensure PPE availability. Unfortunately, all sites experienced theft of these vital resources. Measures included locking up PPE and the provision of identified gatekeepers, to reduce theft and ensure ongoing accessibility. Centralisation of PPE resource management was implemented across contributing health services, providing regular and reliable supply of PPE. With the often overwhelming stream of information, identifying a facility PPE expert resource and trusting that resource was critical for staff safety. 20 The allocation of equipment resources in a rational, organised fashion was imperative in the early stages. All contributing MIDs designated specific equipment and examination rooms for positive and high-risk COVID-19 patients. This also occurred for mobile imaging equipment, which was assigned to specific clinical areas of need when a significant increase in demand for mobile chest X-rays was noted. This challenge was overcome by the purchase, rapid acquisition and deployment of additional mobile X-ray units. Importantly, the designation of equipment and rooms was accompanied by clear, documented workflows covering transport and imaging of patients within these specific areas. Clearly defined roles for all team members before and after examinations were assigned and communicated. The adoption of paired staff teams was imperative but required considerable re-allocation of staffing resources. Providing such capacity for paired staff teams ensured limitation of staff exposure, the support of a spotter and reduction in PPE use. Sonographers faced a unique challenge, as their work required close patient contact for extended periods. 21 All ultrasound examinations for suspected COVID-19 cases required detailed discussion between referring and radiology teams prior to scanning. Protocoling for examinations by radiologists to limit scan times was imperative. Due to the increased risk, utilisation of ultrasound examinations in the presence of COVID-19 was considered a last resort.Consideration was given to the radiation safety of staff and the public when changes in clinical practice and new techniques were adopted. 22 Departments who worked closely with medical physics colleagues were quickly able to measure and address any concerns, ensuring staff and public safety in line with local Radiation Safety and Protection Plans (RSPPs). 23 Communication Communication provides the greatest challenge to all organisations during a crisis. 24 During the pandemic's initial phase, there was an overwhelming amount of information communicated through mainstream, digital and social media platforms. This created a sense of fear for staff, greatly impacting their ability to provide services. Much of this fear was alleviated through open, honest and transparent planning and decision-making, supported by considered staff training. Departments quickly established a single, credible 'point of truth' for rapid communication and dissemination of reliable information. Many services adopted a single, daily email sent late in the day which collated all recent changes into one source. Providing staff time to assimilate information and absorb recent changes when starting shifts was adopted by some departments. Multiple forums for questions and answers during planning and training supported and reassured the staff of the organisational ability to manage the evolving crisis. New workplace instructions were drafted, reviewed and disseminated, outlining equipment designation, workflow changes, PPE and cleaning processes. These documents were revised multiple times following rapidly evolving advice from organisational leaders. These measures ensured consistent and inclusive messaging was communicated to all staff.With strict adherence to physical distancing guidelines in the workplaces, alternative avenues of communication were identified and adopted. All contributing services successfully adopted Microsoft Office Teams 25 as a digital platform for communication through messaging, video conferencing and document storage. This application was accessible and available to all staff through personal mobile devices. A challenge in using this application was the inability of the organisational Wi-Fi to reliably support video applications.A co-ordinated effort was undertaken by all departments to triage outpatient examinations and reschedule those considered non-essential. Communication to patients was vital, to maintain their trust in departments and to show respect. Limited symptom screening of all patients was also implemented prior to arriving and on arrival to the departments. 21 This was to ensure staff safety and prevent spread by identifying patients at higher risk of being COVID-19 positive prior to their examination.The COVID-19 pandemic challenged healthcare leaders at all levels to respond to rapid changes in healthcare delivery, staff and community safety. During the early stages of the pandemic response, contributing sites noted that managing staff emotions by clear and accurate communication was vital. It was important to alleviate staff fears through advocating for access to PPE and appropriate staffing resources. Leadership groups met frequently (often daily) to update each other regarding changes and share challenges within their subspecialties. Staff were acknowledged, listened to and supported at all times. A multi-faceted approach to the departments' communication strategy reduced speculation and rumour and sought to engender trust in departmental leadership. Furthermore, these succinct communication strategies alleviated change fatigue amongst staff.The hosting of students at the outset of the pandemic was noted as an ethical dilemma for departments. Staff were concerned about their responsibility for students with regard to students being exposed to COVID-19 and the potential risk of infection. The ethical principles of autonomy and non-maleficence were considered with respect to students, balancing the risk of harm to themselves with the unique learning opportunity. It was important for students and their education provider to receive clear communication regarding expectations, safety processes and training requirements. Further advice and guidelines were provided across Queensland Health regarding the support of students during the pandemic. 26, 27 The employment of students to provide assistant roles to MI professionals was also considered. 28 Maintaining patient-centred, quality care was achieved through encouraging staff to consider how changes imposed by the pandemic affected their patient interactions. One site noted the potential for the quality of patient-staff interactions to be diminished due to the wearing of PPEspecifically the lack of facial expressions that the patient was able to perceive and the obscuration of staff members' name badges. Staff placed a renewed focus on showing compassion through verbal means and touch (albeit through gloves) and writing their names on the outside of gowns and protective face shields.Staff from contributing departments are employed under provisions of the Industrial Act 2016 29 31 Together, these provide for a minimum safety net of enforceable conditions of employment for employees. These industrial frameworks rightly consider change management expectations including consultation with affected staff. The timeframes set out by these provisions to ensure appropriate consultation were impractical in the rapidly changing conditions of this pandemic, where staff, patient and community safety were paramount. Future consideration should be provided within industrial frameworks to facilitate rapid and temporary changes to the workforce to ensure employee safety. Staff were well supported by Unions with their advocacy of processes for identifying vulnerable staff and the provision of PPE for staff.Although the COVID-19 pandemic continues globally, Australia's implementation of the 'flatten the curve' strategy has thus far been considered successful. However, the potential for a 'second wave' should be factored into future healthcare service planning. Medical imaging services should continue to rethink and redesign workflows leveraging on lessons learnt, to prepare for future surges or pandemic events. This commentary is intended to outline key themes to be considered regarding MIDs response to a pandemic. Many Australian MIDs will already have implemented similar strategies to those described and this commentary may only serve as a limited resource. Medical imaging services must continue to work alongside the COVID-19 threat until a vaccine becomes available.

Identifying barriers of carrier progression for women in science: is COVID-19 creating new challenges?","and Arlene Dent (Case Western Research University, US) we discussed: the benefits of diverse research teams, the main roadblocks that women and minority groups (including ethnic and racial minorities) still encounter to advance their careers and a useful toolkit of ideas, suggestions and good advice [1] , proven to result in positive outcomes towards creating equal opportunity working environments in life sciences (Figure 1) .Although social justice and to some extent legal compliance might have been the initial drivers towards the implementation of policies to promote inclusive working environments, it is becoming increasingly accepted that diversity in the work force provides a competitive edge [2] . Research on financial performance from a group of 366 companies across the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Latin America revealed that gender diverse companies are 15 per cent more likely to financially outperform their counterparts [3] .Furthermore, ethnically diverse companies were found to be 35 per cent more likely to have financial returns above their national industry median [3] . Diversity has been also shown to provide a competitive advantage in the academic sector. A recent study found that research publications authored by ethnically diverse and gender diverse groups of researchers receive significantly higher numbers of citations than papers written by researchers of a single ethnic group or same gender [4] .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Despite this increasing body of evidence, women in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) are underrepresented in education and careers, and women from minority groups, such as African American, Hispanic or indigenous women are particularly underrepresented [5] . This trend becomes evident after graduation from high school, where women are less likely than men to pursue a major STEM field. Women's representation in science declines further at the graduate level and yet again in the transition to the workplace. Furthermore, representation of women at senior and professorial levels is extremely poor (i.e. 14.5% in the Australian academic sector) [6] . This demographic of workforce distribution, causing high levels of midcareer exhaustion, also results in a gender pay gap for STEM (ranging from 11% in engineering to 12.4% in science positions in Australia) [6] , and a society that undervalues the opportunities and contributions a career in STEM can provide for girls and women.During the Workshop at the MAM Conference, several different barriers were identified as key contributors hindering career progression for women in parasitology and public health.Cultural issues such as bias and stereotypes [7] [8] [9] (Box 1) along with often male-dominated working environments that are characterised by strong hierarchical natures, appeared to be the first hurdle encountered by young female graduates commencing a career in STEM.In addition to these culturally posed challenges, women are more likely to be the primary carer not only for young children but also for ill or aging members of their families.Balancing work and carer responsibilities could be even more challenging for scientists in single-parent scenarios. Remarkably, the years of intensive research and long hours in the laboratory, usually required to establish an independent research career path, often coincide with the period in which people tend to start families. The unavoidable drop in productivity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof that women experience during these years, usually measured as number of papers published and their impact, has an inexorable detrimental impact on grant success rates, which largely depend on a strong publication record in unforgiving funding environments. These are important obstacles for women choosing to take career breaks or part-time appointments when raising children. Furthermore, working conditions and job insecurity were also identified as having a strong negative impact on women maintaining careers in science. The vast majority of appointments are grant-dependent short-term contracts, with unclear pathways to promotions. Whilst this also impacts male researchers, career disruptions due to carer responsibilities and the impact on their track records make these uncertain scenarios more challenging for women, encouraging them to seek alternative position outside the academic sector.Whereas the aforementioned barriers are somehow potentially possible to measure, other elements including the lack of role models and mentors are more difficult to define with quantitative data but were also identified as important detrimental factors in career progression for women in STEM. Perhaps even more important than mentors, a crucial and difficult to measure hurdle for women, particularly for those trying to break through the ""glass ceiling"" and consolidate their position in senior management is the lack of sponsors ii , willing to advocate on their behalf to help them promote and advance their careers to professorial positions. This lack of support networks contributes to women feeling usually isolated and out of place in STEM fields. These growing feelings of misfit or imposter syndrome are highly demoralising and result in women questioning their abilities and on occasion, lead to thoughts of leaving the field.Most of the discussed barriers experienced by women to pursue a career in STEM were shared by women and males from minority groups. Scientists from minority groups also face additional challenges [10] including reduced access to resources and technology, as well as negative perceptions of their own career success, in part due to reduced networking opportunities and role models.The participants at the Gender Equity Workshop at MAM 2020 discussed various strategies and resources that helped them overcome obstacles during their careers in parasitology (Box 2). Among them, identifying early in their career a diversity-prone working environment, appropriate mentors and a good group of collaborators seem to be important for women to avoid isolation, stay connected and further their networking skills to boost their careers in science. It was clear from discussions at the workshop that this is not an easy path. Gender equity, diversity and inclusion in STEM careers are work in progress. Being patient, persistent and remaining aligned with the core principles and values that inspire women to start a career in parasitology, are all desirable qualities to successfully navigate this path.As for employers, it is clear that there is an urgent need to further resources in order to improve recruitment, development and retention of women in science careers (Box 2). A commitment to training towards recognising stereotypes and unconscious bias along with transparent recruitment and promotion processes will be required to close the gap [6] . Clear strategic plans to promote cultural shifts of organisations are needed to ensure that women and minority groups have access to developmental opportunities and adequate paths to advance their careers in science.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f It would have been hard to predict at the time I was invited to contribute this article in February, that a global pandemic would spread around the world, with unprecedented consequences for health systems and global economies. Emerging evidence is starting to reveal alarming figures on the gendered impact of COVID-19, and the STEM workforce is no exception.A recently released report commissioned by the Australian government and produced by the Rapid Research Information Forum (RRIF) estimated that the pandemic will result in greater disadvantages for women than men in the STEM sector [11] . The report also warns that women from culturally diverse backgrounds, Aboriginal women and women who identify asLGBTIQA+ are potentially facing additional barriers during the pandemic. Evidence shows that while work-from-home policies apply equally to women and men, women in heterosexual relationships seemed to bear the major burden of home-schooling of their children, meal preparation and general housework compared with men, while trying to manage their paid workload [11] . There is also evidence that the pandemic has resulted in women less likely than men to attend STEM workplaces, with women accounting for 16% of staff visiting campuses in Australia, compared to 28% males between March and April 2020[11].Academic output including not only submission of manuscripts but also grant applications iii appeared to be compromised for women in STEM in New Zealand during the pandemic. A recent analysis revealed that female academics are submitting significantly fewer papers than men and starting fewer new projects [12] . This reduction in the quality and quantity of women's research publications is anticipated to harm job and funding prospects now and for several years to come. Furthermore, with income losses in universities and the research sector J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof facing budget cuts, STEM jobs are at ongoing risk, and short-term contracts that usually mainly employ women, likely to be the ones to take the hardest hit. Indeed, whereas Australia's professional, scientific and technical service industry recorded job losses of 4.8% for men from mid-March to mid-April 2020, jobs in the sector were down 6.3% for women [13] .We should remain hopeful that anticipated COVID-19-related funding cuts in the sector do not compromise ongoing equity programs, as this could jeopardise all progress made in STEM workforce diversity. The future of women in STEM could be at risk if the improvements achieved in recent years are lost. As a community, it is critical to start the conversation now, on how to mitigate the impact that COVID-19 has on job security and career progression for women in STEM.13.

As at 24 May 2020 there have been 7135 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Australia, of which 947 (13%) have been hospitalized, 202 (21%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 102 have died. 1 Twenty percent of COVID-19 cases can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which confers up to 62% mortality. 2, 3 Despite low rates of severe disease in Australia, 4 therapies for COVID-elated ARDS are urgently needed.Clinical information for each patient was obtained from a review of electronic and paper medical record systems, from which sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score 22 and H-score 23 were calculated where possible. Ethics approval was not required at two sites and was obtained at one site. All patients consented to publication.The five patients were aged between 46 and 74 years and were followed for between 13 and 26 days after tocilizumab therapy; see Figure 1 . Table 1 describes patient demographics, past medical history and time-course of events prior to tocilizumab administration. All patients additionally received broad-spectrum antibiotics; four patients received corticosteroids; and two received both hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). The time from tocilizumab administration to improvement in oxygenation, defined as a 25% fall in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) required to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) greater than 92%, ranged from 7 hours to 4.6 days; Table 2 describes tocilizumab dose, additional medications administered, progress following treatment and adverse events. Table 3 and Figure 2 describeacute respiratory distress syndrome, coronavirus, immunomodulation, interleukin-6, pneumonia, tocilizumab, viral clinical and laboratory results before and after tocilizumab treatment, and in Table S1 the Supplementary Appendix details further laboratory parameters.A 53-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to hospital with fever and rapid-onset type I respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. At presentation, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) was 99 mm Hg while receiving FiO2 80% yielding PaO2 to FiO2 ratio (PF ratio) of 93 mm Hg. He underwent endotracheal intubation and was mechanically ventilated using the ARDSNet protocol 24 to manage adequate gas exchange and noradrenaline to maintain mean arterial blood pressure greater than 70 mm Hg. A total of 6 days LPV/r and hydroxychloroquine were administered commencing at day 2 of hospitalization. On day 3 of hospitalization, intravenous (IV) tocilizumab 400 mg and methylprednisolone 70 mg (1 mg/kg) were administered. Noradrenaline was ceased 6 hours after tocilizumab administration. Two days after tocilizumab therapy, ventilatory function improved, but signs of encephalopathy arose when sedation was weaned. Corticosteroids were therefore ceased and encephalopathy resolved rapidly.Ventilator-associated pneumonia, diagnosed 3 days after tocilizumab administration, was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. Three days following tocilizumab administration, the patient was extubated. He was discharged from ICU 5 days after tocilizumab administration, ceased oxygen therapy 1 day later, and was discharged home after a further 4 days.A 74-year-old man with a history of type II diabetes and hypertension presented to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, with SpO2 95% on room air at presentation. He became hypoxic on admission day 3, and oxygen therapy, ceftriaxone and azithromycin were commenced. On day admission 9 he developed rapid-onset type I respiratory failure with clinical and biochemical features of COVID-19 CRS.PaO2 was 119 mm Hg while receiving oxygen 8 L/min via Hudson mask (estimated FiO2 60%) yielding a PF ratio of 198 mm Hg. He was admitted to ICU and tocilizumab 800 mg IV was administered.Following tocilizumab administration, estimated FiO2 requirement fell from 60% to 36% in 16 hours while maintaining SpO2 greater than 92%. He did not require endotracheal intubation. He was discharged from ICU 20 hours after tocilizumab administration. He then remained stable on FiO2 36% for 5 days, when oral prednisone 25 mg daily was commenced. Oxygen therapy was ceased 7 days after tocilizumab administration, and he was discharged home 6 days later. Corticosteroids were tapered to cessation over 2 weeks.A A A 46-year-old man with a history of obesity and asthma presented to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, with SpO2 95% on room air at presentation.

If global supply comes under strain, the needs of both COVID and non-COVID patients for tocilizumab will need to be considered.In our series, the time from tocilizumab administration to an improvement in oxygenation, defined as a 25% fall in FiO2 requirement, ranged from 7 hours to 4.6 days, and radiographic improvement occurred at between 41 hours and 9.8 days. While no laboratory parameter reliably predicted clinical improvement in all five patients, changes in ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase generally correlated with clinical improvement, whereas D-dimer, creatine kinase, troponin-T and neutrophil counts did not. While all patients rapidly defervesced and CRP rapidly normalized, these are IL-6-dependent processes, 29 and so are unlikely to predict clinical improvement.This series illustrates that tocilizumab can be associated with favorable clinical outcome in some cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The Australian Society for Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) recommends IL-6 blockade be considered early in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. 9 We concur with these recommendations and advocate for collaborative, multidisciplinary management of such patients, including judicious use of tocilizumab, while awaiting the results of large multicenter placebo-controlled randomized trials.The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.Ethics approval was obtained from the Monash Health Human Research Ethics Committee.

There was something ominous in it, though I had every confidence that the Department of Health injunctive was based on the advice of well-meaning Aboriginal health experts. My disquiet at the statement? I see myself as relatively privileged, in good health, and with the capacity to make any necessary decisions relevant to my health and lifestyle. There was also concern at the increased nuisancing powers given to the Victorian police force, at a time when it had never been in greater disrepute. But at the base of my anxiety were the darker shadows of history-the Aboriginal experience of the intertwined realities of invasion, colonization, and foreign-brought disease. In the words of Wiradjuri poet Jazz Money: across great seas that hulking sickness comes wambunbunmarra greed the first steps the first theft first shots (Money 2019) Two novels published in the late twentieth century provide us with specific perspectives on the Aboriginal experience of disease and invasion and the culture that produces them. Eric Wilmot's 1987 historical novel Pemulwuy: The Rainbow Warrior takes as its subject matter conflict between the Eora nation and the British invaders between 1788 and 1802. As smallpox (Galgalla) spreads among the Eora people, Pemulwuy, the Aboriginal leader who believes in opposing the British with force, tells the more conciliatory leader Bennelong, that a truce agreed to between the British and Eora can be broken by the British killing the Eora with muskets, bayonets, swords, or deliberately with the release of their ""sickness,"" the ""galgalla in a jar"" (Wilmot 1994 (Wilmot [1987 . (The novel itself suggests that the release of the smallpox cultures was accidental rather than deliberate.)Responding to Pemulwuy's charge, Captain Macarthur, the commander of the Parramatta Stockade, outlines what amounts to a rationalization of germ warfare,The fact is that civilisation brings with it diseases that primitives simply cannot bear as we can… Their bodies are not resilient. Pemulwuy knows that full well. The rumour of the fatal jar is useful to him. It adds a touch of drama. But in a sense he is right. Disease is our invisible weapon. Our sickness will cut a massive swathe through the native's ranks as we move through this continent, settling it and converting it to useful cultivation. (Wilmot 1994 (Wilmot [1987 ).Wilmot's point is that both the British and the Eora understand that there is nothing incidental about the galgalla and it is seen as integral to invasion and colonization.A later novel, Bruce Pascoe's Shark, extends the discussion and identifies the factors that create disease bearing cultures and the disordered psychology of their citizens. The central character, Jim Fox, has an ambivalent, disconnected, relationship with his Aboriginal heritage and in consequence his country. When we encounter Fox he is working as a deckhand in a small Victorian coastal town but he has an international dimension and as a young man fought with the Papuan resistance to the Indonesian invasion and colonization of West Papua. Though mild and self-effacing Fox speaks with trenchant, almost bitter, passion on cultures dependent on wheat, rice, and other grains and the social hierarchies and over-population that result from lowquality, abundant food. He summarizes those cultures in the following manner:… too many people too close. The rats start to squabble over the crusts. There's got to be space between people. Room to be alone, room to move to another camp, find more fish, more fruit … No town dwelling civilisation has ever survived more than few hundred years without being run down by the next mob of rats. (Pascoe 1999, 98) (We should note Pascoe's later (2014) non-fiction work Dark Emu: Black Seeds: Agriculture or Accident argues the contrary thesis.) Fox goes on:All I know is what I know. And I know we're going nowhere living in high-rise flats and motor cars. The planet can't support it. And we, people, can't survive it. We're going mad. The worst side o f o u r n a t u r e i s e n c o u r a g e d b y t h i s crowdedness-this anonymous way we live. (Pascoe 1999, 99) In the absence of direct experience of COVID-19 my perceptions are of hysteria which accompanies the early stages of the pandemic. I'm surprised at the ease with which it is generated and spreads. There is a foreignness about the behaviour but it's also the social glue that for the moment binds an anomic society into a dysfunctional community. Behaviour formerly unthinkable becomes normal for a time. Images of frightened politicians and mass media reports of profiteers, shelf strippers, panicked shoppers, the aged and infirm pushed aside. There are reports of mass deaths and anonymous funerals for the dead in Spain and Italy and the anticipation of the same in Australia. These reports are leavened with tales of individual resilience, generosity, courage, and humour. In all this we witness efficacy of news/entertainment media storytelling, manufacturing reality even as it pretends to do nothing but report it (de Certeau 1986).Confronted with that pandemonium the affective part of my nature finds respite in First Nations dancers from North America and Canada. The dancers (many of them children and adolescents) post videos of solo dances on a dedicated Facebook page. They often offer their performance for family members, the sick, or those who cannot dance for themselves. In one post, a soldier, cut off from his family, home community, and regalia because of the pandemic, dances in his army uniform; in another, a small girl from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in full regalia, dances in the snow; another child dancer executes hieratic steps with unwavering concentration. The best dancers, whatever their age, have an integrity and self-possession. The psychic energy that elsewhere transforms into hysteria is integrated by the dancer, and by the viewer, into an Indigenous consciousness grounded in tradition and oral history and resolute in the face of the latest contagion.Aside from that necessary affective engagement, an intellectual and ethical response can be found in the philosophy of Iris Murdoch. Murdoch believes that reason and discernment can provide guidance and personal integrity for the individual and is uncompromising in her belief in the individual as the basis for the creation of a moral subject. Beyond the shared morality of the demos there is the possibility of an ever-deepening understanding of moral concepts in the specific circumstances of an individual life. And in a deepening understanding of what morality is one proceeds ""onward into increasing privacy … and not back towards a genesis in the rulings of an impersonal public language"" (Murdoch 2007 (Murdoch [1970 , 28). Murdoch asserts that as ""moral agents we have to try to see justly, overcome prejudice, to avoid temptation, to control and curb imagination, to direct reflection"" (Murdoch 2007 (Murdoch [1970 , 39).The challenge with the above is that Murdoch proposes something that is moral and hence difficultgoing against our natural inclination toward ease and laziness. It is the self that must try and live out these precepts and through discernment and reason give order and meaning to chaos and confusion. And though the concept of a responsible moral subject is implicit in intellectual and religious traditions in the West it may no longer have moorings in a consumer capitalist society.An alternative means to a resistant privacy in a mass society is indicated by Marcuse. He suggested the aesthetic experience and the private sphere could serve as ""bulwarks against a society which administers all dimensions of human existence"" (Marcuse 2003, 38) . And posthysteria in this time of contagion and quarantine there is an appreciation of the quietness, clean air and bluer skies; one can see further, hear more; affections buried under the commonplaces of everyday life reawaken with surprising intensity; football ovals surrounded by wooded embankments become theatres of space and freedomand a reminder that we are guests on Wurundjeri land, and share it with all manner of animals. Without any regret we see how unnecessary humans are to the rest of creation. In those moments of intense quietness, and empty streets one feels like a ghostly witness to the end of the human world. And what was normal about that world prior to the lockdown? And how long before that infranormality re-establishes itself?Reflecting on this odd moment I was standing in my garden, enjoying the cold early morning air, when not more than fifty metres away the perfectly executed notes of The Last Post sounded through the darkness. After a minute's silence the echoing notes of a trumpet somewhere in the distance were heard. I realized I had become an unwitting, but not unwilling, participant in the Anzac Day Virtual Commemoration Service when Australians had been asked to stand and observe a minute's silence in their driveways at dawn but I was powerfully reminded, at the same time, of the final scene of Fellini's I Clowns (Fellini 1970) . Two clowns perform a poignant duet on trumpets, engaging in a call and response, then meeting in centre ring and playing in unison while exiting a dark and deserted circus.","Australia","first author","2020-08-25",8

The impact of COVID-19 on stroke imaging and intervention at an Australian stroke centre","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a disruptive effect on healthcare systems around the world. Since March, when the disease entered a pandemic phase, contingency plans have been implemented in healthcare systems and hospitals around the world, including the deferral of elective medical procedures. 1-3 These changes to clinical operations were aimed at creating capacity and preserving resources so that hospitals could deal with a projected surge in COVID-19 patients while continuing to care for patients with other acute medical conditions necessitating treatment. However, there is emerging evidence from media 4 and the scientific literature [5] [6] [7] [8] that the volume of patients receiving care for emergent and time-sensitive conditions has also decreased.Acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is a time-critical emergency. Endovascular clot retrieval (ECR) is now the standard of care treatment for AIS patients with intracranial large vessel occlusions (LVOs) up to 24 hours of onset. 9 It has been shown to decrease disability and improve outcomes. [10] [11] [12] Imaging, including non-invasive angiography, is recommended by guidelines in the work-up of AIS patients who present within the ECR window to identify those with LVOs who may benefit from treatment. 9 During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency guidance from the American Stroke Association and Australian Stroke Coalition has been to continue providing evidence based stroke treatment, including ECR. 13 ,14 Yet a recent analysis reported an approximately 40% decrease in the volume of patients who underwent acute stroke imaging across 856 hospitals in the United States. 6 At a comprehensive stroke centre in Barcelona, which is at the heart of a region severely affected by the pandemic and where 60% of bed capacity was occupied by COVID-19 patients, the number of stroke admissions and ECRs performed reduced by a quarter. 7 France, another nation that has been hit hard by the pandemic, also experienced a significant decrease in the number of ECRs performed. 8 The decline in patients receiving care for AIS in these European settings was postulated to be due to saturation of emergency medical services, including emergency transport system capacity, during the crisis. 7, 8 In comparison with the United States, France and Catalonia, which were the focus of previous analyses of the collateral effects of the pandemic on stroke imaging and care, Australia has had a low prevalence of COVID-19. 7, 8, 15 Our emergency transport services and hospitals have not been overwhelmed. The purpose of this investigation is therefore to share insights into the impact of the pandemic on stroke imaging and intervention from the lens of a high volume comprehensive stroke centre in Australia (>200 ECRs per year), where service was not disrupted by a surge in COVID-19 patients. The volume of 'code stroke' presentations and acute stroke imaging was assessed. We also looked at the number of patients with a radiologically confirmed LVO and the number of ECRs performed during and prior to the pandemic. The aim was to test the hypothesis that any decrease in volume of stroke presentations during the pandemic was driven by a reduction in the number of patients coming to hospital with mild strokes and stroke mimics.This study was performed at Monash Health, a network of hospitals with 3 emergency departments (EDs), which serves as one of two major comprehensive stroke centres in the second most populous state (population 6.4 million) of Australia. The state is divided into two catchments, one for each major comprehensive stroke centre. Emergency services adhere strictly to these when transferring stroke patients, including from other hospitals.The other major comprehensive stroke centre is more than 40 km away for the vast majority of patients in our catchment, who are therefore unlikely to self-present there. No changes were made to the availability and emergent access to acute stroke imaging and endovascular treatment for eligible patients during the pandemic.Data from our institution were reviewed for this retrospective study. Specifically, via our Radiological Information System (RIS) and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), we determined the number of multimodal CTs (consisting of non-enhanced CT, CT angiography [CTA], and CT perfusion [CTP]) performed for a 'code stroke' work-up per week for the period from 1 March 2019 to 10 May 2020. For the same period, we assessed via our hospital's records the number of 'code stroke' activations per month on patients who had presented to our hospital directly through our emergency departments (including via emergency transport). The total number of ED presentations was also assessed. The number of ECRs performed in eligible patients per month was also determined by querying the database of our neuro-interventional service. For each patient who underwent ECR, whether they were transferred from another hospital or presented directly to our emergency department was recorded, as well as the time between presentation and multimodal CT (Door-to-CT time), a key performance metric of stroke imaging. The multimodal stroke CTs of patients were assess by two readers (J.M. and S.A.) for the presence of an LVO. The number of patients with an LVO, as well as the percentage of patients undergoing multimodal stroke CT who had an LVO, was also determined.This study was approved by our institutions' IRB which waived the requirement for informed consent due to the retrospective study design and anonymization of all data.For Australia, the period from 1 March 2019 to 31 January 2020 was deemed the pre-pandemic period since it preceded the announcement of a 14-day ban for noncitizens arriving from China. Triggered by the first Australian COVID-19 fatality on March 1, the period from 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020 was considered the pandemic period while February was considered a transition month. Other notable timepoints in Australia were as follows: (i) all international travel banned for Australians (17 March 2020); (ii) strict social distancing of 4 sqm/ person mandated (20 March 2020); (iii) Australian border closure (25 March 2020); and (iv) public gathering of more than two people banned with a stay at home rule imposed (29 March 2020ongoing).The pre-pandemic period was deemed the baseline relative to which we compared the pandemic period. Zstatistics were used to determine whether the number of 'code stroke' activations, multimodal CTs and ECRs were significantly different from the pre-pandemic mean.Statistical analyses were performed using a dedicated software written in Python. A P-value < 0.0025, corresponding to a z-score > 2.8, was considered significant, indicating there is only a 0.25% chance that the value falls within the fluctuation distribution of the pre-pandemic baseline. To test for the correlation between prepandemic baseline patient numbers and corresponding normal scores, the Shapiro-Wilk test was used.To address seasonal or holiday-related changes, we also reviewed 2019/20 year-on-year changes in patient numbers for the two pandemic months of March and April and four pre-pandemic months of November to January.During the pre-pandemic period, from 1 March 2019 to 31 January 2020, a 'code stroke' was called on a total of 2125 patients who presented (including via emergency transport) to our institution's emergency departments and were suspected to have an acute ischaemic stroke. Of these, 1818 underwent multimodal CT for diagnostic work-up. ECR was performed in 216 patients.During the pandemic months of March and April, there were 277 'code stroke' activations, 202 patients underwent multimodal CT, and 21 ECRs were performed. The monthly breakdown for the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods is given in Table S1 of the Supplement. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed normality of all patient numbers for the pre-pandemic period.Demographic data for patients undergoing multimodal CT are also given in the data Supplement (Table S2a for  the pre-pandemic period and Table S2b for the pandemic period; Figure S1 ).The total number of 'code stroke' activations in patients presenting to our institution dropped during February (transition month), with more pronounced decline during the pandemic period, reaching significance (p < 0.0025) in April following the lockdown (Fig. 1) . The total number of ED presentations and ED patients who underwent CT also decreased significantly (p < 0.0025) during the pandemic period (Fig. S2) .The number of patients undergoing multimodal CT per month also decreased during February and the pandemic period, reaching significance (P < 0.0025) in April. Figure 2 shows the number of patients presenting to our institution who underwent multimodal 'code stroke' CT per week relative to the weekly number of new and cumulative COVID-19 cases in Australia. At the start of the pandemic period on 1 March 2020, there was a considerable decline in patients undergoing multimodal CT, crossing the 95% confidence interval by March 20 and reaching significance (P < 0.0025) in the weeks of March 27 and April 10. This aligned well with the peak of the number of new COVID-19 cases in Australia. The nadir was in the week of March 27, when the population was placed in lockdown. At this nadir, the number of CTs decreased 68% relative to the weekly average over the pre-pandemic period. Although still depressed, weekly patient numbers have started to increase. The number of ECRs also decreased during the pandemic months (16 in March and 11 in April) compared to the compared to the pre-pandemic mean of 18.4, but this decline did not reach significance (P = 0.165).Year-on-year (Fig. 3) , there was a mild relative decrease in the number of 'code stroke' activations and patients undergoing multimodal CTP but a 14% increase in the number of ECRs performed in March. There was a substantial relative year-on-year decline across all categories in April, with a 37% decrease in 'code stroke' activations, 54% decrease in multimodal CTs and 48% decrease in ECRs performed. Both the absolute number and percentage of patients with LVOs increased in March compared to the pre-pandemic months (Fig. 4a , Table S3 ). In April, the absolute number of patients with LVOs decreased but the percentage was similar to the pre-pandemic months. Year-on-year, there was a mild increase in the number of LVOs in March (+15%), but marked decrease in April (À55%) (Fig. 4b) .The percentage of ECR patients who were direct presentations to our hospital is shown in Figure 5 . There was a significant decline (P < 0.025) in April compared to the 9-month pre-pandemic period.The median Door-to-CT time decreased to 9 minutes (inter-quartile range 7-16 minutes) during the pandemic months of March and April compared to the pre-pandemic months where the median was 22 minutes (inter-quartile range 15-32 minutes). The number of patients who underwent ECR during the pandemic months was too small to determine whether these time reductions were statistically significant.The number of COVID-19 positive or suspected patients who underwent multimodal CT and ECR was also too small to determine whether there were significant delays caused by additional precautions taken by the CT and interventional neuroradiology teams when caring for these patients, such as use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Only one COVID-19 suspected or positive patient underwent ECR during this time. Both the Doorto-CT time and Door-to-Puncture time in this patient were above the 90th centile of the pre-pandemic values.Our retrospective analysis shows that both the number of patients presenting to our institution with a suspected acute ischaemic stroke and volume of multimodal CT scans performed to rule out stroke declined significantly during the pandemic period. The number of LVOs remained stable in the first pandemic month but decreased proportionally in the second month along with the number of ECRs performed. The results of this study casts in numbers the perception of decline in stroke patients presenting to hospital during the pandemic in a community where the prevalence of infection has been low, and the healthcare system has not been challenged by a surge in COVID-19-related presentations.Since 2018, following the publication of two high-profile trials showing the benefit of ECR in the late time-window, it has since been routine practice at our institution to perform multimodal stroke CT on all patients with a suspected ischaemic stroke presenting within 24 hours of onset. 10, 12 The intake of stroke patients has been relatively stable since then. Other than seasonal factors and holidays, no other extrinsic factors or changes in internal process could therefore explain the dramatic decline in patient numbers during the pandemic period. We have addressed the former by assessing the relative year-onyear changes in patient numbers and shown a substantial decline in the number of 'code stroke' activations, multimodal CTs, LVO presentations and ECRs performed in April.Both the absolute number and percentage of patients with LVOs amongst those undergoing multimodal CT increased in March. This suggests, in keeping with our hypothesis, that patients with severe strokes continued to present to hospital during this early pandemic period, while those with mild strokes or stroke mimics may have been deterred from coming into hospital. In April, following the lockdown and peak in new COVID-19 cases, the number of patients presenting with LVOs decreased in alignment with the decrease in patients undergoing multimodal CT. The percentage of LVOs therefore did not increase compared to the pre-pandemic months. The decline in stroke presentations and imaging during April therefore also included patient with severe strokes, counter to our hypothesis. Due to the relatively short temporal span of the COVID-19 event, we were only able to operate with point estimates, which is a limitation of the study.A decline in stroke imaging across the United States and a significant decrease in ECRs performed in France during the pandemic have already been reported. 6, 8 A single-centre study from Catalonia found a modest decrease in stroke admissions and ECRs. 7 France, the United States and Catalonia have all been severely affected by COVID-19, causing a strain on their healthcare systems, an important point of distinction between these prior investigations and ours. In Australia, we were fortunate that our healthcare system was not overwhelmed by a surge in COVID-19 patients. Our geographic isolation and low population density, as well as early institution of travel bans, have likely kept the disease at bay. Hospital and emergency service (including emergency transportation) capacity was therefore not a rate limiting factor that could explain the reduction in 'code stroke' activations, multimodal CTs and ECRs. Since healthcare providers in referring hospitals and at our institution have not altered their practice, the question remains: what was the cause for the decrease in 'code strokes,' including LVOs?One potential hypothesis is a true decrease in patients suffering AIS. As a 'healthcare system COVID preparedness' measure, elective surgical procedures have been curtailed. 1 This has, in turn, decreased the number of patients coming off anticoagulation, a known risk factor for ischaemic stroke. 16 However, it has been shown that fewer than 5% of strokes are related to cessation of anticoagulation as a part of perioperative management. 17 This is therefore speculated to be a minor contributing factor.We hypothesize that the main driving force behind the decline in acute stroke presentations was patients avoiding hospital presentation and medical care due to social distancing rules, the lockdown and fear of contracting COVID-19. The nadir in multimodal stroke CTs immediately followed the peak in new COVID-19 cases and coincided with the week in which lockdown was instituted, suggesting that patients' adherence to the lockdown and fear of contracting COVID-19 may have led to a decrease in stroke presentations to hospitals. Since the decrease in 'code stroke' activations and patients undergoing multimodal CT had already decreased in February and March, prior to the lockdown but during extensive media coverage of the toll extracted by COVID-19 in other parts of the world, fear is suspected to have played a large part in this phenomenon. We speculate that altruism may have motivated some patients to avoid coming to hospital and 'burdening' the healthcare system during the crisis. It is also possible that the lockdown rules resulted in delayed presentation of socially isolated individuals.The increased percentage of LVOs amongst patients undergoing multimodal CT in the first pandemic month suggests that those with more severe strokes continued to come into hospital prior to lockdown, while patients with milder symptoms chose to stay away, causing a decrease in number of 'code strokes' and multimodal stroke CTs. In April, following lockdown, even the number of LVOs decreased. We speculate that this may be due to increasing anxiety in the community, despite declining incidence of new COVID-19 cases in Australia. Kansagra et al also observed that differences in the incidence of COVID-19 did not correlate with decreased utilization of stroke imaging. 6 In addition to the decrease in the total number of ECRs during April, there was also a decrease in the proportion of patients undergoing ECR who presented directly to our institution, compared to those who were transferred from a primary stroke centre. Access to transfer resources does not, therefore, appear to have been a driving factor in the decline in patients undergoing ECR. Since these referring hospitals are peripheral and rural centres, fear of presenting to hospital may have been less than in more densely populated metropolitan areas where the prevalence of COVID-19 was higher. This is, however, speculative.So where have all the patients gone? The question remains whether the decrease in stroke imaging and intervention reflects a true decrease in the incidence of LVO strokes, or a decrease in patients seeking medical care. There are anecdotal reports of delayed presentation of stroke patients to hospital, beyond the ECR window. In a sub-study, we attempted to see if there was a larger proportion of patients presenting with larger and/or completed infarcts as a consequence of delayed presentation to hospital; however, the numbers were too small for meaningful analysis. Perhaps future studies can shed light into what happened to these patients and reveal why they did not come into hospital during the pandemic period.If the observed decrease in the number of LVOs and ECRs has been due to patients avoiding or delaying hospital presentation for fear of COVID-19, the burden of neurological disability and morbidity in the community will have increased during the pandemic. This neurological disability could have been prevented with timely treatment. Therefore, in communities where the prevalence of COVID-19 has been low, the collateral damage caused by patients avoiding medical care during the pandemic may be greater than the morbidity caused by COVID-19 per se. As such, public awareness campaigns encouraging patients to access timely care for treatable conditions may be warranted if there is a resurgence of COVID-19 or if a similar pandemic scenario was to occur in the future.One thin silver lining was that the Door-to-CT time decreased during the pandemic months. This was attributed to reduced congestion of our emergency departments, which we speculate may have helped expedite patient transfer to the radiology department for multimodal CT. The authors are cognizant that in other health systems, where emergency departments have been overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, a delay in this process may have occurred. Normal workflow was disrupted during the pandemic by additional precautions required to minimize infection risk. All staff involved in the direct care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were required to don additional PPE. Intensive decontamination of equipment and rooms used to image and treat these patients was also necessary. To mitigate potential delays, additional staff were rostered to assist with these precautions. Non-emergent outpatient CTs and elective procedures were deferred to create capacity in preparation for a surge in COVID-19 patients. These 'radiology preparedness measures' likely contributed to the shorter Door-to-CT times, which was an unanticipated collateral benefit. The number of COVID-19 positive and suspected patients who presented with a stroke during the study period was too small to assess whether extra precautions caused a significant delay in imaging or ECR in this group. Further studies are warranted, with pooling of data from different centres given the low prevalence of infection in Australia, to assess the impact of COVID-19 precautions on in-hospital performance metrics.In conclusion, this study confirmed a marked decrease in the number of acute ischaemic stroke patients presenting to hospital and worked up during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an associated decline in the number of ECRs performed. There was an inverse relationship with the number of new COVID-19 patients in the community. Since the prevalence of infection in our community was low, our emergency medical services were not stressed. We therefore conclude that avoidance of hospitals, driven by fear of contracting COVID-19 and strict adherence to the lockdown, was the most cause for this dramatic decrease in stroke patients, including those who may have benefitted from treatment. Such indirect effects of the pandemic may have greater impact than the pandemic itself. Assessment of follow-up data from outpatient clinics and imaging for delayed presentations is warranted. There is, however, hope for those countries who are fighting their way out of the crisis in the trend we are seeing in Australia. With relaxation of the lockdown, the number of patients coming to the hospital is gradually recovering.Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-site: Table S1 .

In the current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic the implications of working whilst unwell have been highlighted more dramatically than ever [11e14] , and the need to address and resolve this existing norm amongst medical professionals is increasingly urgent. Doctors working when they are sick, also known as presenteeism, poses a potential infection risk to patients and colleagues [2, 7, 15, 16] and compromises the robust infection control measures that are needed to prevent the spread of nosocomial infections, such as COVID-19 [12, 17, 18] and influenza [15] . There have been numerous documented cases of intra-hospital spread of COVID-19 from healthcare workers both in Australia and overseas [11, 13, 14] , including in Tasmania where COVID-19 spread in a medical ward after some staff worked whilst symptomatic [13] . Data from the NHS indicating that up to 20% of hospital COVID-19 positive patients contracted the virus during their time in hospital further highlights the importance of healthcare workers taking sick leave when they are unwell [11] . In addition to the risk of spreading infection, not taking appropriate sick leave may worsen the health and wellbeing of doctors, and perpetuates a longstanding cultural norm of working through illness [4, 5, 8, 19] .In a landscape where it is imperative that doctors do not work when they are sick, understanding the complex cultural and organisational barriers that deter doctors from taking sick leave is of the utmost importance. Multiple reasons for presenteeism have been identified in the pre-COVID-19 literature through survey, questionnaire and interview studies engaging directly with doctors at varying levels in their career [1e10,20] . Concern about burdening colleagues with an increased workload [1e3,5,10] and a sense of duty to patients [2, 3, 5, 10] are consistently expressed as prominent obstacles to taking sick leave amongst doctors. In a survey study of New Zealand doctors by Tan et al., in which 82% reported presenteeism in the preceding 12 months, 71% of doctors identified ""not wanting to burden co-workers"" as a reason they did not take sick leave [2] . Even more dramatically, in a survey study of attending physicians by Szymczak et al., 98.5% of doctor respondents reported not wanting to let down colleagues as a reason they worked whilst sick [5] . Additionally, broader cultural and social norms -such as an expectation that doctors are healthy and hardworking, and a commitment to caring for patients -widely promote presenteeism amongst this cohort [2e5, 10, 19, 21] . Collectively these findings contribute to the poor self-care and health behaviours commonly exhibited by doctors [6, 8, 9, 21] .Survey studies into sick leave behaviours of junior doctors in New South Wales (NSW) have been conducted in recent years, which provide useful insights into the sick leave behaviours of this cohort. In the Australian Medical Association NSW Hospital Health Check survey of 1958 junior doctors in 2019, 62% ""rarely"" or ""never"" took sick leave when unwell [22] . 77% were deterred from taking sick leave due to ""concerns about increasing workload for other team members"", and 62% because of ""no sick reliever"" [22] . Similar results were demonstrated in the NSW Health Junior Medical Officer Survey in 2018 [23] , with ""nil cover, impact on rest of team/colleagues"" and ""nil cover if not there"" being identified as the two largest deterrents to junior doctors taking sick leave, at 76% and 54% respectively [23] . While these large studies provide valuable information on the accessibility of sick leave amongst the NSW junior doctor cohort, they do not include other Australian states and territories, and as such it is difficult to ascertain whether these patterns are limited to NSW or reflect a wider norm. Furthermore, these studies related to sickness in general, rather than to respiratory illness specifically.There are other studies that exist which do include doctors nationwide, however these also do not focus on respiratory illness and do not specifically investigate the barriers that exist to taking sick leave exist. These include the 2008 Australian Medical Association survey study into Junior Doctor Health and Wellbeing in Australia and New Zealand, which found that 22.3% of males and 10.2% of females had never taken any personal leave for their own health [21] , and the MABEL study, a survey which asks a large number of Australian doctors at different points in their career about sick leave behaviours and accessibility, but does not ask them to identify factors that deter them from taking sick leave [24] .The aim of this study was to identify what barriers existed to prevent junior doctors working in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and experiencing acute respiratory symptoms from taking sick leave. This study was conducted in November 2019 before COVID-19, and as such provides a valuable snapshot of the pre-COVID-19 attitudes, behaviors and cultural norms that led to junior doctors working when unwell with an acute respiratory illness in the ACT. Identifying and subsequently addressing these obstacles is imperative in improving the health of doctors, patients and healthcare organisations, and is of heightened importance now when the obstacles to taking sick leave must be dismantled to prevent the nosocomial spread of COVID-19.We conducted a survey study to investigate the barriers that prevented junior doctors with symptoms of an acute respiratory illness from taking sick leave while employed at Canberra Health Services in Australia. All junior (postgraduate year 1 and postgraduate year 2) doctors employed in this health service were invited to complete a ten question, anonymous, online survey hosted on Survey Monkey (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LBDTVQ3). An anonymous link to this survey was sent to each doctors' staff email, and posted on the Facebook group page for the intern (postgraduate year 1) cohort. Additionally, an announcement inviting doctors to participate in the study was made at intern teaching. The survey link remained open for two weeks in November 2019 and could be completed any time during this period.Informed consent was obtained in the first questions of the online survey (see appendix 1). The survey then asked participants whether they had come to work with an acute respiratory illness in the last two years, before asking various questions about their illness. Only respondents who answered ""yes"" to the first question were included in the study. In order to investigate the experiences of these respondents who had not taken sick leave when unwell with acute respiratory symptoms, participants were asked if they felt supported by their workplace to take sick leave, and asked to identify factors that deterred them from taking sick leave. One of the questions allowed for multiple responses to enable the selection of multiple relevant barriers to taking appropriate sick leave, and another question only allowed for a single response to identify which factor respondents perceived as the most significant. The response options offered were based on the literature cited in this study and empirical insights into potential barriers to taking sick leave that may exist. The final question asked participants to suggest a cultural or organisational change that would improve the accessibility of sick leave and allowed for a free text response. Key words that were repeated in the free text responses were used to capture emerging qualitative themes, and responses were then organised into these themes (see Table 2 ). The STROBE checklist for crosssectional studies was used in writing up this report [25] .Ethics approval was obtained through the ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee, 2019/ETH13251.Of the 192 doctors invited to participate there were 54 responses, equating to a response rate of 28%. Four of these responses were excluded as the doctors had indicated that they did not come to work when unwell, and thus they did not meet the inclusion criteria. As such the final response rate was 26% (fifty participants).In Australia, intern doctors (PGY1) are required to rotate through different departments in order to meet requirements for general registration. Junior doctors in their second year (PGY2) in Australia largely continue to rotate through departments before beginning specialty training.At the time they reported being unwell, 27 (54%) of the junior doctor respondents were working in Medicine, 30 (15%) in Surgery, 4 (2%) in Critical Care and 12 (6%) in Womens' or Childrens' units (see Table 1 ). One third of respondents (32%) reported a fever at the time of illness and the majority of participants (72%) believed they were infectious when working while unwell.The majority of respondents (86%) indicated that they did not feel supported to take sick leave when unwell. When asked to select reasons that deterred them from taking sick leave and multiple responses were allowed, 96% of respondents were concerned about burdening their colleagues with extra work-load and 96% about a lack of available cover (see Fig. 1 ). Not feeling sick enough to take leave and seeing other colleagues working when similarly unwell were also commonly selected factors, at 52% and 50% respectively. Nearly half (48%) of the doctors were unsure of or concerned about the impact that taking sick leave could have on their registration requirements, and 10% were unsure about how to access sick leave. 44% were concerned about judgement from colleagues, and 36% were deterred by a sense of duty towards their patients and a concern that patient outcomes would be poorer in their absence.When participants were only allowed to identify one factor as the single biggest deterrent to taking sick leave, concern about burdening colleagues with extra work and no available cover were the two most prominent reasons selected, at 40% and 32% respectively (see Fig. 2 ), followed by concerns about registration requirements (16%) and judgement from colleagues (12%).All but one of the participants provided a free text response about what cultural or organisational changes might make sick leave more accessible (see Table 2 ). More available cover was suggested by 76% (38) of respondents, making it overwhelmingly the biggest emerging theme (see Table 2 ). Numerous junior doctors were worried that lack of cover meant that if they took sick leave it would burden their teammates, who they felt were already working in understaffed environments with high workloads. In addition to reporting that cover was often not available (particularly for night shifts and in rural secondments), respondents expressed concerns about how cover was organised, noting that the system for arranging cover was inconsistent between hospitals and difficult to organise out of hours. Notably, junior doctors were concerned that if they were sick it often meant that the colleague who was called to cover them would work double shifts and more overall hours, making them vulnerable to also becoming unwell. Suggestions were made for more streamlined systems between hospitals and capacities to draw on staff from both hospitals within the health service to provide sick cover at either site, more junior doctors as designated floaters and Sick leave accessability in junior doctors sick cover on teams, built in redundancies in specific teams and departments, and a 24/7 administrative contact to arrange cover out of hours and to allow sick cover to start on time (see Table 2 ). In Australia interns (PGY1) are required to undertake 10 weeks of surgery, 10 weeks of medicine, 8 weeks of emergency medicine and a combination of other approved terms to make up a total of 47 weeks full time equivalent before being granted general registration [14] . Nine junior doctors expressed concern about registration requirements and suggested clearer guidelines about how much sick leave can be taken without it affecting registration. Junior doctors also expressed frustration that they work many hours in overtime and out of hours shifts that do not count towards registration, and that the weekly roster exceeds full time equivalent, but that this additional time does not always count to compensate for the absence of any sick leave taken when calculating registration requirements.Four respondents recommended more leadership from senior staff, including senior doctors staying home when unwell to set a cultural example, and sending home junior staff when they are sick.Other contributions included suggestions for clearer guidelines about how to access sick leave including when on call, more emphasis on duty of care to patients and the potential harms they can incur by doctors treating them whilst unwell, and more support from an administrative level. Finally, one respondent advocated for a greater sense of hospital, rather than personal, accountability for staffing issues, suggesting that this would be helpful in alleviating the guilt junior doctors feel for understaffing when they are required to take sick leave.These results indicate that the predominant factor deterring junior doctors from taking sick leave is concern about burdening their colleagues with increased workloads. This is reflective of their experience that there is not adequate sick cover in place, that the workplace is understaffed, and that junior doctors already have high workloads. These findings are consistent with the sentiment broadly emerging across the literature that doctors' concern towards burdening their colleagues makes them reluctant to take sick leave [1e3, 5, 10] , and ultimately suggest that inadequate staffing and cover in hospital systems strengthens a ""As a junior doctor always working in understaffed environments the professional guilt of not working is strong."" ""More of an emphasis on duty of care to patients"" ""Better support from admin staff"" culture where taking sick leave is perceived as being unsupported and problematic. That 86% of the doctors who worked when unwell in our study did not feel supported to take sick leave is concerning. In their cross-sectional study of 70 junior doctors Fitzpatrick et al. found that those who did not perceive their hospital to promote their wellbeing were nearly nine times more likely to be emotionally exhausted [26] . Furthermore, they found that presenteeism made junior doctors more likely to experience emotional exhaustion [26] . Ensuring a positive organisational culture within hospitals where junior doctors feel valued and empowered to look after their own health is therefore important in protecting this cohort from emotional exhaustion, and is vital in combating the cultural norm evidenced in the literature that physicians often give little or poor attention to their own medical problems [4, 8, 21] . The fact that nearly half (44%) of junior doctors in our study felt concerned about judgement from their colleagues if they took sick leave is a significant reminder the ""climate of stoicism"" Baldwin observed in 1997 still permeates the medical culture today [8] .This ""climate of stoicism"" may provide some insight into why doctors may be especially more likely to work when they have an acute respiratory illness than when they have other illnesses, making the sick leave behaviours of doctors with respiratory illness particularly important. Of the 869 Norweigan physicians who reported working with an illness in Rosvold and Bjertness' 2001 study, over 60% of them had symptoms of influenza or a respiratory illness, making this the most common illness to work with [6] . Similarly, respiratory illnesses were the most common illness to work with in Szymczak's study, with 60% of the 280 attending physicians who worked while unwell listing their symptoms to be ""acute onset of significant respiratory tract symptoms"" [5] . In investigating why this is the case, Szymczak offers that there is a perception that doctors should continue working with a respiratory tract illness, with respondents in the study widely reporting an expectation to continue working with these symptoms [5] . Szymczak suggests that perhaps this is because respiratory illnesses are sometimes considered too mild to take leave for, occur more frequently, and can take multiple days to recover from [5] . This expectation is of course particularly problematic during the era of COVID-19, and attitudes towards working when unwell with respiratory symptoms may have now changed significantly. Interestingly, while it is a dominant reason in the literature [2, 3, 5, 10] , a sense of duty to patients was not a common reason in this study for not taking sick leave, with no respondents selecting it as the single biggest deterrent to taking leave and 36% selecting it as a factor when multiple responses were allowed. This is perhaps due to the fact that this cohort were junior doctors, compared to senior doctors in other studies who may feel a higher degree of responsibility for patient outcomes. Unique to junior doctors were concerns about how absence due to illness may impact their ability to meet their registration requirements, with one in six selecting this as the biggest single reason to not take sick leave.In their 2009 study on presenteeism e in which over 80% of physicians continued to work when they had a respiratory tract infection e Gudgeon et al. ominously warned that:""further research is required to explore and address this issue, not only for common respiratory tract infections but to ensure that proper infection control practices are in place to prevent healthcare workers from acting as vectors e as happened in SARS e should another pandemic respiratory illness occur."" [7] .In the era of COVID-19 there is a unique opportunity to use the heightened awareness of the implications of working whilst unwell to change the culture around presenteeism and improve the accessibility of sick leave for doctors. It has already been shown that cultural change regarding the accessibility of sick leave is possible and beneficial. In their analysis of presenteeism among physicians in the Health and Organisation among University Physicians Europe study, Gustaffson et al. found that ""organisational care for employee health and well-being reduced the frequency of sickness presenteeism in all countries [Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Italy]"" [4] . Similarly, in their research exploring whether workplace conditions had become more conducive to junior doctors taking appropriate sick leave, Perkin et al. found that junior doctors were more than twice as likely to take sick leave in 2001 than in 1993, at 36.8% and 15.1% respectively [1] . The more flexible sick leave arrangements offered in the ""fit notes"" model in the United Kingdom-including graded and partial sick absences e have shown some benefits in other work sectors, and there may be scope to investigate whether similar models would improve the accessibility of sick leave in a junior doctor cohort [27] . Substantial efforts to improve junior doctor health and wellbeing are already underway in Australia. The 2017 NSW Health Junior Medical Officer (JMO) Wellbeing and Support Plan offers welcome initiatives that respond to concerns raised by junior doctors about their work, wellbeing, health and training [28] . The plan is robust and the initiatives are promising and important. However, while they acknowledge that ""a lack of cover for when staff are on leave e resulting in staff not wanting to take sick leave, annual leave etc as they are concerned about the workload on their colleagues"" as a key issue arising from the JMO wellbeing and support forum [28] , no initiatives are offered to improve sick leave cover or the accessibility of sick leave in the plan [28] . Whilst the issue of inadequate cover and the inaccessibility of sick leave for junior doctors is being increasingly recognised, tangible changes at a systems level still need to be made to address this.Suggestions from junior doctors in our study as to how to improve accessibility of sick leave commonly centre around the theme of improving the availability of cover so that individuals do not feel that they are burdening their colleagues by increasing their workload if absent (see Table 3 ). These include having more doctors as designated sick relief rather than requiring other doctors to work double shifts or having no cover, and shifting the sense of responsibility to cover shifts from the individual to the hospital organisation. This echoes suggestions made in the literature by Perkin et al. [1] , Jena et al. [3] , and Tan et al. [2] that providing more cover is fundamental in addressing sickness presenteeism in the medical workforce. Assuring doctors that they would be covered if unwell would create a more supportive culture and potentially position junior doctors to be less concerned about judgement from their colleagues if they are absent from work. Respondents in our study also suggested having clear and consistent policies pertaining to sick leave, something that is advocated for by Gustaffson et al. [4] , Chow and Mermel [16] , and Tan et al. [2] . In the case of junior doctors in Australia, details about the effects of sick leave on registration requirements would help empower doctors to utilise sick leave when it is necessary for them to do so. Baldwin [8] , Chow and Mermel [16] , and Gustaffson et al. [4] also argue that health services for junior doctors should be promoted, with Chow and Mermel suggesting that review by an ""occupational health representative"" when doctors are unsure about whether they are too sick to work would be useful [16] . This may improve the extent to which junior doctors perceive that their hospital organisation cares about their health and wellbeing, and thus, if we are to be guided by the compelling findings of Gustaffson et al. [4] and Fitzpatrick et al. [26] , reduce their rates of presenteeism [4] and make them less vulnerable to experiencing emotional exhaustion [26] .We note several limitations to this study. Firstly, this study only examined the responses of doctors who did not take sick leave. Thus, the responses may be reflective of a sampling bias toward doctors who worked whilst unwell and does not communicate the views of doctors who did feel supported to access sick leave. The response rate of 26% may also reflect that this is a hard to reach group and may have been increased if reminders to complete the survey were sent. Reminders were not sent as this was not specified in the ethics application and thus specific ethics approval to send reminders was not granted. Furthermore, the survey design only allowed brief full text responses which found consistent themes but did not allow deeper interrogation of the structural and cultural reasons for attendance at work whilst unwell. Further studies using a semi-structured interview design would allow for a deeper qualitative analysis and would be valuable prior to any intervention to effect cultural change. Furthermore, interviewing hospital administrators on this issue could clarify whether there is a shared understanding between junior doctors and administrators around junior doctor sick leave behaviour. While these results reflect a certain moment within this particular cohort and health district, their wider application and relevance to other settings is not known. Finally, the survey was not piloted and did not use standadised questions.We intend to repeat this survey study in 2021 and observe whether the same concerns for accessing sick leave still exist. Additionally, in this upcoming survey we plan to quantify how many junior doctors in the ACT took sick leave for an acute respiratory illness pre and post COVID-19, in order to observe whether organisational changes to sick leave and cover during COVID-19 have improved the rates at which junior doctors access sick leave. We intend to use the same survey in this future study, with modifications to allow for doctors who did take sick leave to have their responses included.Participants were provided with written study information at the start of the online survey and provided their informed consent via the online survey before undertaking the survey.Ethics approval was obtained through the ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee, 2019/ETH13251.Lucy Mitchell: Obtained ethics approval, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Writing -original draft, review and editing, Formatting, Project administration.Nicholas Coatsworth: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Writing e review and editing, Supervision, Project administration.There are no competing interests or conflicts of interest declared in this study.This study was not funded and was completed by two doctors working at The Canberra Hospital.

Early publications revealed SARS-CoV-2 could cause a wide spectrum of illness in adults, and children were seemingly under-represented with regard to both the total number of cases as well as the likelihood of experiencing severe disease. 2,3 Comprehensive population-based epidemiological studies have confirmed this finding, revealing a lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children compared to adults. [4] [5] [6] Furthermore, if children do acquire SARS-CoV-2, the vast majority experience mild disease not requiring hospitalisation, 3, [7] [8] [9] and as SARS-CoV-2 disseminates globally and chains of transmission are becoming increasingly recognised, children do not appear to be efficient transmitters of infection. [10] [11] [12] [13] There are a number of hypotheses postulated to explain children's lower risk of being infected by, and affected by, SARS-CoV-2. These include differences in viral kinetics, a mucosal burden of competing pathogens, and alterations in their immune response including vascular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most notably, a hyperinflammatory state, with features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), appears to be a central feature of the pathogenesis of acute severe disease in adults. Children are seemingly acutely protected from this state for reasons that are as yet unclear, yet one of the leading hypotheses regarding their protection from acute illness and transmission relates to age-related differences in expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in different tissue types. ACE2 is a key mediator of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and plays an integral role in the endothelial inflammatory response. However, with the recent recognition of potential late multisystem inflammatory sequelae from SARS-CoV-2 infection, differences in the immunemediated response to SARS-CoV-2 is also of interest.This article presents an overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children based on the available data to date, including the spectrum of disease, transmission and immunopathological underpinnings, as well the possible multi-system inflammatory sequelae that may ensue.Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen in the Hubei Province of China, it has become evident that children are largely spared the acute severe features of COVID-19. China was the first country to experience intense community transmission, and a review of 72,314 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CDC) revealed that less than 1% of cases occurred in children aged less than 10 years, and the vast majority of these cases were well enough to be managed in the community. 14 The United States (US) has subsequently emerged as the nation with the highest rates of infection and less than 2% of affected cases are in the paediatric age range, 15 which is in keeping with data collated in Italy 16 and Spain. 17 In New South Wales, Australia, where community testing rates have been high, children contribute only 4% of the known COVID-19 cases in the community, despite comprising 23% of the population. 18 Alongside a low prevalence of diagnosed disease, children also consistently exhibit mild (if any) illness following infection with SARS-CoV-2, including some traditionally 'high risk' children such as those with cancer, 19 bone marrow transplant recipients, 20 immunosuppressed children on biological agents, 21 and those with cystic fibrosis. 22 The most common symptom reported in children is fever, with rhinorrhoea, cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache and myalgia also reported. 15, [23] [24] [25] However, a proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 detected by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have no clinical or radiological features of disease. 24, 26 Mild bronchial thickening and ground-glass opacities are the main radiological findings on chest X-ray or computed tomography studies, and can be evident in asymptomatic children. 24, 27 While there are still limited data available regarding COVID-19 in infants, case reports regarding infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection (horizontally or otherwise acquired) have predominantly described asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic disease, with mild shortness of breath the most commonly reported symptom. 28 Outcomes have been favourable in the vast majority of infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those presenting with less common and potentially more severe signs, including encephalopathy. 29 While vertical transmission has been postulated to occur, 30 there is evidence suggesting perinatal acquisition is unlikely in the context of appropriate hygiene measures (adequate hand-hygiene and the use of a surgical mask in mothers positive for SARS-CoV-2) at delivery. 31 Therefore, it is recommended that infants should continue to room-in with their mothers and breastfeeding should be encouraged, with these hygiene measures in place. 32 Severe disease requiring admission to intensive care units (ICUs) in the acute phase of infection is rare in children. Of 1391 children assessed and tested for SARS-CoV-2 at Wuhan Children's Hospital, only 12.3% (n=171) were positive, of whom just three children (1.8%) required ICU admission. 24 However, as has been evident in other reports (including a prospective surveillance study of paediatric oncology units in France), 33 it is uncertain as to whether these children required ICU admission due to COVID-19 or their comorbid conditions. Whilst a review of 41 children with COVID-19 in Spain demonstrated a relatively high proportion requiring hospitalisation (25/41, 61%), only four required admission to ICU (4/41, 9.8%). 17 In North America, the majority of paediatric cases have not required hospitalisation, 8, 34 and those requiring ICU admission frequently have a number of comorbidities and complex medical backgrounds that dictate their need for intensive care. 35 Therefore, extrapolating conclusions from the observational data available on children who develop moderate to severe COVID-19 globally is difficult due to possible confounding by other factors. Published detailed clinical information is often lacking with regard to whether these children required high-level care due to COVID-19, or were simply RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive and admitted due to an alternative diagnosis or active comorbidity at a time when community transmission of the virus in their geographic settings was high. 27 Furthermore, a vast array of (not yet evidence-based) therapeutic options have been utilised in many of these descriptive studies, including antiviral agents, traditional medicine, antibiotics, and immunomodulatory agents, many of which have known adverse effects, further complicating the ability to ascertain whether complications in these cases were due to SARS-CoV-2 or other factors implicated in these presentations. 36, 37 The direct long-term outcomes for children from SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be seen. Aside from the multisystem inflammatory sequelae potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 (see section 6) there are no outcome data for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond acute infection. There are preliminary adult data that raise concerns for the longer-term respiratory, cardiac and neurological sequelae. Observations from China in non-critical hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 adult survivors demonstrated persisting pulmonary function defects on discharge; the most common being diffusion capacity, followed by restrictive ventilatory defects, both of which correlated with the severity of acute infection. 38 Myocardial involvement (as evidenced by elevated troponin levels) has been reported in up to 30% of adults hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be related to myocarditis, myocardial ischaemia/infarction, cardiomyopathy or coronary vasculitis. 39 The long-term prognosis for such patients is extrapolated from the long-term outcomes of other viralassociated myocardial injury (myocarditis, cardiomyopathy and vasculitis) and general myocardial insults (e.g., myocardial ischaemia/infarction). One concern that requires consideration is the long-term cardiac outcomes for children with SARS-CoV-2 who develop coronary artery abnormalities in the context of the suspected SARS-CoV-2 associated multisystem inflammatory conditions (see section 6). As may occur in other viral illnesses, there have been case reports of neurological complications in adults with SARS-CoV-2 including neuroinflammatory syndromes (such as encephalitis and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis), stroke and peripheral nervous disorders (including Guillain-Barré syndrome, plexopathies, and cranial nerve palsies) that may lead to long-term morbidity (with prognoses extrapolated from other viral-associated and general neurological insults). 40- By analogy to influenza, for which children are known to be major transmitters, there was initial concern regarding the potential role of children as 'silent spreaders' of SARS-CoV-2, 47, 48 and occasional early studies supported this perspective. 49 As SARS-CoV-2 spreads globally, the transmission chains of SARS-CoV-2 are becoming apparent. Collectively, data suggest that children with SARS-CoV-2 acquire their infection from an adult contact, with minimal secondary transmission from children. 50 Droplets are the main mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and while some studies have revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the stool of patients 51 and on environmental surfaces, 52 confirmation of viable virus of sufficient load to produce infection in other individuals has not yet been documented. To date, there are no published data confirming faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, despite detectable virus genetic material documented in the stool of paediatric patients. 53, 54 Isolated case reports have suggested transmission from symptomatic children to household contacts, 10,11 however these are rare. Simultaneously, other case reports support an absence of transmission even amongst symptomatic children, including one paediatric index case for whom not one of 172 contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 55 One case series of household contacts revealed 3/31 (9.6%) clusters involved a child as a possible source case, compared to H5N1 avian influenza in which 54% of family clusters had a paediatric source case. 12 Similarly, in school-based transmission studies in Australia involving 18 index COVID-19 cases, only two of 735 (0.3%) students became secondarily infected: one from an adolescent student, and another from an infected teacher. 13 A systematic review on school closures for coronavirus control has found no conclusive evidence for a convincing impact on population-level viral transmission dynamics, 56 and in Sweden (where schools and childcare centres have remained open throughout the pandemic) the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children has remained very low. 57 Concordant with these epidemiological findings, a recent modelling study demonstrated that susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in people under the age of 20 years is around half that of adults. 58 Additionally, only 21% of infections are symptomatic in adolescents (aged 10 to 19 years), compared to 69% in older adults (>70 years). As a result, transmission-based interventions aimed at children, including school closures, are projected to have a relatively small impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. 58 Indeed, there are now data from many geographic settings across Europe, Asia and America confirming that the proportion of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the community is low (varying from 1% in young children to 6% in older children), 54 although further adequately powered seroprevalence studies are necessary to more clearly establish the transmission dynamics in children.Despite the weight of evidence suggesting children are not major drivers of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level, children in many geographic areas have been subject to the same social isolation rules as adults, including widespread school closures. These policies have significant repercussions for education, development and wellbeing. 59 Furthermore, reduced economic productivity at household as well as national levels, and negative impacts on the psychosocial wellbeing of parents and/or caregivers may be expected corollaries. Limiting transmission from adult source cases is essential through prioritisation of optimal hygiene and physical distancing measures; yet the need to enforce physical distancing in children with the same rigour (including universal school closures or restrictions) poses a risk of marked social and emotional morbidity which is not proportionate to the existing evidence for the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 60 As with other human coronaviruses, the diagnostic gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 is via RT-PCR, commonly utilising genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface spike glycoprotein. [61] [62] [63] Higher viral loads have been documented in the lower respiratory tract, 64 consistent with what has been observed for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 65 In some settings, where there is a strong clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 yet a negative result on nasopharyngeal or throat swab, lower respiratory tract sampling is recommended; 66 however, this should be reserved for the most unwell children in light of the risks associated with obtaining lower respiratory tract samples.Buccal swabs have been explored as a more tolerable sampling method than the currently recommended nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens, 67 yet studies investigating this method have included very small numbers of children and have revealed higher cycle thresholds when compared with nasal nasopharyngeal specimens, indicating a lower viral load assessed via this sampling method. Although saliva specimens have been investigated in studies involving small numbers of adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 68 this has not been evaluated in the paediatric population. Most of the available data regarding the timing of viral detection via PCR is based on evidence obtained from the adult population, and indicates that viral detection via PCR tends to decline more quickly in upper respiratory tract samples than lower respiratory tract samples. 63 SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected for longer periods in patients with more severe disease than in patients with mild illness. 69 SARS-CoV-2 infection can also be ascertained by the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, which may be helpful in aiding in the diagnosis of post-infectious inflammatory syndromes in children. The first detectable serological marker is total antibodies, 70 although IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been documented as positive as early as four days after symptom onset. 63 Seroconversion typically occurs in the third to fourth week after illness and ELISA-based IgM and IgG antibody tests have revealed a high specificity for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, 63 although false positive results have been described 71 and cross-reactivity between other coronaviruses may occur. 72 While specific sensitivity quantification is difficult to delineate with regard to serology in children, it is known that paucisymptomatic patients (which describes the vast majority pf paediatric cases) may have low antibody concentrations and in these circumstances, false negative results are more likely occur. 73 Similar to SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, several features of SARS-CoV-2 suggest the immune response is central to disease pathogenesis. For both viruses, the delay to onset of significant symptoms points to the priming of an immune response and high levels of inflammatory markers supports an inflammatory pathogenesis, while the worsening of disease in the presence of decreasing viral titres suggests that direct viral cytopathic effects may no longer be of relevance at that time. 74 In adults, it has been established that infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in a robust antiviral CD4 and CD8 T cell response 75 as well as generation of virus-specific antibodies, including neutralising antibodies. 76 Using single cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) several studies have now established the immune profile of adult patients with COVID-19. One study found that in hospitalised adults with COVID-19, especially those with ARDS, there is depletion of natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells and CD16+ monocytes, but expansion of plasmablasts. 77 Further analysis revealed that type I interferon induced signatures were strong (but not universal) in all patients, although cytokine expression was not elevated in peripheral blood immune cells, suggesting an alternative source of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19. 77 Indeed, scRNA-seq of bronchoalveolar lavage immune cells has revealed the presence of aberrant pro-inflammatory macrophages, especially in patients with severe COVID-19, 78 suggesting that perhaps the immune cells of resident tissues are the source of inflammatory cytokines. Another study focused on the early recovery phase of COVID-19 and identified a prominent population of CD14IL1β monocytes in the peripheral blood of adults seven days after showing a negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2, which was associated with increased signalling by inflammatory cytokines (such as type 1 interferons and IL-6 in several immune cell subsets, including monocytes, T cells and B cells). 79 Very little research currently exists regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in children. Data from New York city has shown that severe disease is associated with obesity in older children, and a pro-inflammatory profile demonstrated by a high C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels at admission. 80 Therefore, it seems that a pro-inflammatory state in predisposed children may be associated with severe adult-like COVID-19. Indeed, a key unanswered research area regarding SARS-CoV-2 is how the immune response in children differs from adults, and whether this difference may explain the spectrum of disease susceptibility and severity associated with COVID-19. Postulated reasons as to why most children appear to be protected from an acute hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 include: (i) the capacity to mount a more controlled and efficient immune response; (ii) relatively fewer co-morbidities that predispose to a pre-existing pro-inflammatory state; and (iii) relatively lower viral loads that may not trigger as intense an inflammatory response.One of the most consistent and biologically plausible theories emerging in the literature regarding the mild (if any) disease SARS-CoV-2 causes in children surrounds age-related differences in ACE2. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptors, as well as the cleavage or priming of this S protein by host cell proteases (Fig. 1) . 81 SARS-CoV-2 (and its predecessors SARS-CoV-1 and the seasonal coronavirus, CoV-NL63) engage ACE2 for cell entry, and utilise the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. 82, 83 In the previous SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, the efficiency of ACE2 usage in viral cell binding was found to be a key determinant of SARS-CoV-1 transmissibility. 84 ACE2 is an enzyme that functions to convert angiotensin II to its metabolite angiotensin-(1-7), particularly within the lung microenvironment, where ACE2 levels are intrinsically elevated. 85 Angiotensin-(1-7) has a homeostatic role in the regulation of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a finely tuned cascade of vasoactive peptides that orchestrates key processes of human physiology. 86, 87 The RAAS is an important regulatory pathway for the cardiovascular system and the counter-regulatory enzymes ACE and ACE2 have been identified as key elements of the inflammatory processes established in conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, lung injury and sepsis. 88 Diminished expression of ACE2 can result in chronic heart failure and pulmonary compromise, implying a protective mechanism of ACE2 and alluding to a mechanism whereby dysregulated ACE2 in COVID-19 may imbalance the angiotensin-II/angiotensin-(1-7) equilibrium to tend towards inflammation and hypoxia. 85 After gaining entry to the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 appears to down-regulate ACE2 expression on cell surfaces, thereby minimising the ability of the enzyme to exhibit its protective effects on organs. 87, 89, 90 While ACE2 expression has been found throughout the cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal systems (with TMPRSS2 expressed even more broadly), nasal epithelial cells exhibit the highest expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 within the entire respiratory tract, which may explain the prominence of the symptom of anosmia in patients with COVID-19. [91] [92] [93] In the lower respiratory tract, where both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 appear to have their most acute pathogenic effects, ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression has been identified in both type I and type II pneumocytes. 83, 94, 95 In children, a higher concentration of ACE2 in pneumocytes has been documented, which may explain the protection for this age group against the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19. 85, 96 Age-dependent ACE2 gene expression has also been documented in the nasal epithelium, with the lowest gene expression evident in younger children and increasing expression evident with age. 97 As this is the first point of contact for SARS-CoV-2 in the human body, lower ACE2 expression in the nasal epithelium of children may explain the infrequent infectivity in this age group. The RAAS derangement that is evident in many underlying chronic cardiovascular conditions, which normally do not affect paediatric populations, may be implicated in the severity of COVID-19 seen in older populations. It is becoming evident that while age is the strongest predictor of COVID-19-related death, in keeping with findings revealed by prior coronavirus epidemics, the presence of coexisting conditions-particularly chronic cardiovascular disease and obesity-are proving key prognostic determinants for COVID-19. [98] [99] [100] [101] It has been hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 may directly attack vascular endothelial cells expressing high levels of ACE2, resulting in abnormal coagulation and a sepsis-like picture. 102 Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium tends to result in organ ischaemia via a shift in the vascular equilibrium towards vasoconstriction, which further exacerbates tissue inflammation. 103,104 SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate induction of endotheliitis, as autopsy evidence has revealed the presence of viral inclusion bodies within endothelial cells alongside an accumulation of inflammatory cells, impairing microcirculatory function and resulting in clinical ischaemia of multiple organs. 103 Once again, this may explain a predisposition for patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction (as is associated with hypertension, diabetes, established cardiovascular disease and obesity) to have the highest risk of adverse outcomes in COVID- 19. 103 Finally, modified endovascular responses due to developmental differences in clotting factors and endothelial cells have also been proposed as an explanation for the attenuated response to SARS-CoV-2 in children. 103, 105 Indeed, there is clear evidence that haemostasis is a developmental continuum, with reduced vitamin K dependent coagulation factors and antithrombin evident in neonates, while lower protein C and S levels persist throughout childhood. 106 This contrasts to the prothrombotic milieu evident in elderly populations, which may serve as yet another mechanism for driving severe disease in this population. 107 In April 2020, several severely unwell children with fever and shock were described in the United Kingdom (UK) in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 108 No such cases had been reported prior to this from China, and a solitary case from the US of Kawasaki disease (KD) with concurrent detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection had been published. 109 Further cases were later identified in the UK and the condition was labelled 'paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2' (PIMS-TS). 108 Reports subsequently emerged from other high-burden settings regarding children with fever, shock, rash and abdominal pain, some of whom met diagnostic criteria for KD; 110-113 many of these children were seropositive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and a minority showed concurrent detection of SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR. 108, 110, 111 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has named the syndrome 'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19' (MIS-C). 114 Although the link between SARS-CoV-2 and these multisystem inflammatory syndromes requires further elucidation, there is a growing consensus that this syndrome may represent an immune-mediated complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents, in light of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in most cases and 4-week delay in timing between peaks of community SARS-CoV-2 infections and case report clusters of children presenting with inflammatory syndromes in several locations. 110, 111 One of the more comprehensive descriptive studies regarding this inflammatory syndrome depicted 58 children who presented with fever, with half having evidence of rash and gastrointestinal symptoms. 115 Twenty-nine of these cases (50%) developed shock and required intensive care support. Twelve of these children (20%) met the diagnostic criteria for KD, while 24 children (40%) showed no features of KD. However, the patients described were generally older than KD cohorts and showed higher inflammatory markers than is common in KD. Eight (14%) cases developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysms, revealing a possible shared pathogenesis with KD. Almost all children recovered (1 death), with the majority receiving systemic immunomodulatory treatment. Other reports have described a high prevalence of macrophage activation syndrome in PIMS-TS, which is less common in endemic KD than in PIMS-TS. 110 KD may provide a model for the pathogenesis of PIMS-TS, not least because KD has a strong association with seasonal infections, but also because it is rarely associated with intercurrent infection at the time of manifesting the vasculitic processes (as has been evident in the above described cohorts). A number of surveillance studies have been established to better monitor the emergence of this clinical entity. 116 In Australia, surveillance undertaken by the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance network (www.paeds.org.au) has not shown an increased frequency of KD across the period of the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia, which may be anticipated in light of the low community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 to date. Specific, albeit provisional, recommendations for management of patients with possible PIMS-TS/MIS-C have been published by a group of specialist clinicians and endorsed by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. 117 SARS-CoV-2 serological testing during the acute presentation, and ideally prior to the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, is a key priority.Unlike many respiratory viruses, children have been relatively spared by severe illness in the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and appear to be only minor contributors to virus transmission. These aspects of SARS-CoV-2 in children likely result from differences in their immune response to the virus, including a lower predisposition to pro-inflammatory states, fewer co-morbidities, and the differential expression of ACE2 in children, which may attenuate viral entry, as well as ongoing replication and subsequent inflammation, hypoxia and tissue injury.At the time of writing, the multisystem inflammatory syndromes associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS/MIS-C), which present with KD-like clinical features, remain under investigation. Temporal and serological plausibility of a link with SARS-CoV-2 infection is supported by consistent data, but further studies are required to refine case definitions, establish SARS-CoV-2 as an inciting agent, understand the immune-mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and determine optimal management strategies.There remain significant questions needing to be addressed regarding the intricate pathogenic mechanisms underlying the differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults. Research to better define the immune response and assess the possibility of altered ACE2 tissue distribution and affinity for SARS-CoV-2 in the paediatric population should be a focus for future studies. Understanding the nature of host-virus interactions, and particularly which features of the paediatric immune system facilitate protection or (conversely) delayed multi-system inflammation, will shed light on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and may lead to necessary improvements in therapeutic options. Furthermore, it is important that future epidemiological and clinical cohort data describe clinical comorbidities and coinfections in children with more precision, as well as delineating disease findings implicated in severe COVID-19 and potential SARS-CoV-2 multisystem inflammatory sequelae more clearly. This will enable clarification of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2-related disease and its associated disease entities in children. Fig. 1 Host cell interaction with SARS-CoV-2.

Quarantine Measures and the Second Wave","In previous work [1] , a two-component model of the COVID-19 epidemic was proposed. The model is based on the selection of two immunologically different groups of the population -superspreaders and sensitive. Superspreaders carry the infection without visible symptoms, so they spread it. Sensitive, having received an infection, fall ill, are isolated and therefore cannot spread it further. A few relevant examples have shown that the model adequately describes the course of the COVID-19 epidemic.At the same time, the two-component model describes only the spread of the virus and does not consider the recovery processes. Further, it does not consider quarantine measures during the epidemic and the impact of these measures on the course of the epidemic itself. In this paper, we will include these factors in the twocomponent model and examine their impact on the final phase of the epidemic. In particular, the possibility of a second wave of the epidemic will be considered, and the conditions for its appearance will be determined.The article is structured as follows.In its second part, we consider the impact of recovery processes on the dynamics of the epidemic in the framework of the two-component model, as well as the impact of the quarantine as a factor affecting the spread rate. In this part, we introduce both factors into the dynamic equations of the two-component model and find an analytical solution under conditions of permanent quarantine.The third part examines the 4 phases of the epidemic. In particular, the effect of lifting the quarantine in the final phase is being investigated. The effect is to re-increase the endemic equilibrium number of asymptomatic superspreaders. This, however, does not mean * Electronic address: dimaschko@gmx.net an automatic re-increase in the incidence, if the proportion of those who have been ill and who have received immunity among the sensitive is already large enough.In the fourth section, we formulate a criterion for predicting the presence of a re-wave based on the analysis of the final segment of the first phase of the epidemic. Next, we compare the results obtained with the current course of the epidemic in a few countries and territories.The final section summarizes the application of the model to the course of the current COVID-19 pandemic and provides a natural explanation for the decrease in mortality resulting from the two-component model.The dynamic equations of the two-component model [1] describe the change in the number of infected sensitive (n 1 out of their total number N 1 ) and the number of infected superspreaders (n 2 out of their total number N 2 ) over time:In this model, only superspreaders spread the infection, see Fig.1 .Equations (1,2) take into account only the process of infection spread and do not take into account the recovery processes. In addition, they do not take into account the quarantine measures that have a direct impact on the spread rates of g 1 and g 2 .To consider this effect, we introduce the quarantine factor Q, which takes a value from 0 to 1. The effect of Fig. 1 : Scheme of the two-component epidemic model quarantine on the dynamics of the spread is reduced due to the same decrease in the spread rates g 1 and g 2 :When considering the recovery processes, we will proceed from the assumption that after suffering a disease with severe symptoms, a person acquires absolute immunity. Thus, he is deprived of the opportunity to be re-infected and, from the point of view of the model, is no different from a simple patient -both during the illness and after it, a person from the sensitive group cannot spread the infection. Therefore, such a restoration does not affect the dynamics of the two-component model. In contrast, recovery processes in asymptomatic infected individuals have a direct impact on the spread of the virus. We will assume that asymptomatic infected are deactivated with a recovery rate of γ. However, they do not acquire any lasting immunity and can be re-infected. This creates a circulation of infection among the superspreaders, leading to endemic equilibrium.Considering the factors of quarantine Q and the recovery rate γ, the equations of the two-component model take the formAfter switching to new variablesit is reduced to a simple form:Here the valueis the ratio of the spread rates g 1 ≡ αg and g 2 ≡ g. In the case of a long-time permanent quarantine, Q = const, this system of equations has an exact solutionwhere τ ≡ Qgt is dimensionless time and-dimensionless parameter of superspreaders deactivation rate. As in the absence of the quarantine (Q = 1) we have an epidemic occurs, the epidemic criterion is met (µ < 1). Consequently, the ratio of the recovery (γ) and spread (g) rates is also less than one:The found solution (10,11) meets the initial conditionsthat is, at the beginning of the epidemic, there are already infected people, but no sick ones yet. A stable endemic equilibrium among superspreaders is the state ofIn accordance with (12,15), at a sufficiently small value of Q, i.e. with a sufficiently strict quarantine leading to the case of µ ≥ 1, s 2 = 0 -all superspreaders are deactivated. In the opposite case of non-strict quarantine, when the value of the quarantine factor Q is not small enough and the parameter µ is less than one (µ < 1), an endemic equilibrium takes place with a certain proportion of active infected superspreaders, s 2 > 0.In such a solution the proportion of cases sensitive s 1 continues to grow until it reaches the limit value s 1 = 1. It is this condition that corresponds to the end of the epidemic and the vanishing of the daily incidench among superspreaders the infection continues, as at the beginning of the epidemic, to circulate at the stationary endemic level. The course of the epidemic according to the found solution (10, 11) is shown in Fig. 2 .Thus, in the two-component model, the quarantine factor does not affect the reproductive number, which determines the exponential growth rate of the incidence, but rather the endemic equilibrium number of asymptomatic superspreaders. The daily incidence is directly proportional to this number. In addition, it is proportional to remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) in the Public Domain.

Anyone can legally share, reuse,In the general case, the value of the quarantine factor Q is some function of time Q(t), determined by the sequence and severity of quarantine measures. A typical course of the function Q(t) is shown in Fig. 3 . Natural boundary conditions for it areAt the beginning of the epidemic, there is no quarantine and the quarantine factor is close to one, which corresponds to the boundary condition Q(0) = 1. As the epidemic develops, quarantine measures are taken, which are responsible for reducing the value of the Q factor. As the incidence decreases, the quarantine measures are removed, and the quarantine factor returns to the initial value. This corresponds to the second boundary condition Q(∞) = 1.For an arbitrary dependence Q(t), the dynamic equations (7,8) have no exact solution. However, taking into account the boundary conditions (16), it turns out to be possible to carry out a qualitative analysis of the course of the epidemic corresponding to the real dependence Q(t).In this analysis, it is convenient to divide the entire course of the epidemic into 4 phases.A) The epidemic phase itself. At the beginning of the epidemic, there is no quarantine,Q = 1. At the same time, the number of the superspreaders is growing exponentially, s 2 ∝ e (g−γ)t . The daily incidence among sensitives is directly proportional to the number of superspreaders ds 1 /dt ∝ s 2 and therefore also grows exponentially.B) Quarantine start phase. In this phase, the spread rates are suppressed by quarantine measures with a factor of Q < 1, the relative number of the superspreaders reaches the endemic equilibrium value s 2 = 1 − γ/(Qg) and stops growing. Therefore, the daily incidence ds 1 /dt, which is directly proportional to the number of superspreaders, also stops growing. In this phase, the daily incidence reaches its maximum. C) Endemic phase. In conditions of constant quarantine and, accordingly, an endemic constant number of the superspreaders, the daily incidence is gradually decreasing due to a decrease in the proportion of those who have not been cured among sensitive, (1 − s 1 ). Ideally, by the end of this phase, this proportion is already small, 1 − s 1 1. D) Quarantine release phase. After the quarantine is released, the equilibrium number of the superspreaders increases from the value s 2 = 1−γ/(Qg) established after the quarantine is turned on to the maximum possible value s 2 = 1 − γ/g.Thus, even if the endemic equilibrium number of the superspreaders was significantly reduced during quarantine, after the quarantine was lifted at the end of the epidemic, it again increases to its maximum value.If the proportion of those who did not recover among the sensitive by the time the quarantine was lifted is already small, 1 − s 1 1, then this does not lead to a noticeable increase in the daily incidence at the end of the epidemic.If this share has not yet managed to become sufficiently small, i.e. a significant part of the sensitive, then the release of quarantine leads to a noticeable increase in the daily incidence, i.e. to the second wave.To illustrate the possibility of the emergence of the second wave, let us consider the course of the epidemic at remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) in the Public Domain. It is no longer restricted by copyright. Anyone can legally share, reuse,At Q = 1 (absence of the quarantine), Q = 0.45 and Q = 0.30 (soft or moderately strict quarantine), the equilibrium endemic number of the superspreaders differs from zero. In these three cases, superspreaders continue to spread the infection during quarantine, and the incidence decreases relatively slowly due to a decrease in the number of sensitive who have not been ill. As can be seen from the first three graphs, here the release of quarantine after a significant decrease in the incidence does not lead to the appearance of a noticeable second wave, since by this moment the vast majority of the sensitive have already been ill.If Q = 0.15 (very strict quarantine), as shown in the fourth graph, then the endemic equilibrium number of superspreaders during quarantine becomes zero. On the one hand, this leads to a rapid zero morbidity during quarantine. However, it is for this reason that most sensitive do not have time to get sick during quarantine. After the quarantine is released, the number of the superspreaders returns to the former endemic equilibrium non-zero value, and a new wave of infected people appears among the sensitive. It represents the second (residual) wave of morbidity Thus excessively strict quarantine that deactivates all carriers of the virus is harmful. The reason for this is that in the absence of the virus, the sensitive are completely deprived of the opportunity to acquire immunity during the course of the disease. When active infected superspreaders reappear after the quarantine has been lifted, this still inevitably leads to the infection of the sensitive, deprived of immunity, to the appearance of a second wave of the epidemic and, thereby, to an increase in its duration.Since the severity of quarantine can be assessed only by its consequences, it seems reasonable to find a criterion for the possibility of a second wave after quarantine is removed (corresponds to the phase of quarantine D in Fig.3) based on the analysis of the current course of the epidemic, i.e. before the quarantine was lifted (corresponds to the beginning of quarantine phase B and endemic phase C in Fig. 4) .The forecast of the second wave will be based on the course of the epidemic immediately before and after the first maximum. In accordance with the exact solution (10,11), before reaching the first maximum, the increase in the incidence rate under quarantine conditions with factor Q occurs with an exponential rate ∝ e (Qg−γ)t . After reaching the first maximum, the incidence rate decreases exponentially ∝ e −(Qαg+γ)t . The ratio of the Fig. 4 . The appearance of the second wave with a decrease in the quarantine parameter Q (i.e., with an increase of the quarantine). Sections A, B, C, D correspond to 4 different phases of the epidemic: Athe epidemic phase itself, B -the phase of the beginning of quarantine, C -the endemic phase, D -the phase of quarantine lifting. The dotted line shows the quarantine factor Q(t) as a function of time. solid -daily incidence. For comparison, the course of morbidity is shown in the complete absence of quarantine measures, Q=1. In this case, the maximum incidence would exceed the maximum scale of the graph by about 1.5 times. The minimum value of the quarantine factor Q=0.45 conditionally corresponds to moderate quarantine measures, Q=0.30 -strict, Q=0.15 -extremely strict. remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) in the Public Domain. It is no longer restricted by copyright. Anyone can legally share, reuse,In the epidemic limit γ/(Qg) 1, when the recovery constant can be neglected, this ratio is equal to 1/α. In [1] , we showed, using the example of a number of countries, that this value has a numerical value ofIn other words, this means that for most countries and territories, the value of A is close to 4. A significant deviation from this value towards a decrease should indicate excessively strict quarantine measures, which can lead to the appearance of a noticeable new wave -even after almost complete attenuation of the first. The lower the value of the parameter A, the more likely the second wave.Examples of this kind are Israel (A=1.1) and Serbia (A=0.9), where there is a significant second wave. The course of the epidemic in these countries is shown in Fig.5 . The value of the critical parameterA is determined by the section of the graph at half the maximum height and the projection of the top of the graph onto this section. The value of parameter A in this and subsequent graphs is estimated as the ratio of the lengths of the right and left segments of this section.A very interesting situation shown in Fig.6 is observed in Australia and New Zealand. The first peak of the epidemics in both neighbouring countries is similar, observed in the same time and satisfies the second wave criterion: A=0.9 in Australia and A=1.0 in New Zealand. In Australia we already observe the second wave with maximum about 500 cases per day. The value of A=1.0 indicates the emergence of a similar second wave in New Zealand in the near future.Counterexamples of countries with moderate values of A are Germany (A=1.5) and Italy (A=2.5), where the signs of the second wave are very weak. The course of the epidemic in these countries is shown in Fig.7 .In addition to the excessively strict quarantine, the reason for the appearance of the second wave can obviously be its premature weakening. In this case, the endemic equilibrium number of superspreaders increases against the background of a significant proportion of sensitive individuals who have not recovered and have not yet received immunity. This will lead to an immediate increase in the incidence, as appears to have happened in Iran and the United States. The course of the epidemic in these countries is shown in Fig.8 .Note that in terms of the criterion of severity of quarantine, Iran is equivalent to Germany, and the United States is equivalent to Italy (Fig. 7) . This indicates that in both cases, extending the quarantine until the end of the first wave would have avoided the appearance of a second wave. Thus, the two-component model not only provides an adequate description of the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, but also allows one to assess the impact of the severity and duration of quarantine measures on the course of the epidemic. It results a simple criterion for predicting the possibility of a second wave of the epidemic after the quarantine is weakened. Based on this criterion, we can predict the repeated wave of the epidemic in New Zealand.Further, the two-component model provides a natural explanation for the observed decrease in mortality among those infected. It is important to understand that, due to the individual differences in the immune response, the concepts of ""infected"" and ""sick"" are not equivalent: infection leads to disease only in sensitive and does not lead to disease in superspreaders. The increase in the number of infected in the final phase of the epidemic may largely occur not due to an increase in real morbidity, but due to an increase in the number of asymptomatically infected superspreaders found during testing. Since those who have recovered from the sensitive acquire immunity, an increasing proportion of those infected are superspread-remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) in the Public Domain.

Anyone can legally share, reuse,For this reason, data on absolute mortality from COVID-19 are more adequate for model verification than data on the number of infected. It is these data that were predominantly used to evaluate the re-wave criterion in Finally, note that the two-component model ignores the spatial heterogeneity of population density. This circumstance is important for countries with a large territory and an extensive system of regions and megalopolises (Russia, USA). For such countries, the epidemic acquires a multifocal character, and its spread to the entire territory of the country takes a longer time. Taking this circumstance into account requires considering the spatial distribution and corresponding modification of the model in the spirit of [2] . ","New Zealand","abstract","2020-08-16",8

WHO officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic in early March 2020 and COVID-19 has now spread throughout most countries in the world 2 causing heavy life losses and damaging social-economic impacts 3 . The COVID-19 outbreak has actually turned a regional public health threat into a global social-economic crisis.This study aimed at developing a COVID-19 spread dynamics based Monte Carlo simulation model that could be used as a decision making tool in battling COVID-19 in the immediate need, and for modelling any other infectious diseases in the future. Same as those compartmental disease models within the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) framework [3] [4] [5] , the proposed model captured population changes in each cohort. However, the approach for modelling the dynamic processes of virus/disease transmission is different. In this study, the progression of COVID-19 was characterised by a Monte Carlo simulation model which is similar to a stochastic point process model 6, 7 . By treating each individual in a population as a random point, the rationale of the new model was much intuitive and easy to interpret. The modelling processes were implemented using the popular statistical software R 8 . Using this article as a user guide, the application of the new model would be straight forward for an experienced R user. The outputs of the new model included the estimated daily number of newly confirmed cases and the daily number of the infection active cases (i.e., new cases and the carry-over infectious cases) over a specified observation period. The model outputs therefore contained the information for answering the most essential decision making questions such as when the number of the active COVID-19 cases would peak, how long the number of the active cases would fall back to a specified level, what would be the total number of confirmed cases by the end of the COVID-19 outbreak, etc. The most important parameter of the simulation model was the average/expected number of cases that a single infectious person would infect over the course of this person's infectious period (i.e., the reproduction number as usually reported in literature, however, primarily referred to as the infection rate parameter 'Rt' in this article). It was a matter of fact that the determination of the infection rate Rt over an observation period depended on many factors that at least including goodness-of-fit of the observed number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, interpretation of the impact of government interventions/policies, the capacity of health care system, and evaluation of the potential consequences due to public responses to government policies and induced people's behaviour changes 1, 3, 9 . By statistically capturing the most essential COVID-19 spread mechanism, this simulation model should at least The COVID-19 spread dynamics was characterised by a few key parameters in building the simulation model.The key parameters and assumptions were: (1) the infection rate parameter 'Rt'; (2) the actual number of people being infected by each of the infection active cases is determined by a Poisson distribution with mean Rt; the exact number of days for someone getting infected follows a negative binomial distribution with the mean/expected time (parameter 'muT') in days. (3) The limit of the number of people and the immunity proportion in a study population could be pre-determined by the user. (4) Other initial conditions including the initial number of infectious persons, the observation period (in days), and the simulation period (in days) of a simulation study. A stochastic point process conceptual model was best illustrated with a graph as shown in Fig. 1 , assuming a hypothetic micro-population of 10 people. The observation period was 20 days. The COVID-19 spread processes started from one person (represented by the initial round dot point) who infected five people (represented by the cross points). The number of people being infected was modelled by a Poisson distribution with parameter Rt which could be different in different stage of the observation period. We assume that a minimum of one day is needed for a newly infected person to start transmitting the COVID-19 to the next generation of infected people. The infection times are independent of each other so that more than one person could be infected from the same infection active person on the same day. The exact number of days for someone to be get infected followed a negative binomial distribution with the mean/expected time (parameter 'muT') in days. Once the Poisson distribution generated number of infected people was reached, the source infection active person would be excluded from the transmission process (e.g., assuming the source infectious person is either cured or died, or at least in a condition of incapable of causing infection of other people, therefore no longer staying in the infection active case cohort). If an infected person had no one else to transmit the virus, this person would be excluded from the active case cohort after muT days on average. In Fig. 1 , the top panel plot showed us how many and when of the infection cases would happen for a micro-population of 10 people within an observation period of 20 days; the bottom panel displayed the corresponding pattern of the number of the active cases (i.e., the daily number of people who were actively infectious).The simulation model was implemented in R 8 and the r code was provided in the Supplementary informmation for readers' information (the full set of the r code for reproduction of all the analysis results presented in this article would be available upon request). The simulation model had the following format for usage in R environment 8 .TransSimu (days = 300, nd = 30, Rt = rr, muT = 4, sizeV = 1, limit = 1,000,000, pp = 0.001, n0 = 1). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ There were eight parameters/argument terms in this R function and definitions of these argument terms were given in Table 1 .Due to the uncertainty introduced by probability distributions employed for determining the number of infection cases and the time at which such event would occur, we should allow the observation period ('days') relatively longer than the simulation period ('nd'). For modelling COVID-19 data, it was found that nd = 100 was enough to obtain a stabilized simulation results. The length of Rt should be as least as large as the nd value. This would be better explained through an example.Suppose now we had a hypothetic infection rate pattern as rr = c(rep(2.8,30), 2,2,1.5,1.5, 1.2,1.2,rep(0.8,4),rep(0.5,10)) , hence length of Rt is 50. If we tried to run the simulation model as TransSimu(nd = 100,Rt = rr) in R, an error message would be returned in the R console window: Error in TransSimu(nd = 100, Rt = rr): the length of Rt should not be smaller than nd.Since Monte Carlo simulation processes involve the random number generation which means the simulation analysis results would be subject to random variation due to different starting points defined intrinsically by a selected random seed value 10, 12 . Therefore, when we would compare different scenarios of the disease transmission using the simulation model, the same random seed needed to be specified for each scenario for a valid comparison.The determination of the infection rate patterns was a mixed exercise procedure involving using reported reproduction numbers (referred to as infection rates in this article) as a base line to start, performing statistical optimization (e.g., least square curve fit of the observed data), and incorporating personal judgement and interpretation of the government intervention effects. For example, curve fitting could only be done for those days the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases were available which were 62 days out of the 100-day model simulation period in this study. Therefore, the remaining 38 of the total 100 Rt = rr values were primarily the results of subjective judgement and assumptions. It was in this sense we considered that primarily what this Monte Carlo simulation model could do for us was of the nature of what-if analysis for decision making.To count for the uncertainty in a Monte Carlo simulation study, a bootstrap approach 10,13 was followed to obtain the estimated median and interquartile values of the number of the infection active cases and the confirmed daily new cases over the observation period (hence the total number of confirmed cases could easily be derived). Each simulation model was run for 1,000 times and the median values were considered as the most likely estimation and the uncertainty level was characterised by the interquartile range (i.e., the range between the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the 1,000 values).In order to show how to use this simulation model to count for the impact of population size and immunity level, three hypothetical infection rate patterns were assumed for simulation study. The comparison of these three infection rate patterns was to show the simulation model performance in the case when the population size limit would be reached and the cohort with immunity should be counted for in the disease transmission processes. This study also showed under what condition the number of the infection active case curve could be flattened.The outputs of the simulation model included three pieces of information: the estimated daily number of the active cases; the estimated daily number of the new cases; and a single total number of all confirmed cases. Therefore, summing up all the estimated number of the daily new confirmed cases should equal exactly the overall total number of the confirmed cases.Simulation results and comparison of 12 hypothetical disease transmission scenarios. In this study, we first examined the model theoretical performances using a few reasonable but hypothetic infection rate patterns. Three such patterns expressed in r code format were given below. 1,50) ). Literature reported that the typical range for Rt values was between 2 to 4 for COVID-19 spread without intervention 1, 3, 9, 14 . Assuming the simulation period started before any government interventions, therefore, Rt values were set to 3 for the first 30 days in the pattern 1 and then decreasing gradually over the subsequent stages Table 1 .

In pattern 2, we would like to check how the outbreak outcomes would change if the government's intervention enforced 5 days earlier; further in pattern 3, we examined how different it could be if the starting Rt values were lower than 3 (e.g., 2.5) given other things equal. As indicated in Table 1 , there were two parameters (muT and sizeV) for defining a negative binomial distribution 10, 11 which was used for describing the time interval for a susceptible person getting infected. In the study, we also compared different scenarios by examining different muT and sizeV values. The three different simulation settings that examined were: TransSimu(nd = 100, muT = 4, sizeV = 1); TransSimu(nd = 100, muT = 4, sizeV = 0.9); and TransSimu(nd = 100, muT = 3.6, sizeV = 1). Therefore, we finally ended up with a total of 12 hypothetical disease transmission scenarios for us to investigate/compare using the proposed simulation model and the results were presented in Fig. 2 .The interpretations of the graphical outcomes of Fig. 2 were as follows. The three panels in the top row showed that by only five days earlier of enforcing intervention, the number of the active cases would peak earlier accordingly with a much lower peak value (black curves versus blue curves). The three panels in the bottom row showed that by reducing Rt from 3 to 2.5 for the first 30 days, the number of the active cases would reach the peak on the same day but with a much lower peak value (black curves versus red curves). The comparison of the panels in the second column versus the first column showed that reducing the muT values (3.6 versus 4 days) would increase the peak level quite substantially. The comparison of the panels in the third column versus the first column showed that reducing the sizeV values (0.9 versus 1, a smaller sizeV value implies a larger variance) would increase the peak level even further. By comparing panels in columns three and two seemed indicating the impact on the peak level due to the change (10%) in muT was somehow smaller than that due to change (10%) in sizeV. Therefore, in summary, this part of the simulation study showed that, as expected/implied by the underlying theory, a higher Rt or a smaller muT would result in a higher number of infected people keeping other things equal.Simulation study results on Australia and UK data. The 1,30) ). Different from the model default setting for the initial cases (n0 = 1), it was decided to use the sum of the newly confirmed cases over the period of two weeks prior to 1 March as the initial infectious case number. Therefore, it was n0 = 10 for Australia data and n0 = 9 for UK data in running the simulation model. The parameter muT was also adjusted in the simulation setting to give more flexibility in fitting the observed data patterns. The simulation settings were:TransSimu(nd = 100, muT = 4.4, sizeV = 0.9, n0 = 10) for Australia and TransSimu(nd = 100, muT = 3.8, sizeV = 1.1, n0 = 9) for UK. The resulting muT values implied that the average time needed for getting a susceptible people infected was shorter in UK than in Australia (3.8 versus 4.4). On the other hand, the resulting sizeV values implied that the infection intervals in UK was less variable than that in Australia (a higher sizeV value implied a lower variance).The simulation study results based on the Australian confirmed COVID-19 cases data were presented in Fig. 3 (the model estimated number of the infection active cases) and Fig. 4 (the cumulative number of the confirmed cases). Figure 3 indicated that, according to the model prediction, the number of the active cases in Australia would peak around 29 March. Practically, this would be the time the Australian health care system having the highest pressure. Decisions might then be made for preparation for the possible worst scenario situation (how much and when) as predicted by the model. Figure 4 presented the model predicted/estimated pattern for the cumulative number of cases and the actually observed/recorded number of confirmed COVID-19 cases were superimposed as those dot points. The 62 observed data points (period over 1 March to 1 May) fitted nicely to the predicted median curve. By examining the resulting Rt values, it was found that the infection rate in Australia was actually higher in later March than in early March which might be explained by the fact that a substantial large number of new cases were identified related to several cruise ships arrived in March (e.g., the Ruby Princess cruise ship case https ://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-05/ruby-princ ess-cruis e-coron aviru s-death s-inves tigat ed-nsw-polic e/12123 212). As we have argued in the previous sections the determination of Rt values involved different types of influential factors and these factors were very much time dependent. Nevertheless, the simulation model predicted that at the peak time, the number of infection active cases could reach 1,670 with the interquartile range of (1,321, 2,079); by the end of the COVID-19 outbreak, it would have a total number of 6,789 confirmed cases in Australia with the interquartile range of (5, 268, 8, 401 ). Both Figs. 3 and 4 indicated that the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia should be over before June should the assumed Rt pattern in this model proved to be true. The model predicted that by 3 May the active case level in Australia would drop back to the same level prior to 1 March.The simulation study results based on the United Kingdom's confirmed COVID-19 cases data were presented in Fig. 5 (the model estimated number of the active cases) and Fig. 6 (the cumulative number of the confirmed cases). Figure 5 indicated that, according to the model prediction, the number of the infection active cases in UK would peak around 22 April. The simulation model predicted that at the peak time, the number of active cases could reach 22,856 with the interquartile range of (18,653, 27,323) . Practically, this would be the time the UK's health care system having the highest pressure. For example, assuming 10% of the active case individuals would require ICU beds, this meant UK health care system should have at least 2,286 ICU beds ready before 22 April. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Same as the Australian case in Fig. 4 , the UK case in Fig. 6 showed a near perfect fit between the model predicted/estimated median curve and the observed data points. The simulation model predicted that by the end of the COVID-19 outbreak, UK could have a total number of 206,481 confirmed cases with the interquartile range of (168,074, 247,047). Due to the uncertain and complex nature in determination of the Rt values, one should not be too confident about the model estimation results for both the Australia case and the UK case in terms of ultimate true cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases because, as it was said ""Models are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based"" 15 . However, in the process of determining the Rt values for the simulation model more insights were gained on the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread over time in both countries. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The feasible interpretations of those two resulting/estimated infection rate patterns were as follows. Over 62 days (i.e., 1 March to 1 May) of the recorded data period, Australia had a much lower infection rate pattern than UK had. The details of the differences was summarised by presenting a descriptive summary of the first 62 Rt values (which primarily were determined by the observed number of confirmed cases) as in Table 2 . The results should explain the reason why even both countries started with almost the same confirmed case numbers (26 versus 23 as of 1 March) but it ended with UK had as 25 times higher of the confirmed cases than Australia had (6,762 versus 171,253 as of 1 May).The infection rate patterns could also be examined by different stages over the observation period. Beginning from 1 March, the first 10 days both countries were under pre-intervention stage and the resulting/estimated infection rate was between 2.3 and 2.5 for Australia and as high as 3.4 for UK. Then the unusual changes happened for the Australian infection rates over the second 10-day in March that it increased to as high as 3. On the other hand, the UK infection rates remained steady at 3.1 over the same 10-day period. From 20 March to 5 April, the infection rates kept constantly decreasing for both countries with a sharper drop in Australia (e.g., from 3 to 0.25) than in UK (e.g., from 3.1 to 1.4). This 15-day of gradually decreasing pattern of Rt values might be interpreted as a reflection of how intervention measures were enforced and taking effect over time. Then the infection rate pattern in Australia had showed a gentle bounce-back over the period of 6 April to 20 April (e.g., from 0.25 to 0.5) while UK's infection rates kept decreasing slowly and remained at a much higher level (e.g., from 1.4 to 1). After 20 April, both countries had showed a constantly decreasing pattern. However, caution was needed in interpretation of those Rt values after 1 May for the following reason. Of the total 100 Rt values in each pattern, the first 62 Rt values were largely determined by fitting the model to the observed data. The remaining 38 Rt values would then primarily be a result of subjective judgement or some wishful assumptions. For example, by assuming the last 30 Rt values to be 0.2 (for Australia) or 0.1 (for UK), we practically assume that, for both countries after 10 May the interventions would keep in effect, the general public would respond accordingly, and the confirmed cases keep recovering so that the overall effect was to such an extent that the infection rate would drop to a very low level of 0.2/0.1. However, what the future reality this might finally play out could only be a matter of ""what will be will be"". So far the hypothetical examples and the real life data models were referred to the situations in which the total number of infection cases was far below the default population size limit, one million (1,000,000). For example, Australia has a population about 25 million but the model estimated a total number of COVID-19 cases was less than 7,000; and the estimated total number of 206,450 cases versus a population size of 68 million for UK. Since COVID-19 was completely new to this world it was reasonable to assume that no immunity cohort in the current populations. In this section, however, the simulation model was examined for its performance in a different modelling situation: assuming the total infection number would reach the limit of a hypothetical population size, e.g., one million and a substantial proportion of immunity cohort, e.g., 10% (0.1). Three scenarios characterised by three hypothetical infection rate patterns were examined. The three hypothetical infections rate patterns were specified as: rr = c(rep(5,40),rep(0.5,60)); rr = c(rep(4,40),rep(0.5,60)); rr = c(rep(3.2,40),rep(0.5,60)).Therefore, we have assumed that in scenario 1, the infection rate was five for the first 40 days and then 0.5 for 60 days; scenario 2, infection rate was four for the first 40 days and then 0.5 for 60 days; scenario 3, infection rate was 3.2 for the first 40 days and then 0.5 for 60 days. Furthermore, we assumed that the immunity cohort proportion was 0.1 for all three scenarios. By setting the same random seed in running the simulation, we had the analysis results as graphically presented in Fig. 7 .The simulation study results showed in Fig. 7 could be interpreted as follows. In the situations that the total number of infection cases would exceed the population size (scenarios 1 and 2, which were represented by the grey and blue curves), a smaller infection rate would not necessarily widen the length of the disease outbreak period and the peak level of the number of active cases was not necessarily lower. On the other hand, if the infection rate was smaller enough so that the total number of infection cases would not reach the population size, the pattern of the number of the active cases would really flatten out as it was the case of scenario 3 (the green curve). The numeric simulation outcomes showed that this simulation model could correctly model the immunity proportion as specified in the input information.This study had developed a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure that could capture the essential virus transmission dynamics for the purpose of modelling COVID-19 spread over time. Through both the hypothetical and real life examples, the proposed simulation model had showed a good potential to be used as an effective and adaptable tool in performing what-if analysis for decision making for combating COVID-19 in specific and any other infectious diseases in general. With this newly developed empirical analysis tool/simulation model, however, the author is well aware of its limitations and weaknesses. For example, the current approach for estimation of the model parameters is largely an ad hoc empirical procedure. Because of its Monte Carlo simulation nature, a Bayesian approach, e.g., using one of the available BUGS language software 16, 17 , would be an obvious better solution. Although, the stochastic point process model was implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation model in this study, the mathematical formulas and its theoretical properties were not established. Although a couple of ad hoc parameter sensitivity studies were performed, neither the theoretical analysis nor a systematic empirical study of the model parameter sensitivity were pursued. The author will surely deal with these identified issues in his future research. ","Australia","abstract","2020-08-04",8

SARS and MERS are both caused by coronaviruses. This group of crown-like viruses can cause liver, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disease [1, 2] . SARS first appeared in Southern China in November 2002, caused by the SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with ready transmission through droplets. The incubation period was typically 2-7 days. The outbreak was declared to be over by late July 2003; this global pandemic resulted in a total of 8098 probable cases with 774 associated deaths [3] . Compared to SARS, new MERS cases were being reported. Since it was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, a total of 2519 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases including 866 associated deaths, were reported globally by the end of January 2020 [4] . With 79.6% similarity in sequence identity as SARS-CoV, the newest coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak first started in Wuhan, China on 12 December 2019 [5, 6] . Considering the rapid spread over the globe and the person-to-person transmission capability, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 1 February 2020 [7] . As lockdown restrictions continue to ease in countries worldwide, there is a need to avoid another wave of the outbreak that may occur in any place and at any time [8] . The second wave may not be as large as the first one, but it may lead to another worldwide outbreak, especially when reducing restrictions on air travel. For this reason, governments need to be more vigilant and should closely monitor any possibility of an outbreak. Predicting the spread of disease globally can foresee its impact, effectively manage the supply chain prior to the epidemic, and secure allocations for critically affected and at-risk countries, thus reducing the shortage issue for endangered health workers on the frontline [9] .The aim of this paper is to highlight some lockdown factors that may have a direct impact on the contagion level. The infection and mortality rates not only depend on the contagion level but also many other factors such as a late response at the start of the pandemic. Lockdowns have been applied by most governments worldwide, either as curfews or on a voluntary basis. The community lockdown can be statistically defined as maintaining the stay at home duration for as long as possible during 24 h.There are similarities between SARS, MERS, and EVD. However, none of the mentioned diseases have caused a global outbreak as COVID-19 has. It is hard to predict the major circumstances that gave COVID-19 a good chance to spread that fast. Table 1 explains the differences between these diseases and partially points out major spreading reasons. A quick comparison between the four viruses may conclude that MERS and COVID-19 are very similar. COVID-19 has the highest recorded infection rate. The basic reproduction number measures the infections produced by an infected individual in a population that is totally susceptible, and it is known as Pronounced R-naught (R0). This number is important in determining how contagious a disease is, or how quickly an infection will spread through a population [10] .The reason for COVID-19 spread in a large cluster may refer to other factors that are not confirmed yet. It is obvious that there is a minimum number of infections required to ignite any outbreak, this is large enough in urban areas and crowded cities. In a rough estimation, it is enough to infect a minimum of 0.2% of the inhabitants of many cities to reach the outbreak threshold value. This estimation depends on the R0 value of the virus and the population density. For instance, 0.2% is not enough to create an outbreak in suburban or fewer density cities. Wuhan/Hubei has one of the highest increases in population rate in China; its average annual increase rate is 7.9% with a population of 11 million [11] . The density of the city center of Wuhan is unknown, but the average of the world's medium metropolitans is around 29,000 people per kilometer. This number is usually doubled or tripled during the daytime in the city center.Various factors created an ideal environment for the virus to spread: the city center density, the outbreak core center, the high seasonal shopping celebrating the upcoming Chinese spring festival, the large number of international students, and the worldwide visitors. In contrast, MERS and SARS most probably started in suburban areas [12] . MERS has appeared in places far away from main cities in Saudi Arabia since camel farms are available in unoccupied areas of deserts.This article presents some suggested methods for measuring the R0 spread in the short run. This is to provide better measurement tools to government bodies, so they can promptly decide in accordance with the spread development. During the past few months, the spread measurements have adopted the value of R0 = 2.5 [13] . This value was calculated during the initial stages of the pandemic. The calculation method takes into consideration an incubation period of 14 days for the virus. As time passed, the R0 rate dramatically dropped down due to lockdown procedures, self-quarantine, and people's awareness of the disease. Moreover, the uncertainty in understanding the infection numbers, in the early stages was high. Currently, the uncertainty percentage rate is lower, and the scan/testing rate of suspected patients is higher. Also, the virus test result period is much shorter than before, it may not exceed a few hours. We need to find a faster and more accurate measurement tool that gives governments a better understanding of the outbreak growth. The measurement model in this paper comprises the measurement of lockdown procedures, which may support government decisions. The method adopts a short period of measurement, which should not exceed four days. This may not seem accurate for measuring R0, but it can be considered another proposed model of measurement. This is essential to monitor the social distancing efficiency closely. Four days may allow the prompt review of some public health actions for better spatial protection against this disease.Governments should have a long-term plan for this outbreak; this includes continuous revision of the lockdown policies, restrictions, and procedures. The policies should compromise between preventing an over-limit outbreak and mitigating economic loss. Limited capacity is defined as the ultimate capacity for intensive care units in the public health system. Governments are concerned about finding the optimal planning response since they are unable to determine the outbreak spread time and the social activities that cause the highest spread. Future modeling will account for the actions taken by governments, which include restricting travel, isolating people with the virus and their contacts, social distancing, growing health system capacity, and others [14] . For approximate evaluation, we built a naïve model that may support decision making. The model should provide a short period of reading the exponential spread of the disease. A period of four days is defined as a short time to re-review the public health policy. The governments should therefore respond promptly according to the resulting output.To implement a proper model for measuring the lockdown efficiency, we introduced a model to measure some factors that have a direct impact on lockdown procedures. The R0 value was calculated daily, and then it was grouped by interquartile ranges. The R0 can be calculated by subtracting the number of infections in the previous day from the current day infections. The growth rate is given by. Suppose that the number of infections is denoted by X, where X is defined as:where x n represents the number of infections on the nth day.The dispersion value is calculated by finding the interquartile mean of R0 for each interquartile range. Two interquartile values of Q1 and Q3 are found as follows:where N denotes the number of days. Three interquartile ranges are defined by finding the mean of the values between zero and Q1, then the mean of the values between Q1 and Q3, and finally the mean of all the values greater than Q3. Close monitoring of the mean values of R0 would give a good indication of the daily social distancing efficiency. The mean value is not unique, in this case, it is a value that keeps changing daily. Calculating the mean value on a daily basis is essential to reduce the error rate caused by underestimating the actual number of daily infected cases. The mean value for each quartile is defined as:where x donates the mean values for each interquartile, and p represents the quarter number.Finding out methods for gauging the contagion rate R0 can be a complicated task. Also, finding out methods for measuring the major factors that have a direct impact on R0 is an even harder task. We introduced a methodology for evaluating R0 within a short period by calculating the dispersion value of R0 interquartile. This may provide better accuracy for the latest R0 value. The second part of the methodology was finding the direct factors that may affect the R0 value. For this purpose, Google community mobility reports were used.Google reports for social distancing are used in this measurement tool. Google has developed a COVID-19 Community Mobility Report for various countries. They abstract data from the length of stay at different locations. The length of stay is a good measurement tool that may partially provide some information on social distancing [15] . Google uses the location services that are available in Android devices. Depending on the products users use and settings they choose, they may provide Google with different types of location information. Location is provided from real-time signals, like the IP address or device location, and also past activity on Google sites and services. This information is collected and calculated by the start time and end time. For instance, if a user stayed 3 h in a shopping center, then Google considers that period the length of stay. This length of stay is compared to previous values recorded before the pandemic. The previous length of stay is known as the baseline. A lower value for the length of stay indicates a tighter lockdown.Google reports included the following locations, retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. All these values were given a percentage of comparison with a baseline of zero. A minus value represents a very low length of stay, which can be interpreted as a lockdown policy. A higher value with a minus sign represents a stricter lockdown. This is true for all locations except residential since residents will stay the longest time at home. Thus, data show a decrease in six attributes and an increase in the residential attribute simultaneously.In addition to the Google specified locations, we added schools as one more location, since they were missing in the Google reports. Google uses mobile location services to prepare these reports, which are not available for school children. The school's data were abstracted from the UNESCO website and given a value of −30 on the closure date and onward. Zero value was assigned to the school opening dates [16] . The dataset was cleaned and prepared, as shown in Table 2 . Data were analyzed based on seven independent variables, as mentioned before, and one dependent class. The dependent class was chosen from the R0 mean values of the interval >Q3. This interval was chosen since it measures the latest periods. The dates chosen were between 15 February 2020 and 4 November 2020, for 98 countries. Table 2 lists sample data for Australia with the dependent and independent attributes. The aim of this dataset is to study the efficiency of social distancing and lockdown measures at any time. The data were classified using various models of Decision Table, Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). RF is a classifier that produces multiple decision trees, using a randomly selected subset of training samples and variables [17] , while KNN assumes that similar things exist in close proximity and are near to each other [18] . In the initial stage of analytics, the dataset was classified for all countries. Two models were used in these analytics, KNN and Random Forest. The data split was conducted by the test mode of 3-fold cross-validation for all datasets. KNN was used for the combination of all independent attribute classifications, while Random Forest was used for individual attribute classifications. Figure 1 Figure 1 shows the correlation coefficient average and the mean absolute error (MAE) for all countries. The MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts without considering their direction. Figure 1 shows a low correlation coefficient and a high MAE for each individual factor, for instance, Retail and Recreation do not have a direct impact on the on Q3, since the correlation coefficient (CC) is around 0.35. It was concluded from Figure 1 that individual factors do not have a direct impact on lockdown efficiency. All independent attributes were found to have between 0.32 and 0.38 correlation values with R0 mean values. The correlation value was higher when combining all independent attributes since it reached up to 0.68. Moreover, the MAE was found to be the least value when a combination of all attributes was chosen. In the second stage of data analytics, we compared several countries. We chose a few countries with very high-level lockdowns with curfews, such as Italy, Jordan, and Indonesia. Then, we compared these countries to countries with fewer restrictions on lockdown procedures. The results showed a large variance in correlation values between countries. Figure 2 illustrates the correlation coefficients and MAE for 13 countries. We only considered the models that provided the highest value of CC and the lowest value of MAE. In all experiments, we ensured that the Relative Absolute Figure 1 that individual factors do not have a direct impact on lockdown efficiency.

The resulting values indicated that some countries had forced the lockdown policy while it is ineffective enough, such as Italy and India. Based on the resulting output from analyzing various countries, lockdown efficiency can be categorized into four main R0 groups, high (A), medium (B), low (C), and very low (D):• R0 Group A: High lockdown efficiency is given by (CC ≥ 80%) • R0 Group B: Medium lockdown efficiency is given by (60% ≤ CC < 80%). • R0 Group C: Low lockdown efficiency is given by (40% ≤ CC < 60%). • R0 Group D: Very low lockdown efficiency is given by (−40% < CC < 40%). As mentioned earlier, there are many factors that may affect the infection and mortality rates. The value of R0 is only one of these factors. Therefore, Figures 2 and 3 show the lockdown policy impact on R0 only for two different periods. Figure 2 shows values up till April, while Figure 3 shows values up till July. Figure 2 shows two countries from group D, Germany and Spain. This may indicate that Germany and Spain are not gaining any productive results out of the lockdown procedures. Figure 3 shows a dramatic increase in group rank. Here, Germany jumped from group D to group B, while Spain jumped from group D to group C. The South Korean government claimed that they did not apply any lockdown procedures. However, referring to the Google report, the lockdown was clearly applied to retail shops and transportation. It seems that the lockdown in South Korea was voluntary, hence, the R0 value dropped from R0 = 0.6 in February to R0 = 0.02 in April. In Figure 3 , South Korea moved from group C to group A. As shown in Figure 2 , India is in group C, though it started a very strict lockdown. Therefore, this may improve the lockdown efficiency in the coming weeks.

Figure 3 illustrates the second result of the Indian lockdown by moving from group C to group B. In Brazil's case, Figures 2 and 3 show that Brazil remained in group B, which does not reflect the real status of the infection rate. This may indicate that Brazil has other factors apart from the Google parameters affecting lockdown efficiency. The Google report shows high lockdown values, yet their infection rate was skyrocketing. Moreover, the R0 value was low since April. This may give some indications about other factors that governments need to consider. Late procedures could be a major reason behind the large outbreak. The United States has a similar case to Brazil since late lockdown procedures intensively contributed to the current outbreak. The high value of MAE may indicate that these seven factors are not the only factors. There might be other unknown factors that have a negative impact on lockdown efficiency. This measurement does not give a direct indication of exponential increase or decrease in the infection numbers. Instead, it only indicates lockdown efficiency.This model aimed to give an approximate value for R0 and to provide some factors that may have direct impacts on R0. However, this model is unable to resolve all the factors that may increase infection and mortality rates during the outbreak; instead, it presents the R0 value and the changes that occur by applying lockdown procedures. The lockdown procedures should reduce the R0 value but not the number of infections because R0 is only one out of many factors that may affect the infection rate. Many factors may increase the infection rate such as R0, late government action, number of ports in land and water, airport access policies, a country's homogeneity or heterogeneity, lifestyle, and others.Moreover, Google reports have limitations in measuring the length of stay due to some technical issues. For instance, many users may disable the location features in their mobile devices, or might not have mobiles supported by Android. Some countries may not have reliable access to the internet. Other users may have less mobility such as elderly people living in geriatric healthcare centers.

Findings from included studies suggest that mono-herbal preparations of S.nigra berry (in extract or lozenge formulation) may reduce influenza-type symptoms, including fever, headache, nasal congestion and nasal mucous discharge in adults, when taken within the first 48 hours of symptom onset. Within 2-4 days of S.nigra treatment, most adult participants experienced significant symptom reduction, by an average of 50%. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of S.nigra berry on the symptom of cough, and need for / use of medicines (including antibiotics) to treat acute respiratory infections, is currently unclear and inconsistent. Adverse events were rare with no serious events reported. Adverse events, reported in two studies, were more common in comparators than in treatments. There is currently no reliable or sufficient scientific evidence to support the use of S.nigra in pregnant or lactating women.The S. nigra plant belongs to the Adoxaceae family, which is indigenous to Europe, Asia and North Africa (1) . Historically, the flower and berry of the Elder plant have been used in herbal preparations for the treatment of common cold and flu (1) . Preclinical studies have shown elderberry extracts to have antimicrobial and antiviral effects, including activity against influenza viruses (2) . These antiviral effects have been attributed to the inhibition of viral replication by S.nigra. Additionally, elderberry extracts have been shown to increase cytokines that activate immunomodulation (3).S.nigra berries contain multiple constituents, including flavonoids, triterpenes, acyl spermidines, αlinolenic acid, linoleic acid (1), mucilage and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (4) . The rich anthocycanin flavonoid content is associated with antioxidant activity (5) . The unripe berries also contain toxic constituents, but these are lost during drying and heating processes; as such, these toxic constituents are not typically present in commercially available preparations (3).Research question Does S.nigra improve outcomes in humans with acute respiratory viral infections?Original prospective intervention studies involving adult participants with acute respiratory viral infections written in English that evaluated the effect of S.nigra (as a mono-or combination therapy) in any form, dose and route of administration. All comparators or controls were included.Studies involving children, or participants with bacterial, fungal or non-infectious respiratory disease and not meeting the inclusion criteria above were excluded from this review.Relevant studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), AMED (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) for articles published from inception to May 2020. One author (KO) scanned the title and abstract of each record retrieved. All articles that appeared to meet the selection criteria were accessed and evaluated in full text. For articles that met the inclusion criteria, two authors (KO and JMC) extracted the relevant population and intervention characteristics into an extraction template, with any disagreements resolved by discussion with AS.Where duplicate papers and papers reporting aspects of the primary study, the authors (JMC and AS) checked the data aligned before removing the secondary paper and the original publication (typically the older paper) was included.The risk of bias of each study was evaluated by KO and JMC, using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool (6) , and checked by AS. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool is comprised of seven domains including; random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. Reviewers designated a judgement related to the risk of bias for each item. 'Yes' indicated a low risk of bias, and 'No' a high risk of bias and 'Unclear' indicating unclear or unknown risk of bias. (see Table 3 ).Data were synthesised in narrative form. Due to the heterogeneity of the data, a meta-analysis was not conducted.The database search identified 40 studies. After the removal of duplicates (n=10), 30 studies were screened by title and abstract. This resulted in the exclusion of 15 studies. The remaining 15 studies were screened as full text. Ten studies were excluded as they reported the wrong study design (n=4), were a systematic review (n=4) or duplicated already included studies (n=2). Five studies were included for full review. The included studies involved a total of 936 participants (minimum 27, maximum 473, mean 187). The study population were primarily adults aged between 18 and 70 years, with two studies also including children aged from 5 years (7) or 12 years (8). The most common conditions studied were influenza (7-9) and influenza-like symptoms (10), followed by common cold (11) .All included studies used a proprietary herbal medicine product as the intervention. Four studies used mono-herbal preparations of S.nigra berry extract (7, (9) (10) (11) . One study used a poly-herbal preparation, which contained S.nigra berry plus Echinacea purpurea root (8) . The preparations were administered orally in the form of a syrup (7, 10), capsules (11), granules (8) or lozenges (9) . Doses ranged from 15mls four times per day (syrup), 3 capsules per day, 175mg lozenge four times per day or 5ml of the poly-herbal formula in 150ml of hot water using an initial dosage of 5 times per day for days 1-3 followed by a maintenance dose of twice per day (days 4-10).The risk of bias assessment for the first domain (randomisation process) resulted in all 5 studies being rated as having a low risk of bias (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . For domain 2 (treatment assignment), two studies were considered to have some concerns (8, 9) , and three studies were rated as having low risk of bias (7, 10, 11) . Under domain 3 (missing outcome data), all five trials were judged as having low risk of bias (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . For domain 4 (measure of outcomes), all five studies were rated as having low risk of bias (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . In domain 5 (selective reporting), all trials were judged to be at low risk of bias (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Overall, two studies were identified as having some concerns (8, 9) and three studies were judged as having J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f low risk of bias (7, 10, 11) . These judgements should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings of this review.Treatment outcomes reported included overall reduction in symptoms; duration of illness/rate of recovery, and the use of rescue medication including analgesics, nasal spray, cold tablets, antibiotics.Four studies (7, (9) (10) (11) ) measured reduction of symptoms; fever reduction (7, (9) (10) (11) and one study (9) also reported reduction of headache, muscle ache, nasal congestion and mucus discharge and cough All studies reported (7-11) a reduction in overall symptom severity among participants receiving S.nigra berry (whether in mono-or poly-herbal formulation) when compared with controls. One study reported that participants receiving treatment reported significant improvement in symptom severity following 48 hours whereas the control group reported increased severity in the same time-period (8).Duration of illness and rate of recovery was reported in four studies (7, 8, 10, 11) . Three studies demonstrated that the duration of illness was almost 50% shorter for those receiving S.nigra berry compared with the control group (7, 10, 11) . In one study, the rate of recovery was similar between a S.nigra polyherbal preparation and an active control (Oseltamivir) (8) .In the two studies (10, 11) reporting the use of rescue medication including analgesics, antibiotics, nasal sprays, or cold tablets to manage participant symptoms, the need for such medication was found to be inconsistent. In one study, participants assigned to S.nigra berry treatment reported using rescue medication to manage influenza-like symptoms less frequently than control participants (10) . By contrast, a second study found no difference between groups in the reported use of rescue medication or prescribed antibiotics among participants with the common cold (11).Adverse events were rare with one study (11) reporting two adverse events (fatigue and cold-like symptoms) attributed to S.nigra berry compared to three (itchy throat, fatigue and kidney pain) attributed to placebo. A second study (8) Overall, the evidence obtained from the five studies included in this review involving 936 people suggests that mono-herbal preparations of S.nigra berry when taken close to the onset of symptoms and for up to two weeks, may assist in relieving the symptoms of the common cold and influenza.S.nigra berry may be effective in reducing the duration and severity of fever, headache, nasal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f congestion and nasal mucous discharge when associated with an acute viral respiratory infection.Some evidence suggests that S.nigra berry may relieve cough or help prevent the worsening of cough when attributed to such viral infections however this finding is inconsistent across studies. As the formulation, dose and duration of S.nigra berry treatment varied between studies, general recommendations regarding these clinically important factors cannot be made.

An effective public health response to the current pandemic will require any vaccine 46 to be supplemented by other alternative preventive modalities. 47 SARS-CoV-2 receptors and coreceptors have been shown to be highly expressed in nasal 48 epithelial cells (Sungnak et al., 2020) . This finding is consistent with the virus infectivity or 49 replication pattern along the respiratory tract, which peaks proximally (nasal cavity) and is 50 relatively minimal in the distal alveolar regions (Hou et al., 2020) . These findings suggest that 51 nasal carriage of the virus could be a key feature of transmission, and that nasally administered 52 therapeutic modalities could be potentially effective in helping to prevent spread of infection. The current studies were conducted to assess the antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium against 69 SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, to determine if it has potential as a reformulated, nasally administered or 70 inhaled antiviral agent to help prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Astodrimer sodium was prepared as 86.29 mg/mL in water and stored at 4°C.

SARS-CoV-107 2 was mixed with diluted astodrimer sodium at a MOI of 0.05 and incubated for 1 hour at 108 37°C in 5% CO2. Virus and compound mixture were added to Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-109 well plates and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 days. On day 4, the virus-induced CPE was 110 measured by the MTT assay as described above.

The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is currently the recommended approach to the diagnosis of GDM in the UK and internationally [2, 3] . Early in 2020, a novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, reached pandemic levels of worldwide infection [4] . In the UK, pregnant women have been advised to remain in self-isolation for at least 12 weeks except for essential excursions for food, healthcare and health reasons (including outdoor daily exercise), with similar restrictions internationally. This, alongside public transport limitations, especially during peak hours, social distancing and laboratory requirements, has made it challenging for healthcare providers to implement routine OGTTs. Furthermore, with staff shortages due to self-isolation, illness or redeployment, the clinical capacity for managing large numbers of pregnant women with milder forms of hyperglycaemia has been reduced. An alternative approach to screening for severe forms of maternal hyperglycaemia during the COVID-19 pandemic was required for urgent implementation [5] . The intention was not aimed at identifying an equivalent group of women as those detected by OGTT, but rather to identify pregnant women with the highest glucose levels for whom specialist management remained essential throughout the pandemic. The alternative strategy recommends glucose testing during other hospital or community appointments to minimize additional clinical contacts [5] .The OGTT has well recognized limitations in terms of test reproducibility, tolerability and seasonal influences [6, 7] , but remains the most commonly recommended diagnostic strategy for GDM [2, 3] .Excess fetal growth acceleration is detectable from 20 weeks' gestation, predating diagnosis of GDM [8] . However, approximately half of women with identified risk factors for GDM, do not have an OGTT performed in routine care settings. Importantly, among women with stillbirths, an OGTT was only performed in 38% of women with GDM risk factors [9] . A nationwide UK audit confirmed that OGTT testing was least likely to be performed in obese women and those from higher-risk ethnicThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved groups [10] . Although some women may refuse OGTT testing, it is clear that screening for GDM is not consistently implemented in accordance with guideline recommendations [6, 10] .A recent case-control study identified a 44% greater risk of stillbirth in women with risk factors when an OGTT was not performed [9] . Likewise, women with raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels who were not diagnosed with GDM experienced a fourfold greater risk of stillbirth [9] . Women who were appropriately screened and treated had no increased risk of stillbirth [9] . This failure to effectively implement OGTT in routine clinical care settings even prior to the pandemic leaves women exposed to potentially modifiable risks for stillbirth.Relatively little research has focused on identifying a suitable alternative to the OGTT. Some novel technologies and biomarkers show promise in small studies, but do not have proven diagnostic performance or wide availability. Performing an OGTT at home or replacing it with glucometer or continuous glucose monitoring readings was not feasible for widespread implementation during the pandemic.The interim testing strategy for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy aimed to: (1) identify women with the most severe hyperglycaemia for prioritization of resources towards those at highest risk of suboptimal obstetric and neonatal outcomes; (2) fit around women's routine antenatal visits at 12, 20 and 28 weeks (for blood tests or ultrasound scans), avoiding additional visits to healthcare environments; (3) use established laboratory methods with good analytical performance and wide availability; (4) avoid increasing clinical workload during staff shortage (prioritizing test specificity over sensitivity); (5) be simple to understand (by non-specialists) and easy to rapidly implement across healthcare environments; and (6) use an existing evidence base to support it and to enable audit after the pandemic.Several diagnostic strategies for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy have been suggested for use during the COVID-19 pandemic ( Table 1 ). The UK approach advises measuring HbA1c and random plasma glucose in all women with risk factors for GDM (previous GDM, BMI >30 kg/m 2 , high-risk ethnicThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved groups, family history of diabetes, previous macrosomic baby >4.5 kg) at the first antenatal visit (Table 4) . Women with HbA1c levels ≥48 mmol/mol or random plasma glucose levels ≥11.1 mmol/l are managed as having pre-gestational, most commonly type 2 diabetes. Women with HbA1c levels 41-47 mmol/mol or random plasma glucose levels 9-11.0 mmol/l are managed as having early-onset GDM. Women with HbA1c <41 mmol/mol and random plasma glucose <9 mmol/l are retested at 28 weeks, with a repeat HbA1c and FPG (if possible) or random plasma glucose performed. Women with FPG ≥5.6 mmol/l, HbA1c ≥39 mmol/mol or random plasma glucose ≥9 mmol/l are managed as having GDM. The pandemic testing procedures do not exclude GDM and further testing should be performed, at any gestational age, in women with glycosuria, symptoms of diabetes, or ultrasound features of LGA infant or polyhydramnios [5] . Similar strategies were recommended in Australia, Canada and New Zealand (Table 1) [11] [12] [13] .The aim of the present study was to provide evidence-based recommendations for a pragmatic diagnostic strategy for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy, applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic.Data from complete and ongoing studies ( Table 2 ; methodology and patient characteristics) were used to assess diagnostic performance of potential glucose measures including HbA1c, random plasma glucose, FPG and 1-h and 2-h plasma glucose after a 75-g OGTT performed in a real-world clinical setting.Gestational diabetes diagnosis was classified according to the criteria of the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; 0 min ≥5.6 mmol/l; 120 min ≥7.8 mmol/l) [3] and the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), adopted by the WHO (IADPSG/WHO; 0 min ≥5.1; 60 min >10.0; 120 min ≥8.5 mmol/l) [2] .Older (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) and more recent data (2014-2019) from approved service evaluations at Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (CUHFT) used for this study have been previously described [14, 15] . In brief, the older cohort includes 17 736 consecutive women with singleton pregnancies, with random plasma glucose performed at booking followed by a universal 50-This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved g glucose challenge test at 24 weeks. Women with a 50-g glucose challenge result of >7.7 mmol/l had a 75-g OGTT at 28 weeks' gestation (n = 3848) and were offered treatment (776/17 736; 4.4%) in line with NICE guidance [16] . A minority (<5%) had an OGTT using capillary rather than venous blood.The more recent cohort included 826 consecutive women with GDM (risk factor screening; 75-g OGTT 24-28 weeks using IADPSG/WHO criteria, 20 October 2014 to 31 January 2019), who received standard clinical management. Detailed information on pregnancy outcomes was gathered from electronic medical records as part of an ongoing service evaluation [14] .In addition, data were included from 361 women with one or more risk factors for GDM [3] , recruited from an ongoing multicentre prospective study, OPHELIA (Observational study of Pregnancy Hyperglycaemia, Endocrine causes, Lipids, Insulin and Autoimmunity; REC 18/LO/0477; researchregistry no.5528). Briefly, women with a singleton pregnancy and one or more GDM risk factors [3] were invited for a 24-28-week 75-g OGTT with measurement of HbA1c. A total of 8.3% of women had GDM (NICE criteria) and were offered treatment. Pregnancy outcome data from this ongoing study are not available.Assessment of neonatal outcomes was performed using the older and recent CUHFT datasets. We chose outcomes which are directly related to hyperglycaemia, are consistently measured during GDM pregnancies, are potentially modifiable by standard clinical management [1, 17] , and which have a defined impact on healthcare costs [3] .Large for gestational age was defined as having a birth weight >90 th centile using locally derived standardized centiles adjusted for infant sex and gestational age [7] . Neonatal hypoglycaemia was defined as a capillary blood glucose level <2.6 mmol/l on more than one occasion at least 4 h after birth. Admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was defined as admission for 24 h or longer.The ability of each glucose-related variable to predict GDM diagnosis was assessed using receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curves. Unadjusted logistic regression identified associations betweenThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved glucose measures and pregnancy outcomes (odds ratios and 95% CIs reported). Missing data were not imputed. A statistical significance level of 5% was used throughout.The OPHELIA study was approved by the London and Westminster research ethics committee (REC 18/LO/0477; research registry no.5528). The CUHFT data were collected as part of approved service evaluations. Further ethical approval was not required for this analysis.All glucose measures were significantly associated with GDM diagnosis on ROC curves (Table 3 and Table 3) .The sensitivity and specificity of thresholds for random plasma glucose, HbA1c and FPG to predict GDM using NICE or IADPSG diagnostic criteria are given in Table 4 . For example, to identify a similar proportion of women as detected by the NICE criteria (~5%) would require a 12-week random plasma glucose of ≥8.5 mmol/l (42% sensitivity, 96% specificity; older CUHFT cohort), a 28-week HbA1c of ≥39 mmol/mol (26% sensitivity, 96% specificity; OPHELIA); or an FPG of ≥5. 2-5.4 mmol/l (sensitivity 18-41%, specificity 97-98%; OPHELIA or older CUHFT).This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedFasting plasma glucose at 28 weeks was the best predictor of diabetes in pregnancy [AUROC 0.9 (95% CI 0.86-0.95); older CUHFT), with a specificity of >90% and sensitivity of 50-70% at thresholds of ≥5.2 mmol/l (Table S1 ). Unfortunately, the number of women with HbA1c >48 mmol/mol was not available and the number with IADPSG-defined 'overt diabetes' was too small (n = 19) to draw any conclusions.There are limited data available to support a change in diagnostic criteria for GDM in a real-world clinical setting. Despite this, our results provide some evidence regarding the use of routine antenatal blood tests, random plasma glucose at 12 weeks' gestation and HbA1c or FPG at 28 weeks' gestation for diagnosing hyperglycaemia in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic [5] . These established, affordable, widely available laboratory tests have reasonable ability to predict diagnosis of GDM and to identify women at highest risk of suboptimal glycaemic, obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Although the sensitivity of these measures is substantially lower than that of the OGTT, the specificity is sufficient to allow targeted assessment of women at highest risk.Despite differences between the universal and selective risk factor screening procedures and patient characteristics, the results show consistent associations between routine antenatal glucose measures, GDM diagnosis and clinically relevant obstetric and neonatal outcomes (Caesarean delivery, LGA infant, neonatal hypoglycaemia, neonatal intensive care unit admission). However, the women included in the present study were not blinded to their diagnosis, had GDM diagnosed using different screening pathways and diagnostic criteria, and had no measures of glycaemic control later in pregnancy. The treatment of patients within these clinical datasets will not affect diagnostic predictions but may have reduced associations with maternal or neonatal outcomes. The use of unadjusted regression reflects clinical decision-making; adjusted odds ratios may show different associations. In addition, these datasets do not have sufficient ethnic diversity to fully represent national or international populations, with more women belonging to higher-risk ethnic groups. TheThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved older CUHFT dataset is large but not all women underwent an OGTT to exclude GDM and none of the datasets used universal screening for GDM with an OGTT at 28 weeks. These results reflect test performance in high-risk cohorts. The OPHELIA study reflects a high-risk cohort, chosen according to risk factors [3] (UK approach), while the older CUH cohort reflects a high-risk cohort chosen from a two-step strategy (used widely in USA) [5] . Although these results are not directly comparable to assessments of test performance in an unselected population, they are comparable to current clinical practice internationally. Although preventing stillbirth is a priority during the pandemic, as this outcome is so rare, the datasets provide insufficient data to allow this outcome to be assessed accurately.Compared to an OGTT, random plasma glucose, HbA1c and FPG assessments have less evidence to support their use in the diagnosis of GDM. The ability of a first-trimester OGTT to predict pregnancy outcomes is also unclear. However, random plasma glucose performs surprisingly well as a firsttrimester predictive tool for later GDM diagnosis [15] . An early-pregnancy random plasma glucose also has consistent associations with Caesarean section, LGA infant, and neonatal intensive care unit admission, but the small odds ratios suggest that random plasma glucose alone lacks precision as a prognostic tool. The performance of and optimal thresholds for random plasma glucose in late pregnancy are unknown. Random plasma glucose was included pragmatically, alongside routine bloods, to minimize the logistical challenges associated with obtaining multiple early-morning fasted samples within a short timeframe.Fasting plasma glucose assessment, when performed as part of an OGTT at 24-28 weeks' gestation, has strong associations with the pregnancy outcomes attributed to fetal hyperinsulinism including primary Caesarean delivery, LGA infant and neonatal hypoglycaemia [18] . The necessity of having a test in the fasting state, and therefore in the morning, is associated with non-attendance [6]. This was pertinent during the pandemic peak, when having all women attend during a small, timeframe was logistically difficult, and challenging for women without private transport.

All rights reserved influences uptake of the OGTT, especially among socially disadvantaged women in real-world clinical settings [6] Unfortunately, although included in the UK, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand recommendations [5, [11] [12] [13] to detect overt and/or pre-gestational diabetes, we did not have data for HbA1c in early pregnancy. Hughes et al. [19] previously demonstrated that an early-pregnancy HbA1c ≥ 41 mmol/mol (5.9%) was predictive for diabetes and for identifying mothers and offspring at risk of complications [19] . In the present study, we found that HbA1c ≥39 mmol/mol (5.7%) at 28 weeks' gestation had good specificity (96%) and identified approximately 5% of women who were screened, a comparable number to those identified using the NICE or IADPSG criteria [3, 4] . Outside pregnancy, HbA1c is widely used both for diabetes diagnosis and glycaemic monitoring, and is highly predictive of diabetes complications [20, 21] . However, accuracy is reliant on stable red cell turnover and the absence of haematological disease, iron deficiency or inherited haemoglobin variants [21, 22] .In early pregnancy, red cell turnover increases, contributing to the well-recognized non-glycaemic reduction in HbA1c in the late first/early second trimesters [21] . HbA1c is therefore a poor marker for individual glycaemia, but remains important for predicting obstetric and neonatal outcomes including preterm delivery, LGA infant and neonatal intensive care unit admission [23] . The proposed screening strategy includes an early HbA1c measurement to exclude overt diabetes and a 28-week measurement for pragmatic reasons, with interpretation in conjunction with another glucose measure, either FPG or random plasma glucose.Although the OGTT is the most widely used test for GDM diagnosis, this recommendation is largely based on research data with optimal pre-analytical processing and analytical performance within specialist laboratory settings [30] . The OGTT has poor reproducibility in real-world clinical settings [24] . Non-pregnant individuals having two OGTTs within 1 week receive the same diagnosis of diabetes, prediabetes, or normal glucose tolerance on 27-80% of occasions [25] . FPG values can vary by 10-30% in adults with normal glucose tolerance [25] . The intra-individual variation in OGTT glucose is predominantly determined by biological variation in normoglycaemic adults, with 95% ofThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved the test-retest variability of <15% for FPG and <46% for 2-h post OGTT glucose [26] . The diagnostic performance of an OGTT is pertinent during pregnancy, where substantial variability was described by O'Sullivan et al. [27] more than 50 years ago. More recently, seasonal differences in OGTT performance have been highlighted: higher ambient temperatures may increase GDM diagnosis by ~30% in the UK summer [7] . Pre-analytical processing is also critical: a recent Australian study reported that early centrifugation (<10 min) was associated with almost a doubling in GDM diagnoses [24] .A Canadian study found that almost 50% of women with GDM diagnosed using an OGTT were normoglycaemic using capillary glucose monitoring in daily life, emphasizing concerns about sensitivity [28] . Continuous glucose monitoring reflects fetal exposure to maternal glycaemia during the 24-h day, providing substantially more detailed glucose measurements compared to an OGTT or capillary glucose monitoring. Preliminary data have identified the continuous glucose monitoring glucose profiles associated with LGA infants in women with GDM, although further research is needed to determine the feasibility and performance of continuous glucose monitoring for GDM diagnosis [29] .Despite its limitations, the OGTT has a strong evidence base in the diagnosis of GDM [18]. The Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study demonstrated consistent linear associations between maternal glucose concentrations during an OGTT with pregnancy outcomes [18] . Furthermore, the OGTT identifies women who gain demonstrable benefit from standard clinical management, with reductions in adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with more severe hyperglycaemia and improvements in maternal infant metabolic outcomes in women with 'milder' GDM confirmed by high-quality randomized controlled trial data [1] .The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a review of procedures for the screening and diagnosis of hyperglycaemia during pregnancy. Stacey et al. [9] have demonstrated no increase in stillbirth for women who are appropriately screened by OGTT and treated, but screening procedures are variably implemented and many high-risk women are not screened. The HAPO follow-up study highlights theThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved longer-term impact of antenatal hyperglycaemia on the risks of overweight, obesity and diabetes in both mother and child [30] . Women who are appropriately screened and managed for GDM can now have pregnancy outcomes comparable to the background maternity population, but we lack contemporary data on their progression to type 2 diabetes and/or the longer-term cardio-metabolic outcomes. After the pandemic, larger population-based studies should seek to evaluate whether the compliance benefits of having opportunistic tests such as HbA1c and random plasma glucose performed in routine antenatal care settings can reduce the risks of perinatal death, especially among women in socially disadvantaged and higher-risk ethnic groups. Various diagnostic thresholds at booking and at 28 weeks should be examined (separately and in combination) in relation to pregnancy outcomes alongside longer-term cardio-metabolic follow-up programmes for women with treated GDM and their offspring.In conclusion, the proposed changes to testing for hyperglycaemia during pregnancy facilitate identification of women at highest risk during the COVID-19 pandemic peak, but should not be adopted long-term. Future work should aim to identify pragmatic, evidence-based alternatives to the OGTT, document the risks and benefits of opportunistic glycaemic testing in women from marginalized patient populations, and address longer-term maternal and childhood cardio-metabolic health outcomes.No specific funding was required for this study.

Seven duplicates were removed leaving 633 citations to be screened. After title and abstract reviews, 91 citations were left with 76 citations further excluded as they didn't meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria [wrong patient population = 48, wrong study design = 13, wrong intervention = 7, paediatric population = 6, wrong comparator = 1 and wrong outcome = 1]. The remaining 13 articles were included in this rapid review.All but two studies were identified as randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The two non-RCTs comprised of a case report [1] and a controlled clinical trial [2] . Eight of the 13 (61.5%) included trials were placebo-controlled [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , and 6/13 (46.1%) were double-blinded [3, 5-7, 9, 10] .Studies were conducted across five of six World Health Organisation (WHO) regions, with most undertaken in the European region (6/13 [46.2%] [4, 6, 7, [10] [11] [12] ), followed by the Eastern Mediterranean (3/13 [23.0%]; [2, 8, 9] ), Americas (2/13 [15.4%]; [3, 5] ), South East Asia (1/13 [7.7%];[1]) and Western Pacific (1/13 [7.7%]; [13] ) regions. All studies were conducted in a hospital setting, and all but two [1, 13] were reportedly undertaken in an intensive care unit.The 13 included studies comprised a total pool of 1,337 subjects, with study sample sizes ranging from 1 to 842 (median 42). All subjects had an acute respiratory condition, with diagnoses including ALI/ARDS (7/13 [53.9%]; [2-4, 6-8, 10] ) or pneumonia (2/13 [15.4%] ; [1, 13] ). Four studies (30.8%) did not define the respiratory disorder [5, 9, 11, 12] .N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) was predominantly administered intravenously (10/13 [76.9%] ; 40-480 mg/kg/day or 400 mg TDS via intravenous infusion; [1-8, 10, 11] ), and to a lesser extent, as an oral tablet (2/13 [15.4%]; 600 mg BD; [9, 13] ) or via nebuliser (1/13 [7.7%]; 300 mg QID or on demand; [12] ). Control interventions included 5% dextrose in water (3/13 [23.1%] ; [3, 8, 11] ), saline (2/13 [15.4%]; [4, 7] ), water-soluble vitamin tablets (1/13 [7.7%]; [9] ), conventional treatment only (1/13 [7.7%] ; [13] ), and non-specified placebo (3/13 [23.1%] ; [5, 6, 10] ). The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 28 days, with a median period of 3 days.In the first Domain (randomisation process), two studies were rated as high risk of bias [1, 4] with all other studies rated as low. For Domain 2 (treatment assignment), one trial was identified as high risk of bias [6] , with seven trials rated as low [2-5, 9, 12] . Under Domain 3 (missing outcome data), two trials were considered to have high risk of bias [6, 7] , with eight trials rated as low [3-5, 8, 10, 12, 13] .For Domain 4 (measure of outcomes), all trials were rated as low risk of bias, except Lai et al. [1] , which was assessed as having some concerns. In Domain 5 (selective reporting), one trial [11] was identified as high risk of bias, with the remaining trials rated as having some concerns or low risk of bias. Overall, five studies were judged as having high risk of bias [1, 4, 6, 7, 11] , six rated as having some concerns [2, 5, [8] [9] [10] 13] and two judged as low risk of bias [3, 12] . These judgements should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings of this review.The 13 included studies reported on nine broad outcomes: markers of inflammation and oxidation, changes in CT or x-ray images, patient length of stay, mortality rate, pulmonary complications, ventilation-related issues, recovery rate, clinical improvement and adverse events.Four RCTs [3, 7, 11, 13] reported changes in markers of inflammation or oxidation. These studies reported significant improvements in GSH, tumour necrosis factor -α (TNF-α), malondialdehyde, total thioles, lipoperoxidation, total antioxidant power and polymorphonuclear cell activity following NAC administration when compared to controls. These findings were consistent with those reported in the two non-RCTs [1, 2]). No differences between groups were reported for superoxide dismutase and elastase.Changes in CT or x-ray images were measured in two RCTs [6, 13] . Both studies found no differences in this outcome between NAC and control.Three RCTs [5, 9, 12] assessed patient length of stay. Although one RCT [9] reported a significant reduction in ICU and hospital length of stay in the NAC group versus control, two studies [5, 12] found no differences between groups in patient length of stay.Mortality rate was measured in six RCTs [3-5, 8, 10, 12] . Four studies [3, 5, 10, 12] reported no differences in mortality rates between NAC and control. The remaining studies reported conflicting results, with one RCT [8] revealing a reduction in the rate of mortality following NAC administration (relative to control), and the other RCT [4] reporting an increase in mortality rate with NAC administration.Three RCTs [9, 10, 12] examined the efficacy of NAC in preventing pulmonary complications. When compared to control, NAC administration was associated with a significant reduction in ventilatorassociated pneumonia and time to ventilator-associated pneumonia in 1 RCT [9] . However, in two RCTs [10, 12] , no difference was found between groups in the prevalence of pulmonary complications.Ventilation-related issues were reported as an outcome in four RCTs [4, 5, 8, 10] . NAC administration was associated with improvements in systemic oxygenation in two [8, 10] of 3 RCTs, and a reduction in the need for / duration of ventilation in two [5, 10] of three RCTs.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Four RCTs [3, 6, 9, 11] and one case report [1] examined recovery rate following NAC administration.All but one study [6] reported a significant improvement in the rate of recovery from an acute respiratory condition with NAC administration when compared with control.Clinical improvement was assessed in one controlled clinical trial [2] . The authors indicated that NAC administration was associated with an improvement in Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score -a measure of clinical improvement and a predictor of mortality risk.Adverse event monitoring was reported in three RCTs [6, 9, 13] . Two studies [9, 13] reported no adverse events with NAC administration, and 1 [6] reported a rash during the administration of a loading dose of NAC.From the evidence identified in this review, it is recommended that NAC could be used for people who have contracted Covid-19. At early stages of the disease, health practitioners could recommend oral NAC [600 mg BD] to assist in reducing respiratory mucus and inflammation, increasing systemic GSH levels and possibly averting hospital admission. As only three trials assessed the oral administration of NAC, and there were some concerns with the risk of bias of these studies, these suggestions need to be considered with caution until conclusive evidence becomes available. If health professionals have access and ability to administer NAC via nebuliser or IV, the review findings suggest that doses of NAC ranging from 40-480 mg/kg/day for at least 3 days may be suitable for patients who are deteriorating. Again, as two of the ten studies on IV administration of NAC were rated as high risk of bias, patients who are administered NAC intravenously need to be monitored closely.Health practitioners are advised that these recommendations should complement, and not replace, standard medical care, and if required, the patient is recommended to obtain emergency care where needed.

The current wave of digital disruption 2 has been caused by the development of mobile phones (that are really computers), resource sharing services such as Uber and airbnb and social media communications platforms that are centrally managed (but socially distributed) like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Unfortunately, our IS development trajectory also now sees us https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102201 in a time of post-truth 3 , fake news 4 and an 'infodemic' 5 which have wreaked digital destruction and havoc on our shared mental models 6 of what we understand to be real and true i.e. shared situational awareness 7 . It is becoming increasingly difficult to agree on what information represents the reality and truth about crisis events within the echo chamber of social media and the opaque algorithmic biases which underpin platform providers, search engines and data aggregators (Bunker, Stieglitz, Ehnis, & Sleigh, 2019; Himelboim, Smith, Rainie, Shneiderman, & Espina, 2017; Noble, 2018; Sismondo, 2017) . Fig. 1 shows the current level of concern with fake news about the COVID-19 epidemic from a survey conducted in Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, S. Korea, U.K. and U.S. (Edelman Trust Barometer, 2020) . This survey highlights that 67 % of respondents worry that there is a lot of fake news being spread about COVID-19 while 49 % of respondents are having difficulty finding trustworthy and reliable information.If these levels of concern are reflected in the global population at large, then managing an adequate pandemic response through shared situational awareness becomes an impossible task.While profiling is not a new approach to the treatment of data, communications and service platform providers and data aggregators have found new ways of combining the techniques of individual user profiling (IUP), data analytics (DA) and artificial intelligence (AI) to monetize 8 the vast amounts of data that have been increasingly generated by their users (Liozu & Ulaga, 2018) .IUP, DA and AI are applied to better understand, influence or manipulate an individual's opinions and social, political and economic behavior through 'nudging' mechanisms (Lanzing, 2019) . This approach to profiling is a powerful tool (Zuboff, 2019) which is used to exploit the individual, their decisions and behavior for financial gain, but which does not effectively address issues of critical and optimal decision making and behavior for societal and group benefit e.g. pandemic management. This is due to the creation of mental model dissonance through the misinformation and rumors that are produced and propagated by this approach.For example, in the current COVID-19 pandemic, in order to stop the spread of the virus, health agencies across the globe are urging us to stay socially distant, wash our hands at every opportunity, wear masks (when necessary), and get tested if we develop symptoms. Unfortunately, rumors propagated on social media platforms quite often reinforce multiple and conflicting mental models of virus conspiracies, 'quack treatments' and inaccurate information regarding government motivations for lockdowns. This can severely hamper crisis management efforts.Some examples 9 of misinformation propagated during the current pandemic include: Dissonant mental models are reinforced by recommender algorithms (Lanzing, 2019 ), bots (McKenna, 2020 and trusted individual platform users or influencers (Enke & Borchers, 2019) resulting in alarming levels of digital destruction which is turn undermines social cohesion and creates a barrier to shared situational awareness and effective crisis response.We therefore see a tension and conflict arising from: 1) the need for alignment of mental models and shared situational awareness to support effective crisis management; and 2) the developments of digital disruption, destruction and the facilitation and reinforcement of dissonant mental models through post truth perspectives and conflicting situational awareness.Shared situational awareness is developed through the alignment of our mental models to represent a shared version of truth and reality on which we can act. This is an important basis for effective information sharing and decision making in crisis response (Salas, Stout, and Cannon-Bowers et al., 1994) . Aligned mental models help us to agree about the authenticity, accuracy, timeliness, relevance and importance of the information being communicated and give concurrence, weight and urgency to decisions and advice. Harrald and Jefferson (2007) highlight that shared situational awareness implies that ""(1) technology can provide adequate information to enable decision makers in a geographically distributed environment to act as though they were receiving and perceiving the same information, (2) common methods are available to integrate, structure, and understand the information, and (3) critical decision nodes share institutional, cultural, and experiential bases for imputing meaning to this knowledge"" (page 3).We know that most crisis management agencies have established, agreed, authenticated and qualified mental models on which they base their internal operational command and control systems. This gives them assurance and governance of the information they produce (Bunker, Levine, & Woody, 2015) and qualifies their decisions and recommended actions to manage crisis situations. It also engenders public trust in these agencies, to provide relevant and critical crisis information and advice for public action. Fig. 2 highlights the current high and increasing levels of trust in government institutions during the COVID-3 ""…That truth has been individualized or that individuals have become, to borrow a turn of phrase from Foucault, the primary and principal points of the production, application, and adjudication of truth is one important point. That emotion and personal belief are able now to outflank even objective facts and scientific knowledge is another (the claim that literature, for example, has truths to tell has long fallen on deaf ears). Their articulation is decisive: with the regime's inflection, even inflation, of the indefinitely pluralized and individualized enunciative I who, by virtue of strong feeling, is able at any moment not only to recognize or know but, also, to tell or speak the truth, truth is privatized and immanitized, its universal and transcendental dimensions nullified altogether. Hence, what is true for any one person need not be true for everyone or anyone else; what is true for anyone now need not necessarily be true later"" (Biesecker, 2018pp 331-332) . 4 We posit that fake news is, in essence, a two-dimensional phenomenon of public communication: there is the (1) fake news genre, describing the deliberate creation of pseudojournalistic disinformation, and there is the (2) fake news label, describing the political instrumentalization of the term to delegitimize news media "" (Egelhofer & Lecheler, 2019page 97) ."" 5 ""an over-abundance of informationsome accurate and some notthat makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it."" (WHO, 2020) 6 ""A concentrated, personally constructed, internal conception, of external phenomena (historical, existing or projected), or experience, that affects how a person acts"" (Rook, 2013 )page 47. 7 ""refers to the degree of accuracy by which one's perception of his current environment mirrors reality."" (Naval Aviation Schools Command (032) 19 pandemic (Edelman Trust Barometer, 2020). When digital destruction produces mental model dissonance shared situational awareness between crisis management agencies and the general public becomes impossible to maintain and communicate (both to and from) due to inconsistencies in what constitutes reality and truth, making crisis response unmanageable.Centrally managed communications and service providers and data aggregators treat your personal data as a commodity/resource which they are generally entitled to use as they wish, however, they largely ignore the deeper understanding of the mental models on which data is produced by any one system (Bunker, 2001) . ""In the social sciences, in particular, big data can blend wide-scale and finer-grained analytic approaches by providing information about individual behaviour within and across contexts"" (Tonidandel, King, & Cortina, 2018)page 531.Data science harnesses the belief that data created by an individual using different applications or platforms, can be seamlessly combined then analyzed using sophisticated data analytics and AI. Conversely, this belief has also fundamentally changed the way that all individuals view and interact with data and information in their daily lives. For instance, our trust in the Google Maps application on our phone to tell us exactly where we are at any given moment, extends to the belief that all information coming to us via our mobile phones and the applications we choose to use, must be some version of reality or the truth. We selfselect our filters (applications and services) for engagement with the wider world and our reliance on mobile technology and applications to navigate the world is now at an all-time high i.e. 3.5 Billion or 45.04 % of the global population. 10 If we are a social media platform user, however, we can be bombarded with paid advertising or 'nudged' by recommender algorithms to make contact with other platform users, information sites and products and services that are deemed to be relevant to us and part of our 'shared reality' (Echterhoff, Higgins, & Levine, 2009 ). Nudging performs three functions : meeting platform user 1) epistemic; and 2) relational needs; and 3) adding to the platform owner's profitability'. For instance, the platform user is directed to people, products, information and communities of interest that help them to ""achieve a valid and reliable understanding of the world"" (Levine, 2018) -pg 54; this then fulfills their ""desire to affiliate with and feel connected to others"" (Levine, 2018) -pg 54; and ; platform owners and managers (and their influential users) then make lots of money selling targeted advertising by directing platform users in this way.This might be a desirable situation when sharing situational awareness within a social media platform community of interest where mental models align, but when combined with platform characteristics like user anonymity and lack of information assurance, then treating a social media platform as a trusted information source for shared situational awareness becomes problematic.For example, social media platform users can be a valuable source of eyewitness information for crisis management agencies to enhance the production of shared situational awareness for crisis decision making. Social media information when generated in large volumes in a crisis, however, is difficult to process. The source of the information can take time to identify and authenticate and the information provided by them can be a problem to verify, validate, analyze and systematize. This produces a general lack of trust by crisis management agencies and other social media users, in the crisis information produced on social media platforms. This can have catastrophic consequences for shared situational awareness through failure to detect and use important and relevant information or through the belief in, and the propagation of, mis-information produced on these platforms (Bui, 2019, Ehnis and which can also impact and undermine social benefit and cultural cohesion in times of crisis (Kopp, 2020) .We are currently living in an era of digital disruption which provides many economic and social benefits, but we must also be able to support crisis management based on shared situational awareness. Post truth perspectives, fake news and the resulting infodemic has resulted in wide ranging digital destruction and the enablement and encouragement of mental model dissonance. How can we best address this problem?Seppanen, Makela, Luokkala, and Virrantaus (2013) have outlined the connection characteristics of shared situational awareness in an actor network. Fig. 3 highlights the configuration of the connection which includes three requirements: 1) informationto bridge the information gap through the identification of key information elements; 2) communicationto understand the fluency of how actors communicate through describing this communication in detail; and 3) trustto analyse the role of trust on the quality and fluency of communication.They reason that ""if trust could be increased the availability, reliability, and temporal accuracy of information could be improved"". Recent research conducted on the use of social media platforms for crisis communication purposes, so far concludes that: 1) trusted agencies have an early mover information advantage in crisis communication on social media platforms such as Twitter (Mirbabaie, Bunker, Stieglitz, Marx, & Ehnis, 2020) ; 2) information communicated by trusted agencies can be amplified and intensified by influential social media users and others to ""communicate, self-organize, manage, and mitigate risks (crisis communications) but also to make sense of the event (commentary-related communications)"", for example through retweets on Twitter (Stieglitz, Bunker, Mirbabaie, & Ehnis, 2018); 3) trusted agencies and the information they supply is influential in shaping the human response to crisis situations (Mirbabaie, Bunker, Stieglitz, & Deubel, 2019) ; 4) trusted agencies find processing the high volumes of information communicated through social media platforms problematic due to the difficulty in authenticating the information source (user) and establishing the accuracy, timeliness and relevance of the information itself ; and 5) there are a number of tensions which emerge in the use of social media as a crisis communications channel between trusted agencies and the general public. These tensions occur in the areas of: information, generation and use i.e. managing the message; emergence and management of digital and spontaneous volunteers; management of community expectations; mental models which underpin prevention, preparation, recovery and response protocols (PPRR); and management of the development of the large-scale adoption of social media technologies for crisis communications (Elbanna, Bunker, Levine, & Sleigh, 2019) .This knowledge points us to a number of areas of research focus in IS for the future development of data analytics and artificial intelligence to more effectively align mental models for shared situational awareness. These should:• Build on the trust in government and their crisis management agencies, as well as other influential actors in crisis management communications, to provide and amplify advice and information as early as possible in a crisis;• Build frameworks that create algorithmic transparency, information governance and quality assurance for platform and service providers and data aggregators to create and reinforce trust in them as information sources i.e. so they become trusted actors in the communications network;• Address how platform and service developers and government communication system developers can share concepts and build systems that address crisis communication requirements, including those used in IUP, DS and AI; and• Address government failures to provide robust IS services, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent impacts this has had on trust in government and their systems for tracking and tracing infections (Chakravorti, 2020) .These areas of focus are important given the negative impacts that are already emerging from the use of AI during the COVID-19 pandemic i.e. varying levels of data quality and comprehensiveness, development of COVID-19 treatments based on the use of this variable data, use of social control and surveillance methods to minimize virus spread (Smith & Rustagi, 2020 , Naughton, 2020b .It is time to critically analyze and evaluate how centrally managed platforms, their data and systems algorithms are being used during the COVID-19 pandemic (and other crises) by the companies who own and run them. How are they using the information they collect i.e. development of services, influencing users, creation of profits etc., (how) are they limiting the spread of post truth arguments and fake news/information and are they exacerbating or assisting with the management of crises? Some platform owners (YouTube, Twitter, WhatsApp) are currently making efforts to be more transparent in their platform operations, data governance and quality assurance (Hern, 2020; Naughton, 2020a) . There have also been growing calls from critics for regulation of these companies and their business practices (Lewis, 2020) .There is a long way to go, however, to address the problems, issues and barriers caused by these companies for the production of shared situational awareness to support crisis management. For instance, the Latvian government wanted to access the Google/Apple designed contact tracing framework (a Bluetooth enabled API) which ""can later be translated into COVID-19 exposure notifications"" and which are sent to contacts of a COVID-19 positive person. Google and Apple set preconditions to accessing this framework, however, by only allowing the registration of one government/health authority approved contact tracing app per country and by not allowing government health agencies access to the personal details of contacts, due to their evaluation of potential privacy issues (Ilves, 2020) . Multi-jurisdictional legal definitions and treatment of privacy issues is also a complicating factor in this decision.This situation presents a problem to any country wishing the use the API, as contact tracers need to be able to: 1) assess the level of potential exposure to the virus of the contact; and then 2) provide advice to the contact as to what action they should take. This could be anything from ""get a test and self-isolate for 14 days"" through to ""take no action at all, socially distance from others, but watch for symptoms"". As COVID-19 health advice can have critical health, economic and social consequences for an individual, the advice needs to be tailored for the individual and be as least impactful as possible. Merely sending an exposure notification to a contact of a COVID-19 infected person, does not guarantee any action, or the correct action being taken by that person.By prohibiting access to data and controlling their API in this way, Google and Apple are not sharing available data with not sharinggovernment health agencies that would allow them to tha perform effective contact tracing which could save many lives while preventing large scale economic hardship and vice versa. This presents us with a difficult legal and ethical situation to ponder i.e. does the individual requirement for data privacy outweigh the opportunity to save lives and livelihoods?We are now in the midst of a pandemic and the 'infodemic' that has followed in its wake and to counter the effects of this overload of inaccurate and misinformation, the WHO has collaborated with the providers of social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to mitigate the impact of false information on social media (WHO, 2020) in order to support shared situational awareness and effective crisis management. This is an unsustainable and unrealistic situation, however, due to the ongoing cost, level of resources and necessary skills required for such an intervention. While many countries have been unable to adequately deal with the pandemic, there are many success stories of shared situational awareness supporting health agency and public response for effective virus containment through day-to-day decisions and actions. Australian governments (federal and state) have had mixed results in the containment and management of the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been communications and IS missteps along the way e.g. Ruby Princess cruise ship (McKinnell, 2020) and the Melbourne quarantine hotels (Kaine & Josserand, 2020) where quarantine protocols were breached, as well as the current technical problems with the collection and use of the data from the Australian federal government COVIDSafe tracking and tracing app (Taylor, 2020) . We are also currently seeing the rapid development of a COVID-19 outbreak in metropolitan Melbourne (Victoria), where previously there had been a successful pandemic response. This has necessitated the reinstatement of lockdowns, strict social distancing enforcement and the closure of the NSW/Victorian Border. This outbreak has been exacerbated by misinformation circulating on social media targeting specific cultural groups, which has caused general confusion (especially in non-English speaking communities) as well as the promotion of racist tropes and hate speech (Bosley, 2020) .While managing a pandemic is a complex and complicated process with many stakeholders, to achieve a more effective level of crisis management there are benefits to be obtained by shared situational awareness through the alignment of mental models that represent more broadly acceptable situational reality and truth. This alignment would further support our trust in government as well as develop trust in other organizational and individual actors in the communications network. Individual differences in political, social and cultural contexts also add a layer of complexity to the alignment of mental models for shared situational awareness. Government agencies should refine their mental models of situational awareness to accommodate those variations in factors of significance which impact alignment e.g. cultural behavioral practices, housing conditions, working environments and practices, access to services, regard for community leadership, digital literacy, access to technology etc. or they risk the ongoing development and reinforcement of dissonant and alternative mental models and erosion of their trusted status. (Mirbabaie et al., 2020) Both government and platform providers have public interest and safety information communications requirements to satisfy in both the short and long-term, which directly impact our ability to manage pandemics and other types of crises and disasters effectively. There must be collaboration and cooperation (either legislated or voluntary) to build on the trust in government to provide information as early and as often as possible in a crisis (and enable the amplification of, and action taken from this advice) as well as ensure algorithmic transparency, information governance and quality assurance for robust and trusted communication and information services overall.To remain successful in managing the pandemic, however, requires long term vigilance and effort by both the pandemic managers and the International Journal of Information Management xxx (xxxx) xxxx public alike. As we can see by the current COVID-19 outbreak in Victoria, mental model alignment (and realignment) during a crisis is a continual process which requires constant attention, effort and resources. ""A critique of how science is produced is very different from the post-truth argument that there are alternative truths that you can choose from. Post-truth is a defensive posture. If you have to defend yourself against climate change, economic change, coronavirus change, then you grab at any alternative. If those alternatives are fed to you by thousands of fake news farms in Siberia, they are hard to resist, especially if they look vaguely empirical. If you have enough of them and they are contradictory enough, they allow you to stick to your old beliefs."" Bruno Latourinterview (Watts, 2020) .","Australia","first author","2020-08-04",8

Overall, the national message has been one of social distancing and minimal physical contact among members of different households. This was aimed at facilitating the now ubiquitous 'flattening of the curve' scenario, as a means of reducing the likelihood of healthcare system saturation and thereby unnecessary loss of life.The swift government-enforced lifestyle changes will undoubtedly have had significant effects on Australians, with consequences for mental health and well-being at the forefront. For example, unemployment and being temporarily 'stood down' could contribute to a reduction in financial resources and subsequent pressures in the home situation. The era of 24-hour news cycles and ease of social media access confronts Australians with large amounts of often-negative and at times conflicting information. Given the expected extension of many of these changes and restrictions (e.g. social distancing, business closures, working from home), it is important to understand how the mental health and well-being of Australians are being affected, and how this may change over the course of the pandemic. In particular, there is an urgent and critical need to identify if there are certain groups of individuals that may require immediate, particular and sustained support.Recently published data from COVID-19 studies in China have revealed significantly higher levels of anxiety , along with increased negative emotions (e.g. depression) and decreased positive emotions (e.g. happiness) in the general population (Li et al., 2020) . Medical health workers also demonstrated increased insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatisation and obsessive-compulsive symptoms when compared to non-medical (e.g. administration) health workers (Zhang et al., 2020b) . In terms of risk factors for negative emotions, the following were identified: being female Zhang et al., 2020a) , living in rural areas, being in contact with COVID-19-positive patients (Zhang et al., 2020a) , student status, specific physical symptoms and poor selfrated health . Some of these were corroborated and expanded on in a Spanish study, identifying risk factors associated with higher levels of distress and loneliness: being female, being younger, having negative self-perceptions about ageing, fewer positive emotions, lower quality of sleep and higher expressed emotion (Losada-Baltar et al., 2020) .In the Australian context, there is a critical need for population-level data on the psychological impact of the pandemic. This will aid the development of government policies and initiatives in relation to mental health that can best support the Australian population. Such information is also critical for future pandemic and crisis planning (Holmes et al., 2020) . Digital research methods, such as online surveys, would be an ideal rapid data collection exercise in cyber-connected nations, such as Australia. Below, we detail some key research priorities that we believe are of immediate and general need.The first consideration is the urgent need to characterise current levels of mental health and well-being in the general population. For example, levels of depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, positive and negative affect, feelings of loss and life satisfaction in society need to be determined, as well as understanding how these have changed as a result of the pandemic. In addition, the assessment of risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes at the population level will help us understand where support should be targeted. To do this, it would be beneficial to capture a range of factors. At a socio-demographic level, variables such age, gender, employment type and status, family size, social network size, frequency of nonphysical interactions, adaptability to new situations (e.g. working from home, online communication), rural/ urban residence, any current or previous mental health diagnoses, and alcohol and substance use information would be valuable to collect. In terms of physical health, factors such as sleep duration and quality would be important, as would eating and exercise behaviours, and information relating to current physical health and medical conditions. Psychological constructs that could prove informative include personality traits, aberrant thinking, coping styles, resilience, selfefficacy and life satisfaction.A second consideration is a specific focus on the mental health and wellbeing of particular groups with preexisting conditions or situations that could render them more vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, individuals with existing diagnoses of serious mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders) (Druss, 2020) . There is evidence that current high-level stresses and traumatic experiences can result in symptom exacerbation and relapse in psychosis and mood disorders (Docherty et al., 2009; Kessler, 1997) , while higher levels of anxiety are related to increased eating disorder symptoms (Costarelli and Patsai, 2012) . Increased levels of loneliness and isolation brought about by social distancing restrictions, coupled with the existing stigma of living with a mental illness (Druss, 2020) , will likely be detrimental to their mental health and will require more dedicated support.Other vulnerable groups include older adults who live alone, carers of those with a mental illness or special needs, school-aged children (including adolescents) and their parents, frontline health workers, essential workers (e.g. police, supermarket workers, delivery drivers) and victims of domestic violence. It is important to uncover how these groups are being affected by the pandemic to inform approaches to assist them. In light of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people seeking mental health support services is expected to increase and will thus require greater government investment. Related to this, evaluations of the efficacy of these increased investments will also be essential.The final consideration is the need for longitudinal studies that track changes in mental health during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, as the impact of restrictions and social isolation will likely be evident for an extended period (Holmes et al., 2020) . Indeed, in Taiwan, significant mental health consequences were observed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, with greater psychological distress in people over 60 and with higher levels of education, even after the crisis had resolved (Peng et al., 2010) . Thus, primary concerns and related mental health impacts may evolve and should be captured as individuals adapt to a 'new normal'. The term 'new normal' has been used when referencing the current situation we find ourselves in; it can also denote the period when Australia emerges from effective lockdown and 'regular life' begins to resume. Further tracking of the population time-stamped to announcements for significant nationwide government initiatives, such as additional funding for mental health services or the employment support payments, will be beneficial in assessing the potential impact and efficacy of these initiatives on Australians. It is therefore imperative that alongside cross-sectional studies, there are long-term studies to track changes in mental health and well-being, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.While the national focus remains on the negative impacts of the pandemic, it is worthwhile considering and assessing potential unanticipated positives that may have emerged. Indeed, a review conducted after the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) epidemic in Mexico revealed an increased awareness and uptake of personal hygiene practices nationwide in the wake of the virus (Córdova-Villalobos et al., 2009). Furthermore, after the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, many residents reported feeling closer to their family and friends, and more in touch with their mental health, which led to them increasing time devoted to relaxation and exercising (Lau et al., 2006) . In Australia and abroad, anecdotal evidence from news and social media has already highlighted potential silver linings associated with spending more time at home, including more time to do jobs around the house, and time to do more reading, exercise and enjoy hobbies, such as cooking. The use of simple openended questions about the personal experience of unexpected positives from the current situation would be one way to examine this and ensure a holistically understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Another point relates to the language used in research projects, particularly during this sensitive time. While it is perhaps inevitable that the bulk of study content may be negative (whether in questions or elicited responses), it is important that the questions asked are staggered by valence and worded neutrally where possible. This would help to prevent the unnecessary development of an overtly negative feel to the research, which may influence responses. It may also be beneficial to end on a positive note, for example, with a more encouraging questionnaire (e.g. a resilience measure). Language and phrasing can be a powerful and stigmatising tool (Tan, 2020) , and in these uncertain times, it is contingent on researchers to be more sensitive to the prevailing circumstances in the interests of both respondent welfare and data quality.It is conceivable that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt in existing mental health research and may affect a priori hypotheses and observed results. Consequently, it would be useful to incorporate questions relating to changes an individual may be experiencing or may have experienced because of the pandemic where possible. Potential freeresponse questions could include 'Have there been significant changes in your life situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic?', 'How has your mental health and well-being been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?' and 'Have you been affected by any changes in access to healthcare related to the COVID-19 pandemic?' It might also be beneficial to include Likert-type rating options (e.g. not at all, moderately, significantly) to better quantify responses and permit such influences to be accounted for in later data analyses.To address a large number of these considerations, and with an urgent need to gather empirical data on the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project on 1 April 2020. Ethical approval was obtained from the Swinburne University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number: 20202917-4107). The project includes a series of online surveys commencing at the start of each month and open for 72 hours. The surveys will run for 12 months (until March 2021), with four annual surveys thereafter, concluding in April 2024. Participants have and will continue to be recruited nationwide. They will be invited to complete as many or as few of the surveys as they wish, with the overall project seeking to gather snapshots of Australian mental health and well-being longitudinally. The data collected will be an invaluable resource towards not only an understanding of the current state of mental health and well-being in Australia, but also long-term trajectories. A number of measures form the core data collected, including socio-demographics such as age, gender, employment type and status, postcode (for identification of region and state), history of physical and mental health conditions, as well as measures of mood (depression, anxiety, stress, current positive and negative affect) (Watson et al., 1988) , selfreported cognitive function and life satisfaction.The COLLATE project team is committed to maximising the generalisability of the findings to the Australian population. We envision that the composition of respondents and response rates for each survey will differ over the life of the project. Consequently, when analysing survey results, we will adopt weighting of responses for variables such as age, gender and state/territory against published results from the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics census (ABS, 2016: at present) , where appropriate, to maximise the representativeness of results and comparability of data across different time points. When matched to prevailing and significant pandemic-related global and local events, the COLLATE surveys will provide potential markers of national mental health, as Australia navigates these uncharted times.As Australia adapts to the 'new normal', key issues facing the population and their immediate concerns may quantitatively and qualitatively differ across time, and it is important to capture this information as it emerges. The flexibility of our 'snapshot' study design will allow the COLLATE project to metamorphose between survey iterations to better capture the effects of evolving situations and events as they happen. This could occur, for example, through the introduction of relevant new questions at later stages of the project (e.g. when restrictions are lifted) to gauge those specific impacts. We consider the adaptability of individual survey iterations within the COLLATE project to be a strength of the design. Coupled with the 4-year duration of assessment, the COLLATE project will be well-positioned to empirically assess the breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The project can be found on Facebook at 'The Collate Project' and via our Twitter handle: @collateproject.Presently, the COLLATE project is gathering broad information from adults aged 18 years and above in the general population. There is clear scope for targeted adult populations, involving healthcare workers, the police, educators, specific mental health populations, carers and older adults. It would be beneficial to conduct international comparisons (Holmes et al., 2020) to explore the influence of cultural perspectives, as well as different virus mitigation strategies (e.g. widespread restrictions vs limited to no restrictions) on mental health. The COLLATE project team are open to collaborators who can aid in expanding the reach of future survey iterations during the life of the project and invite potential new stakeholders to contact the corresponding author. The COLLATE project presents a time-sensitive opportunity to provide critical, urgent and definitive information for community, policy and national benefit. We are optimistic that it will contribute significantly to the collegiate repository of COVID-19 and related mental health findings in Australia and around the world.The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: E.J.T. and T.E.V.R. are in receipt of Early Career (GNT1142424 and GNT10 88785) and S.L.R. in receipt of Senior Research (GNT1154651) fellowships from the National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC).

This pattern has been noted around Victoria, Australia, 1 and worldwide, 2 resulting in late presentations of treatable conditions and poor outcomes. 3 The reason behind this pattern is unclear and there is currently no literature in this area.Hypotheses for this trend include the following: (i) patients with mild illness are not presenting; (ii) patients with concerning symptoms are not presenting for investigation; (iii) multi-morbid patients are more compliant with management of their chronic illnesses and avoiding acute exacerbations requiring hospitalisation; (iv) social isolation is resulting in decreased communicable disease with less acute exacerbation of chronic illness as a consequence;(v) residential care facilities are treating residents within their facility rather than transfer to hospital.Decreased hospital admission rates raise the concern that patients may be failing to present to hospital with acute illness or concerning symptoms. The present study aims to compare the acuity and reason for current presentations, with presentations from the same period in 2019.Patients admitted under the Acute Medical Unit at the Royal Melbourne Hospital between 1 and 31 March 2019 and 1 and 31 March 2020 were included for comparison.We performed a retrospective audit using two validated instruments to measure the acuity of presentations: The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score 4 and the Charlson comorbidity score. 5 The APACHE III assesses initial risk stratification for severely ill hospital patients. Possible scores range from 0 to 299 points, with a 5-point increase in APACHE III score associated with a statistically significant increase in the relative risk of hospital death. 4 The Charlson Comorbidity Index predicts mortality by weighting comorbid conditions. 5 These scores were calculated for each patient from medical record data at time of admission.Additional data collected from medical records included patient age, gender, place of residence and reason for admission. Reason for admission was classified as acute physiological derangement, concern over diagnosis, cognitive decline, functional decline or psychiatric. Concern over diagnosis was defined as a patient admitted due to suspicion of a dangerous medical condition being present, for example, chest pain raising concern for acute myocardial infarct. However, if this was accompanied by an acute physiological derangement, this would be classed to the latter category. Reason for admission was classified by a resident medical officer and then reviewed by a consultant physician (PWL). Urine output and results of arterial blood gas evaluation were not often available in these general ward patients and therefore were not included in scores.To estimate the required number of cases to audit, initial data on APACHE III scores in our cohort outside pandemic conditions were analysed with a mean of 30.33 and SD of 9.634, hypothesising a 10-point difference in scores (corresponding to a 10% change in risk of mortality with APACHE III scores in this range) α 0.05, β 0.9, would require cohorts of 21 per group for 42 overall. Noting the available cases, adequate power was expected to be attained.Data analysis was performed using STATA 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Data from 115 consecutive patients beginning at the start of the identified periods were collected: 64 (2020) and 51 (2019). Demographic data and reason for admission were compared using Fisher exact test with no significant difference between the two groups (Table 1) . APACHE and Charlson scores were analysed using unpaired t-test for an initial 48 patients, 24 from 2019 (non-pandemic) and 24 from 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic). APACHE III scores and Charlson comorbidity scores were approximately normally distributed. There was a non-significant trend to more severe scores in mean APACHE score (30.33 (SD 9.64) in 2019 versus 33.7 (SD 11.87) in 2020, P = 0.0652) that approaches the 5-point difference noted to change mortality 4 and a statistically and clinically significant difference in Charlson Comorbidity Index (5.88 (SD 2.29) in 2019 versus 6.26 (SD 2.57) in 2020, P = 0.0429), indicating approximately one additional comorbid condition per three patients, between these two groups.Our study demonstrates that patients admitted to the Acute Medical Unit of RMH during the COVID-19 pandemic may be more comorbid than in a matched period prior to the pandemic. There was also a non-significant trend towards more acute illness. In this study, we were unable to show that the reasons for admission were different, but this is not sufficient evidence to argue against that hypothesis.These findings, if reflected in the general population, suggest that patients with milder illnesses and/or more modest degrees of comorbidity than our current inpatients, may not be presenting to hospital for admission, potentially resulting in late presentations of treatable illness and poor outcomes. 3,6 These patients may be concerned about burdening the hospital system or acquiring COVID-19 as inpatients. 1 We recommend a public health campaign to encourage patients to continue to attend hospital if they feel unwell, regardless of the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a result, established maternity care practices have been adapted to address this rapidly changing crisis and to ensure the wellbeing and personal safety of practitioners as well as pregnant women and their families. Changes in practices, such as reducing the number of scheduled antenatal care appointments, moving from in-person to a telehealth format, not allowing a support person to attend routine antenatal appointments, including the 20-week scan and minimising support people in labour may be more detrimental to women and their families experiencing a pregnancy after loss (PAL) (1) (2) (3) . These practice changes are being made with a crisis management mindset. The COVID-19 pandemic is complex. Risk mitigation strategies need to consider the health and wellbeing of not only the mother and baby, but support people, care providers and the unprecedented demand upon health services.Current evidence, albeit changing and correlational in nature, suggests that a pregnant woman or baby are at no more at risk of contracting COVID-19 than any other member of the community, and that even if she was to contract it, the woman and her baby would be no more at risk of complications (4, 5) . Furthermore, the risk of vertical transmission between the mother and baby is thought to be small (6, 7) . However, concerns about risk of transmission is not just regarding the pregnant woman, but also includes fears that the maternity health care provider may be exposed to multiple women and their partners during their daily practice. Maternity care providers' physical and psychosocial health during this crisis also need to be at the forefront of any clinical recommendations (8) . Maternity care providers are a diverse workforce, which includes those at risk of increased severity of complications from COVID-19, i.e. the older practitioner or those with comorbidities (8) . Hence, maternity care providers' psychosocial wellbeing and physical protection needs to also be considered alongside how to support pregnant women and their families.There are 2.6 million stillbirths globally every year (9) . Approximately 66% of women will go on to have a subsequent pregnancy within 12 months of their loss (10) . The greatest risk factor for stillbirth is a history of a prior stillbirth (11, 12) . Families experiencing PAL have additional physical and psychological needs (10), such as gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction (13) , depression and anxiety (14) . However with appropriate, care these risks can be reduced or even mitigated (15, 16) . Therefore, the health care provider has an important role to develop a care plan which is sensitive and individualised and planned in collaboration with bereaved parents (10, 15, 17) . Furthermore, a support person plays an important role during PAL (16) . To preclude the partner's support in times of likely increased anxiety, such as during an ultrasound, raises concern for ongoing negative psychological sequelae not just for the pregnant woman, but for her partner as a result of experiences from the prior stillbirth (18, 19) . The COVID-19 pandemic has meant many new guidelines for antenatal care provision which have been implemented may have inadvertently diminished their importance.Currently, there are no specific guidelines nor evidence which provides evidence-based guidance for PAL and COVID-19. This means, women with PAL should continue to be managed as an at-risk group and in keeping with international consensus guidelines developed to guide practice in subsequent pregnancy (15, 17) . However, anecdotes from across the globe suggest that current provision of care during COVID-19, may not necessarily be meeting those additional care needs for a woman and baby experiencing a pregnancy after loss and these may in turn lead to unintended consequences or indirect costs of COVID-19.Evidence-based practices which generally recommend increased surveillance during PAL may not be adhered to during the COVID pandemic. This potentially carries the risk of unintended consequences such as subsequent stillbirth. Conversely practices may be implemented that are not based on evidence and may lack specificity or the understanding for the unique position facing women experiencing PAL. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (17) produced a consensus statement designed to guide clinical practice and the recommendations for pregnancy after loss, the principles that should remain during COVID-19. The current reality derived from what 'living guidelines' (20) are recommending, observations of current practices from the professional experience of the authors, as well as extrapolated from recent reports from non-PAL parents (21) and research reports (22) from high-income countries across the world are outlined in Table 1 . Evidence based-guidance that should be maintained during COVID-19Previous stillbirth is a known risk factor for current stillbirth (GRADE: high) Women with this history need to be considered high risk and managed as such.Reduced number of face-to-face antenatal consultations is being recommended by most professional bodies (e.g.1-3).Women with a history of stillbirth are at higher risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and placental abruption (GRADE: moderate).Women with this history need to be considered as having these risk factors and managed as such.This may be challenging in the context of reduced face-to-face consults. For example, recent research suggests predisposing risk factors to stillbirth such as hypertension may be being missed (22) Low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk of perinatal death in women at risk for placental insufficiency. Women with a history of stillbirth may fall into this category (GRADE: high).Women should be aware they are able to access low-dose aspirin either online or contactless pick-up Decisions on thromboprophylaxis should be made on a case-by-case basis, involving senior obstetricians, physicians and radiologists (20) .Women with a history of stillbirth may be at risk for fetal growth restriction in the subsequent pregnancy and may benefit from serial growth ultrasound (GRADE: high)While there is limited evidence supporting routine biophysical profile studies, some women and their families may benefit from increased surveillance, while others will find the increased monitoring to contribute to their anxiety (GRADE: moderate) Serial ultrasound should be offered .Women and her partner should be included in the rate of surveillance decisions with their care provider.With telehealth many women may not be having as many physical checks as they want or need. For example, no blood pressure taken at telehealth visits. (21) In certain locations, no support person is being allowed into antenatal care and sonography appointments. (20, 21) Decisions around timing of birth should incorporate the circumstances surrounding the previous stillbirth and psychosocial family needs. (GRADE: moderate).Planned early birth not recommended. Most professional guidelines consider Covid-19 is not an indication to expedite birth (e.g.1-3). Timing of birth conversations can still occur based on the woman's history for reassurance.Families are uniquely impacted by prior stillbirth and current pregnancy management systems and processes should strive to adequately address these needs (GRADE: high).A high level of psychosocial support should be maintained.Telehealth is being offered to address this need. (1) (2) (3) Adequate care provision includes consistent and timely medical and psychosocial care, services, and support by skilled and familiar care teams knowledgeable about the pervasive impact of stillbirth on the subsequent pregnancy and beyond. All care for families with prior stillbirth should be focused on protecting and promoting the health of the woman and her family, as well as informed choice (GRADE: high)Vital to protect, promote and maintain the psychological health of woman and her family at this time UnknownPeer support is often beneficial for parents in pregnancies after stillbirth. Care providers should discuss and promote peer support options (GRADE: moderate).Vital due to increased care providers and maternal anxiety about Covid-19.Where face-to-face peer support is not possible there are a variety of online peer support options.Women and families with prior stillbirth are very likely to need emotional support, and the entire family should be provided with opportunities for support during pregnancy and postpartum. Care providers should promote family strengths and provide psychosocial screening, targeted follow-up, referrals, and treatment as appropriate (GRADE: high)Care providers should promote family strengths and provide psychosocial screening, targeted follow-up, referrals, and treatment as appropriate UnknownNew antenatal care guidelines have been widely enacted (e.g.1-3) that were derived in a crisis and are purpose specific. While some attempts have been made to create 'living' guidelines, (20) at present these are mainly focused on care for pregnant women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Consensus and / or evidence-based guidelines developed prior to COVID-19 and based on high grade evidence should be re-implemented as soon as it is deemed safe to do so. Recommendations made in table 2 are to highlight strategies in which families experiencing PAL can continue to feel supported while also aiming to mitigate future indirect costs of COVID-19. These include the need for partner support, access to mental health services, and peer support. 4. Where the partner is not allowed to attend scanning facilities recognise the importance of scans as a vehicle for attachment and provide a disk/USB of the recording to be shared with the support person and family to connect with the unborn baby. 5 . Health care providers encourage PAL women and families to access local peer-support support.Maternity guidelines enacted for use in the Covid-19 pandemic have in the main superseded existing pregnancy care guidelines which were based on a weight of evidence, developed and refined over many years. The short and long-term implications of these changes to standard maternity care provision remain to be seen. The psychological wellbeing of the woman and her family need to remain the utmost importance during PAL and the importance of a support person, peer support and access to mental health services needs to be highlighted. Families experiencing stillbirth today are likely to go on to have another pregnancy and therefore, reduction of services and care around stillbirth occurring today may well also have an impact well into the future.Funding: There was no funding allocated towards this paper.Ethical Statement: No ethics were needed to be obtained for this discussion article as no recruitment was undertaken.Our group contains midwives (MM and JW), researchers (MM, JOL, DP and JW), and JOL is also a pregnancy after loss group facilitator with the US-based Star Legacy Foundation working directly with families.

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization belatedly declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, 1 the same day that the Greater Geelong region confirmed its first known case. 3 Early decisive action in Australia resulted in flattening of the curve between March and May. This included the introduction of strict social distancing, closing the borders, contact tracing and isolation/quarantine of oversees travellers and known case contacts.To reduce the number of patients attending hospitals, the Federal Government introduced 19 telehealth Medicare Benefits Scheme item numbers from 13 March. 4 To reserve emergency department, ward and intensive care unit capacity, as well as personal protective equipment, non-essential elective surgery was wound back from 26 March (1 April in private hospitals). 5 To create extra capacity, including for essential elective surgery, the government financially underwrote the private hospitals until 30 June. Only cases that were category 1 and urgent category 2 were done over the next 4-5 weeks. Elective surgery began to be restored in stages with a 25% increase allowed from 27 April 2020, 50% (18 May) and 75% (1 June). 6 No other event in modern surgery has led to the need for such rapid, drastic changes in the delivery of a surgical service. This article describes Geelong's general surgical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and how practice and service delivery changed during the first 7 weeks (30 March to 17 May 2020).Barwon Health is the only public health service provider for the Greater Geelong Region serving a population of around 350 000. 7 Surgical services take place at University Hospital Geelong and two not-for-profit private hospitals, St John of God Hospital and the Epworth Hospital.On 20 March 2020, the Barwon Health surgical directors agreed to form a State of Disaster Surgical Triage Team which met daily at 7 am from Monday 24 March. Ahead of the Federal Government's announcement, Barwon Health's State of Disaster Surgical Triage Team began cancelling category 3 and many category 2 elective general surgical patients similar to what was occurring at other tertiary institutions. 8 The workload of triaging and cancelling elective cases was spread among the specialties, with difficult cases discussed with an independent senior clinician.Commencing on 30 March 2020, all public elective surgery was moved to the two private hospitals. To ensure teams were kept separate, and to distribute the work between the two private hospitals, the upper gastrointestinal and breast units went to St John of God, and the colorectal/endocrine unit to the Epworth Hospital. This involved 19 consultants, four fellows, six surgical education and training (SET) registrars and nine unaccredited registrars. A general surgical consultant meeting was held weekly online via Zoom to ensure good communication of the strategy.The emergency surgical service was retained at University Hospital Geelong, but to isolate teams from each other (in case of an infected team member) we created a fourth unit as the acute general surgical unit. Two unaccredited registrars, two accredited SET registrars, a general surgical fellow and consultant were allocated to the unit, each rostered on for a week at a time. Both the general surgical fellow and supervising consultant were relieved of all other responsibilities for the 7-day period. Plans were in place to also move emergency surgery to the private sector, where the pandemic to overwhelm University Hospital Geelong's capacity.Outpatient clinics changed to a largely telehealth-based service conducted over the phone. Patients were triaged by our surgical registrars who reviewed the referral letter and/or online medical record. Those not suitable for phone review were seen in person. Our perioperative team triaged patients, if appropriate, to a preoperative phone review or review on the day of surgery.Weekly surgical audits, multi-disciplinary meetings (MDMs), registrar teaching and department meetings were all conducted through an online videoconferencing platform Zoom.To compare the service delivery and outcomes, we used the 7-week period (30 March to 17 May 2020) with the same 7 weeks in 2019 (1 April to 19 May 2019). The weekly audit data was cross-referenced to Barwon Health's Data Warehouse. The individual medical records of patient's undergoing appendicectomies and laparotomies were reviewed to generate the outcomes of interest.To measure the impact of COVID-19 on SET trainee operative exposure we compared the 7-week COVID period to the first 7 weeks of their current rotation (3 February 2020 to 22 March 2020), based on their Morbidity Audit and Logbook Tool. This enabled the same trainee in the same rotation to be compared between full and reduced activity.Statistical analyses were performed with non-categorical data compared using a Student's t-test assuming homoscedasticity of data. Categorical data was compared between years using a chisquared matrix. Differences were deemed statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level. Statistical analyses were completed using MedCalc for Windows version 9.6 (MedCalc, Ostend, Belgium). Ethical approval was obtained from Barwon Health's Human Research and Ethics Committee.There were 64 cases of COVID-19 in the Greater Geelong region between 11 March and 17May 2020. During April there were only 10 new cases. By 17 May there were 1595 cases in Victoria and 7157 cases in Australia (Fig. 1) .From 30 March to 17 May 2020, general surgeons in Geelong performed 105 elective public elective operations (excluding endoscopy), a 45.9% reduction on 2019 activity (Table 1) . Even category 1 cases were reduced by 30%. Eighty-one of these were performed in the private sector. Patients requiring surgery for cancer (44 patients) waited on average 3 days less (14.7 days compared with 11.7 days) during the COVID-19 period. One hundred and forty-two patients already on the waiting list with dates for surgery were cancelled by the hospital, the patient themselves or for a positive COVID-19 screen.During the COVID-19 period we performed 198 public endoscopies in Geelong, representing a 58% reduction on the previous year, with category 1 endoscopies down 71% (Table 1) . Seventysix (38%) endoscopies continued were done at University Hospital Geelong, the rest in private hospitals. Five cancers were found, and the adenoma detection rate was 41%.Despite a 30% drop in emergency presentations, emergency overnight general surgical admissions averaged 68 cases per week and only declined 6.1% (475 versus 506) compared with the same period in 2019 (Table 2) . We conducted 205 emergency operations compared with 180 the previous year, an increase of 13.9%. There was an increase in the number of emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomies and emergency colonoscopies performed. There was no significant change in the indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomies (Table 3) . For the period 30 March-17 May 2020 there were 10 complications compared with nine in 2019. We included complications that occurred for patients initially treated during the respective time periods, which may or may not have been discussed within these dates. The Clavien-Dindo grade 9 for each complication was determined. In both periods, following peer review, the complications were deemed to be non-preventable. In 2020 none were considered related to changed environment due to COVID-19 or a reluctance to present to hospital. Appendicectomy numbers were similar between the two time periods, particularly both the perforation rates and the negative appendicectomy rates. Indications for laparotomies were similar between the two time periods and there were no significant differences in numbers or outcomes for emergency laparotomies (Table 3) .A radical restructuring of our outpatient clinic service led to a change from no scheduled telehealth consults in 2019 to 81.3% of all consults being conducted via telehealth. Similarly, no preoperative anaesthetic reviews were conducted via telehealth in 2019 and this changed to 61.8% of all pre-operative consults in 2020 (Table 4) .At upper gastrointestinal, colorectal and breast MDMs we discussed an average of 9.1 patients per week (total = 64 patients) via the online platform. This is compared to 2019 when we discussed an average of 8.4 patients per week (total = 59 patients) in person.The SET trainee's operative exposure was similar comparing the first 7 weeks of the rotation with the seven during the COVID-19 response. However, gastroscopy was reduced by a third and colonoscopies by 14.3% (Table 5) .Prior to COVID-19, a weekly face-to-face tutorial for registrars was run by a rotating roster of general surgery consultants. During the COVID-19 service this tutorial continued, albeit delivered through Zoom. While formal attendance numbers were not kept during 2019 for comparison, strong anecdotal evidence suggests a significant increase in the registrars participating in the tutorials when delivered online. A weekly meeting between the supervisor of general surgery training and trainees continued via online videoconference. Trainees within the training hub that were on rotation to other regional centres were invited to join these meetings online.Almost every element of our general surgical service in Geelong was impacted by COVID-19. This was particularly so for elective surgery (down 45.9%) and endoscopy (down 58.2%). In addition to cancelling 142 patients already booked for surgery from 24 March, we did 89 fewer elective cases and 276 less endoscopies. The impact of not doing this surgery on the health of the population will only be learned over the coming 12-18 months. Of note, we did not change current best practice, despite some contrary advice from overseas 10, 11 and consistent with General Surgeons Australia recommendations 12 we did not change our utilization of laparoscopic surgery. We would anticipate that we have around 90-100 patients per week not operated on in general surgery, which will equate to up to 1000 general surgical procedures (including endoscopies) before we are back to 100% given the staged re-introduction of elective surgery over 2 months. This represents a small fraction of the estimated 28 million elective surgeries cancelled worldwide due to COVID-19, or 400 000 for Australia. 13 We expect there will be some delayed diagnosis of cancer, though the evidence from our maintenance of category 1 cancer surgery and the decision-making at our MDM's suggest we treated the 46 cancer patients we knew about appropriately. Our colorectal patients had a decreased time from endoscopic diagnosis to surgery (down 34.6% to a mean of 25.3 days) which shows we were able to maintain efficient and effective treatment pathways for known cancers. Additionally, all cancer patients had a decreased elective surgery wait list time (down 20.4% to 11.7 days,) demonstrating we maintained an effective essential service. A decrease in both these waiting times likely reflects increased access to theatre for category 1 patients.With outpatient services being delivered via telehealth, our clinicians had greater flexibility to manage appointments and even undertook some of their outpatient commitments from home. We retained half of our ability to assess new outpatient referrals and even increased the number of review patients by changing our model of care to involve telehealth in over 80% of consultations (Table 4 ). This is anticipated to be one of the major benefits of COVID-19, 14 and one we plan to utilize in the future. General surgical emergency presentations were only slightly reduced during the COVID-19 response period. This was despite a 30% reduction in emergency department presentations and a 20% drop in all cause emergency admissions to hospital. This probably reflects the acute, obvious nature of general surgical emergencies, with our patients aware of the need to attend hospital.We increased the number of emergency operations performed during COVID-19 by 13.9% despite a 6.1% decrease in overnight admissions. In particular there was an increase in the number of emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomies and colonoscopies performed. While there was no formal change in our departments approach to emergency surgery, this change in practice likely resulted from increased access to emergency theatre and a desire to perform urgent cases before a potential worsening of the pandemic.Moving the general surgical electives to the private hospitals preserved capacity at University Hospital Geelong to respond to COVID-19. The key to being able to rapidly transfer our elective work to the private sector was Geelong's unique pre-existing public-private relationship. 15 This allowed rapid transfer of our units and a smooth transition to treat public patients in the private hospitals. Clinicians were also familiar with the clinical information systems, while credentialing, and financial processes were already in place. Only credentialing of junior medical staff was additionally required and, under the private hospital contracts, a system of private to public reimbursement for junior staff work.Despite the potential for the community not presenting to the hospital for urgent care during the pandemic, our results do not reflect this. Our appendicectomy perforation rate, gallbladder necrosis rate and laparotomy lengths of stay were not significantly different.While COVID-19 required a change in approach to preoperative anaesthetic assessment there was no evidence that patient outcomes were affected. The number of pre-operative reviews decreased by 55.3%. Only 13 patients were reviewed in person compared to 76 during the corresponding period of time in 2019. Our concern was that patients would not receive the robust level of assessment compared to 2019, but in the end, none of our patients were cancelled on the day of surgery due to anaesthetic issues. Similarly, our postoperative outcomes showed no significant change.COVID-19 threatened to significantly impact surgical training. 16 We were very pleased with the comparative figures which showed that our SET trainees overall suffered no significant change in their operative exposure during the COVID-19 period. This figure also likely reflects our accredited trainees doing a greater proportion of procedures compared to our non-accredited trainees. Despite an overall reduction in the number of colonoscopies in Geelong performed by 58.2%, our trainees performed only 14.3% fewer colonoscopies. Combined with an increase in the mean primary operator rate, this highlights our department's ability to maintain exposure to operative surgery despite delivering a surgical service using different models of care.We have found the use of online meetings a valuable tool for communication and maintaining morale in the face of social isolation. Despite restrictions in the delivery of some content, online meetings resulted in increased attendance of clinicians to our scheduled meetings. Increased attendance was likely due to the ability to access these meetings off-site, from either home or other workplaces while acknowledging that some clinicians did have a decreased clinical work load.. Online meetings are likely to continue in the future.Many lessons have also been learnt to better prepare ourselves, and other health service providers, for a similar situation in the future. Indeed, COVID-19 has been described a 'window of opportunity' for change. 14 Early, decisive and collaborative leadership without fear of making a wrong decision has underpinned our service changes. Furthermore, the flexibility of a pre-existing publicprivate partnership in Geelong has proved to be invaluable and is something that needs to be considered by other health service providers in the future.We believe our response offers some valuable lessons which could be adopted by other health service providers.None declared.

We are encouraged to remember and to celebrate the endurance and resilience that have seen particular communities, and the human species in general, through so much in the past. That insistent optimism finds reinforcement in common metaphors of war-of resistance in the face of a deadly enemy-and of eventual victory.The implicit message here is that the manifest effects of the pandemic should be seen as temporary glitches in an ongoing triumphal story, in which humanity fights back against hostile Nature. Such narratives are meant to communicate-and to instil-hope. However, they rest on a construal of hope in terms of assurance of future deliverance, whatever the temporary trauma or grief along the way. It is easy to be swept along by such rhetoric. The appeal to resilience in the face of adversity seems appropriate and necessary; and it is difficult to resist-or even to question-the evoking of hope. Yet, there are some grounds for unease in relation to the resolute expectation of future well-being.In an essay published in The Monthly, the Australian writer and commentator Don Watson (2020) has offered an intriguing insight on the difference between hope and optimism in the context of the pandemic. Hope, he observes, is essential for human beings, but optimism is voluntary; and it can, in its assured confidence about the future, be deadly. I want here to explore that distinction by drawing on the thought of the seventeenth century Dutch philosopher, Benedict de Spinoza.Underlying the current rhetoric of optimism are narratives of perfectibility and of progress, which were articulated later in the history of western philosophy. They draw on assumptions of the supremacy of human reason, construed as transcending ""mere"" Nature. Spinoza offers an alternative perspective, which can now be seen as an intellectual path not taken. His philosophy emphasizes the interdependence of humanity and the world in which it is shaped, and on which it leaves its own inexorable traces.In the early eighteenth century there was a philosophical version of optimism, which left its mark on later developments in the imagining of assured progress of the human species towards perfection through exercise of distinctive capacities for rational thought. That ""metaphysical optimism"" rested on the notion of a benign providential order of things, in which apparent evil falls into place within the perfection of the whole. As Alexander Pope (1829) put it in his An Essay on Man, within that bigger picture, whatever is, is right. In a more philosophically nuanced version of the idea, later elaborated in Gottfried Leibniz's Theodicy, the actual world excludes the existence of other less perfect-less rationally ordered-possible worlds. Shorn of its philosophical niceties, this was the idea later pilloried by Voltaire (1759) in his famous satire Candide, in which the Leibnizian doctrine is mouthed by the fatuous tutor Pangloss, who sees actual perfection in the midst of every apparent disaster.Spinoza's version of humanity's place in the whole of Nature also emphasized the broader context of human life. However, he developed that theme in a radically different way, rejecting all notion of purpose or design in the natural world. Rather than offering assurance of a world rationally ordered towards ultimate human wellbeing, reason is itself part of Nature-inserted into a totality of finite processes, which have no bearing on what may be ""best"" for human beings.Spinoza thus offered a very different version of humanity's place in Nature from a more familiar one-strikingly articulated by his contemporary, Blaise Pascal. In his Pensées (1852), Pascal famously observed that-despite being like a fragile reed, liable to be destroyed by a vapour-human beings are superior to the might and power of the whole of Nature; for they are unique in being things that think. Pascal's exultation in the nobility of human thought resonates throughout later philosophy. It was explicit in the notion of the Sublime-the ancient aesthetic concept revived in the eighteenth century, largely through strands in the thought of Immanuel Kant. In his Critique of Judgement, Kant presented the sense of the Sublime as arising in reason's recognition of ""the appropriate sublimity of the sphere of its own being, even above Nature"" (Kant 1952 (Kant [1790 .Like other philosophers of his time-and many who came later-Spinoza celebrated the powers of human reason. Yet his affirmation of reason is framed by insistence on the doctrine for which he is most famous-and notorious: the treatment of minds and bodies alike as finite modes of a non-transcendent unique Substance, identified as God-or-Nature. An individual mind is for him not a free-standing intellectual substance but a modification of that one Substance, under one of its Attributes-Mind, or Thought.In terms of more recent debates in the philosophy of mind, Spinoza is neither a ""dualist"" nor a ""materialist."" For him, minds and bodies are not reducible in either direction. Nor is a mind superior to-or nobler thanthe body, of which it is the idea. Minds and bodies have equal status as finite modes of Substance, under different Attributes-Mind or Thought, and material Extension. They are united, across that difference in Attributes, in a non-causal relation of ideas to their objects.""The object of the idea constituting the human Mind is the Body or a certain mode of Extension which actually exists, and nothing else"" (Spinoza 1985 (Spinoza [1677 ; Kant 1952 Kant [1790 , Part II, Proposition 13). Whether as mind or as body, a human being is inserted into-and hence vulnerable within-the totality of Nature. ""The force by which a man perseveres in existing is limited, and infinitely surpassed by the power of external causes"" (Spinoza 1985 (Spinoza [1677 ; Kant 1952 Kant [1790 , Part IV, Proposition 3).At a superficial level, the observation that human beings are themselves part of the reality they know can seem commonplace: we know that we are not positioned outside the world like observing gods, viewing it from nowhere. Yet we do readily imagine human knowledge as a relation between a mind-complete unto itselfand a world of things external to it, including its own body. Spinoza challenges that way of thinking, demanding serious engagement with the ramifications of acknowledging that human minds are minds-in-world, understanding that world only from within it. For him, a mind's thinking processes reflect its immersion in the dynamic totality of the whole of Nature-vulnerable to rival forces and powers, as well as able to draw strength from those con-genial to its own persistence in existence. ""We are acted on, insofar as we are a part of Nature, which cannot be conceived through itself, without the others"" (Spinoza 1985 (Spinoza [1677 , Part IV, Proposition 2).What does all this mean for hope? In Part III of his Ethics, Spinoza defines it in tandem with Fear. Hope is an inconstant Joy, associated with the thought of an uncertain future outcome. Fear is an inconstant Sadness, similarly associated with uncertainty about what lies in the future. Where no such uncertainty is felt, Hope is replaced by Confidence-an assured expectation, not unlike what we now call ""optimism.""What is significant here is that Hope is seen as grounded in a more basic emotion-Joy, which Spinoza defines as the mind's transition out of passivity into greater activity. Hope is thus presented as a tremulous anticipation of Joy-in the midst of uncertainty. That connects it with something even more central in Spinoza's philosophy-the dynamic concept he calls conatus: the effort to persist in existence. A human mind, like all other finite things, has conatus as its essence; and for it, that essence resides in the effort to better understand its relations with other things within the totality of Nature. Its continued existence involves ongoing transitions into greater activity or passivityjoy or sorrow-under the impact of forces external to it.In thus connecting Hope-through its associations with Joy-with the essence of the mind, Spinoza offers, not so much a reason for hope, as an insight into its preconditions. In Hope a mind is aware of the onward movement-the struggle to persist-of life itself. Thinking minds are thus for Spinoza integrated, for better or worse, into the totality of the powers of Nature. Humanity does not occupy any privileged place in a benignly ordered whole, shaped to ultimately accommodate its well-being.The ramifications of Spinoza's perspective on human reason are developed in his political writings. In Chapter 16 of the Theological-Political Treatise (Spinoza 2001) , he offers a startling image of human reason as a small speck, struggling to persist within the immensity of the whole of being. We may want the whole of Nature to be directed according to how we think, but in reality human reason is adapted only to its own workings as a tiny part of that whole.It may seem an unhopeful picture of what can be expected for-or from-human reason, adrift in the immensity of Nature. Yet for Spinoza actively understanding the interdependence of finite things brings its own remedy for the negative passions associated with fear; for the activity of rational thinking is, by definition, itself an enactment of Joy.Despite its initial strangeness, Spinoza's insistence that human reason is itself but a speck within the whole of Nature can seem strikingly prescient in the light of developments in contemporary physics and cosmology. Yet he remains largely an ""outsider"" in the history of western thought. His philosophy draws on ancient sources, which were taken up and developed also in the writings of other philosophers, whose thought is more ""mainstream"" for contemporary consciousness. He draws on Stoicism, on Epicureanism, on Aristotle, on Descartes. However, he also draws on less familiar sources-on Maimonides, Averroes, Avicennaimaginatively adapting and modifying them into his own distinctive system.In their startling unfamiliarity, Spinoza's insights into humanity's place within Nature can open up possibilities for constructive re-thinking of what is at stake for human presence on a changing planet. Perhaps Spinozist hope might better sustain us, as we move into an uncertain future, than a more familiar state of optimism, grounded in illusory assumptions of human supremacy over ""mere"" Nature.Thinking through with Spinoza what it is to be truly part of Nature would require re-thinking-intellectually, imaginatively, emotionally-a prevailing mindset which has shaped attitudes towards human presence in the world. He responded to what he saw as a false imagining of humanity as lodged in the world as if it were an autonomous, self-contained ""kingdom within a kingdom,"" carved out within the whole of Nature.Re-thinking that imagining would involve taking seriously human finitude and the vulnerability inherent in struggling for survival within rather than against the rest of Nature.In the context of the current COVID-19 crisis, recognizing the dangerous limitations of that underlying mindset might well involve acknowledging points of connection-shared underlying conditions-between the pandemic and ongoing crises of climate change: the unthinking encroachment of human interests into previously ""wild"" Nature; the displacement of species from destroyed habitat; the mass movements of people from depleted environments.On a Spinozist approach, human well-being depends on coming to an ever deeper understanding of humanity's interdependence with the rest of Nature. In the conclusion to his Ethics, he described that understanding as ""excellent,"" though ""difficult"" and ""rare."" In our own times, it is a pressing challenge to try to engage in such re-thinking.","Australia","first author","2020-08-25",8

In recent years, HIIT has proven popular in the general community and has been studied across a wide array of cardiovascular (CV)related disorders, such as hypertension (2, 3) , stroke (4, 5) , type II diabetes (6) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (7) . This is due to compounding, compelling evidence of the efficacy of HIIT on CV outcomes such as reduced blood pressure, lowered body fat, improved lipid profile, less arterial stiffness, improved myocardial function (lower rate pressure product), and improved insulin resistance/glucose control (8) (9) (10) , in addition to the cardiac-specific adaptations that Li and colleagues outlined in their letter.While the CV benefits of HIIT are now quite clear, following the large volume of research on the topic in the last decade or so, the efficacy of HIIT specifically for respiratory and pulmonary functionthe main outcome that would be desired in those who have suffered hospitalisation from COVID-19 infectionis less known. It is well-established that HIIT induces improvements in maximal ventilation, associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). HIIT has consistently demonstrated greater improvements in CRF than traditional moderate-intensity continuous training in both healthy and chronic illness populations (11, 12) . Improved ventilation interacts with improved cardiac output to provide the working muscle with more oxygen, equating to higher CRF. Our data noted an 11% increase in maximal minute ventilation (litres of air breathed per minute), corresponding with an 11% increase in CRF, after 6 weeks of HIIT in our cardiac patients (1). Improved CRF following HIIT does not just have exercise performance benefitsit has been well-documented the positive effect of higher CRF on CV-related mortality risk (13) largely via the improved CV outcomes outlined earlier, and it plausibly can at least partly explain J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f improved cognitive function and mental health in those with illness-induced deficits (14, 15) via improved cerebrovascular blood-flow. Improved CRF also directly influences daily functionan improved ability to undertake tasks of daily living leading to improved quality of life, an important practical consideration during the post-COVID recovery.Other than improved maximal ventilation and the associated improved CRF, HIIT might help COVID survivors in other ways. Persistent symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue following recovery from COVID have been frequently observed (16), somewhat akin at this stage to a post-viral fatigue syndrome. The intermittent nature inherent to interval training may be advantageous for these patients by reducing the ventilatory demand associated with exercise, which may serve to reduce dyspnoea and the sense of breathing effort as compared with traditional continuous aerobic exercise (17) . Thoughtfully applied work and recovery intervals within a HIIT program for these patients, such as applying shorter bursts and longer rests, are key to tolerability and not exacerbating the fatigue symptom, and therefore promoting longer-term adherence. In addition, the higher exercise intensity also may generate improvements in inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, again leading to lower sense of breathing effort generally. Specific inspiratory muscle resistance training may prove a better method to address this, or may be an adjunct to HIIT as applied recently in patients with heart failure (18) .","Australia","first author","2020-08-31",8

On 16 March 2020, South Australia officially declared a Public Health Emergency, and the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH)an 800-bed quaternary referral centre, with a 48-bed intensive care unit (ICU)was designated the receiving COVID-19 hospital for the State. 1, 2 On 24 March, the first critically ill COVID-19 patient was admitted to the RAH ICU, with 17 more admitted over the following 20 daysto our knowledge, the highest number in a single centre in Australia. We summarise and share our early experience managing a cohort of COVID-19 patients in ICU.A COVID-19 ICU leadership team was convened, and pandemic response organised according to the 'Prevention, Preparedness, Response and Recovery' model, adopted by the SA State Emergency Management Plan. 3 Key portfolios were shared amongst the consultant group, and included development of clinical guidelines (based on established evidence-based care of critically ill patients, plus emerging evidence specific to patients with COVID-19); education and training; staffing, credentialing and rosters; staff welfare; personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols; procurement (pharmacy, equipment and PPE); communications; ethics; research and data collection.The RAH ICU adopted a 'Command and Control' structure: reporting vertically to the RAH Executive, Central Adelaide Local Health Network, and South Australian COVID-19 Command Centre; and interfacing horizontally with colleagues from Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, Acute and Urgent Care, and other clinical disciplines. A Command and Control structure can threaten frontline autonomy and flexibility to respond to a changing clinical environment. To maintain responsiveness during the uncertain and dynamic course of the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid access to, and feedback from, senior decision-makers is essential.The RAH ICU estate was reviewed with senior engineers. Forty-eight ICU beds were available, comprising five 'Class N' negative pressure rooms (with antechambers for applying PPE), and 43 'Class S' standard side rooms. 4 A dedicated 'pandemic ventilation mode' prevented recirculation of potentially contaminated air throughout the ICU.Between 24 March and 13 April, the RAH admitted 65 patients with COVID-19, with 18 (28%) critically ill patients managed in the ICU. Patients were referred to ICU if requiring >4 L/min oxygen to maintain normal haemoglobin-oxygen saturation levels, or if ICU admission was indicated by conventional criteria. Patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 based on a positive RT-PCR from a nasal and/or throat swab.Demographics, ICU therapies and outcomes of this patient group are described in Table 1 .Our cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients had similar characteristics to those described elsewhere, with comparable rates of mechanical ventilation (44% of ICU patients), prone positioning (63% of ventilated patients) and mortality (50% of ventilated patients). 5, 6 Significant comorbid disease was present in 75% of those who died, including ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and diabetes.Infection control precautions make routine clinical care difficult. Donning and doffing PPE was rehearsed, and supervised clinically by a 'buddy' system, but it remains complex and time-consuming. Patient-clinician communication is hampered by the use of N95 masks, and staff communication is limited by the need for isolation rooms, with antechambers. As a result, even the most basic clinical task can be arduous.All ICU staff underwent PPE training and mask-fit testing. This developed and maintained staff competence, and ensured adequate mask-fit, across a variety of models. N95 masks and visors were not changed when caring for consecutive COVID-19 patients, in an effort to conserve supplies.We sought to make every patient interaction as time and resource efficient as possible: five-lumen central venous catheters were placed, to minimise the need for further intravenous cannulation; infusion formulations were reviewed, to minimise syringe changes; prescriptions were rationalised to once-daily, where possible; and therapeutic modalities which required infrequent laboratory testing were preferred to those requiring more frequent testing (i.e. heparin-based anticoagulation was preferred to citrate for renal-replacement therapy). Whiteboards allowed effective communication through glass, when electronic methods were unavailable or unreliable.Therapeutic procedures were enacted early and followed locally developed COVID-19 specific protocols. 7 Intubations were semi-elective using a four-person team in the patient's room with support staff outside. Turning patients prone required six staff, plus 'runners' outside. Procedures were undertaken in negative pressure rooms, with patients subsequently moved to standard rooms if required. Despite extensive training and simulation, we found all procedures to be time-consuming, and markedly complicated emergency interventions. We intend to deploy dedicated intubation and 'proning' teams if the number of patients with COVID-19 escalate.We initially supported hypoxic COVID-19 patients not requiring immediate intubation with high-flow nasal oxygen rather than non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The unintended consequence was that NIV became perceived as 'unsafe', with concerns about virus aerosolisation. Subsequently, when case definitions for COVID-19 broadened and patients suspected of having COVID-19 presented with concomitant indications for NIV (e.g. acute pulmonary oedema or chronic obstructive airways disease), there was heightened staff anxiety around offering NIV despite appropriate PPE and circuit modification. This was exacerbated by the number of stakeholders involved (Emergency Department, Thoracic Medicine, ICU), and highlighted to us the importance of a clear coordinated approach.As the incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis increased in South Australia, the RAH adopted a strict 'no visitors' policy for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID- 19. For dying patients, two visitors at a time were admittedfor mutual supportalthough neither was allowed to enter the patient's room. Relatives with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection were not allowed to visit, while those under quarantine required screening. Many patient families and ICU staff found this distressing.Telephone calls were made to families twice daily, with at least one from an ICU doctor. We established videoconferencing with families, using secure Healthdirect VideoCall software. Communicating bad news through this medium, at physical distance, and frequently with families who were themselves in self-isolation or quarantine with COVID-19 infection, was frequently emotionally challenging. The RAH ICU has established a bereavement follow-up service that has been shown to support bereaved family members at the end of life. 8 Our unpublished observations indicate that the support and feedback provided by the follow-up service were particularly valued both by loved ones, and staff, facing the challenge of end-of-life care for patients dying from COVID-19.Clear, consistent and reliable communication is a major challenge in the face of a rapidly evolving global health emergency, especially when new information (of variable quality) emerges daily. Staff frequently felt information 'overloaded' from both institutional and external sources, and the problem of a COVID-19 'infodemic' is emerging as a significant issue. 9 Furthermore, differing opinions and recommendations between hospital departments and health jurisdictions caused significant confusion and anxiety. In response, we sought to build trusted local sources of reliable information, building on the ANZICS COVID-19 guidelines.The RAH ICU established a secure departmental 'DropBox', with access restricted to ICU staff. This allowed for live updates of relevant ICU guidelines and policies by senior clinicians, with real-time 'push' notifications sent to linked mobile devices. We established a secure 'WhatsApp' group of all ICU medical staff to share promptly important communications (but not patient or confidential information). In addition, an ICU COVID-19 dashboard was established, and succinct daily briefs cascaded by email to all members of the multi-disciplinary team.We embraced institution-based teleconferencing to conduct meetings, allow governance activities to continue and provide on-going education to trainees with minimal disruption to intensive care training. 4 However, when questions about the adequacy of PPE made national news, the limits of electronic communication became clear. 10 Reassurance and explanation were best provided face-toface, through trusted trainee-supervisor relationships.The COVID-19 pandemic provoked a variable degree of anxiety and fear amongst ICU staff. 4 Staff were invited to highlight concerns, in confidence, to the senior clinical leadership team and higher risk individuals were redeployed to non-COVID-19 areas of the ICU. Unfortunately, such distinctions are not always clear-cut owing to the frequent need for ICU staff to attend to patients elsewhere in the hospital, and the frequently changing 'suspected COVID-19' case definition.In tandem, a dedicated roster of staff willing to be deployed to confirm and suspected COVID-19 areas brought clear benefits, with continuity of care and consolidation of key skills (e.g. turning patients prone). This is clearly a stressful role, and we sought to limit the number of shifts worked in our 'COVID pods', avoided rostering inexperienced staff, and made confidential counselling services available to all.Nosocomial healthcare worker infection was treated as a sentinel event, and staff involved were supported, including with funded quarantine arrangements. Notably, infection of one ICU Registered Nursewith no known community contact with COVID-19 diseaseled to 26 other healthcare professionals being required to enter 14-day quarantine. 11 Unsurprisingly, this again caused significant anxiety within our ICU. The impact of quarantining staff can clearly have major implications on resources, and we were fortunate to have several medical and nursing staff available to cover resulting staffing gaps. Ensuring separation of staff working in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinical areas may reduce the impact of any future nosocomial infection on staffing.The support and behaviour of the wider community are vital. 4 State health authorities deployed clinical pathways to triage all suspected COVID-19 cases to the RAH. Patients self-presenting to other hospitals in the region were risk-assessed and transferred to the RAH. Our ICU treatment guidelines and early clinical experience was shared across the State.The RAH ICU has been generously supported by the people of South Australiaincluding with cards from schoolchildren, letters of thanks from families affected and support from local businesses. These personal messages, and those from the hospital executive and members of government, provided valued support and helped morale during these challenging times.As South Australia's COVID-19 referral hospital, our experiences provide practical and local insights to consider alongside national guidelines. We rapidly recognised the complexity of managing uncertainty, and the importance of a coordinated and dynamic response, as we prepared for the unknown burden of critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Australia","abstract","2020-08-06",8

Plague was an unwelcome visitant, bound to take its leave one day as unexpectedly as it had come.Albert Camus (""The Plague"", 1947) The respiratory tract illness caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19; Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020) has caused substantial global health and economic impact, and the global epidemic appears far from over. COVID-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province (China) in late 2019; (Zhu et al., 2020) . By 11 March 2020 there were 100,000 cases across 114 countries leading to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020b) . By the end of April, 3 million cases and 200,000 deaths had been confirmed (World Health Organization, 2020a), with over half of the world population under stay-at-home orders (Sandford, 2020) .COVID-19 has now been characterised extensively. The average number of people each case goes on to infect (known as the effective reproduction number, R e ), for example, has been estimated as 1-6 during the early stages of the outbreak (Liu et al., 2020; Binny et al., 2020; Alimohamadi et al., 2020) . Because COVID-19 often causes mild symptoms (Day, 2020b,a) , the difference between the true and reported number of cases could be of an order of magnitude (Li et al., 2020a; Lu et al., 2020) . Fortunately, R e has since declined in many locations to less than 1 as result of social distancing, travel restrictions, contact tracing, among other mitigation efforts (Binny et al., 2020; Chinazzi et al., 2020) .At the moment of writing, different parts of the world tell contrasting stories about their struggle against COVID-19. New Zealand, Iceland, and Taiwan, for example, have fared comparatively well with smaller infection peaks and lower excess mortalities compared to many mainland countries (World Health Organization, 2020a; FT Visual & Data Journalism team, 2020) . Australia was close to elimination, but in late June a second uncontrolled outbreak began in the state of Victoria. Nevertheless the initial experience of these four countries was similar. They all responded to COVID-19 by closing their borders and requiring isolation or quarantine of those who were allowed through (Hale et al., 2020) , and either restricting or discouraging human movement (Apple, 2020) . These countries provide excellent case studies to characterise the effects of human travel on epidemic spread, a critical endeavor when facing the threat of a COVID-19 second wave and global endemicity.We have sequenced 217 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from New Zealand, and evaluated the effects of travel and movement restrictions on disease progression in New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, and Taiwan. Finally, we examined the spatiotemporal structure of New Zealand's COVID-19 epidemic, by comparing genetically identified clusters to those independently identified by public health surveillance.In the study of disease phylodynamics, a complete epidemic can be modelled as a rooted, binary phylogenetic trees whose N tips are all infected individuals (Fig. 1) , and whose characteristics and drivers we wish to uncover. In a rapidly growing epidemic the age of this tree is a good proxy for the duration of the infection in the population. Because it is seldom possible to sample the entire infected population, one instead reconstructs a subtree T from a sample of cases of size n, where n < N. This sample provides n viral genomic sequences we refer to as D, as well as each sequence's sampling date, collectively represented by vector y. D and y thus constitute the input data, and are herein referred to as the ""samples"". In the case of structured phylodynamic models, samples in y are further annotated by ""deme"" -a geographical unit such as a city, a country, or a continent. A Bayesian phylodynamic model is characterised by the following unnormalised posterior probability density function:The multitype birth-death (MTBD) model (Kühnert et al., 2016; Sciré et al., 2020 ) is a structured phylodynamic model that assumes infected (""I""; Fig. 1 ) hosts of viral lineages are organised into a set of demes (""types""), and migrate between them at rate m ( Fig. 1 ). Infected individuals transmit the infection at birth rate λ, and can be sampled (""S""; Fig. 1 ) and sequenced at sampling rate ψ, after which they are removed (""R""; Fig. 1 ) with probability r. We set r = 1 by assuming (sampled) confirmed cases are isolated and are unlikely to cause further infections. Removal without sampling happens at death rate µ (Fig. 1 ).Here, ""death"" refers to anything causing hosts to no longer be infectious, including recovery, host death or behavioural changes (e.g., self-isolation).The probability density function of T under the MTBD sampling distribution (Kühnert et al., 2016) and its parameters θ τ is given by:where π G represents the frequency of lineages in each deme at the root, and O is tree T 's age.The MTBD model is reparameterised into a computationally and epidemiologically convenient form, with new parameters R e = λ µ+ψr , b = µ + ψr and s = ψ ψ+µ . R e is the disease's effective reproductive number, which is closely related to the basic reproduction number (Stadler et al., 2013) , with both being equal at the onset of the epidemic. b is the rate at which individuals become non-infectious, and s is the probability of an individual being a sample (out of all removed individuals). The phylodynamic tree prior under this parameterisation is:Under our MTBD model, R e , b, s, and m are estimated across a series of time intervals (and held constant within intervals) defined by time boundaries t, with t 0 < t 1 < . . . < t f . t is not estimated here (see below andS upplementary material for more details), but fixed at epidemiologically informed dates, or dates derived from a human mobility model; t 0 is the beginning of the infection, and t f is both the last sampling time and the end of the last interval ( Fig. 1 ). Time intervals are both parameter-and deme-specific.Finally, we consider four independent geographical models, each characterised by two demes: a target island deme (New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, or Taiwan; referred to as the ""I S"" deme) and a mutually exclusive ""rest-of-the-world"" deme (""RW""), which contributes samples from other countries in the world.All RW parameters are considered nuisance parameters.Phylodynamic analyses can be carried out with a range of different models. In order to determine how robust our estimates are to model choice, we analysed our SARS-CoV-2 genomic datasets (see below) with three models in addition to MTBD: (i) a simple discrete phylogeography model that treats demes in the same fashion as molecular sites (""DPG"", Lemey et al., 2009) , (ii) a discrete phylogeography model with two time intervals (""DPG2""), and (iii) a structured coalescent model (""SC"", Müller et al., 2018) . A brief description of these models and their results can be found in the Supplementary materials.We sequenced and assembled 217 New Zealand SARS-CoV-2 genomes that are now available on GISAID (Shu and McCauley, 2017) , which provided the remaining 3000+ genome sequences analysed here. Due to computational limitations, we subsampled GISAID sequences as follows: (i) two different subsample sizes (""small"" vs. ""large""), with 200 and 500 RW sequences, and (ii) two sample selection methods (""time"" vs.""active"") that chose sequences uniformly across time, or proportionally to the number of active cases over time. Up to 250 sequences from the IS deme are included in each alignment (where more than 250 were available, we subsampled them using the respective sampling method).Permutating the two options above yields four subsampling protocols (detailed in the Supplementary materials), which were applied to the four IS demes, generating a total of 16 SARS-CoV-2 alignments (30 kb long, 0.3% ambiguous sites on average). Each alignment consists of sequences from one of the four islands (I S) and from the rest of the world (RW).With the goal of characterising the decrease in human movement over the weeks our SARS-CoV-2 samples were collected, we employed a Bayesian hierarchical sigmoidal model for the analysis of mobile phone data (Apple, 2020; Fig. 2 ). This analysis revealed that human movement generally decreased in all four islands, with Taiwan being the first to show a declining trend among the islands, but also the least pronounced one. New Zealand, Australia, and Iceland underwent a marked decline in human movement during March 2020, with a slight recovery starting around mid-April.This analysis informed the three epoch model for R e . The first interval for R e ranged from the origin t 0 to the first reported case in each IS at t 1 . The second describes normal human mobility and ranged from t 1 to the date of mobility reduction t 2 (shown for each IS in Fig. 2) . The third ranged from t 2 to the final sample at t f and describes a period of reduced human movement.We estimated R e as 1-2 during the early infection of each respective country and later at less than 1 after human mobility decreased (see credible intervals in Fig. 3 ). These estimates were not sensitive to sampling strategies. Each island IS saw multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from the rest of the world RW ( Fig. 4 and 5) . Under MTBD, we estimated the mean number of sample sequence introductions to be 63, 87, 49, and 65 for New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, and Taiwan, respectively. Conversely, we estimated just one virus export event in each country. Similar results were observed using the SC model, with neither SC nor MTBD producing drastically different estimates between subsampling strategies.We estimated the substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2 as approximately 9.4 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year, across the four phylodynamic models, the four islands, and the ""small-time"" subsampling method.The New Zealand Ministry of Health (NZMH) defines a significant COVID-19 cluster to comprise ten or more cases connected through transmission, and who are not all part of the same household (New Zealand Ministry of Health, 2020). Five of these clusters are represented by five or more of our samples (Fig. 4a and   c) , with a sixth non-significant cluster.The most stringent definition of a phylogenetic cluster is a group of reciprocally monophyletic samples sharing the same outbreak identifying label. By this standard, only one of the six epidemiological clusters (i.e., six different labels), Matamata, was recovered from genetic data (Fig. 4) .Less stringently, one can define a phylogenetic cluster as a clade that contains all samples sharing a label, with only a single introduction into a focal deme being invoked. Under this definition (i) case exports are allowed, (ii) isolated labelled tips outside of the clade are considered type-1 contract tracing mismatches, and (iii) unlabelled tips that are both from the focal deme and placed within the clade are considered type-2 mismatches. Using this definition, all clusters identified by NZMH were recovered (among those represented by our samples). However, there were five type-1 mismatches: two from an Auckland-based cluster, one from Christchurch, one from Queenstown, and one from Bluff (shown by arrows in Fig. 4) . We estimated 18 type-2 mismatches.We explored the introduction and transmission history of COVID-19 in New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, and Taiwan -geographically isolated countries that were initially successful in preventing this disease from wreaking havoc as extensively it did in other parts of the world. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced into each island on many independent occasions, corroborating the available epidemiological data from health officials (Supplementary materials). Viral imports rapidly declined after the respective islands closed their borders around 20 March 2020 ( Fig. 4 and 5) . Closing borders played a significant role in limiting the spread of COVID-19.We estimated effective reproduction numbers, R e , as approximately 1-2 at the onset of the pandemic in all four islands. These estimates are not as high as in other countries where the pandemic was more widespread and where R e was typically estimated in the range of 2-6 (Liu et al., 2020; Binny et al., 2020; Alimohamadi et al., 2020) . Our low estimates reflect the fact that a large fraction of cases in these countries were travel-related imports, and that community transmission rates were low. R e declined as human movement decreased in each of the countries studied, reaching values below 1.0 (Fig. 3) .The case of Taiwan illustrates that an extreme restriction of domestic human movement -officially mandated or otherwise -is not necessarily required for suppressing a pandemic like COVID-19. Instead, extensive contact tracing and the widespread use of face masks in Taiwan were likely key factors . However, a stringent response against COVID-19 greatly restricting mobility such as that adopted by New Zealand is likely to have contributed to the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 by May 9 (Cousins, 2020) . New Zealand was the first country with over 1,000 confirmed cases to return to zero active cases, allowing it to re-open its economy, albeit with a still closed border. Most importantly, human morbidity and mortality were limited. Conversely, while Australia also saw a decline in human mobility and initially enjoyed some measure of success against COVID-19, its more lenient approach might underlie this country's ongoing struggle to fully eliminate SARS-CoV-2, as exemplified by the emergence of a second community-transmission led epidemic in the state of Victoria (Dexter, 2020) .Positive outcomes against this and similar pandemics will be dependent on a plethora of factors that must include human movement, but also population density, enforcement of social distancing, hygienic practices such as the use of face masks, the efficiency of contact tracing, high testing rates, and timely border closure. However, none of these should be seen as a silver bullet.Nonetheless, contact tracing has its limitations. Establishing the link between cases is restricted, for example, by the ability of cases to recall their recent contacts and travel history, which can lead to type-2 mismatches between epidemiological and genetic clusters. Furthermore, a case may have attended an event causally linked to a cluster but acquired their infection elsewhere and did not infect anyone at the event (type-1 mismatches). The implications of these types of error are manifold. If cluster sizes are underestimated, then so too is the rate of disease spread. If the extent of import-related cases is overestimated, then the impact of international air travel and the extent of community transmission cannot be fully accounted for. Indeed, our results suggest there are an additional 18 unclassified cases in New Zealand that could have been linked to known clusters but were not, and 5 cases that were linked to a cluster where they did not acquire or transmit the infection. However, by and large, our phylodynamic analysis is in agreement with conclusions reached by NZMH.Overall, we have shown that contact tracing has been accurate among the cases considered, and succeeded to a large degree in identifying individuals belonging to the same infection cluster. We have demonstrated how the rapid real-time availability and assessment of viral genomic data can complement and augment health surveillance strategies. Genome sequencing is increasingly affordable and shared global surveillance resources such as NextStrain and GISAID are becoming more complete and useful.We advocate incorporating modern methods of genetic epidemiology into standard contact tracing and epidemic surveillance in order to ensure COVID-19 and future epidemics leave as promptly as they come.","New Zealand","abstract","2020-08-06",8

This includes measures pertaining to patient, medical staff and device(s) used. Skin preparation prior to treatment, disinfection of the EBD used, plume and aerosol management, as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff form the main pillars.This review is aimed to set guidance for risk reduction to patients and staff when EBD (including lasers and cautery) are utilised to treat dermatologic and/or aesthetic conditions. The chosen treatment modality by the healthcare professional depends on multiple factors with patient safety lying at its core component. These factors include the presenting problem or treatment desire, its' severity and impact on the patient, along with the patient's risk of contracting COVID-19 disease. Other important factors are the specific clinic circumstances, including levels and type of PPE available, the vulnerability of any staff members to severe COVID-19 infection, the level of community transmission of the virus, and any current government or regulatory restrictions/requirements.With advances in COVID-19 testing, in particular should serological tests to determine acquired immunity become available, patient workup, measures and services are likely to evolve with time. At present, all patients and staff should be considered potentially infective and/or susceptible to infection and as such measures should be based on this assumption. Screening of patients and general clinic considerations have been well covered. 1,2COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped singlestranded RNA virus. 3, 4 Its potential in humans to cause a severe and potentially fatal inflammatory respiratory and systemic disease necessitates extra precautions in the absence of an effective treatment and vaccine availability. 4 Nosocomial COVID-19 infections have occurred worldwide irrespective of geographical and racial differences, highlighting the risks to both patient and health-care worker. 5 Viral shedding is greatest during the early phase of the disease and may include a pre-symptomatic infectious period of several days. 6, 7 Whilst the role of asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission remains uncertain, given a potentially high rate of silent asymptomatic infection, COVID-19 precautions are required while community transmission is established or evolving.Human-to-human spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be via droplets and aerosols, where the virus can survive for several hours; 8 these may be inhaled or deposited on mucosal surfaces. In addition, self-inoculation through the mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth may contribute to the hand-to-face spread of virus that has persisted and survived on surfaces. 8, 9 The stability of SARS-CoV-2 varies from few hours on porous fomites (e.g. paper, wood and cloth) to 4 or more days on smooth surfaces (e.g. plastic, glass and metal). 8, 9, 10 The basic principles of cleaning and disinfecting are valid for SARS-CoV-2, and the level of PPE precautions, needs to take into account staff, the patient, the procedure and device risks involved. 10, 11 Cosmetic treatments may pose a particular risk given the high number of treatments involving the face. The mouth, nose and mucosal surfaces represent a particular infectious risk given the higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Treatment to the neck and chest may also involve prolonged periods of close proximity (15 min or longer) to the face. This, associated with the known risks of aerosolgenerating procedures in other medical areas, 8, 11, 12 and their potential for transmission, need to be considered and appropriate precautions taken with aerosol or plume generating treatments.Regular hand washing for at least 20 s including interdigital spaces, wrists and nail folds with soap and water remains the key method to reduce virus transmission. 13 A reasonable alternative includes 70% alcohol-based hand rubs. This needs to be done before and after patient contact, including postremoval of PPE (gloves included). Touching of the face, in particular areas around the eyes, nose and mouth is strongly discouraged. 13 Ideally, surfaces and EBD equipment should be cleaned initially with a detergent and then disinfected (e.g. 70-80% alcohol or sodium hypochlorite 0.05-0.1%). 9,10 Alternative biocidal products are available (many combine both detergent action plus disinfection): https://echa.europa.eu/c ovid-19. 14 Surfaces must stay wet for the entire labelled contact or dwell time of the product for disinfection. 14 For low touch, minimal organic matter contamination, surfaces, such as laser touch screens, their cleaning between each patients with a disinfectant such as minimum 70% alcohol may be sufficient, whilst for a handpiece contaminated by gel/ organic matter, cleaning then disinfecting between patients remains necessary. To minimise any potential damage to EBD, it is important to check the compatibility of the cleaning or disinfecting product used. Whilst alcohol is appropriate for most laser and EBD surfaces, sodium hypochlorite or bleach in particular may damage some medical equipment.Patients should be screened based on current public health guidance including making telephone or telehealth contact prior to patient attendance with repeat screening on arrival to the clinic. 1 This includes but is not limited to asking patients if they have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, along with COVID-19 symptom screening including acute respiratory symptoms, fever, headache and recent loss of smell. Enquiry should also encompass recent (last 14 days) international or cruise ship travel along with any close contact with a suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, or an individual required to isolate. On arrival to the clinic, these screening questions are repeated, alcohol hand rub utilised, social distancing followed where possible and practical and non-contact infrared patient temperature measured. 1Skin preparation is important for addressing potential contamination particularly before any potential plume or aerosol-generating treatments. First, remove all creams, make up, etc., from the skin to be treated; have the patient wash these areas with soap and water, or cleanser, for more than 20 s. This should be followed by the application of an appropriate biocidal agent, particularly when treating the hands (forearms) or head and neck. Alcohol (isopropyl-or ethyl-70%) +/À chlorhexidine 0.05-0.1% or povidone-iodine (7.5-10%) have proven SARS-CoV-2 antisepsis activity with standard dwell times. 9,10 All act relatively rapid (alcohol less than 30 s). Unlike alcohol and povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine has the added advantage of binding to the stratum corneum providing sustained or residual activity. Alternative agents for skin anti-sepsis include benzylkonium chloride 0.05-0.2% and hydrogen peroxide (less than 1%). 9, 10 Awareness and enquiries on previous allergic reactions to any anti-microbials are recommended. Viral RNA has been found in aerosols (plus sink and toilet basins) of COVID-19 patient bathrooms, making it prudent to disinfect wash basins after use. 15 Povidone-iodine is a chromophore and needs to be thoroughly removed after adequate dwell time with sterile water when using a 532-1064nm laser device.Potential aerosol-generating dermatology procedures include • All laser plumes and electrosurgical treatments (cautery). • Medical gases such as nitrous oxide delivered using a mask system also poses greater aerosol risks than, for example single use mouthpiece demand systems. • Cryotherapy (unknown risk).Plumes produced by vaporising tissue, in particular ablative lasers (CO2, Er:YAG & Er:YSGG) and electrosurgery, need special consideration including the risks of bio-microparticles and their potential to transmit viable virus. 16, 17, 18, 19 The importance of reducing risks of inhalation of particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) in medicine is highlighted by its proven respiratory and cardiovascular risks. A postulated increase in infection and severe COVID-19 infection risk has been linked to higher PM 2.5 air pollution levels. 20 Use of a laser-rated or N95/P2 mask should be considered in these circumstances. In addition, the use of a plume scavenging system (suction nozzle within 5cm from treatment site with high-efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA) or ultra-low penetration air filters (ULPA)) is required. 14, 15, 16 Ideally, consider having a HEPA filter included in your AC system or your laser laboratory air purifier and/or combined with a carbon filter for volatile toxic organic chemicals. 16, 18, 19 Plume scavenging systems may not be as effective for picosecond and Q-switched lasers due to the speed of particle ejection, making room air HEPA filtering systems relatively more important when using these devices. 16 Ensure you follow good infection control precautions when handling and changing these filters.In cases of non-aerosol and laser plume generating treatments, normal surgical masks appear to provide some SARS-CoV-2 protection although these should not be relied on for higher risk laser and electrosurgery plume exposures or procedures as discussed above. 11 In addition to protective eyewear, consider a face shield particularly when using ablative, picosecond, and Qswitched lasers or devices requiring potential aerosol-generating air cooling systems. Consider wearing surgical caps, gloves and work scrubs (disposable gowns for significant aerosol-generating procedures). All staff should be trained and competent in using PPE correctly, including its safe removal and disposal. Significant facial hair reduces the seal efficacy of surgical masks; consider a facial hairfree COVID-19 period for added safety.Acetone is a defatting agent with some anti-microbial actions, though insufficient for adequate skin anti-sepsis. When used for skin preparation, this should be combined with a separate treatment, for example 70% isopropyl-alcohol.Patients should be encouraged to wash the skin areas to be treated with soap/cleanser and water for at least 20 s prior to attending for their treatments (including their hair if adjacent to the prospective treated area) and refrain from touching their face or treatment area from then until their therapy.Ensure all eye protection used is either disposable or disinfected between patients, but avoid shared elastic straps. Avoid chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite when disinfecting metal eye shields due to potential ocular toxicity.It is currently unknown whether postablative fractionated laser resurfaced or photodynamic therapy-treated skin or mucosa is at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a theoretical risk that respiratory droplets or aerosols and fomite transfer containing SARS-CoV-2 landing on, or being transferred to inflamed and broken skin and/or mucous membrane barrier, could increase infection transmission risk. Post-EBD treatments, patients are often encouraged to regularly cleanse and apply topical agents. As a result, the risk of frequent touching of their face with their hands needs to be considered.Counselling patients regarding the potential safety benefits of cleaning/ disinfecting and controlling their environment during the initial healing period. Patients should be instructed to wash their hands prior to application of any skincare products; these products should not be shared with anyone else. Hypochlorous and acetic acid wound solutions have been shown to have anti-microbial benefits and are often recommended postablative treatments to control skin microbes; there are, however, no scientific studies into their SARS-CoV-2 activity.COVID-19 currently needs to be considered in the clinic set-up along with the planning, treatment and post-treatment care of patients utilising EBD procedures. This involves extra precautions to keep both the patient and staff safe. Thorough explanation and counselling of patients undertaking procedures carrying significant COVID-19 transmission risk should be undertaken. Lack of access to appropriate PPE may result in reputational damage, and medicolegal risks should a staff member or patient contract COVID-19. There remains no specific proven anti-viral therapy for COVID-19, making containment and prevention of spread crucial. The high number of nosocomial COVID-19 disease cases in health-care workers around the world highlights the transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 in medical settings. 4 Most of these measures to mitigate risk represent adherence to good clinical practice with regard to infectious disease, laser and laser plus electrosurgical plume safety precautions and practices.","Australia","first author","2020-08-19",8

This is the third significant emergence in the 21st century of a novel human coronavirus. 1,2 SARS-CoV-2 has already had a substantially wider impact in terms of cases and both social and economic disruption. At the time of submission of this paper, there have been over 3 750 000 confirmed cases and 260 000 deaths. 3 The rising number of cases has necessitated a robust response at a national, regional and local level.Effective utilisation of the time between identifying the risk and the subsequent outbreak is fundamental to mitigating the short-and long-term challenges of a pandemic. It allows the opportunity to strengthen preexisting surveillance and reporting systems and establish surge capacity. 4 Infectious disease (ID) physicians, through their training and experience, perform a pivotal role in directing this response. 5 To be successful, such a response requires the gathering and assessment of rapidly changing information to produce guidelines and recommendations, in order to build capacity within healthcare systems and formulate an overarching public health response. An effective response also helps to safeguard healthcare workers, buffering the long-term psychological and occupational effects of a prolonged outbreak. 6 However, the recognition of the importance of this interval and the urgent nature of the task has magnified the associated pressure on ID physicians.Furthermore, several agents have been suggested as potential treatment options for patients. 7 However, perceptions of efficacy may be influenced by limited knowledge of the natural history of the pathogen coupled with physicians' desires to treat their patient with any available tools. This creates a tension between clinicians who advocate conducting research to identify truly efficacious treatments and those who advocate empirical therapy as part of routine care. 8 We aimed to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the workload and psychosocial outlook of ID physicians in Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of this pandemic, including their treatment intentions and research equipoise.We conducted a survey of ID physicians in Australia and New Zealand. Respondents were contacted through an established Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases (ASID) online mailing list, OZbug. 9 ASID is the professional body for ID physicians and clinical microbiologists in Australasia. Approximately 600 ID physicians, including advanced specialty trainees, are members of ASID. A web-based data collection tool (Survey Monkey, Palo Alto, CA USA) was utilised to collect de-identified data from ID physicians in Australia and New Zealand over the period from 3 to 10 March 2020 (full survey available in Supporting Information Data S1). The adapted CHERRIES checklist for the reporting of electronic surveys, 10 including additional details of this survey's design, piloting and administration are available in Data S2. Data collected included speciality (adult infectious diseases vs paediatric infectious diseases vs clinical microbiology with infectious diseases), country, size and setting (metropolitan vs regional) of hospital, years of experience post-commencement of advanced speciality training, full time equivalent (FTE) worked in medicine and FTE fraction worked in ID, and membership of relevant outbreak-related committees at the hospital, health district, state, and national level. FTE was employed as a marker of time worked, with 1.0 FTE equating to a 40-h working week.Respondents were asked to estimate how many hours they spent in the month of February on various categories of SARS-CoV-2 related activities (Table 2) , and whether they had to work outside normal hours. Fivepoint Likert scale questions, with response options ranging from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree', were utilised to assess respondents' agreement with a range of statements ( Fig. 1 ).In addition, respondents were asked to report their intended usage of lopinavir/ritonavir for proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were asked whether they plan to prescribe it to all confirmed cases; confine its use to patients with severe disease (e.g. those Figure 1 Demonstrates the percentage of agreement, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, to several statements. requiring non-invasive ventilation or ICU admission); use it only as part of a clinical trial; or not use it altogether. Respondents could also supply a free-text response; these were regrouped where appropriate.Respondents were asked whether they would have equipoise to randomise usage of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine among all hospitalised patient and among those with severe disease.Data were analysed using Excel ® 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and Stata/IC 11.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Excel ® 2013 was used for data collation, cleaning and descriptive statistics. Stata/ IC 11.2 was used for all other statistical analyses. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with working overtime (with the number of days in which they worked outside normal hours grouped as 0, 1-2, 2-3 and >4), and Likert responses. In the regression analysis, the explanatory variables were made binary: years of experience ('less experienced' and 'more experienced', with ≤15 and >15 yearsexperience post-commencement of advanced specialty training, respectively), location (Australia vs New Zealand), hospital size ('small' and 'large', with ≤500 vs > 500 beds, respectively) and committee membership (member vs non-member) (Fig. 2) . P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.We received 302 responses (50% of 600 eligible participants). Eighty-eight of these responses were excluded: 80 due to incomplete data, four were from non-ID physicians, and four were located outside of Australasia. Data were, thus, available for 214 respondents (36% of 600 eligible participants).Respondent characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The majority of physicians were located in Australia (92%) and worked in metropolitan settings (84%). Adult ID was the most commonly reported subspecialty (66%). Ten percent were paediatric ID physicians. Paediatric ID physicians worked in smaller hospitals than their adult ID counterparts, with 17 of 18 (94%) working in hospitals with 200-500 beds. Membership of a COVID-19 related committee was high (59%), but this figure was lower for physicians earlier in their career (<5 years; 15/45, 33%).A total of 8850 h was spent on SARS-CoV-2 over the month of February. This is equivalent to a median of Figure 2 Ordinal regression analysis comparing Likert responses (comparator vs reference group) to key statements. A higher odds ratio in this figure indicates an increased likelihood that the comparator group, compared with the reference group, agrees with the statement. A lower odds ratio indicates an increased likelihood that the comparator group disagrees with the statement. Table 2 . Physicians spent a median 34% (interquartile range 18-68%) of their FTE in ID on SARS-CoV-2-related activities.Nearly three-quarters (159/214, 74.3%) of respondents stayed late at work more than 1 day/week, with 33% (70/214) working late more than 3 days a week. New Zealand employment (odds ratio (OR) 3.16, P = 0.012 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-7.79)) and committee membership (OR 2.41, P = 0.001 (95% CI 1.42-4.09)) were significantly associated with spending more time working outside of normal hours.Of the respondents, 23.4% (50/214) agreed that they have previous extensive involvement in managing potential cases in an outbreak of similar scale. More experienced physicians (OR 6.37, P < 0.001 (95% CI 3.63-11.24)), those who worked in a hospital with >500 beds (OR 1.95, P = 0.017 (95% CI 1.13-3.38) and members of a committee (OR 3.18, P < 0.001 (95% CI 1.79-5.63)) were significantly more likely to agree with this statement.Previous extensive involvement in preparing for potential cases in an outbreak of similar scale was reported by 33% (70/214). Variables significantly associated with agreement were being a more experienced physician (OR 10.05, P < 0.001 (95% CI 5.56-18.18)), working in a large hospital (OR 3.02, P = 0.042 (95% CI 1.02-3.02)) and committee membership (OR 2.75, P < 0.001 (95% CI 1.57-4.81)).The majority of respondents (192/214, 90%) stated that their senior level hospital administrators are taking COVID-19 seriously. Almost two-thirds also agree that ASID has responded adequately (64%, 137/214).When asked about their national response, 95 of the 212 responses (45%) agreed that it was well coordinated. Australian respondents were four times more likely to agree that their national response was well coordinated compared to New Zealand respondents (OR 4.16, P = 0.002, 95% CI 1.71-10.15). In this metric, 7 of the 18 (39%) New Zealand respondents reported that they disagreed with this statement. Of the remainder, 10 were neutral and one did not respond.When giving testing and management advice, 88% (188/213) believe they are well informed. Concerning infection with SARS-CoV-2, 41% (88/214) of respondents were worried they would become infected through occupational exposure. More experienced physicians were twice as likely to agree with this statement (OR 1.99, P = 0.013 (95% CI 1.16-3.41). Physicians in New Zealand were significantly less worried about becoming infected (OR 0.32, P = 0.017 (95% CI 0.12-0.82). Similarly, being a member of a committee was also significantly associated with less concern (OR 0.55, P = 0.03 (95% CI 0.32-0.94). A similar proportion (99/214, 46%) was worried about passing infection onto family and friends. This was less of a concern for physicians in New Zealand (OR 0.31, P = 0.017 (95% CI 0.12-0.81)) and physicians who were committee members (OR 0.56, P = 0.039 (95% CI 0.33-0.97)). Of the respondents, 23% (49/214) agreed that they have changed their socialising and travel patterns. A higher percentage, 53% (113/214), agreed that they have changed future travel plans.Around half (116/214, 54%) of respondents intended to reserve the use of lopinavir/ritonavir for those with severe COVID-19 (defined as requiring intensive care or non-invasive ventilation). Only 7% (14/214) of respondents intended to use lopinavir/ritonavir in all patients with confirmed COVID-19 with a small number (7, 3%) intending to follow a unit lead decision and 2% (6/214) gave an uncategorised response.The majority of respondents indicated there was clinical equipoise to conduct a randomised trial of lopinavir/ ritonavir although there was differing opinion with regards to severity of disease as inclusion criteria (Fig. 3) . The majority were undecided with regards to a clinical trial of chloroquine.On a day-to-day level, ID physicians provide a wide range of services, including guiding judicious antibiotic usage, directing infection control practice and providing direct patient management. 11 In an outbreak setting, this role expands to meet the increased need, focussed on developing a multifaceted response. During this critical time, ID physicians in Australia and New Zealand spent a significant amount number of hours on SARS-CoV-2-related activities, equating a median of 34% of all their FTE in ID for that month. Unsurprisingly, physicians who were members of SARS-CoV-2-related committees devoted more time to this endeavour.Increasing the number of hours worked, especially outside the normal hours, is associated with burn-out, even given the protective effect of a professional interest. 12 Nearly three-quarters of ID physicians spent more time working outside of normal working at least one additional day per week during the month of February. Furthermore, almost one-third stayed late more than 3 days a week. New Zealand respondents were more likely to stay late, reflecting the smaller number of specialists available. The FTE a physician had allotted to ID did not significantly alter this finding. As a consequence, New Zealand ID physicians and those with smaller amounts of FTE are at higher risk of burning out. It is important to note that our survey was carried out in the preparatory stage of the pandemic in Australasia, and ID physician workloads are likely to have since increased substantially. This has clear implications for human resources management and staff well-being.Experience and training are crucial when guiding outbreak preparation and management. ID physicians later in their career reported more experience with similar outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS and 2009 pandemic influenza. The majority of respondents felt wellinformed, with those further in their career tending to respond even more favourably. Furthermore, the majority of later-career ID physicians, including those with direct pandemic experience, were members of committees. ID physicians early in their career were less likely to be part of a committee, potentially missing out on an important opportunity to gain invaluable experience. An important fact to note is that the majority of ID physicians in our sample, especially those with experience with outbreaks of similar nature, work in large metropolitan hospitals, clustering knowledge and experience away from smaller regional centres. It is important that these physicians continue to offer guidance and support to their less experienced and poorer-resourced colleagues. Facilitating such links will also be of benefit even after the COVID-19 pandemic is over, by improving collegiality and ensuring sustainability of ID services in smaller hospitals.Leadership and support are needed at both local and national levels to facilitate effective preparation. 4 ID physicians mostly agree that their senior hospital administrators are taking SARS-CoV-2 seriously and that ASID, the Australasian specialist society for ID physicians and medical microbiologists, had responded appropriately.The lower positive report rate of 45% regarding the effectiveness of the national response is not unexpected. It is difficult to respond swiftly to an outbreak with multiple unknowns and rapidly evolving information. It is expected that this metric will improve as policies and approaches become more clearly delineated. Experienced physicians were more likely to assess their government response favourably, recognising the difficulty of the situation and their role in preparation. ID physicians in New Zealand responded particularly unfavourably to this question. This is likely multi-factorial, but principally influenced by the limited pool of specialists to guide their national approach and the consequent immensity of this task. One step that may strengthen outbreak responses is the establishment of a national body, such as a Centre for Disease Control. This central coordinating and advisory body, as a repository of epidemiological and clinical expertise, would allow for more efficient dissemination of guidelines and policies, reducing the current duplication of effort and, importantly, allow a more consistent regional and national approach. This body would need to be adequately funded and politically supported to be effective. The importance of this backing is underlined by the contrasting performance of similar bodies in other jurisdictions at this stage of the pandemic, such as the United States, New Zealand and South Korea. Additionally, in Australia, it would require legislative change as many powers are currently decentralised to the state level.The SARs-CoV-1 outbreak in the early 2000s highlighted physicians' concern about getting infected through their work. In our study, 41% were worried about being infected, while 46% were worried about infecting friends and family. ID physicians further in their career were more concerned about getting infected. This finding may be explained by the older ages of more experienced physicians, and the fact that age is a risk factor for adverse outcomes. 13 The proportion of ID physicians with concerns about being infected and infecting friends and family is considerably lower than those reported by paediatricians in Australia and New Zealand. 14 In comparison, 86% of paediatricians were worried about becoming infected SARS-CoV-2 through their work and 92% transmitting the infection to others. The variation in concern may be partially explained by differing levels of exposure risk and knowledge. This is supported by our finding that membership of a committee was associated with less concern about being infected. Interestingly, ID physicians in New Zealand tended to be less worried about infection, despite their concerns about the adequacy of their national response. This may reflect a high degree of trust in their healthcare system, 15 and is an issue that could be explored further in their local context.As demonstrated in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, balancing research and medical care during an outbreak can pose an ethical quandary. 16 The Declaration of Helsinki states that research should be conducted 'only to the extent that (it) is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects'. 16, 17 The evidence for treatments for COVID-19 remains limited. Building on a potential benefit in SARS-CoV-1 18 and MERS, 19 as well as early case reports, 20 lopinavir/ritonavir was put forward as a potential treatment option. Despite a lack of robust evidence, over 50% of ID physicians in our sample intended to use lopinavir/ritonavir in severe disease. At the time of the survey, there were no published data on the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19. Since then, Cao et al. published a randomised controlled trial of lopinavir/ritonavir among 199 participants that did not demonstrate a benefit for lopinavir/ritonavir. 21 The rapid release and publication of data may mean that the respondent answers to this question about lopinavir/ ritonavir may be different at the time of writing.There was a similar level of equipoise for further investigational work. It is unclear at this juncture which groups will potentially benefit from intervention, and which interventions are most efficacious. The number of unknowns is significant but this survey supports the appetite ID physicians have for randomised clinical trials to determine the best possible therapies.Our study had several limitations. Firstly, it was conducted at a single time point and is a simplification of a complex situation. Secondly, there may have been a degree of response bias as more motivated physicians are more likely to respond. In addition, physicians that were heavily involved in SARS-CoV-2-related activities, may not have had time to complete the survey. Nevertheless, the response and completion rates were high and there were respondents from multiple jurisdictions, hospital settings, and levels of experience, which increases the representativeness of the sample.SARS-CoV-2 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on Australian and New Zealand ID physicians. They have risen to challenge, spending a significant amount of time on pandemic-related activities. However, without support, this response may not Impact of COVID-19 on ID physicians Internal Medicine Journal 50 (2020) 924-930 be sustainable. Furthermore, there were concerns expressed about the national response in both Australia and New Zealand. We advocate for the establishment of a national body to coordinate future responses.","Australia","abstract","2020-08-06",8

Due to the disruption caused by Covid-19 we took the opportunity to ask them additional questions on the impact of the 6-week lockdown on their weight loss journey. Of the 229 participants who had completed the initial survey, 58 responded to the additional COVID-19 impact survey. We assessed the representativeness of these 58 respondents by age, gender, education, and marital status, and thematically summarised the issues they described.Participants had a good age distribution (18-39 years: 21%; 40-55years 41%; 56year and above: 38%), but were skewed towards higher education (45% had Bachelor degree or higher), English-speaking (88%), mostly women (81%), and married or living with partners (76%). Most participants had a self-reported weight above healthy ranges (82%), with most within the range of obesity (62%). The majority (60%) of the participants indicated that their diet strategy for weight loss had been impacted, and a little over half the participants (52%) said their exercise strategy had been impacted over this period. A thematic summary of issues is shown in Table 1 .Many of the issues raised by our participants were similar to those issues highlighted in the general population(1) as well as patients with obesity(2, 3), with reports of high levels of 'stress eating' and 'eating out of boredom', followed by 'higher food consumption' 'more opportunities to eat', and 'higher consumption of junk foods'. The (1). We also know from previous research that major life events such as marriage, pregnancy, stressful life events(4) and even seasonal holidays (5) disrupt the usual diet and exercise behaviours of people. These events affect ability to regulate our weight and subsequently have a profound effect on lifetime weight history. Therefore, the influences of lockdown periods on weight trajectories cannot be underestimated.Our sample of higher-educated participants are likely to be better equipped at maintaining appropriate weight-related behaviours having embarked on selfmanaged weight loss journeysyet were overwhelmed in lockdown. This highlights a need to develop specific weight management guidelines that address the unique pressures brought about on people during lockdowns. Quarantine specific programs and resources should be in place, which can be immediately picked up and recommended during such situations by health professionals that are advising people with obesity. Practical suggestions (1), should be embedded in lifestyle guidelines and strategies during a quarantine. In the short term, this should include advice on types of foods to take to lock down, mindful meal preparation, eating regularity, and use of treat foods. There also needs to be a broader range of options available to people to exercise from home. Social exercising stands out as an important strategy for those trying to self-manage their weight. However, apart from online exercise classes, which are only really appealing to a certain segments of the population(6) -it is necessary to find novel approaches to maintain the social nature of exercise while physical distancing. However, in the longer term, detrimental responses to lifestyle stresses such as social distancing lockdowns will only be attenuated when the food and activity environments are improved to be more supportive of healthful eating and active living under a variety of circumstances.

For countries with under resourced health systems, limited water supply, suboptimal sanitation and hygiene facilities, and aging populations, the ability to vaccinate against COVID-19 would be cause for public health celebration. Acceptance of the vaccine is important to its success and with the rise of the antivaxxer movement, increasing public education and awareness is urgently needed. Samoa can be used an example of the impact of a vaccine preventable disease on an under vaccinated population, there were 81 reported deaths and 5,675 reported cases 2 of measles from an epidemic in 2019.Although no inquiry into the government's management of the outbreak was approved or conducted, several weaknesses were highlighted in the public media. These included delays in declaring the outbreak and state of emergency, unavailability of measles diagnostic tests locally, poor communication and leadership, lack of a decentralized vaccination response and among some the cultural preference for traditional healers. Additional significant challenges were the misinformation on vaccinations that was largely promoted by anti-vaxxers on social media; and public mistrust after the tragic deaths of two babies one year earlier after receiving a mixture of the MMR vaccine and an expired anesthetic 3 . Although the deaths were found to be due to human error, the combination of misinformation and mistrust contributed in part to people seeking medical attention and treatment late. In response to anti-vaxxer promotion activities, the government imposed fines and potential jail penalties for persons who actively attempted to dissuade people from receiving vaccines. One person was charged with incitement against the Samoan Government's vaccination order and the case will be seen by the courts later in 2020. 4 Unfortunately, penalties do not change anti-vaxxer sentiment but drive the discussion underground, with studies indicating that social networking applications such as Facebook can be used to spread misinformation. 5 To stem the epidemic, the government implemented a mass vaccination campaign across Samoa vaccine is an unknown time away, but involving the anti-vaxxer community now is imperative to high vaccine acceptability when it is discovered.","Samoa","abstract","2020-08-28",8

At the time of writing, there have been over eight million confirmed cases with over 450,000 deaths worldwide [1] . As the novel virus moves through the population, it is inevitable that people with concurrent severe illness also become infected. We present a case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and the progress of both illnesses through intensive induction chemotherapy. A review of the existing literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection in the immunocompromised patient is also presented.A previously fit and healthy 54-year-old Maori woman presented to a secondary care hospital with a 10-day history of increasing fatigue and three days of progressive fevers, dyspnoea, headache, myalgias, and dry cough. She denied anosmia. The only significant medical history was pT1c grade 2 breast cancer treated with surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy in 2013. There was no family history of haematological malignancy. She was an ex-smoker with a 15 pack-year history.On examination, the patient had pallor with mild tachycardia (115 bpm), low pulse oximetry [90% on Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO 2 ) 21%], and tachypnoea (24/min). She required 1-2 L of O 2 via nasal prongs to maintain O 2 saturation > 92%. Her complete blood count showed moderate macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin: 77 g/L) with moderate thrombocytopenia (platelets: 80 × 10 9 /L). There was a marked leucocytosis (white cell count (WCC): 377.1 × 10 9 /L) comprised almost entirely of blasts. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood confirmed myeloid blasts with expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD13, CD33, and with aberrant CD7. Karyotyping showed 46,XX and molecular analysis showed a type D NPM1 mutation, an FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) (high variant allele fraction), and a low-level FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation.Other key laboratory findings included elevated Creactive protein of 130 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 2450 U/L, D-dimer of 16,300 μg/L, and N-terminal-pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) of 263 pmol/L. Serial high-sensitivity troponins were normal. A portable Anterior-Posterior (AP) chest radiograph showed no interstitial infiltrates, lobar consolidation, or effusion.The patient was diagnosed with therapy-related AML (t-AML) and admitted to the haematology ward. Although it was felt highly probable that her presenting symptoms were explained by her AML, in line with the broad testing strategy in New Zealand at the time, a nasopharyngeal swab for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was taken and the patient was isolated until the RT-PCR results became available. No other source of infection was identified and the patient was commenced on empiric amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. She was then transferred to a tertiary hospital for specialized haematology care and a repeat nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was sent on arrival. The swabs were taken 7 h apart. The first swab became positive on day 2 at 35 cycles. This was sent for confirmatory testing to the national reference laboratory and was confirmed positive. The second swab was processed locally at the tertiary centre and this was negative at 38 cycles (local testing protocol). At this point, the tertiary centre laboratory requested and tested an aliquot from the first swab which again became positive at 35 cycles. Following discussion involving a haematologist (H. Goodman), a respiratory physician (C. L. Chang), and a clinical microbiologist, it was deemed that a false-positive result was unlikely due to a very low false-positive rate with local RT-PCR methodology and multiple positive confirmatory tests at different laboratories. The conclusion was that the second sample was a false negative possibly due to suboptimal sampling of the nasopharynx resulting in a nasal or mid turbinate swab. The patient also had a plausible epidemiological risk factor working in a hotel accommodating international guests.Chemotherapy was commenced despite the positive SARS-CoV-2 status due to unacceptable risk of disease progression and mortality without treatment. Cytoreduction was initially achieved with hydroxyurea then cytosine arabinoside. Intravenous dexamethasone was commenced for possible hyperleucocytosis. Rasburicase and intravenous fluid were given to prevent tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). Cytoreduction continued until WCC was <50 × 10 9 /L prior to intensifying to induction therapy with an anthracycline.The patient continued to express symptoms of only a mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) phenotype. Low-grade fevers continued until the third day of admission. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen after the initial presentation. Dyspnoea on minimal exertion and dry cough continued until the fifth day of admission where the respiratory rate normalized and no further respiratory symptoms were reported. At this time, cytoreduction had achieved a leucocyte count < 100 × 109/L. Three SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs between days 13 and 19 of admission were negative and the patient was successfully de-isolated to the haematology ward on day 20. During her 26th day of admission, she completed a cycle of induction chemotherapy, had a second course of antibiotics for neutropenic colitis, and was discharged on cell count recovery. Her disease was refractory to daunorubicin, ara-C (DA) induction chemotherapy but she subsequently achieved morphological remission with fludarabine, ara-C, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, idarubincin (FLAG-IDA) salvage and has been referred for consideration of allogeneic stem cell transplant.This case highlights the potential of coexistence of COVID-19 and other acute severe diagnoses including acute haematological malignancies, where both the pathophysiology and treatment may render the patient highly immunovulnerable.There is limited existing literature on the clinical course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections in immunosuppressed states, such as patients with active malignancy or due to immunosuppressants. Case reports have shown that the presentation and outcomes can vary from mild to severe disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . As immunosuppressive therapy downregulates the production of interleukins (ILs) and the proliferation, survival, and maturation of T cells, it is possible that although the risk of acquiring the virus is higher, the anti-inflammatory effects of such therapy reduce the overall severity of COVID-19 [9] . Furthermore, AML itself leads to impaired T-cell response [10] . We note evidence supporting the link between overactivation of T cells and severe immune injury in patients with severe COVID-19 [11] . Systemic inflammatory response has also been shown to play a role in provoking viral-induced lung injury. Table 1 summarizes the case reports of COVID-19 infection in patients who are immunosuppressed as a result of solid organ transplant or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL). Of the 19 patients described, four died. Of note, three of these four patients were on very low-dose immunosuppression therapy at the time. The fourth death was unrelated to COVID-19. In terms of severity of disease, five patients were managed as outpatients; seven were admitted, one of whom did not have an oxygen requirement, and four required intensive care unit (ICU) for ventilation, one of whom was successfully de-escalated to ward-based care. Of note, ours is the first reported case of a patient with COVID-19 actively undergoing cytoreduction chemotherapy rather than broad-spectrum immunosuppression following transplantation. In this case, the patient was given dexamethasone for hyperleucocytosis. At the time of treatment, steroids were not recommended for the management of COVID-19 as they have not demonstrated efficacy in prior SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics. The early reports of steroid use from China suggest detrimental effects rather than benefits. However, the recent RECOVERY Trial conducted in the UK found that dexamethasone was associated with improved outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [12] . It is possible that early administration of systemic steroids improved the overall clinical course of the coronavirus infection in our patient. Elevated serum ferritin and IL-6 level have been associated with increased mortality from COVID-19 infection suggesting inflammation may contribute to poor outcomes. It has been suggested that a subset of patients with COVID-19 and high H-score (used in the diagnosis of haemophagocytic syndromes) may benefit from immunosuppression with biological agents such as tocilizumab [13] . Thus, patients undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy are less likely to suffer from a cytokine storm, which is a proposed pathway leading to COVID-19-related mortality. Interestingly, despite severe immunosuppression, our patient only developed mild respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, the pulmonary and neurological symptoms may also be secondary to AML-associated hyperleucocytosis-fever and medullary pain can also accompany acute leukaemia which may masquerade as the fever and myalgia of a viral respiratory illness. Other elevated prognostic markers of COVID-19 such as D-dimer, LDH, and thrombocytopenia can all be attributed to acute leukaemia in this patient. It was unclear if the clinical symptoms in this case were secondary to hyperleucocytosis or COVID-19 infection.The coexistence of a highly communicable infectious disease also introduced significant practical complications in the management of this case. Following careful consideration, the patient was placed in isolation in the respiratory ward rather than the haematology ward to reduce exposure to other vulnerable patients. There is also concern that immunocompromised patients have prolonged viral shedding and may remain infective for longer. We were conservative in de-isolating our patient to the main haematology ward and only did so following complete resolution of respiratory symptoms and two consecutive negative PCR nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. Furthermore, isolation for the first few weeks with minimized staff exposure and no family or friend visits coupled with the natural grief process of such a grave diagnosis may lead to an increased need for psychological health support.Routine monitoring and treatment options were also affected by the co-diagnoses. For example, we were unable to obtain a pre-treatment echocardiogram prior to commencing anthracycline due to local infection control guidelines, although we note that myocarditis is a wellrecognized sequelae of COVID-19 infection [14] . Instead, the patient received the iron chelator dexrazoxane to decrease the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.We also elected to continue moderately aggressive fluid resuscitation despite an elevated NT-proBNP and the risk of cardiac complications following COVID-19, as the benefit of preventing TLS was deemed greater than the potential risks of fluid overload.In conclusion, this case report adds to the discussion of COVID-19 and whether immunosuppression alters the clinical course and outcome. It highlights the difficulties of treating high-grade haematological neoplasia in the current pandemic. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of AML and COVID-19.Appropriate written informed consent was obtained for publication of this case report and accompanying images.","New Zealand","first author","2020-08-25",8

Whilst hand washing with soap and water remains the effective method to reduce transmission of the virus, ABHRs provide a convenient, effective and relatively low cost alternative worldwide [1] .Several countries including the United States of America (USA), Australia and the United Kingdom (UK) have relaxed legislation to make it easier for local businesses to rapidly produce ABHRs [2] [3] [4] . The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) currently allows for hand sanitizer to be produced without the requirement of TGA approval or notification, provided one of the two formulations developed by the WHO are used [3] . In the UK and USA, local businesses are allowed to produce hand sanitizer adhering to WHO formulations, however the alcohol used must be denatured prior to production of the ABHR [2, 4] . Consequently, there has been a surge in production of large quantities of ABHR by various businesses, including pharmacies and alcohol distilleries. The magnitude and speed in response is commendable in this era of unprecedented demand, but may also carry some potential risks.The WHO's recommended formulations utilise either ethanol 80% v/v (Formulation 1) or isopropyl alcohol 75% v/v (Formulation 2) each with glycerol 1.45% v/v, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) 0.125% v/v and sterile distilled or boiled cold water [5] . Ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are chosen due to their marked viricidal effect by denaturing proteins and inactivating enveloped SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV -and more recently both formulations have been shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 [6, 7] . Benzalkonium chloride, an antiseptic used in some hand sanitisers, appears to have less reliable activity against coronaviruses than either ethanol or isopropyl alcohol and for this reason is not recommended first line for use against SARS-CoV-2 [8] . The low concentration of hydrogen peroxide within the WHO formulations is intended to eliminate any bacterial spores present in the formulation and is not considered part of the antisepsis. Glycerol is a safe, relatively inexpensive humectant that acts as an emollient to increase the tolerability of the product and protect skin from contact dermatitis with repeated use.Unsurprisingly, the shortage of commercially available ABHRs has also led to a multitude of home 'Do-It-Yourself"" (DIY) hand sanitiser recipes circulating online. Several of these formulas use unvalidated methods and are from non-qualified sources. Of potential concern is where 'methylated spirits' (also known as denatured alcohol) is substituted for ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. Whilst in recent years in Australia, the formulation of methylated spirits has largely changed from including methanol (wood alcohol) to other safer denaturants such as denatonium benzoate, there are still some formulations of methylated spirits containing methanol available for purchase -admittedly often at a low concentration of 2% (e.g. 'Gold Cross™). However, a recent Australian alert issued earlier this year described a patient who presented with methanol toxicity having ingested the contents of methylated spirits which was found to contain more than 60% methanol [9] . Worldwide, particularly in low income settings, methylated spirits products frequently contain methanol and are readily available [10] . Other regions such as the UK also permit methanol to be used in some trade-specific formulations of denatured alcohol [11] . In the past month in Dubai, six ABHRs of 102 tested have been removed from the market because of the presence of methanol [12] .Methanol toxicity as a result of ingestion, as well as from inhalation and transdermal absorption is not a new entity. Perhaps the most tragic reminder of the toxic effects of methanol can be seen in a recent poisoning epidemic in Iran, where at least 700 deaths occurred and over 2000 people became severely toxic after ingesting methanol in illegal alcoholic beverages in a bid to 'prevent' Covid-19 [13, 14] . Furthermore, there have been reports of methanol toxicity caused by ingestion of ABHRs as well as chronic methanol toxicity from transdermal absorption of these products, where the methanol content was not disclosed [15, 16] . While all the alcohols used in ABHRs may be toxic following ingestion, only methanol appears to be toxic following dermal absorption via these products [15, 17, 18] . The toxic effects of methanol compared with isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol are summarised in Table 1 .In light of the well-recognised dangers of methanol, and the absence of any precise legislation prohibiting its presence in methylated spirits, we conclude that methylated spirits should not be used in ABHRs, not least for the risk of toxicity by ingestion as a deliberate act or unintentionally by children, but also because of the risk of toxicity from respiratory and dermal exposure. This is particularly important in countries where methylated spirits products are highly likely to contain methanol. Where possible, commercially produced ABHRs should be used and the general public should avoid producing their own ABHRs. If commercially produced products are not available, organisations with the facilities to produce ABHRs should continue their laudable efforts, but whilst adhering to the WHO guidance on formulations.

Stage 3 requirements were relaxed by the end of April and by mid-May restaurants and businesses had largely re-opened. By 14 th May a total of 6,989 COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed, with almost half in New South Wales (NSW). 6 A screening service for SARS-CoV-2, using a multiplex PCR assay was established on 9 th March at St. Vincent""s Hospital, a University-affiliated hospital in inner-Sydney, NSW. Two community satellite testing services were opened in April. We report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens including co-infection, and evaluate the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 temporal pattern of respiratory infections alongside the introduction, and subsequent relaxation, of physical distancing measures.Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected by trained nurses using appropriate infection control measures at the dedicated COVID-19 clinic at St Vincent""s Hospital and satellite clinics at Bondi Beach and East Sydney. Testing was performed in the hospital Emergency Department (ED) when clinically indicated. A small proportion of specimens were referred from other sites such as rural laboratories, correctional facilities and general practitioners.Testing was carried out in accordance with NSW Health policy during the study period.Initially, testing was offered to individuals with respiratory symptoms who had returned from overseas, had severe respiratory illness, had been in contact with a known COVID-19 case, or had healthcare employment. These criteria were subsequently expanded to include anyone with fever or respiratory symptoms in local ""hot spots"" (30 th March 2020), defined Over the eleven-week period from 12 th March to 27 th May 2020, 21,808 people were tested. The proportion of people in whom any respiratory pathogen was detected declined markedly during the study period, from 32.5% in week one to 3.1% in week eight before rising again to 12.9% in week 11 (Figure) (p<0.001 for each subsequent week, compared to baseline, in a two-sample test of proportions). In most cases a greater than 10-fold reduction was observed: rhinovirus, 19.9% to 1.7% (before increasing again to 11.8% by late-May); parainfluenza, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 3.0% to 0.1%; and non-SARS-COV-2 coronaviruses, 2.3% to less than 0.1%. Of note, nonviral respiratory pathogens such as Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Pneumocystis jiroveci did not demonstrate marked reduction. (Supplementary Table) .At a major hospital serving the initial geographical epicentre of Australian SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, 175 cases were identified over an 11-week period. Despite the broadening of testing criteria, an increase in total testing numbers, and a move into cooler months, SARS- CoV-2 cases to similarly rise supports the absence of circulating SARS CoV-2 in the NSW community during that period, but the increased rhinovirus transmission does raise concern that SARS CoV-2 may also spread readily if reintroduced. Singaporean report 10 showed a 76% reduction over historical rates. To our knowledge, ours is the first report from the Southern hemisphere demonstrating a reduction during a move into the cooler months, and also the first to document simultaneous trends in other infectious respiratory pathogens.Among individuals with SARS-CoV-2, 5% had co-infection with other respiratory pathogens, with rhinovirus most common. Limited data have been reported on co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. In a Seattle surveillance study, 11 4 of 25 people (16%) with SARS-CoV-2 had rhinovirus coinfections. Interestingly, in that study (as in ours) no coinfections between SARS-CoV-2 and non-pandemic coronaviruses were found. This raises the hypothesis that co-exposure to different human coronaviruses may lead to only one establishing infection, or that shared viral epitopes lead to some degree of cross-immunity within the coronavirus group. A Californian report, 12 however, has shown occasional coinfections between SARS-CoV-2 and non-pandemic coronaviruses.There are some key limitations of our study. Firstly, during the eleven-week period the SARS-CoV-2 testing criteria changed, with broadened testing initially in local geographical ""hotspots"" then our entire catchment area. However, guidance was consistent that only people with fever or other respiratory tract symptoms should be tested. Secondly, detailed data on A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 8 the timing of testing in relation to symptom onset were not available. In general, however, most people were tested within a few days of symptom onset, when SARS-CoV-2 should have remained detectable. Thirdly, we are unable to determine which SARS-CoV-2 prevention measures had the greatest impact on respiratory virus prevalence, as they were introduced in rapid succession. It is also unclear how much impact a shift in SARS-CoV-2 cases from largely returned overseas travellers (predominantly from North America and Europe) to locally acquired cases had on temporal trends in respiratory viral pathogen prevalence. Higher prevalence of all respiratory viral pathogens would have been expected among returned travellers from the Northern Hemisphere late in the Northern winter, and these may have reduced naturally over time even without local COVID-19 prevention measures. Our study period is too short however to assess any seasonal trends.In conclusion, the introduction of multiple public health measures to minimise SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Australia from mid to late-March 2020 had a major impact on the prevalence of all respiratory viral infections highlighting the effectiveness of this approach. Changes in the prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses may provide a useful reflection of the success of ongoing measures including physical distancing restrictions. M a n u s c r i p t 11 9.

Infection with the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with considerable postoperative mortality and morbidity for surgical patients. [1] [2] [3] The global backlog of operations resulting from the temporary suspension of elective surgery could take close to a year to resolve. 4 Although both Australia and New Zealand have experienced a relatively low COVID-19 caseload on an international scale, 5 surgical systems within both countries have still been affected. During the initial phase of COVID-19, evidence-based guidance was required [reference GM editorial] from organisations such as the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) and other specialty surgical societies and associations for safe intraoperative practice, 6, 7 appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), management of surgical departments 8, 9 , and effective surgical triage 10, 11 in order to preserve the safety of surgical patients and staff. With the recommencement of elective surgery, clarity is required regarding the most appropriate methods of screening for active SARS-CoV-2 infection before surgery. 12 We aimed to evaluate the literature and produce evidence-based guidance regarding screening methods for active SARS-CoV-2 infection before surgery in a setting of low COVID-19 prevalence.A rapid review of the literature was combined with the advice of a working group comprising clinical experts across Australia and New Zealand, including seven senior surgeons (five general surgeons, one urologist and one otorhinolaryngologist) and a senior medical virologist. Input was also provided by five representatives from other areas of medicine, surgery and healthcare management.A rapid review methodology 13 with the World Health Organization""s identification of the novel coronavirus. 14 This was supplemented with targeted searches of the peer-reviewed literature until 1 July 2020, using both the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, which were informed by the working group.Study selection was performed by JGK and DRT, and was expedited using the web application, Rayyan. 15 Data extraction from each study was performed by a single reviewer (JGK, PW, LT, HSK) using a standard template, and a sample of the extractions were checked by JGK and DRT. Inclusion was not limited by language as any relevant non-English articles were translated using Artificial Intelligence translation tools where necessary.Case series with a sample size under 40 were excluded, apart from articles deemed important by the reviewers. 16, 17 Median values and interquartile ranges of the datapoints on the demographics and symptoms associated with COVID-19 were calculated from the retrieved studies.The literature search yielded an initial pool of 5,762 citations, from which 1,395 human studies were identified (Appendix A). After screening of title and abstract, this pool was refined to 255 relevant articles, for which full-text versions were retrieved. Information deemed pertinent from this pool of 255 articles were synthesised along with findings from the targeted searches.Given the considerable postoperative morbidity and mortality associated with operating on COVID-19 patients, 1-3 it is imperative that all surgical patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection undergo appropriate screening prior to surgery. However, this must be balanced with the urgency of surgery to ensure optimal outcomes for the patient, and surgery should not be delayed unnecessarily. Non-elective surgery should not be delayed for confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected patients, 11 rather it should proceed with surgical staff wearing full PPE 9 and undertaking appropriate intraoperative precautions, especially during aerosol-generating procedures. 6 If turnaround times of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing are within 24 hours, results of patients with suspected COVID-19 Accepted Article should be awaited prior to surgery provided that the delays do not adversely affect patient outcomes.Patients that receive a positive result in preoperative RT-PCR testing should be managed on a case-by-case basis by the treating clinical team. 11 Surgical decision-making should incorporate the urgency of the patient""s condition, local supply of hospital resources, and potential postoperative outcomes if the operation is postponed for repeat testing or symptom resolution.Evidence-based recommendations have been produced (Table 1 ) along with a proposed schema for the preoperative screening of surgical patients suspected of having COVID-19 (Table 2) . A printable questionnaire has also been developed for verbally screening patients for both symptoms of COVID-19 and a history of potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure, either during face-to-face or telemedicine consultations at any point in the preoperative setting (Appendix B). The proportion of patients responding positively to the questionnaire (Appendix B) or requiring diagnostic workup ( Table 2 ) will vary significantly depending on the local prevalence of COVID-19. The use of existing preoperative screening checklists should also be considered, 18 particularly if recommended by local institutions.Due to the high level of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tract which is estimated to begin two to three days prior to the onset of symptoms, 19, 20 asymptomatic or presymptomatic persons with COVID-19 are capable of transmitting the virus to others during this period 21 and at other times during the disease course. 22, 23 It has been estimated that up to 17.9% of COVID-19 cases could be asymptomatic, 24 and that approximately 44% of secondary cases in a given cohort could have been infected during the presymptomatic stage of index cases. 20As SARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly even when clinically undetectable, patient history must be screened for potential sources of exposure to the virus (Table 1) . Surgical patients from population groups at high risk of contracting COVID-19 20, 25 should be treated with appropriate perioperative precautions, 6, 9, 11 and if it is unlikely to worsen postoperative outcomes, surgery should be delayed for preoperative RT-PCR testing ( Table 2 ). Patients from ""essential"" professions that are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 (e.g. workers in Accepted Article healthcare, allied health facilities, supermarkets, schools, delivery, factory and farming, and transport) 26 should be treated with caution and undergo RT-PCR testing if symptomatic.An assessment of patient symptoms is insufficient as a sole method of diagnosing COVID-19 (Table 1) From 31 selected studies investigating a total of 53,538 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the symptoms most frequently reported in association with COVID-19 included fever, cough, sore throat, dyspnoea (including shortness of breath or tachypnoea), diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, and myalgia or arthralgia (Table 3) Immunological dysfunction due to COVID-19 can potentially result in the derangement of haematological, hepatic and renal laboratory markers. 17 75 However, although useful for gauging disease severity, 45 no individual laboratory marker within a multisystem workup provides specific utility for diagnosing active SARS-CoV-2 infection. 76 Thus, non-diagnostic laboratory investigations have little utility within the preoperative screening for COVID-19 (Table 1) .At the time of this publication, the RT-PCR test is considered the gold standard diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 77 Given the poor outcomes reported after surgery in COVID-19 patients, 1-3 RT-PCR testing is imperative for all elective surgery patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, diagnostic accuracy remains challenging, 78 with the test""s false negative rate estimated to be 2-29%. 79 Accordingly, due to the test""s high specificity but relatively moderate sensitivity, a positive result on RT-PCR should be treated with more weight in surgical decision-making than a negative result. 80 Test outcome may be influenced by site of sample collection, 81 variation in specimen collection protocol and handling, 82 and time since exposure to SARS-CoV-2. 83 Corresponding to temporal fluctuations in viral load, 20, 84, 85 the probability of recording a false negative result has been reported as being highest in the four days prior to the onset of symptoms, with the lowest probability occurring on the day of symptom onset. 83 Thus, if a patient displays any symptoms associated with COVID-19, RT-PCR testing should be conducted even if the patient has previously tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . Further, as RT-PCR is less sensitive for SARS-CoV-2 early in its incubation period, a 14-day quarantine prior to surgery should be considered in asymptomatic patients with a history of potential exposure to the virus (Appendix B), so as to allow time for resolution or presentation of the symptomatic phase. 86 Although repeat testing may overcome the limitations in RT-PCR sensitivity 78 RT-PCR tests detecting SARS-CoV-2 should demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity in addition to minimal cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, and a cycle threshold value below 40 is generally accepted as the criterion for positivity. 88 Although the SARS-CoV-2 genes selected for amplification vary depending on the manufacturer, 89-91 within Australia and New Zealand there is good concordance in the analytical performance between in-house developed and commercial RT-PCR tests. 92, 93 Surgical staff are encouraged to seek clarification from their local pathology service regarding the local availability of validated tests 94, 95 (including other methods for nucleic acid amplification 96 ) and their turnaround times.Serological detection of antibodies produced in the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection can be utilised as a method of diagnosing COVID-19. 77, 97 Seroconversion or a fourfold or greater rise in antibody levels between acute and convalescent samples is considered definitive laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 98 Large-scale analyses of seropositivity for immunoglobulin (Ig) M and G produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection have revealed the propensity for variation between populations depending on demographic differences and the population""s overall duration of exposure to the virus. [99] [100] [101] IgG and IgA are the antibodies most reliably detected in blood samples following SARS-CoV-2 infection, however global seroprevalence rates following the first wave of the pandemic ranged from 0.1%-47%, with considerable geographic variation. 102 Serological testing alone has little utility within preoperative screening for COVID-19 as it can neither confirm nor exclude a diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, nor provide information on potential infectivity (Table 1 ). Positivity for IgG or IgM may not be an assurance of protective immunity, 103 and there is uncertainty as to the period of immunity conferred. 104 The type of assay to use has been debated, with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) possibly more reliable than blotting assays, 105 and questions have been raised regarding which antigen (derived from SARS-CoV-2) should be targeted 106 To appropriately integrate testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection into preoperative surgical triage, 11 the temporal dynamics of the virus must be considered. The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated to be approximately four to five days 29, 110, 111 and viral load decreases after symptom onset, 20, 84, 85 although SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected up to 37 days later. 61 The virus is infectious both before 21 and after the onset of symptoms, 20 however infectivity is likely to decline after the first week of symptoms, when live virus may not be isolated in cell culture despite high viral loads in respiratory tract samples. 19 In an evidence-based timeline of the various diagnostic markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 77 Sethuraman et al. estimated that RT-PCR detection (which merely confirms the presence of viral RNA, not viable virus 19, 112 ) is likely to produce a positive result in the first three weeks after symptom onset. 113 Antibodies are most likely to be detected in serological tests after Accepted Article approximately two weeks of symptoms, 114 with IgG levels generally greater than IgM levels from about four weeks after symptom onset. 115 It is important to note that RT-PCR positivity has not been shown to correlate with clinical severity, 113 and has been found in cases when symptoms have completely resolved. 116Thoracic imaging serves the purpose of characterising the extent of pulmonary involvement from COVID-19, rather than providing a method of definitively diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chest computed tomography (CT), radiography and ultrasonography have all been discussed within the literature as imaging modalities that can potentially provide evaluative utility alongside RT-PCR assays. However, due to the considerable overlap between findings associated with pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 and those of other respiratory illnesses, no single thoracic imaging modality should be used as a sole method of diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection.Outside its known utility within the initial evaluation of suspected community-acquired pneumonia, 117 there is little evidence that chest radiography provides added diagnostic specificity for cases of suspected COVID-19. 118, 119 Similarly, although ultrasonography can potentially provide a low-cost, easily-disinfected, radiation-free alternative to CT in settings of high COVID-19 prevalence or low medical resources, [120] [121] [122] in settings of low COVID-19 prevalence and adequate resources its lack of specificity limits diagnostic utility. Groundglass opacities, consolidation, pleural thickening, interlobular septal thickening and air bronchograms have been reported in the literature as the chest CT findings most commonly associated with COVID-19, with lesions more likely to be found in the lower lobes. 123 However, there is variation in reported CT features based on time within the COVID-19 disease course. 124, 125 Chest CT could potentially have even greater sensitivity for detecting respiratory involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection than RT-PCR, 126, 127 however multiple meta-analyses within the literature have estimated the specificity of the modality to be below 40% for COVID-19. 128, 129 Thus while the sole use of chest CT to screen for SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be recommended, 130 it can be useful for characterising the pulmonary involvement within COVID-19 patients that have been confirmed by RT-PCR (Table 1) .This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.On the basis of a rapid review of the literature, evidence-based recommendations have been produced along with a proposed schema for the preoperative screening of surgical patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in a low prevalence setting. RT-PCR testing remains the gold standard diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, relevant patient history suggesting potential exposure to the virus and clinical presentation, particularly the presence of hyposmia or hypogeusia, must also be considered within preoperative screening for COVID-19. Surgical decision-making should incorporate the urgency of the individual patient""s condition, the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and local supply of medical resources. A printable questionnaire has also been developed for verbally screening patients for COVID-19 during face-to-face or telemedicine consultations. This article is protected by copyright.

The use of chest CT scanning alone to diagnose COVID-19 is not recommended due to nonspecific findings that may overlap with other respiratory illnesses.This article is protected by copyright.

Not surprisingly, alcohol has been a topic of significant interest during the pandemic. Around the world and in Australia, governments have acted to either help the alcohol industry through the pandemic or to help deal with the strain that alcohol use places on health and law enforcement services [1] . Given the increased focus of the world on public health and the impacts of COVID-19 on the alcohol industry, the pandemic provides a good opportunity to consider alcohol industry activities and arguments to influence public health measures.In an effort to limit the impact of alcohol-related harm on the health system during the pandemic, the Western Australian (WA) Government introduced temporary restrictions on takeaway alcohol purchases on 25 March 2020. In announcing the restrictions, the WA Premier, the Hon Mark McGowan MLA, noted, 'Alcohol-related issues take up an enormous amount of resources in our health system. These are resources we simply cannot afford to spare during the COVID-19 situation' [2] . The move was widely welcomed and supported by health groups, particularly as the restrictions helped to convey the message that alcohol is a preventable burden on the health system. The limits permitted the purchase of up to around 57 standard drinks per person per day (see Table 1 ).Just 6 days after the WA restrictions came into effect, Retail Drinks Australia (RDA), the body that represents the interests of liquor retailers, introduced a voluntary national initiative that limited the amount of alcohol customers could purchase in one transaction, with the aim of preventing panic buying [3] . The voluntary initiative permitted the purchase of around 150 standard drinks per person per transaction; however, it did not apply in WA because of the government-introduced limits.The WA Government removed the state-wide restrictions on takeaway alcohol purchases several weeks after their introduction, on 20 April 2020, following intense pressure by the alcohol industry for the WA restrictions to be replaced with the voluntary initiative [4] . A week later, RDA announced the conclusion of its voluntary initiative [5] .As takeaway liquor restrictions have largely ended, we now have an opportunity to consider the arguments that the alcohol industry used to encourage the WA Government to lift takeaway alcohol restrictions and how the alcohol industry framed public discussion about the restrictions.We looked at alcohol industry representatives' comments about takeaway alcohol sales in media and online publications between the introduction of the WA Government liquor restrictions and the conclusion of the RDA voluntary initiative.Alcohol was framed as an essential product, including for the economy, for the Australian culture and for mental health and wellbeing. For example, a representative of Australian Grape and Wine said, 'It's [alcohol is] a way of life for many Australians and in moderation it's good for your health' [6] . RDA noted that 'If we want people to stay at home, if we want them in a good state of mental health with a conviviality that encourages them to adhere to social isolation, we've got to ensure they have access to the social norms such as enjoying a drink' [6] .The impact of the restrictions on WA businesses was commonly mentioned by alcohol industry representatives. A key argument was that the WA Government restrictions unfairly disadvantaged WA businesses, as the limits did not apply to interstate sellers. For example, the Liquor Stores Association WA claimed, 'In their current form, the WA Government's alcohol purchasing restrictions clearly discriminate against Western Australian businesses and benefit their interstate competitors' [7] . This point was commonly used to encourage the WA Government to replace its restrictions with the voluntary initiative, with the RDA noting, 'We would urge the WA Government to adopt the same measures as Retail Drinks' voluntary initiative in its next review so that WA retailers are able to compete on a level playing field' [7] .Further, the impact of restrictions on an alreadystruggling industry was highlighted in various comments. For example, Australian Hotels Association WA noted, 'WA's hotels and hospitality businesses have incurred immeasurable financial costs associated with COVID-19 so it is important that they do not face any unnecessary and counterproductive restrictions' [8] .The WA restrictions were framed as complex, confusing, too strict and ineffective and industry comments Cask wine 2 casks, not to exceed 10 litres in total A combination of any two of the above is permitted but not a combination of two of the same product.Customers can purchase up to the total limit in any two of the above product categories. raised concern that the WA limits could be counterproductive. For example, RDA argued, 'The WA limits are complex and confusing and so low they are likely to lead to an increase in shopping, which is the exact opposite of what we're meant to be doing at the moment' [6] .The restrictions were also described as being easily circumvented. A Perth distillery owner argued, 'I do believe people who are going to drink irresponsibly will still do so and this ruling will only serve to hurt our industry' [9] . The RDA appeared to have a similar view: 'The reality of any purchasing limits is that a person could easily travel to a number of liquor outlets in a single day and purchase well beyond the imposed limits, without fear of penalty' [7] .The 'strictness' of the approach in WA was used to encourage the WA Government to lift the restrictions. RDA noted, 'Retail Drinks' voluntary initiative has already been successful in preventing panic buying with sales no longer at the peak trading seen a few weeks ago, demonstrating that these desired outcomes can be achieved without the stricter purchase limits the WA Government has imposed on its own retailers' [10] .The themes and arguments identified here are commonly used by the alcohol industry. Framing alcohol as having a positive effect on society and the economy, as being part of everyday life and as good for health is a common industry strategy and is not unique to the pandemic [11] . These types of arguments are particularly concerning as they are not consistent with the evidence of harms from alcohol and health advice. For example, the national low-risk drinking guidelines advise that alcohol does not relieve stress and can worsen mental health outcomes [12] .Self-regulation is commonly used by the alcohol industry to delay and prevent enforceable government regulation, including for alcohol marketing [13] . Given that alcohol was framed by the industry as an essential service and that the voluntary initiative was introduced shortly after the WA Government announcement, it's possible that the voluntary initiative was introduced to forestall any government intervention in other jurisdictions. It is worth noting that the WA Government restrictions and the voluntary initiative had differing aims; while the WA Government restrictions recognised alcohol as a preventable health burden and aimed to reduce its impact on the health system, the voluntary initiative aimed to prevent stockpiling of alcohol, which framed the issue of concern as being about panic buying, rather than the health system burden.Alcohol industry representatives commonly criticise public health measures as being ineffective or too strict despite evidence of their effectiveness [14] . While the WA takeaway liquor restrictions were somewhat limited in that they did not apply to interstate retailers, the WA Government needed to act quickly to respond to a crisis situation and likely wasn't in a position to fine-tune the policy before its introduction. Online sales of alcohol by interstate sellers are also beyond the scope of the existing WA liquor laws, so action in this area would have taken longer. Nevertheless, in lifting the restrictions, the WA Racing and Gaming Minister, the Hon Paul Papalia MLA, highlighted, 'These measures were put in place to ensure those essential workers could focus on the State's response to COVID-19, and the WA public has acted commendably during this period', suggesting that the restrictions were effective in achieving their aim [15] .The alcohol industry's response to the COVID-19 restrictions in Australia provides a unique case study of how the alcohol industry attempts to interfere in public health policy. While the example is from a specific time period and unprecedented circumstances, it contributes to the existing evidence base of how the alcohol industry frames public discussion of health policy.","Australia","abstract","2020-08-27",8

Because of the need of social distancing imposed by healthcare authorities to prevent the spread of the disease, the demand for telehealth increased dramatically. [1] [2] [3] We aimed to investigate teledermatology (TD) use and doctors' perception during the recent pandemic. The TD task force of the EADV (European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology) ideated an online survey that was spread via email among dermatologists with the support of EADV, AIDNID (Italian Association of Non Invasive Imaging in Dermatology) and SIDeMast (Italian Society of Dermatology and Venerology).Four hundred and thirty-four doctors from 49 Countries completed the survey, 67.1% women. 35.5% were <40 years old; 24.0% were aged 40-50 years; 25.4% aged between 51-60 years; 15% were older than 60 years.The majority of respondents were board-certified dermatologists (87.1%); working in public hospital/ambulatory/clinic in 29.5% of cases, in public University in 24.2%, in private hospital/clinic/ambulatory in 44.0% of cases and 2.3% working in a private University. The majority were from Southern Europe (210; 48.4%), followed by Northern Europe (88; 20.3%) and Eastern Europe (69; 15.9%); 35 (8.1%) were from Asia; 9 (2.1%) were form South America, 3 (0.7%) from Africa; 2 (0.5%) from Australia; 18 (4.0%) did not declare their origin.54.1% (n = 235) of respondents declared to already practice TD before the pandemic, in the last 5 years on average (years of TD practice ranging from 1 to 20 years). Of these, 65.5% (n = 154/235) dermatologists declared to use TD not regularly before the pandemic; and 81 (81/235; 34.5%) to regularly practice TD, for first visits and follow-up (50/235 = 21.3%) or only for follow-up (31/235 = 13.2%). The approximate percentage of patients visited before the pandemic with TD was <10% for the majority of respondents, mainly visited asynchronously with a store and forward modality. The great majority of doctors (88.2%) registered an increase in the demand for TD during the pandemic.Among those who did not practice TD before COVID-19 (n = 199/434; 45.9%), 72.9% (145/199) declared to have started to practice it during the pandemic.The main mode of TD during the pandemic was via telephone call (67.9%) alone or in combination with a store and forward (51.1%) and live interactive modality (41.1%). Acute inflammatory conditions were the main reason for consultation (32.8%).There was a high variability in the platforms used, with 'informal' platforms (Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp) being the most frequently chosen (49.0%). 39% declared to use a dedicated secure hospital platform.We asked to those who did not use TD, which was the main reason why the majority had a scarce opinion of this modality of consultation, which was judged not to be adequate to make a diagnosis by 33.3% of responders (14/42); others prefer to visit patients face by face (31%; 13/42).32% of doctors changed their attitudes towards TD; they started TD during the pandemic and found it effective; 47% were already convinced about its utility.In summary, in times of COVID-19 dermatology surfs the web. As highlighted by the results of this survey, many dermatologists experienced TD for the first time because of the need of social distancing and found it effective, thus reducing the number of face to face consultation and the number of accesses to the ambulatories. The efficacy of TD was already known and demonstrated by many publications; however, sometimes an epochal event is needed to speed up a process. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The further steps could be re-thinking dermatological care in a more sustainable way, for doctors, patients and environment. ","Australia","abstract","2020-08-17",8

Our Ministry of Health set up the National Health Coordination Centre in late January in response to concerns that this virus was spreading around the world. COVID-19 became a notifiable disease on 30 January, and restrictions were imposed on foreign travellers from China into New Zealand on 3 February.The first case of COVID-19 in New Zealand was reported on 28 February in a person who was unwell on returning from a trip to Iran. Subsequent cases were all travellers who had returned to New Zealand from Singapore, United States and Australia and from cruise ships. Our borders were closed to non-residents on 19 March. A total of 23 cases had been reported by the time the Level 2 lockdown was imposed on 21 March, and 205 cases by the time we entered Level 4 lockdown just 4 days later on the night of 25 March. Level 4 lockdown was eased to Level 3 on 27 April.We report the number of procedures performed in our two cardiac catheterisation laboratories at Christchurch Public Hospital during the nine fortnights from 30 December 2019 to 3 May 2020 inclusive, and then compare these numbers with the equivalent fortnights from 31 December 2018 to 5 May 2019. Our hospital is the only hospital admitting patients with acute coronary syndromes and only acute percutaneous intervention (PCI) centre for a population in excess of 400 000. Data were collated from a prospective database compiled by our radiographer team at the end of each procedure. This analysis does not include publicly funded elective coronary angiography procedures performed at another hospital.The number of acute coronary angiogram/PCI (for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)), all angiograms, all PCI, all other interventional cardiology procedures and permanent pacemaker insertions, and all electrophysiological procedures was stable through to 23 March 2020.The number of acute PCI procedures for STEMI remained stable during Level 4 lockdown (Fig. 1A) .However, the total number of catheter lab procedures fell by 60% to a nadir of 45 total procedures in the fortnight 6 April 6 to 19 April inclusive compared with 103 during the corresponding fortnight in 2019. This was largely due to falls in other coronary angiogram or PCI procedures (from 63 to 21) and EP procedures from 29 to 9 cases.Procedures performed for in-patients from 23 March to 3 May are compared with elective procedures in Figures 1 and 2. In the 4 weeks from 23 March, the number of angiograms and PCI procedures on in-patients fell by 53% to 41procedures compared with 87 procedures in the previous 4 weeks in 2020, and by 56% compared with 94 in the corresponding period in 2019 (Fig. 1B) . This fall in in-patient PCI procedures was the main reason for the fall in total angiogram and PCI procedures. There was also a fall in elective procedures (Fig. 1C) . Indeed, no outpatient coronary angiograms or PCI procedures were performed in the 4 weeks beginning 23 March compared with 34 procedures in the previous 4 weeks and 31 procedures in the corresponding 4 weeks in 2019. Dates of final elective angiogram and PCI procedures were 19 March and 20 March, respectively, preceding the move to Level 2 and then to Level 3 lockdown. In-patient procedures have returned to normal early in Stage 3 lockdown (Fig. 1B) .Contrasting data were presented for EP procedures in Figure 2 . The fall in total EP procedures was largely due to reduced elective volumes. The number of in-patient EP procedures has remained relatively constant throughout Level 4 lockdown with 19 procedures during the 4 weeks from 23 March compared with 22 procedures in Internal Medicine Journal 50 (2020) 1000-1003 the previous 4 weeks of 2020, and 17 procedures during the corresponding 4 weeks in 2019 (Fig. 2B) . Outpatient EP studies were continued throughout the lockdown period but at reduced volumes with 16, 4 and 3 procedures, respectively, in the fortnights commencing 23 March, 6 April and 20 April compared with 21, 19 and 11 procedures in the corresponding fortnights in 2019 (Fig. 2C ).We did not detect a fall in acute PCI procedures to treat STEMI during the Level 4 lockdown for COVID-19. This finding is in contrast to recent reports from Spain, 1 United States, 2 Austria 3 and Italy. 4 Those reports were from 'hub' hospitals in countries experiencing a major pandemic of COVID-19 cases and disruption of their medical systems of care including transportation to PCIcapable hospitals. The very large majority of our acute STEMI patients present directly to our hospital and are not referred to from other hospitals. Furthermore, our hospital treated very few COVID-19 cases during Level 4 lockdown, community prevalence was low, and ambulance and hospital services were not overwhelmed.However, we have demonstrated that in-patient angiogram and PCI procedures fell by more than 50%. As we had no major disruptions in resourcing or medical care, this decrease in coronary procedures could be due to a true decrease in incidence of other acute coronary syndromes (non-STEMI and unstable angina) in our city during lockdown. Further investigation is required to confirm the possibility of a true decrease in incidence of acute coronary syndromes, and needs to include analysis of general practice consultations, analysis of trends in requests for troponin levels, emergency department case numbers, hospital discharge data and trends in mortality in the community.Two of the recent European studies documented greater falls in presentations with non-STEMI than with STEMI. 3,4 The Italian study reported a 41-44% fall in non-STEMI admissions compared with a 23-25% fall in STEMI admissions. 4 We have not assessed admission or discharge diagnosis data from our hospital. A study of nationwide trends in acute coronary syndromes and catheter lab procedures using the ANZACS-QI database is ongoing.Alternatively, the fall in in-patient coronary procedures could be a consequence of changes in thresholds for presentation or access to care at patient, community and hospital levels.Did patients suffer symptoms at home and not seek assessment because of a vigorous nationwide advertising campaign that emphasised messages such as 'do not burst your bubble', 'stay at home if you are over 70 years of age' and other messages to encourage social distancing? Did New Zealanders prefer to suffer a heart attack in silence rather than create further risks to their health and the health of others by leaving their home and 'bubble', and presenting to a clinic or hospital?Or was it more difficult to reach out for help? At the beginning of lockdown, all General Practice groups distributed advice that face-to-face consultations were cancelled but phone consultations were available. Many patients may have interpreted this as a barrier to access. If either of these factors was important, there could be a number of people with recent acute coronary syndromes who are untreated and at increased risk or recurrent events or sudden death in the near future.Having reached the hospital, was there a change in the triaging of chest pain patients in ED or a reduction in referrals to the cardiology in-patient service? Or was there a change in decision making and thresholds for referral to the catheter lab during cardiology ward rounds so patients might return home to their bubble as quickly as possible? The decrease in referrals to the catheter lab was not due to reduced resources. The catheter labs were manned by teams working 1 week on, 1 week off rosters. No member of staff contracted COVID-19 and no staff were in self-isolation.In summary, we report a >50% decrease in in-patient coronary procedures during the Level 4 lockdown. This occurred in the absence of resource limitations, disruption to medical care or widespread community infection. We hope this was due to a true decrease in the incidence of acute coronary syndromes rather than changes in investigation and management during lockdown. Indeed, there may be a rebound increase in presentations or demand for treatment as we exit lockdown.","New Zealand","abstract","2020-08-06",8
