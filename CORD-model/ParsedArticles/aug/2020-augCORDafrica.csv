1a53a2c5f7ff3759c955763b9db977aa3b87a229,Egyptian Pediatric Association Gazette,"Since reporting of the first index cases of infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan (Hubei, China) on 12 December 2019, the whole world has changed very rapidly and dramatically. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a Global Health Emergency, and shortly thereafter on 11 March 2020, it was declared as a pandemic [1] . COVID-19 pandemic proved rapidly to be a major international medical problem that has many sequences on infants, children, and adolescents. Worldwide, concerted efforts must be exerted in order to identify the huge problems and impacts the pandemic has created that affect child health and child healthcare, and plan prompt solutions for them. All the news, reports, and experiences from the four corners of the world are indicating that infant and child health and healthcare systems before the COVID-19 pandemic have been changed to variable degrees and will probably never be the same after the pandemic in many aspects for extended periods of mankind life.COVID-19 is uncommon to cause marked clinical symptoms in healthy children as compared with adults. However, asymptomatic children are able to transmit the virus to their adult contacts, and very young infants and children (as well as those with underlying comorbidities) are at increased risk to manifest severe illness [2] . COVID-19 is a droplet infection that spreads rapidly to the unprotected contacts from an infected person. The infectious virus can persist on contaminated surfaces for variable times. The risk of transmission via touching contaminated paper is low, while respiratory and fecal specimens can maintain infectivity for quite a long time at room temperature. SARS-CoV-2 could exist in the air in poorly ventilated buses for at least 30 min. Absorbent materials like cotton are safer than non-absorptive materials for protection from viral infection [3] . As children are less likely to present with serious symptoms, they may have nasal congestion, sore throat, muscular and bony aches, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea [4] . In children, common circulating corona viruses can cause common cold symptoms such as fever, rhinitis, otitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, headache, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, wheezing, pneumonia and, in up to 57% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms (which are more common in children than adults) [5] . Some recent studies have shown that there is limited spread among children and from children to adults [6] [7] [8] . The most common manifestations in infected adults include fever, tiredness, and a dry cough [2] . In the majority of infected adults, the symptoms are mild, and more than 85% completely recover. However, the remainder may become seriously ill and some may die. More severe symptoms include difficulty in breathing, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and septic shock leading to multiple organ failure such as heart, liver, and kidney failure [2] . Until now, there is limited evidence that maternal vertical transmission can occur, and newborn infection if occurs is due to perinatal transmission rather than prenatal [9] . It was also found that there is no transmission of the virus through breast milk; therefore, cessation of breast feeding from COVID-19-infected mothers is not recommended, and infected mothers are strictly advised to follow preventive precautions such as handwashing, cleaning the breast before feeding, and using masks during breast feeding [10] . Laboratory findings from children are rather similar to those in adults and include a white blood cell count that is typically normal or reduced with decreased neutrophil count and/or lymphocyte counts. Thrombocytopenia may occur. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin levels are often normal. In severe cases, elevated liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as an abnormal coagulation and elevated serum ferritin and D-dimers have been reported [5] . Radiologic findings in children are similar to those of adults. Chest radiography mostly shows bilateral patchy airspace consolidations mainly at the periphery of the lungs, peri-bronchial thickening, and ground-glass opacities. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans mostly show airspace consolidations and ground-glass opacities [5] .Until now, there is no definitive evidence-based drug therapy for COVID-19 neither in adults nor in the pediatric populations. Current management for COVID-19 is largely symptomatic and supportive care. Supportive measures include sufficient fluid and caloric intake, antipyretics, oxygenation, anticoagulants, and prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent superadded bacterial or fungal infections. The aim is to stabilize the clinical condition and prevent further deterioration as organ failure and secondary infections. It is better for children with mild symptoms to stay at home under medical supervision. If the child condition is deteriorating, then the child should be hospitalized as advised by the treating pediatrician [11] .Confirmation of the information credibility is essential for healthcare professionals and the public in general. During crisis, rumors and false stories, misleading information, and unreliable data are sadly shared via social media leading to a state of instability and uncertainty among the community members and causing mistrust in the healthcare providers [12] . Pediatricians and all other healthcare team must be cautious about starting therapies based on news or social media reports and should rely on trusted sources of evidence-based information from reliable credited sources of updated information and share those with the families in their care [13] .It is equally important that families be aware that many of what is called sham remedies have been promoted to the public. Many sham treatments have been widely disseminated on social media. These include, for example, drinking warm water, gargling with saline or garlic, drinking lemon juice with honey or black seeds, use of specific homeopathic or alternative medicines, and drinking specific alcoholic drinks. None of these remedies have been proven effective in prevention or treatment, and some have been shown to be harmful, and therefore, should not be recommended [14] .Healthcare facilities all over the world became suddenly overwhelmed by unexpectedly treating thousands of COVID-19 patients at the same time. This has created marked congestion and an unpreceded chaos in the healthcare facilities especially in the populated regions. This has its adverse impacts and many people and particularly infants and children were and still (until the time of writing this manuscript) unable to get the proper medical care they actually need. Suggested short-term measures have been proposed to the countries all over the world by the WHO in response to COVID-19 pandemic. A comprehensive guidance to countries on the types of actions and adjustments needed to support the response [15] .There is an urging challenge of how to provide the required healthcare needed by infants and children in due time and place avoiding the possibility to catch SARS-CoV-2 infection if they go to seek medical advice at hospitals or healthcare facilities. The mandatory precautions including the fundamental physical distancing and infection control requirements will affect the traditional routine medical care beside that many parents are afraid to leave homes or do not want to take their child to a medical care facility with a possibility to be infected from other sick children. Therefore, care givers are encouraged to share their worries and information with their pediatricians via phone calls, e-mails, or other social media applications [16] . Telemedicine has been dramatically exploited in the past few months as a useful tool for long-distance clinical care more than 10-folds what has happened to it during the past decade. Telemedicine can be used for education, counselling parents, and health management, and its role is professionally enlarging in many regions such as the USA and Europe, but awaiting further regulatory approvals in other regions such as in Egypt [17] . Telemedicine may be of limited practical application in some low-income countries where resources are limited due to technical, economic, cultural, or geographical factors, but yet it needs to be tried as an alternative to face-to-face communication to get the required medical advice especially in the straight forward medical problems and concerns. With appropriate attention and caution for some issues such as patient safety, confidentiality, and suspected missed clinical information, telemedicine can be an effective way to help patients during the present COVID-19 pandemic [16, 18] .It is estimated that millions of infants and children worldwide have just missed and will continue to miss their required essential vaccinations with a fear that some vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) may come back as measles and poliomyelitis. The WHO has stressed the importance of maintaining the essential health services during COVID-19 pandemic and identified immunization as a core health service that must be offered to the target chirdren [18] . Special planning and extra ordinary efforts are required to be applied quickly for vulnerable pediatric populations at increased risk of morbidity and mortality as refugees and children under custody. However, it was advised that mass vaccination campaigns should be temporarily halted or postponed to follow recommendations on maintaining proper physical distancing and infection control precautions required to combat COVID-19 transmission during such campaigns [19] .COVID-19 crisis has forced governments to close nurseries and schools as well as sports' clubs and gardens. It is not allowed to travel to areas where recreations can be practiced. Children are not allowed to meet their friends and other relatives. They are locked down at their houses having the same repeated daily routine. Similar to adults, children are likely to suffer anxiety, fear, and other psychological manifestations. Children may experience negative feelings and thoughts such as fear of being hospitalized, taking injections up to a fear of their family member loss, or even their own death. This may present as behavioral disturbances, loss of appetite, sleep problems, nightmares, and many other stress-related disorders. The adolescents are also affected but to a lesser extent than children as adolescents seem to express an excellent ability to manage situations of insecurity and have a better adaptation with the changing circumstances [20] .In the wake of the global lockdown, schools are closed. Children are not only obliged to stay at home for longer hours and become more vulnerable to domestic violence and other sorts of child abuse, but also there is an anticipated decrease in reporting of child maltreatment cases which includes sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Adding other adverse factors as parental unemployment and economic burdens will be negatively reflected on providing a safe healthy environment for the children to stay in. It is clear now that the measures which have been taken to control the spread of COVID-19 are causing what may be called a ""secondary pandemic"" of child neglect and abuse [21] .The living conditions in refugee camps, crowded reception centers, or detention facilities are unfortunately a very suitable environment for COVID-19 spread. There is lack of proper healthcare services and sanitary precautions beside the suboptimal physical and medical status of the children at such places. Displaced children are among those with the most limited access to prevention services, testing, treatment, and other essential support. In addition, the pandemic and containment measures are likely to have negative consequences for their safety and education, which were pre-carious even before the outbreak of the disease [22] .Many families are struggling with their daily lives. Parents and care givers being out of work or even have already lost their jobs during the pandemic do not have enough financial resources to cope with the many changes occurring. On the other hand, the basic needs of infants, children, and adolescents must be fulfilled. With the world economy sagging into recession, it is feared that this hardship will remain and probably increase over the coming months, if not years [23] .Being more vulnerable to catch infections, children suffering of chronic diseases are at high risk to get COVID-19 infection. Those children are suffering of marked decrease of their protective mechanisms and inner barriers to combat infections. Not only that, but also if they developed COVID-19 infection, there will be a potential increased risk of deterioration of their clinical status. Prevention is the principal key factor for those children. They should not catch COVID-19 at the first place. They must strictly stay at home avoiding any possibility to catch infection. If COVID-19 infection is suspected, they must seek medical advice promptly. Infants < 1 year of age and children with certain serious underlying conditions appear to be at greater risk for severe disease. The most commonly reported underlying conditions in COVID-19 pediatric patients were chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression (e.g., related to cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplant, and high doses of glucocorticoids) [24] .The overwhelming current COVD-19 ongoing disaster should not make us forget other serious medical and surgical diseases and emergencies that children may suffer. Pediatricians and pediatric hospitals must be prepared to provide rapid, efficient, and safe medical management accordingly. In its recent Position Statement, the International Pediatric Association (IPA) has strongly recommended that the primary care and hospital resources for children must be maintained during the current COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ensure addressing the child and adolescent health priorities and providing required health management services for children with more severe COVID-19 manifestations [25] .The mandatory lockdown and inevitable social distancing measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the governments in many countries to close nurseries, child care centers, schools, training centers, and higher education facilities as universities and institutions. These closures have affected millions of students worldwide not only retarding their educational aspects, but also adversely affecting their emotional status and well-being. Whenever the schools are reopened, the protection of children and educational facilities is particularly important. Precautions are necessary to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 in school settings; however, care must also be taken to avoid stigmatizing students and staff who may have been exposed to the virus [26] .Staying at home for long time and closure of sports clubs and lack of physical activities may eventually result in marked weight increase in children and adolescents and development of obesity problem with all its negative consequences. Pediatricians have to alert parents and care givers for this increasing heath problem during lockdowns. On the other hand, in many developing countries, the opposite may occur; the economic adverse effect of COVID-19 may result in marked decrease in the families' abilities to ensure enough food supplies for their children resulting in their suffering of undernourishment. Nutritious food intake has to be offered to every individual. Proper nutrition and hydration are vital for health these days. Intake of more water and avoiding sugars are essential. Children and adolescents should eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get enough vitamins and minerals [27] .What is expected after COVID-19 pandemic is over?The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unpreceded disturbance in the global health systems. Humanity is hopeful that it may come to an end sooner rather than later especially if an effective antiviral treatment(s) and/or vaccine(s) are developed rapidly. Until that moment, prevention of infection and symptomatic and supportive treatment are the best to do. Therefore, revising infant and child health and healthcare plans, and prioritizing the healthcare projects are essential and mandatory issues as the world will never be the same again. Both globalization and urbanization that have been two of the world's most powerful drivers in the past few decades are anticipated to be reversed by COVID-19 leading to increasing the distances among people and between countries due to border closures and restricted international travel [28] .So far, the COVID-19 crisis has had a great impact on child health and healthcare all over the world, not only from the medical aspect, but also from the social, psychologic, economic, and educational aspects. All these implications have to be identified and dealt with properly to avoid their short-and long-term consequences on an individual bases approach. ",Egypt,first author,2020-08-04,08
fc45ce9a4d3d0689b90f33423690e30f15c29c1e,COVID-19 variant radiological findings with high lightening other coronavirus family (SARS and MERS) findings: radiological impact and findings spectrum of corona virus (COVID-19) with comparison to SARS and MERS,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a new pandemic disease diagnosed at the late 2019 in China, Wu- han. Chest CT is a key component of the diagnostic work-up for patients with suspected infection [1] .Radiological examinations are vital in early diagnosis and assessment of disease course, as most COVID-19 infected patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic CT imaging patterns [1] .In absence of specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines for 2019 novel coronavirus disease , it is essential to detect the diseases at an early stage and immediately isolate the infected person from the healthy population [2] .The low sensitivity of RT-PCR implies that many COVID-19 patients may not be identified and may not receive appropriate treatment in time; such patients constitute a risk for infecting a larger population given the highly contagious nature of the virus [3] .Chest CT, as a routine imaging tool for pneumonia diagnosis, is relatively easy to perform and can produce fast diagnosis [4] .Investigators are making every effort to further characterize the imaging features of this novel coronavirus syndrome, but information is still limited [1] .Chest CT is a conventional, non-invasive imaging modality with high accuracy and speed. Based on available data published in recent literature, almost all patients with COVID-19 had characteristic CT features in the disease process [2] .The chest CT scans showed a higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection than initial RT-PCR results [2] . Similar pulmonary syndromes have been recognized as being caused by other strains of the coronavirus family. The most striking examples are the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [5] .Imaging is a critical component of the diagnostic workup, monitoring of disease progression, and followup in coronavirus-related pulmonary affection [6] .Since the etiologic and clinical features of the syndrome are similar to those of SARS and MERS, the experience from those pulmonary syndromes can be helpful for managing the emerging COVID-19 outbreak [5] .The aim of this study is to familiarize radiologists with the imaging spectrum of coronavirus syndromes and to discuss the reported imaging features of COVID-19 comparing them to SARS and MERS findings.This cross section study included 50 patients (43 males, 7 females) with age range from 32 to 75 years (mean age of 47.2 years) confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, referred for multislice CT (MSCT) assessment of the chest ( Table 1) . MSCT of the chest was done to all patients as requested. The study was conducted between March 15 and May 12, 2020, in Cairo, Egypt.The inclusion criterion is laboratory proven PCR positive COVID-19 tests.The exclusion criteria are as follows:Pregnant females Patients presenting with acute heart failure Patients who recently experienced clinically defined pulmonary infection attributable to other pathogens Patients with severe artifacts on CT imagesAll enrolled patients were subjected to as follows:❖ Through history taking. ❖ Laboratory assessment (CBC, ESR, and PCR).MSCT of the chest was done to all patients using a multi-detector CT scanner with 64 or more channels. The detailed parameters for CT acquisition were as follows: tube voltage, 120 kVp; tube current, standard (reference mAs, 60-120) to low dose (reference mAs, 30) with automatic exposure control; slice thickness, 1.0 mm; reconstruction interval, 1.0-3.0 mm; and a sharp reconstruction kernel. CT images were obtained with the patient in the supine position at full inspiration, head first and without contrast medium ( Table 2) .❖ Then, the images acquired sent to a separate workstation to be processed, manipulated, and reconstructed. ❖ Images are reconstructed in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes to detect the distribution of parenchymal affection (2D multiplanar images reconstruction, MPR). ❖ All images were viewed on both lungs (width, 1500 HU; level, − 700 HU) and mediastinal (width, 350 HU; level, 40 HU) settings. ❖ For each patient, the chest CT scan was evaluated by two radiologists separately searching for the following characteristics: (1) presence of ground-glass opacities, (2) presence of consolidation, (3) laterality of groundglass opacities and consolidation, (4) presence of nodules, (5) presence of a pleural effusion, (6) presence of thoracic lymphadenopathy (defined as lymph node size of ≥ 10 mm in short-axis dimension), (7) airways abnormalities (including airway wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and endoluminal secretions), (8) axial distribution of disease (categorized as no axial distribution of disease, central ""peribronchovascular"" predominant disease, or peripheral predominant disease), and (9) other abnormalities, including linear opacities, opacities with a rounded morphology, opacities with a ""reverse halo"" sign, and opacities with a ""crazy-paving"" pattern.Findings are presented as medians, and interquartile ranges due to small sample size categorical variables are described as whole numbers, with percentages in brackets.This cross section study included 50 patients (43 males, 7 females) with age ranging from 32 to 75 years (mean age of 47.2 years), with PCR positive COVID results. They were referred to perform MSCT of the chest. Most patients presented with dyspnea, which was seen in 43 patients (86%), 40 patients suffered from fever (80%), and 25 patients presented with dry cough (50%).The most imminent radiological finding was groundglass opacity found in 42 patients (84% of cases), followed by consolidation found in 30 patients (60% of cases) and ground glass and consolidation together found in 22 patients (44% of cases) as shown in Table 2 .Twenty-two patients showed lower zone predominance (44%), 18 patients showed equal distribution between the upper and lower zones (36%), and ten patients showed upper zone predominant changes (20%) ( Table 3) .The ground-glass and consolidative opacities were peripheral in most patients with lung findings (n = 42), while 6 patients who had diffuse ground-glass changes and 2 patients showed peri-hilar distribution (Table 3) .Other less common findings like coarse pulmonary interstitium were in 8 patients (16%); basal curvilinear atelectasis was seen in 7 patients (14%); reversed halo sign was seen in three patients (6% of cases); crazy paving pattern (6%) and mild bronchiectatic changes were noticed in 2 patients (4% of cases).Pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, cavitation, mediastinal, and hilar lymph node enlargement were not seen in any of the patients.Lower respiratory tract infections are the most lethal transmissible diseases worldwide, causing around 3 million deaths per year [7] .Previously, six types of coronavirus had been identified that cause human disease: four cause mild respiratory symptoms, whereas the other two, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, have caused epidemics with high mortality rates [7] . In 2019, a new strain, called SARS-CoV-2, started circulating all over the word as a pandemic, causing the disease COVID-19 [6] .Imaging is confirmed to be critical in assessing severity and disease progression in COVID-19 infection [4] .Variety of imaging features seen while studying MSCT of chest of COVID-19 patients shows great similarity to that described in other coronavirus-associated syndromes.Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT for COVID-19 are reported to range from 80 to 90% and 60 to 70%, respectively [8, 9] .In our study, we noted dyspnea was the commonest clinical symptoms which was in disagreement with the study done by Andrea et al. [10] who noted that fever was the most common symptoms in COVID positive patients, followed by cough and fatigue. Fever is 85.6%, cough is 68.7%, and fatigue is 39.4%.According to the different radiological findings in the study population, it was noted that ground-glass opacification was the most common radiological finding 84%, followed by consolidation 60% which agrees with Ming et al. [11] who studied the imaging profile of the COVID-19 infection and agrees with Melina et al. [5] which showed that multifocal ground-glass opacities and consolidation were reported as main radiological features (Fig. 1) .The ground-glass and consolidative opacities were peripheral in most patients with lung findings (n = 42, 84%), while 6 patients had diffuse ground-glass changes and 2 patients showed peri-hilar distribution, which is matching with a study done by Ming et al. [11] who found that lung affection was peripheral in all patients with lung findings (100%), apart from one patient who had peri-hilar ground-glass changes in addition (Figs. 2  and 3) .Twenty-two patients showed lower zone predominance (44%), 18 patients showed equal distribution between the upper and lower zones (36%), and ten patients showed upper zone predominant changes (20%), which is partially agreeing with Ming's study [11] who found that 44% of patients showed lower zone predominance, while 44% of patients showed equal distribution between the upper and lower zones and 16% of patients showed upper zone predominant changes and agrees also to the study done by Ho et al. [12] , who demonstrated that the common CT findings of bilateral involvement, peripheral distribution, and lower zone dominance.Reversed halo sign was seen in 3 cases (6%) which is agreeing with Ming et al. who stated that reversed halo sign was seen infrequently (Fig. 4) .We found coarsening of basal pulmonary interstitium in 8 cases (16%) which does not match with the study done by Shuchang et al. [13] who found GGO plus a reticular pattern in 62.9% of his patients (Fig. 5) .Curvilinear subpleural opacity was seen in 7 patients (14%) which is matching with studies by Wu et al. [14] and Li et al. [15] both reported around 20% of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated this sign, which might relate to pulmonary edema or fibrosis of COVID-19 (Fig. 6) .Crazy paving pattern was seen in 3 patients (6%) which is matching with many recent investigations reported 5~36% COVID-19 patients with crazy paving pattern in their studies [15, 16] . Furthermore, the presence of diffuse GGO, consolidation, and crazy paving pattern can be the signal of COVID-19 entering progressive or peak stage [17] (Fig. 7) .Pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, cavitation, mediastinal, and hilar lymph node enlargement were not seen in any of our patients which agree with Ming's study [11] which declared that lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and enlarged lymph nodes were absent.Since COVID/SARS and MERS are considered from the same viral family (coronavirus), imaging features of Unlike SARS, where initial chest imaging abnormalities are more frequently unilateral, COVID-19 is more likely to involve both lungs on initial imaging presented as bilateral peripheral subpleural scattered ground-glass opacities [5] . The majority of SARS positive patients show progressive multifocal distribution, in the followup imaging, of which 75% of patients show bilateral distribution [18] , while MERS initial imaging tends to show multifocal airspace opacities in the lower lung zones which then progress to extend peri-hilar and upper lobar [19] .Pleural effusion is absent in COVID-19 patients while it is not rare in MERS and might be observed in 20-33% of affected individuals [5] .Centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud are not characteristics of SARS or MERS [20] , which is the same in COVID-19 according to our study.Overall, the imaging findings are highly sensitive yet highly nonspecific and might overlap with the symptoms of H1N1 influenza, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, or atypical pneumonia. The acute clinical presentation and history of contact with a COVID-19-infected patient or history of recent travel should raise clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [21] .The imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia are highly sensitive yet nonspecific and are more often bilateral with subpleural and peripheral distribution and ",Egypt,abstract,2020-08-28,08
cfc13c89a2d4ebe0dc589816ea509201dc5b8f9c,Past-Future Synergies: Commentary on Schoemaker 2020,"Planning"" expertly portrays the differences and similarities between historical analysis and scenario planning. While both fields study developments over time, historians are focused on looking backward while scenario planners look forward. Examining the parallels,and illustrates the challenges with a 1992 scenario planning exercise on South Africa's post-apartheid future. He concludes with the notion that ""..historians and scenario planners can very much learn from each other"" with the qualifier that this will be challenging, as both disciplines are still developing learning and research methods within their own respective fields.The paper is extremely timely as academics and practitioners are trying to make sense of (and learn from) the unexpected developments perturbing world platforms via Covid-19. Ironically, many countries and organizations have had scenarios for pandemic outbreaks for years. Still, COVID-19 came as a surprise. It appears that no effective planning was done, no proactive measures were taken and governments were overwhelmed while experts warned for similarities to historical outbreaks and drew attention to lessons learned from past epidemics (Snowden, 2020) . The turbulence surrounding Covid-19 presents a productive living and learning laboratory that confirms the importance of how historical analysis can enrich scenario planning as suggested by Schoemaker; and it also highlights how constructing scenarios are not sufficient if they do not translate to forecasts and actions.Our efforts to better understand how historical analysis-scenario planning dynamics could lead to improved forecasts and decisions will need to include studies on biases and informational asymmetries that permeate past-future synergies. Biases are systematic deviations from norm or rationality in judgment, influenced by the context and framing of information (Hasselton, Nettle, & Andrew, 2005) . The literature on biases is extensive and reaches back to Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman's seminal work (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) . Biases play a key role in the context of foresight and scenario processes (Bradfield, 2008; Schirrmeister, Göhring, & Warnke, 2019; Schoemaker, 1993; Wack, 1985) , while also affecting the way we view historical events (Mccullagh, 2002; Mukharji & Zeckhauser, 2019) .Schoemaker's portrayal of similarities and differences between the two fields. One crucial lesson learned from this paper is that we will be better in looking forward (scenario planning) if we learn how to look back (historical analysis of information). While this is a valid point, historical analysis can be subject to misinformation with intentional/unintentional distortions. As it was once so eloquently put: ""History is written by the victors"". More importantly, history is written by individuals and later analyzed by individuals. Yet, individuals are biased, make errors and have subjective views that cannot be uncoupled from the rest of their knowledge. Historic misinformation will influence historical accuracy as well as scenario diversity.Additionally, both the recorders of history and the historical analysts may be biased and looking for information to record that confirm their perspectives. Such confirmation bias reflecting the human tendency to look for new information in accordance with what they already believe to be true (leading to omission of possibly relevant and yet contradictory information) is the complete opposite of the scientific method of falsifiability (Popper, 1934) . Confirmation bias can lead to an effect where information is (often unconsciously) distorted so to make it fit with the person's belief or with the current narrative (Nickerson, 1998) . This misinformation can be created and sustained on different levels: by the people who record the facts, present the facts, interpret the facts and those who in general, use the facts. In the case of COVID-19, there may have been a failure to prepare or react in time, because the people responsible did not want the epidemic to happen, did not believe it could reach such dimensions and only saw confirming signs that would indicate a minor threat of the COVID-19 virus.A second bias that may play a distorting role in both historical analysis and scenario planning is hindsight bias. We deem events more predictable after they have happened than we do before their occurrence. It is such a strong effect that it may even alter our own memories or belief systems, similar to the confirmation bias. It may also elicit overconfidence when asked to predict similar events happening in the future (Blank, Nestler, von Collani, & Fischer, 2008) .We know now that a pandemic was unavoidable and comparisons with SARS are quickly made, but we have not witnessed these strong historical analogies before the current pandemic was officially pronounced. As noted by Schoemaker, although hindsight bias is prevalent and we need to be aware of it in after-the-fact analyses, it may be used positively via framing scenarios in the past tense and asking for alternative histories with what-if scenarios.A third bias of interest is the desirability bias. While scenario planners need to carefully disentangle what they wish to happen from alternative plans, historical analysts need to be cautious about how they engage in retrospective sensemaking when interpreting past records. A global pandemic was fully undesirable across all stakeholders and thus signs of spreading of the virus were ignored or minimized until it was too late. Specifically prompting for undesirable-case scenarios to be generated in scenario planning while instigating thought experiments on alternative histories could pre-empt this bias.It is not just biases and misinformation that can distort conclusions. Given that we live in a misinformation age bombarded with ""alternative facts"" and ""fake news accounts,"" our use of historical analogies may be qualified by the level of trust we place in historical information. There are also potential effects of informational asymmetries and information overload: it is difficult to discern between what information we should consider and learn from, and which information to ignore. Similar to historical analysts' use of counterfactual history (Evans, 2014) , scenario planners may emphasize premortem exercises (i.e., placing themselves in a future position under each of the scenarios and engaging in counterfactual thinking on what could have gone wrong) to alleviate informational distortions.Historical analysis is teaching us that we should indeed learn from history-from past successes and from past failures. Because what is forgotten, can repeat itself-and we may miss the opportunity to prepare for it. We can learn from history to become more resilient and anti-fragile. We can learn how to handle risk better if we can improve our scenarios (and act upon them) by studying history. But, while doing so, we have to be cognizant of not anchoring on misinformed accounts, ignoring significant information and overweighing misconstrued contexts.Schoemaker's article gives insights on why historians should not leave the future to others (Bátiz-Lazo & Haigh& Stearns, 2014 ) and why scenario planners should embrace history. Rather than writing reactive scenarios (Cairns & Wright, 2020) , we have to learn from alternative analyses of the past to proactively and creatively plan for the future. Historical analysis and scenario-planning have to feed from each other to lead to better forecasts and actions.

Covid-19 was recognized in December 2019. 1 The highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which emanated from China and has since become a global public health emergency. 2 In severe cases, the virus causes fatal pneumonia similar to that caused by (SARS-CoV-2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have emerged in the past years sporadically in countries. 3 The course of the Covid-19 epidemic will likely be strongly impacted by how the population behaves, which in turn is influenced by what people know and believe about this disease. 4 A particular concern in this regard is the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 on social media sites. This has led the WHO to host a page with ""myth busters"" on their website and engage in discussions with social media. 5, 26 The concern by the world health organization that COVID-19 could take time to be eliminated and the rate at which the infection is spreading across the world calls for rapid assessments of the population's knowledge and perceptions of this infection. 6, 7 This work is aimed at assessing knowledge and risk perception about COVID-19 among a convenience sample of the Nigerian adult population.This was a web-based cross-sectional survey among adult Nigerian population.The survey questionnaire was adopted from other studies (see appendix). 9 ,10 It covered the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge regarding COVID-19 and its preventive measures and perceived risk about the disease.A pilot study was conducted to assess the reliability of the questionnaire before its use. The questionnaire was pretested on 20 participants who were excluded later from the main study.Participants completed the perceived risk scale (Cronbach's α = 0.82) which had 8 survey-items (5-point likert scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree).An online survey portal, Google Form was created, and adult participants were invited to complete and submit the form via WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter social media sites. The process of calling participants to share in the survey was conducted through convenient sampling. Participants continued to spread and were expected to cover the entire six regions of the country. The study was conducted from May to July, 2020 among Nigerian adults.Participant's responses were analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25.0. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data on socio-demographic characteristics, infection prevention and control measures against the novel coronavirus by participants and responses to questions concerning knowledge and risk perceptions towards the new coronavirus. Data were summarized as frequencies (n) and percentages (%) for categorical variables.Knowledge concerning COVID-19 was assessed by answering 14 questions followed by the calculation of a total cumulative knowledge score for each participant. Questions were given one mark for correct response and zero mark for incorrect answers. The knowledge score was categorized into: Good, Fair, Poor and Very poor. Chi-square test was performed to determine association between sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge as well as infection prevention and control measures by participants. A post hoc test was carried out after a significant Chi square test to identify where the difference in knowledge of the disease really lies. Kruskal Wallis test with post-hoc was used to assess difference in the risk perception across sociodemographic characteristics. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% confidence interval (CI).This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Gombe State University. Participants' anonymity and confidentiality were ensured. A Participant information sheet was served and an informed consent was obtained before the participant answered the questionnaire.Five hundred and ten persons from 6 regions of Nigeria completed the survey. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of the studied participants. More than two thirds (66.9%) were males. More than half the participants (53.5%) aged 26 to <35 years, less than a quarter aged 18 to less than 25 (16.3%), aged 36 to less than 45 (14%) and aged 46 to ≤55, whereas only 3.7% aged 55 and above. Most of the participant reside in the north east (37.6). More than half were university graduates (56.5%), 23.7% had Masters degrees, 3.7% had Doctorate degrees. 0.4% had less than senior school certificate and 2.7% had senior school certificate respectively. The monthly income of a large proportion of the participants 38.6% was more than N 110,000. More than half of the participants (59.4%) were not healthcare workers, 19.2% were pharmacists, 2.2% were physicians, whereas only 2.5% were nurses.Almost all of the participants (95.9%) claimed they were aware of the novel coronavirus. 55.3% of the participants were aware of COVID-19 mostly through the media (TV/Radio/Bill boards/Newspapers). Only a small percent (3.7%) were aware through health officials. Only 48% of the participants had a good knowledge of the disease while 34.9% had a fair knowledge, 13.9% had a poor knowledge and 3.1% had a very poor knowledge of the disease respectively.The relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge about COVID-19 is demonstrated in Table 2 . The cumulative knowledge scores were significantly related to the level of education (p<0.001) as well as to the monthly income (p<0.01). Being a Healthcare worker also influence the knowledge about COVID-19 (p<0.01). When asked ""If you have a fever or cough and recently came in contact with someone who is confirmed to be positive for , what action will you take? 61% of the participants responded with the recommended care-seeking option of staying home and contacting their health system. 33.3% of the participants stated they would delay care-seeking by self-isolation while a small percent (0.6%) of the participants would rather attend the hospital emergency department and 2% of the participants would rather rest more than usual and if symptom persists, they take a public transport to their primary care provider.Avoiding travel to high risk areas was significantly different across gender in which females were much less likely to travel to areas with high cases likewise avoiding eating out significantly contrasted with gender in which the female gender was less likely to eat out than their male counterpart. Wearing of face mask and eating balanced diet also significantly differ across gender in which males were more likely to wear face masks but females are more likely to eat balanced diet. Studies by. 12, 24 revealed that diet and nutrition invariably influence the immune system competence to fight infections and determine the risk and severity of infections. There are bidirectional relationships among diet, nutrition, infection, and immunity. Improving the diet quality in susceptible individuals for COVID-19 might alleviate their risk of severe infection.The distribution of the survey through the internet allowed only those who can read and have internet access to participate and likewise the distribution of responses by participant's regions may differ from the general population owing to the fact that samples from South-South and the South-East were small. Another limitation could be that our data was skewed to the young adults also lack of inclusion of those with chronic illness in this study is also a limitation as novel coronavirus tends to be more deleterious on those with chronic diseases.In general, our participants had a good knowledge of COVID-19 with a low risk perception among non-healthcare providers but a high-risk perception of getting infected with the novel coronavirus was observed among healthcare providers. This knowledge is mainly acquired through the traditional media platforms. However, knowledge was lower among less educated and lower income groups. Intervention may require more efforts or using different methods to communicate with these groups. Although the government has taken major steps to reduce the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to support the most affected groups from the economic impact of the disease..",Nigeria,abstract,2020-08-25,08
d9828971b35e314db8d4dff5c3f30fa11e6db4b8,Chest CT-scan finding of asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective 542 patients' single center study Chest CT-scan finding of asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective 542 patients' single center study,"In the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak, asymptomatic infected individuals may become the contagious source of SARS-CoV-2; some of them progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic complications. Early detection has become crucial to ensure rapid prevention and timely treatment. So numerous healthcare professionals are involved in responding to the health crisis mostly with unknown infected patients. Chest CT imaging of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia has definite characteristics and the role of radiologists has been emphasized [1, 2] . The definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab or other respiratory specimens. However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR depends on several factors, including the quality of the sampling, and the viral burden at the time of specimen collection, explaining that some cases may be missed [2, 3] . In the current emergency, the low sensitivity of RT-PCR implies that many COVID-19 patients may not be identified and may not receive appropriate treatment in time; such patients constitute a risk for infecting a larger population given the highly contagious nature of the virus. Chest CT, as a routine imaging tool for several pathologies, is relatively easy to perform and can produce fast diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonias with characteristic findings including ground-glass, opacities, multifocal patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial changes with a peripheral distribution [3] . Given the current prevalence of the disease, we can expect incidental detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on examinations not directly performed for this reason. This situation is of critical importance since radiologically visible COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with potential virus transmission [4, 5] . In this study we aimed to detect incidentally COVID-19 pneumonia on medical imaging for patients consulting for other reasons.From March 15 to May 10, 2020, 542 patients in Monastir, Tunisia who had a CT scan for different indications and who had a screening chest CT scan at the same time of the requested examination even for acute abdominal pain as well as patients who did requested chest CT scan were included. Three radiologists (Resident in medical imaging during training and two radiologists with 15 years of experience in interpreting chest CT imaging), reviewed all chest CT images and decided on positive or negative CT findings by consensus. The epidemiological history and clinical presentation were available for all readers. The radiologists classified the chest CT as positive or negative for COVID-19. For each patient, the chest CT scan was evaluated by these following characteristics: (1) ground-glass opacities, (2) parenchymal consolidation, (3) peripheral position of groundglass opacities and consolidation, (4) number of lobes affected, (5) degree of involvement of each lung lobe in addition to overall extent of lung involvement measured by means of a ""total severity score"" as detailed below, (6) presence of nodules (alveolar nodule or ""tree in bud"" pattern nodules), (7) pleural effusion, (8) thoracic lymphadenopathy (defined as lymph node size of ≥10 mm in short-axis dimension), (9) small airways abnormalities (wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and endoluminal secretions), (10) central distribution of disease (""peribronchovascular"" predominant disease) and (11) presence of underlying lung disease such as emphysema or fibrosis. Other abnormalities, including linear opacities, opacities with a rounded morphology, opacities with a ""reverse halo"" sign, opacities with a ""crazy-paving"" pattern, and opacities with intralesional cavitation, were noted. Ground-glass opacification was defined as hazy increased lung attenuation with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, whereas consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of margins of vessels and airway walls. Each of the five lung lobes was assessed for degree of involvement and classified as none (0%), minimal (1-25%), mild (26-50%), moderate (51-75%), or severe (76-100%). Patients with chest CTs classified as a COVID-19 suspect had RT-PCR tests and were isolated. For patients with negative RT-PCR tests but positive CT results, clinical follow-up compared with serial chest CT scans and a second RT-PCR were carried out to further confirm the imaging diagnosis.542 patients (mean age, 45years [4, 86] ; Sex ratio 65% [357/542] men) were available for CT chest screening. Only nine patients (1.6 %) had positive CT scans and in which RT-PCR was made. Of 9 patients with positive CT scans results, only 22 % (2/9) had positive RT-PCR and 77% had negative test even for second RT-PCR. Of the 9 patients, five patients (55%) had ground-glass opacities and consolidation, four patients (45%) had only groundglass opacities (with no consolidation). Two patients (22%) had opacities in one lobe, 6 patients (66%) had four affected lobes, and 1 patient (12%) had disease affecting all five lobes (Table 1) Case 2: CT images without intravenous contrast performed in a 57-year-old men consulting in the emergency room for brain trauma following a loss of consciousness. The brain scanner was without abnormalities. The findings included bilateral subpleural and peripheral ground-glass opacities with pulmonary condensation predominant in the lower lobes (Figure 2 ). Two days later the patient presented a cough, chest pain and high fever (39°C). A RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 was performed and returned positive.Case 3: CT images obtained without intravenous contrast in a 52-year-old male following a chest CT scan as part of exploration of atypical chest pain without dyspnea and normal levels of cardiac enzymes. The first ECG showed no repolarization abnormalities. The CT scan demonstrated bilateral and central ground-glass with Broncho vascular bundle and interlobular septal thickening ( Figure  3 ). Interstitial pulmonary edema secondary to probably coronary syndrome was the most likely diagnosis. However, the patient was isolated and RT-PCR test was performed due to the epidemiologic context which proved negative. Meantime, the cardiac ultrasonography control ECG and evolution of cardiac enzyme level confirm the acute coronary syndrome with subacute pulmonary edema.For the nine patients with chest CTs classified as a COVID-19 suspect, specific management was pursued, including the requirement to wear a mask, immediate information of the suspicious imaging findings to the patient and the referring physician, and activation of the RT-PCR test procedure, as well as careful disinfection of the CT suite. All these infection control measures aimed to prevent potential transmission to other individuals, including other patients who are potentially vulnerable, radiology staff, relatives, and any other personal contacts. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the radiology staff, especially radiology technicians, must be aware and trained to any incidental detection of appearances suggestive of SARSCoV-2 infection. Such findings may be discovered not only on chest CT but, during any imaging performed for other clinical situations, also when the lungs are partially visible in non-pneumological studies. Therefore, while specific tracks for suspected or known COVID-19 patients have been established, the healthcare team should keep in mind that asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic carriers are potentially present in the non-COVID-19 pathway. Several consequences flow from this. First, radiology technicians might be unexpectedly exposed and should be provided with adequate protective equipment. Second, we recommend reviewing all available chest images within any imaging examination as soon as possible before the patient leaves the radiology facility to identify suggestive abnormalities. Third, in case of suggestive findings, the CT suite needs to be appropriately cleaned before the next examination, while patients should be quickly directed to the COVID-19 pathway. Taken together, these actions are likely to slow down the clinical workflow, and prolonged waiting times for outpatients should be avoided [5] . Maintaining limited but adequate precautionary measures would be warranted to safeguard the health of the community, including healthcare actors and vulnerable persons. We suggest continuing to review chest images immediately after the acquisition to promptly detect suggestive features of COVID-19 pneumonia, even when the examination is performed for other clinical indications.RT-PCR is currently considered as the gold standard diagnostic method for COVID-19. However, the sensitivity of this method in throat swabs in COVID-19 is around 59% [3] . To date, in several studies the sensitivity of chest CT has exceeded that of RT-PCR, and the authors emphasized the potential of chest CT as the primary screening tool for COVID-19 [3, 6] . The sensitivity of chest CT is unquestionable and encouraged for cases where there is need to determine the extension of disease and alternative diagnoses. Chest CT is a conventional, non-invasive imaging modality with high accuracy and speed. Based on available data published in recent literature, almost all patients with COVID-19 had characteristic CT features in the disease process, such as different degrees of ground-glass opacities with/without crazy-paving sign, multifocal organizing pneumonia, and architectural distortion in a peripheral distribution [3, 4] . In this study only two patients with typical CT manifestations had positive RT-PCR tests. In the context of emergency disease control, some false-positive cases may be acceptable. On the other hand, given the relatively low positive rate of RT-PCR assay, some ""falsepositive"" cases on CT may indeed be ""true-positive"" if RT-PCR assay is an imperfect standard of reference. In fact, from the results of this study, 7 patients (1.3%) with negative RT-PCR results but positive chest CT scans were isolated and followed with a second RT-PCR performed to ensure the absence of sars-cov2 infection.This study showed a low incidence of patients with COVID-19 pattern pneumonia on daily CT scan activity outside the hospital specific pathway. However, this situation is of critical consequences since radiologically visible COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with potential severe complication for patients and potential virus transmission within the health staff. Of note, once the outbreak will be under control and the number of cases declines, these emergency measures will be progressively discontinued. At the same time, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 will probably not end overnight, and some cases will still be diagnosed in the following months.

02df14e9d2c27691bf82b2240e4f99ebc54a1657,Journal Pre-proofs A new approach for COVID-19 treatment by micro-RNA A new approach for COVID-19 treatment by micro-RNA,"The fast-spreading of COVID-19 raised a notion that mutations may drive its evolution.Therefore, discovery single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are considered as a vital step to understanding the viral evolution. The genome of COVID-19 is evoluted from SARS-CoV and MERS CoV6. Comparison of the genome sequences of the COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV showed that 2019-CoV has better sequence identity with SARS-CoV than the MERS CoV6. Kabir et al. [3] extensively reviewed factors that affect COVID-19 genetic diversity and its evolution. The COVID-19 has a unique amino acid sequence from other coronaviruses entirely in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. There are two subunits building S-protein up. One of these subunits binds directly to the host receptor facilitating the virus entry into the host cells.However, the RNA binding domain has a higher homology with SARS-CoV. Although some critical residues for binding to receptors differ, in general, mismatched residues did not change the structural composition. Studies indicate that the human receptor for COVID-19 could be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, enter human cells through ACE2 [4] .The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly worldwide, and the global interested scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for the treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China [5] .Excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known antiinflammatory, and anti-oxidative molecule are protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens [6] . Most recently, Jackson et al. [7] reported the response of healthy adults human, 18 to 55 years of age, to an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The authors in this report concluded that a synthesized mRNA of COVID 19 vaccine-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings strongly support the idea of targeting the viral mRNA using miRNAs in the human body since large mRNA molecules (about 1273 bp) were delivered in living human cells and induces their biological functions.MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that play important roles in regulating gene expression.These molecules comprise a group of small non-coding RNAs 18~25 nucleotides (nt) in length that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression via binding to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of target gene mRNA [8, 9] . The majority of miRNAs are transcribed from DNA sequences into primary miRNAs and processed into precursor miRNAs, and finally mature miRNAs. In most cases, miRNAs interact with the 3′ UTR of target mRNAs to induce mRNA degradation and translational 3 repression resulting in protein biosynthesis inhibition. However, the interaction of miRNAs with other regions, including the 5′ UTR, coding sequence, and gene promoters, have also been reported [10] .The extracellular miRNAs can be delivered to target cells, and they may act as autocrine, paracrine, and/or endocrine regulators to modulate cellular activities [11] . Contrary to cellular RNA species, extracellular miRNAs are highly stable, resisting degradation at room temperature for up to 4 days and in deleterious conditions such as boiling, multiple freeze-thaw cycles, and high or low pH8 [12, 13] .The previous studies indicated that there is a direct binding of miRNA to viral RNA. This binding has negative effects on the virus and consequently preventing its translation on host ribosome's or virus genome degradation [1] . If there is a target site for miRNA on the virus genome, it is likely that this site or its sequences will be removed/changed (introduced -SNPs) very quickly adapted in the virus progeny. For that reason, our hypothesis was developed to stop this natural evolution by targeting many sites on the viral genome simultaneously.Recently, a complete genome sequence for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain isolated from an oropharyngeal swab specimen of a Nepalese patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was published in GenBank (accession number NC_045512), excluding the poly(A) tail of the genome [14] . Taking this advantage, we hypothesized that designing a synthetic miRNA complemented to COVID-19 at 3' UTR and another essential region, including ORF9, which encodes a nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N). This protein is a basic RNA-binding protein encoded in the most 3' protein of the COVID genome, plays both structural and non-structural roles in infection.Most of N complexes with genome RNA to form the viral capsid and interacts with the viral membrane protein during assembly. Therefore, we assume targeting this gene may reduce or stop the process of viral particle assembly. The 3' UTR region and ORF9 of COVID-19 were identified using the sequence (Acc.#: NC_045512). We hypothesize if we can disrupt the binding between eukaryotic translation initiation factors that bind with viral mRNA by miRNAs from 3' and 5' UTR regions could inhibit or suppress the translation process. Designing other miRNAs from ORF could stop the translation or degrading the viral RNA. Therefore, Thei-score designer (www.med.nagoyau.ac.jp/neurogenetics/i_Score/i_score.html)was used to deduce some candidates of miRNAs complemented of COVID-19. These miRNA was tested by blasting against the human genome to check whether they are complemented to any human genes or not. The ones that give no significant matching with the human genome were selected (examples given in Table 1 ). We assume these 4 miRNAs (Table 1) could be delivered to the human respiratory system by a suitable delivery system resulting in reduction or inhibition of the virus life cycle.In order to test whether this hypothesis is positive or negative, these miRNAs will be synthesized using any DNA synthesizer technology with high purity of HPLC coupled with PAGE technologies.We assume to perform an in vitro experiment using cell culture techniques. These cells will be infected with COVID-19 thereafter, the miRNA will be delivered by a suitable method (discussed after). Application of quantitative RT-PCR, the infected cells will be isolated and washed several time; the total RNA acid will be isolated and converted to cDNA using suitable means. Comparing the quantitative RT-PCR results with the control treatment (cells without miRNA treatment, and noninfected cells), we can evaluate our hypothesis. Table 1 : the sequences of deduced antisense miRNA using i-score web tools: The previous studies revealed that plant miRNAs might target their genes in the consumers and have been detected not only in blood circulation but also in murine tissue [15] . In mice, it has been clear that plant miRNAs down-regulated at least one endogenous target in the liver, the low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein one 1 (LDLRAPI), within hours of dietary intake [16] . Based on these results, the extracellular miRNAs may be used to regulate different molecular pathways controlling different metabolic and developmental processes. Therefore, the synthetic miRNA could be delivered appropriately, sticking out the specific organ in the human body and entered the cells targeting the particular gene. The main obstacle to the use of this approach is how to deliver the synthetic miRNAs to a specific organ.The delivery of exogenous plant miRNAs to circulation and murine tissue is not clear.Some studies indicated that exogenous miRNA makes a complex called vesicle-associated-miRNA that may enter the cells by either phagocytosis, endocytosis, or direct fusion with the plasma membranes. On the other hand, vesicle-free miRNA may be delivered by specific receptors on the cell surface [17] . Some studies indicated that miRNAs enter the cells by endocytosis and micropinocytosis [18] . This process depends on clathrin, but not on caveolae or lipid rafts in PC12 cells [18] . However, A549-P studies showed that endocytosis of exogenous miRNAs is mediated by caveolae-and lipid raft-dependent pathways [19] .Furthermore, vesicle-free miRNAs that are linked with HDL are delivered by HDL and BI (SR-BI) receptors, located in the plasma membrane of the target cells [20, 21] . miRNAs show an ability to transfer between co-cultured cells mediated direct cell-cell contact and gap junctions [22] . Although these studies suggest that extracellular miRNAs can interact with recipient cells via multiple mechanisms, the factors that determine the specificity of such interactions are not clear. polyethylene glycol (PEG), a frequently used functional group, was conjugated to cationic lipids to escape phagocytosis of the RES when administered systemically [24] .Studies at Tokyo University confirmed that miRNA-126-loaded by modified PEG liposomes binds with entrapping ultrasound, promoting angiogenesis, and improving blood flow in an experimental hindlimb ischemia model [25] . A novel system contains miRNA-10b antagomirs and a pH-responsive liposome modified with the antimicrobial peptide [D]-H 6 L 9 (D-Lip). It has been reported that paclitaxel could delay 4 T1 tumor growths and reduce lung metastases in a murine breast cancer model [26] . Exploring miRNA profile in cells infected with HCV indicated that the top hits miR-25, miR-130a/b, and let-7a were downregulated by the virus both in cultured cells and liver tissues of infected patients. These results suggest that HCV counteracts their proven antiviral capacity by reducing their levels [27] . In another study, miR-485-5p was one of the most upregulated ones not only upon Newcastle Virus (NDV) infection but also in cells infected with Influenza A virus (IAV) H5N1 or transfected with a synthetic dsRNA, polyI:C [28] .",Egypt,first author,2020-08-19,08

La présente étude s'est donnée pour ambition d'évaluer la prévalence des symptômes de l'anxiété et de la dépression chez les professionnels de santé dans les trois Régions les plus concernées au Cameroun. Les liens entre les variables ont été considérées significatifs pour une valeur de P < 0,05.Résultats. -Les résultats montrent que le personnel féminin a été relativement plus représentatif (54,50%) avec un sex-ratio (F/M) de In any biological disaster resulting to high contamination and death rate, words such as fear, uncertainty and stigma are common and can be obstacles to appropriate medical intervention. The foreseeable shortage of protective equipment and an increasing flow of both suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases contribute to increase pressure and preoccupation on health professionals [17] , but also a real source of stress. In fact, those offering health care to patients with pneumonia or suspected COVID-19 infection are vulnerable to both a high risk of infection and mental health problems [27] . These problems affect the attention, understanding and decision-making capacity of hospital care professionals; which could hamper the fight against COVID-19 and have a lasting deleterious effect on their general wellbeing [10] .Authors report that the medical sector is classified at a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and potentially spreading it to others [4, 25] . There is a constant increase in the number of suspect and confirmed cases, the pressure in health care, the exhaustion of personal protective equipment, the generalized media coverage, the lack of specific drugs and the feeling of being poorly taken care of, can contribute to the mental overload of health workers and as long as to a significant anxio-depressive experience [11] . In addition to the risks associated to the working conditions, health professionals also face psychological risks, in particular the burnout due to excessive stress in an increase busy health system and multiple clinical activities that can fuel anxiety and depression [17] .The experience of depression against the coexistence of countless number of deaths, long shifts with strangers and the most diverse demands in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 has also been identified by authors [11, 21] . For instance, Neto and collaborators remind that most of those who work in isolation units and hospitals are not trained to provide mental health care. All of these factors could contribute to the development of experiences of stress responsible for the emergence of the anxio-depressive symptomatology. COVID-19 respiratory infection spread very quickly and the entire health sector still runs after the virus. We will briefly present the situation in the world, in Africa and in Cameroon at the time of writing this article.Data available on the WHO website as of May 18, 2020 shows that the world has reached 4 718 215 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 315 283 deaths [20] . This article is written during evolution of the pandemic and statistics remain very dynamic. However, the United States, Italy, Spain, France and United Kingdom are the five countries which pay the heaviest tribe linked to this pandemic. As of this write up, the African continent remains the least affected in the world. As of March 31, 2020, there were 5 255 Coronavirus confirmed cases with 172 deaths in 47 countries [28] . Cameroon is among the African countries most affected by the coronavirus pandemic and the first in Central Africa. According to the same source, Cameroon occupies the sixth position with 3,105 confirmed cases and 140 deaths [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In this perspective, the cities of Yaoundé, Douala, and Bafoussam are the cities which alone account for 95.8% of the confirmed cases as well as the deceased. It is a highly contagious disease with a proven risk of death, particularly in the context of comorbidity and old age [22] .In this context of coronavirus, compulsory or voluntary confinement is recommended by almost all the stakeholders. However, health care workers face a dilemma: that of moving forward, facing the disease when others move back ward. This posture imposed on health professionals by their science and practical know-how is not without psychological impact.More generally, the diagnosis of a serious illness remains a traumatic event comparable to a life event [23] and health personnel is one of the populations most exposed to contamination by the coronavirus as already noted. The awareness of this risk of contamination can be a real reason for significant psychological distress.If most of the authors converge on the vulnerable and risky nature of infection inducing mental health problems among health professionals, it is clear that in Cameroon currently, no research identified to our knowledge has attempted to determine the prevalence of distress, anxiety and depression among healthcare workers, who are at the forefront in the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. We agree with the authors [14, 11] who believe that practitioners and researchers in the behavioral sciences should take part in helping health care workers to contain and eliminate the spread of COVID-19, and this by producing appropriate knowledge, tools and methodologies [25] .Psychological distress can be considered as a decompensated stress leading to an anxiodepressive experience, in this sense Norton and collaborators had already underlined that the majority of psychiatric disorders are of the anxio-depressive sphere [18] . Psychological distress is also understood as a subjective state including symptoms related to anxiety, aggression, depression, irritability, exhaustion, social disengagement and cognitive problems [14] . In distress, individuals may exhibit symptoms such as anxious and depressive reactions to stressors, reduced intellectual capacity, aggression, irritability, fatigue, insomnia, absenteeism, withdrawal, cognitive problems, guilt, excessive alcohol, drugs or medication consumption [13] .Several researchers have conducted research to determine the prevalence of mental health problems among medical personnel with highly contagious diseases. Liu and colleagues [12] conducted 23 online mental health surveys on 1,563 medical personnel associated with the COVID-19 epidemic through platforms such as WeChat and Questionnaire Star. The authors found the prevalence of depression at 50.7%, anxiety at 44.7%, insomnia at 36.1% and symptoms related to stress at 73.4%.In another study, Lai and colleagues [11] assessed the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among 1,257 healthcare workers in 34 hospitals treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. The results reveal a considerable proportion of participants who reported symptoms of depression (50.4%), anxiety (44.6%) and distress (71.5%). The authors point out that these results are more important for front-line health personnel engaged in the diagnosis, treatment and direct care of patients with COVID-19. Building on the same dynamic, this research assesses depressive and anxious symptoms among healthcare professionals. This objective is based on the comments of certain authors [21, 17] who maintain that the protection of the mental health of professionals is important to control the epidemic and preserve their own health in the long term.The choice of the three Regions of Cameroon is justified not only by the fact that they cover 95.8% [15] of coronavirus cases in the country since the start of the pandemic, but also because they contain more than half (56%) of the health care professionals in the entire country The non-probability sampling method of convenience coupled with the snowball method was used. It consisted in building a web questionnaire. The choice was made on WhatsApp application where the information is less dispersed as compared to other social networks. In this perspective, the questionnaire link was sent only to the groups of health professionals.Participants were instructed to forward the link to their respective professional groups but also to their other colleagues in-box.The data collection period lasted from 05 to 19 April 2020, two weeks after which there were no more respondents. It was impossible for the same person via the same device to respond twice to the questionnaire, so the questionnaire could not be sent without all the items being checked. At the end of this period, the non-exhaustive sample size was 292 health professionals who normally answered the questionnaire. The diagnosis of anxio-depressive state was made using the HAD scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) deemed to be very relevant for evaluation in hospital settings [3] .In the HAD, each scored response semi-quantitatively assesses the intensity of the symptom during the past week. A total score is obtained as well as scores for the two subscales: the maximum score is 42 for the global scale and 21 for each of the subscales. For each subscale, a score of 7 or less refers to an absence of symptomatology, from 8 to 10 to a doubtful symptomatology and 11 and more to a certain symptomatology. Cronbach's alpha is 0.70 for depression and 0.74 for anxiety [2] . Some authors after several works have proposed that a note less than or equal to 7 indicates an absence of anxiety or depression; that between 8 and 10 suggests weak or mild anxiety or depression; between 11 and 14, for moderate anxiety or depression; finally, a score between 15 and 21 is indicative of severe anxiety [1] . In the context of this study, the latter algorithm will be used because it gives better clinical appreciation.Anyway, some evening the prospect, it is noticed that only the scores of more than 11 allow to account for a significant anxio-depressive suffering.The responses downloaded from the site were first processed with Microsoft Excel 2013 software. In this sense, the anxiety and depression scores were calculated for diagnostic purposes. After this phase, the statistical analysis was done using the software Epi Info version 7.2.2.6. The association between variables were considered significant for a P-value less than 5%. Results are presented using tables.Results are presented in three parts: first part presenting the socio-demographic characteristics. The second part presents the prevalence of symptoms, anxiety and depression and the third part dedicated to the associated factors.The Western Region was more represented with 42.80% of participants, followed by the Littoral with 29.80% and finally the Center region (27.40%) ( Table 1) Table 1) .The results of the diagnostic scales show that the general prevalence of anxiety is 42.20% (27.10% for moderate anxiety and 15.10% for severe anxiety), this prevalence was 43, 5% for depression (33.9% for moderate depression and 9.60% for severe depression). It is a quite variating prevalence within professional categories. We noted that the highest rate of anxiety and depression (57.90% and 52.60%) was observed within the Assistant Nurses category while the lowest rates (0.00%) was observed in the in Medical Laboratory personnel for anxiety (0.00%) and in Clinical Psychologists for depression (20%) ( Table 2) . Results also showed a rate of 20.54% representing the number of participants who accumulated significant scores for depression and anxiety.Factors such as age, occupational category, department, fear of contamination, fear of dying were considered to be associated with anxiety and depression. After the statistical tests, there was a strong association between anxiety and fear of dying (P = 0.000), also between anxiety and the fear of becoming infected (0.019) ( Table 3) , and age (P = 0.006) ( Table 5) . As for depression, a strong association with fear of dying (P = 0.000) ( Table 4 ) was highlighted.Furthermore, the professional qualification, the department and gender did not show a statistically significant association with any of the diagnoses.Psychological distress as an association of anxio-depressive symptomatology is reputed to be the most recurrent psychopathological problem among psychiatric disorders. The were involved in this study and the discussion of the results will respect the chronology of the presentation of the part devoted to the results.As mentioned above, the three regions of Cameroon which were concerned by the study cover 56% of the country healthcare giver number as reported by the survey by the National Institute of Statistics [7] . This shows that, even if the study does not cover all the ten regions of the country, it reflects at a high level the behavior of all the health professionals that are fighting the COVID-19. These are also cosmopolitan regions in which health workers come from all ethnic groups in Cameroon. The results show that female staff was relatively more represented (54.50%) with a sex ratio (F / M) of 1.19. This frequency would have been greater, but it is close to the average, and can be justified by the fact that 36% of women are less literate in Cameroon [7] whereas the minimum entry certificate into the health care professions now our days in Cameroon is First Certificate of Study.The middle class [31-35 years] has the highest frequency (35.30%), this huge portion of young health professionals is justified by the permanent recruitment of young professionals in the Cameroonian public service for a decade. The Nurse and Doctor category led the respondents with the respective frequencies of 57.50% and 25.30%. This strong participation of Medical Doctors and Nurses is the result of a good mastery of the collection tool in relation to their level of training. This representativeness is likely to increase the reliability of the results of the study in the sense that, these categories associated with that of Assistant Nurses, are at the forefront of the care of patients with COVID-19. In this perspective, they live a particular anxiety-provoking experience with COVID-19.In this context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the study shows that the general prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression among health personnel in the three most affected regions of Cameroon are 42.20% respectively and 43.50%. A study had also questioned the same problem in a non-epidemiological context, but rather in stress factors associated with medical emergencies at CHU Habib Bourguiba and Hédi Chaker de Sfax in Tunisia [16] . That study found a prevalence of anxiety symptoms of 38.90%, which is very close to that of the present study. However, another prevalence (50.4% for depression and 44.60% for depression), this time from China during the COVID-19 pandemic [11] was very close to that found in the present study. Still in China, Liu and collaborators [12] from their online survey conducted through platforms such as WeChat and Questionnaire Star on mental health among 1,563 medical personnel associated with the COVID-19 epidemic presented the prevalence of depression of 50.7%, and 44.7% for anxiety.It was also noted in this study the various rates of anxiety ranging from 27.10% for moderate anxiety to 15.10% for severe anxiety and on the other hand and 33.90% for moderate depression and 9.60% for severe depression. The authors Wang et al. brought out a similar approach in a study in the general population in China [26] . They had a prevalence of 16.50% for symptoms of anxiety ranging from moderate to severe and 28.80% for symptoms of depression also ranging from moderate to severe. The disparities observed in this other study can be explained by several factors including the population (the study to interview the general population and not health professionals).There has also been a strong disparity in this prevalence within the different specific professional categories. In this sense, the anxiety rates of 57.90% and depression of 52.60%were noted in the Assistant Nurses category, placing them at the forefront of psychological distress. In contrast, Medical Laboratory Technicians had the lowest anxiety rate (0.0%) andClinical Psychologists for depression (0.0%). These results reflect an empirical reality, because the Assistant Nurses are called upon to collaborate, to help other caregivers (Nurses and Doctors) in the administration of patient care. They are therefore very exposed to the risk of contamination. On the other hand, the Medical Laboratory personnel working in health facilities, except those involved in the sampling as part of COVOD-19 have a very low risk of contamination.From a general perspective, the anxiety symptoms of caregivers were, among other things, associated with the age of the participants (P = 0.006), the fear of becoming infected (P = 0.019) and of dying (P = 0.000). With regard to depressive symptoms, the only statistically significant relationship was that associated with the fear of dying (P = 0.000). These correlations are consistent with the claims of the National Institute of Excellence in Health and Social Services in Quebec. According to her, personnel of the health sector report that worries and fears in a pandemic context are related, among other things, to the health of loved ones and the risk of infection, fears of contracting the disease and / or dying, fear of lacking protective equipment [5] . Even if the fear of dying remains strongly associated with anxio-depressive symptoms, it should be noted that it was an emotion found in less than half of the participants (48.60%) thus showing moderate resilience. This relative resilience of personnel against the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to their low death rate estimated at 9.70% in Europe on May 08, 2020 [6] , but generally estimated between 0.5% and 4% by scientists [19] .The main objective of this study was to estimate the frequency of anxio-depressive symptoms in a population of healthcare professionals from the three regions most affected by COVID-19 in Cameroon. It is noted from this study that the general prevalence of symptoms ranging from mild to severe anxiety and depression among health personnel from the three most affected regions of Cameroon are respectively 42.20% and 43.50%. The anxiety rates of 57.90% and depression of 52.60% were noted in the Assistant Nurses category, placing them at the forefront of psychological distress. In contrast, Medical Laboratory personnel had the lowest anxiety rate (0.0%) and Clinical Psychologists for depression (0.0%). From a general perspective, the anxiety symptoms of caregivers were associated with the age of the participants (P = 0.006), the fear of becoming infected (P = 0.019) and the fear of dying (P = 0.000). With regard to depressive symptoms, the only statistically significant relationship was found with the fear of dying (P = 0.000). Thus, the improvement of working conditions and in particular the provision of protective equipment, the establishment of special listening units for health personnel could be proposed.The authors declare that they have no links of interest.

144cd69af328349e9630ab4905124fd9f5dd1902,Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study,"Coronaviruses are a large family, which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections, ranging from common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and SARS. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The most recently discovered coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19. As cases of COVID-19 continue to rise in different countries, health systems are facing enormous pressure to manage COVID-19 patients. By August 2, 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in about 17,660,523 million individuals worldwide and has resulted in more than 680,894 deaths. These numbers are still increasing. More than 180 countries have reported laboratoryconfirmed cases of COVID-19 on all continents, except Antarctica. [1] [2] [3] [4] In Egypt, the official number of infected patients was 94,316, with 4,834 deaths as of August 2, 2020. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Although many vaccines are in development, effective therapy is needed to treat currently infected patients and prevent mortality. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used for decades in the treatment and prophylaxis of a number of conditions including malaria. The ability of these drugs to inhibit other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, has been explored. Although generally considered safe, there are potential risks associated with taking these medications, including cardiac arrhythmia. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Although an initial study in France found encouraging results for the treatment of COVID-19 with HCQ, the study was later criticized for its methodological problems, leading to skepticism about the validity of its results. Other similar results were not represented in any further subsequent studies, but even reported deleterious clinical outcomes especially cardiac adverse events like prolongation of QT interval. 8 On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an emergency use authorization for use of oral formulations of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. 7-11 Based on emerging data showing CQ and HCQ as unlikely to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19, 12,13 the FDA revoked its previous emergency use authorization for both drugs on June 15, 2020.In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HCQ added to the standard of care versus the standard of care alone in patients with COVID-19.Patients admitted to three tertiary referral centers (n = 194) managing patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in Egypt in the period between March and June 2020 were enrolled. The patients were clinically stratified into mild, moderate, and severe disease according to the WHO interim guidelines published on March 13, 2020. Mild cases represented patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract viral infection, moderate cases represented patients with pneumonia but without need for supplemental oxygen, whereas severe disease represented cases with fever or suspected respiratory infection, plus one of the following: respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO 2 £ 93% on room air. 14 The Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted a standard of care treatment protocol for COVID-19 patients. It included paracetamol, oxygen, fluids (according to assessment), empiric antibiotic (cephalosporins), oseltamivir if needed (75 mg/ 12 hours for 5 days), and invasive mechanical ventilation with hydrocortisone for severe cases if PaO 2 < 60 mmHg, O 2 saturation < 90% despite oxygen or noninvasive ventilation, progressive hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.3), and progressive or refractory septic shock. 15 Patients were randomized into two groups using a computerized random number generator using simple randomization with an equal allocation ratio. During randomization, the proportional allocation of each clinical stratum was equalized in both groups.Study groups. 1. Hydroxychloroquine group: This group included 97 patients who received HCQ 400 mg twice daily (in day 1) followed by 200 mg tablets twice daily added to the standard of care treatment adopted by the Egyptian MOH for 15 days. 2. Control group: This group included 97 patients who received only the standard of care treatment adopted by the national MOH for 15 days.All the patients were followed up for 4 weeks.The study included all patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection and enrolled both genders. Patient who had allergy or contraindication to HCQ, pregnant and lactating females, and patients with cardiac problem (chronic heart failure or prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram [ECG]) were excluded from the study.Informed written consent was obtained from each participant, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University. Privacy of the participants and confidentiality of the data were assured. Risks and benefits were explained to the patients. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with registration number NCT04353336.All the participants were subjected to thorough history taking and full clinical examination including age, gender, weight and height measurements, and calculation of body mass index (BMI); medication history; and investigations in the form of complete blood picture, liver function tests, computed tomography of the chest (CT chest), and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs using PCR and ECG. Assessment of the studied medication side effects was performed using a questionnaire.Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences V. 23 and were expressed in number, percentage (%), mean (x̅ ) and SD. The variables were tested for normality by the Shapiro-Wilks test. Student's t-test was used for normally distributed quantitative variables and Mann Whitney's test for not normally distributed ones. Chi-square test (χ 2 ) was used to study association between qualitative variables, and whenever any of the expected cells were less than five, Fischer's exact test was used. Binary logistic regression was used to ascertain the effect of the potential risk factors on the patients' mortality. A two-sided P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Post hoc power analysis. Considering the percentage of recovery as a primary endpoint and by using G*power program, post Hoc power analysis revealed a sample power of 80.6% with the following input parameters: two-tailed α error 0.05, 54.0% recovery rate in the HCQ group, 34.0% recovery in the control group, and 97 sample size in each group. 16 At the time of presentation, interrupted fever was present in 44.6%, continuous fever in 22.3%, headache in 42.9%, sore throat in 25.7%, anorexia in 33.1%, anosmia in 26.9%, pallor in 3.4%, cyanosis in 4.6%, fatigue in 49.0%, vomiting in 13.7%, diarrhea in 35.0%, abdominal pain in 19.4%, cough in 61.3%, and dyspnea in 24.2% of the included patients. Oxygen saturation between 95 and 90 was present in 16.0%, 90-85 in 7.4%, and less than 85 in 6.9% of all the participants.The computed tomography chest scans were normal in 33.1%, ground-glass opacities in 23.4%, confluent opacities in 25.7%, consolidation in 10.9%, extensive consolidation in 6.3%, and emphysema in only 0.6%.The two groups were matched for age and gender, with no significant difference between them. They had no significant difference regarding BMI, residence, smoking, pregnant females, or the presence of comorbidities. The patients were randomized equally between the two groups regarding the disease severity (Table 1) .There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding laboratory parameters (Table 2) .Mechanical ventilation was needed in four patients (4.1%) in the HCQ group and 5 (5.2%) in the control group, with no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.75). Six patients (6.2%) died in the HCQ group, and five patients (5.2%) died in the control group without any significant difference between the two groups either (P = 0.76).Eleven patients (11.3%) in the HCQ group needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 13 patients (13.4%) in the control group needed the same (P = 0.83). The mean duration to negative PCR was 17 ± 3 days in the HCQ group and 18 ± 2 in the control group (P = 0.11). The HCQ group had a mean of 9 ± 2 days to show clinical improvement and 11 ± 3 days to hospital discharge, whereas the control group had a mean of 10 ± 3 to clinical improvement and 11 ± 2 to hospital discharge (P = 0.80 and 0.52, respectively) ( Table 3) . After 28 days, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the clinical outcome (P = 0.07). Complete recovery was achieved in 52 cases (53.6%) of the HCQ group, whereas 23 cases (23.7%) were in mild, 8 (8.2%) were in moderate, 8 (8.2%) in severe disease status, and six patients (6.1%) died. Among the control group, 33 patients (34.0%) recovered completely, 39 (40.2%) were in mild, 10 (10.3%) were in moderate, 9 (9.2%) were in severe disease status, and five patients (5.1%) died.By logistic regression, the overall mortality was not significantly associated with HCQ therapy; however, it was significantly related to the patient's age, alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, oxygen saturation, and the presence of diabetes mellitus (Table 4) .Chloroquine and HCQ are well-known drugs and have been used for decades as antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory drugs to treat malaria and rheumatological disorders. Chloroquine was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in invitro studies. This may be because of disruption of viral replication, changing immune system activity in addition to its inflammatory effect. 17 The two drugs have been tried earlier for the treatment of SARS infection and showed promising efficacy. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, they have been suggested as potential treatment for the new coronavirus 2019 based on the previous evidence from different coronavirus strains. 18 Although cardiac toxicity is a known adverse event requiring monitoring during treatment, HCQ showed promise in treating SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease. A large trial from India showed that HCQ can decrease time to recovery both in symptomatic and in asymptomatic patients with no effect on mortality. 19 At the beginning of the pandemic in Europe, a small series of COVID-19 patients treated in France with HCQ showed improved decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load compared with controls, which was augmented by the addition of azithromycin. 7 However, this study had serious methodological flaws and could not be considered as a good evidence in the favor of HCQ use. [8] [9] [10] [11] Many other conflicting trials have been published in the past few months leading initially to emergency use authorization for HCQ use in the treatment of COVID-19 and later on withdrawal of this authorization by the FDA. Initial observational trials of HCQ use in hospitalized patients showed that there were no increased risks of mortality or intubation in groups receiving HCQ or the control group who received only standard of care although patients who received HCQ were more critically ill. 20 However, many published trials had some methodological flaws and missed important patient outcomes urging the need for properly designed, adequately powered trials to support clinical decisions of HCQ use in treating COVID-19 patients. 21 Administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher probability of conversion from positive to negative PCR than standard care alone in patients admitted to hospital with nonresponsive mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in China. Adverse events were more frequent in HCQ recipients than in non-recipients. 22 A meta-analysis included seven studies with a large number of patients showing that treatment with HCQ was associated with faster improvement of fever, cough, and less radiological progression of lung lesions. However, there was no difference in the virological cure, clinical improvement, or mortality. 23 Many subsequent trials did not show benefit for HCQ use in COVID-19, with some of them suggesting more adverse events associated with its use. [22] [23] [24] A recent clinical trial by Skipper et al. 12 studied the change in symptom severity over 14 days in nonhospitalized patients between HCQ and control groups and did not find any significant difference (P = 0.12). Another trial by Cavalcanti et al. 13 compared three groups; standard care group, standard care plus HCQ, and standard care plus HCQ and azithromycin. The clinical status at 15 days assessed by a seven-level ordinal scale did not show any significant difference among the three groups. Moreover, elevated liver enzymes and prolonged QT intervals were more frequent among patients who used HCQ.In our study, adding HCQ to standard care did not add an extra benefit for the patients. Hydroxychloroquine arm was similar in all outcomes. Moreover, HCQ was not effective as postexposure prophylaxis against COVID-19 when administered within 4 days after exposure. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Limitations of the study include small sample size which was not adequately powered for survival endpoint. The number of the included patients was limited because in Egypt, tertiary care hospitals were assigned lately to deal with COVID-19 patients and had many regulations by the Egyptian MOH. The study lacks long-term follow-up which could be addressed in a prospective trial. The utility of HCQ should be evaluated in larger multicenter trials either alone or in combination with other drugs/lines of treatment. The role of HCQ as a prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection should be among the future trials also.In conclusion, our trial adds extra evidence from Egypt that HCQ may not be beneficial as a treatment for COVID-19.

43cc6ac503d32a7511e6d48995af6fdf6f1d5a79,"Knowledge, Practice and associated factors towards the Prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups: A cross-sectional study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","About half (48%, 95% CI: 46-49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58-61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48-50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19.The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanism. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority high risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve preventions practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.Coronaviruses are a large family group of viruses that cause illnesses that range from the common cold to more severe diseases found in both animals and humans (1) . A sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China (2) . The most recent novel coronavirus, currently known as COVID- 19 virus, had not been detected before and could be a new strain of coronavirus that has no antecedent known in humans (3) .Fever, dry cough, fatigue, and multiple systemic illnesses including respiratory (shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, hemoptysis, and chest pain), gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting), musculoskeletal (muscle ache), and neurologic (headache or confusion) were the symptoms reported in the first cases in China (1, 4) . The best estimate of the incubation period of the disease ranges from 1 to 14 days (3), it causes a huge burden on the healthcare system and is a global public health emergency for all countries in the world (3, 5) .According to the Worldometer (As of August 4, 2020, 7 pm), COVID-19 has spread to more than 210 countries and territories and accounted for 18 (7).The global community is struggling to slow down and eventually halt the spread of COVID-19 that has claimed thousands of lives and sickened tens of thousands through improving the knowledge and practice of COVID-19 prevention methods, testing and screening (8, 9) .Implementing personal hygiene and public health interventions especially in priority highrisk groups is necessary to curb the spread of coronavirus (12). Therefore, enhancing the community's knowledge and practice of COVID-19 symptoms & prevention methods will have a significant contribution to reduce the spread of the outbreak. A study conducted in United States of America on awareness, attitudes, and actions related to COVID-19 revealed that seven out of ten participants (71.7%) correctly identified three COVID-19 symptoms and 69.8% were able to identify three prevention methods (13) . Studies in China and the United Arab Emirates revealed that 73.8% of health workers identified fever, cough, sore throats and shortness of breath as symptoms of COVID-19 (14, 15) , while, 98% of health workers suggested washing hands with soap and water, social distance and using face masks could help in the prevention of disease transmission (14) . In line with this, 96% of Chinese residents had mentioned fever, fatigue, dry cough, and myalgia as the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 (16) . Another study in Bangladesh also indicated that 98.7% of students believed that handwashing with soap and water followed by avoiding touching your nose, mouth and eyes with unwashed hands, the use of face mask/tissue when coughing or sneezing and wearing a clean surgical mask during their respiratory illness as the prevention methods for COVID-19 (17) .Ethiopia is currently showing a high commitment to prevent and slow down the COVID-19 pandemic before it causes significant health damages and an economic crisis in the community. Case identification, contact tracing, isolation and mandatory quarantine, large scale screening in high-risk groups are the actions being taken to control the spread of the disease (11) . Controlling the spread of infection in high-risk groups must be the target in the containment strategy of COVID-19 responses. To our knowledge, no study has assessed the knowledge and practices towards the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups.Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, practices, and associated factors towards the prevention of COVID-19 among the high-risk groups of Addis Ababa community.The study was conducted in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Addis Ababa is often referred to as ""the political capital of Africa"" for its historical, diplomatic and political significance for the continent. The largest city in the country, with a total population of 4,793,699 (52% Female Vs 48% Male). The religious composition of the population showed the overwhelming majority to be Orthodox Christian (81.8%), followed by Muslim (12.7%), Protestant (3.9%) and Catholic (1%). The city is divided into 10 boroughs, called sub-cities.Addis covers 527 square kilometres of area in Ethiopia. The population density is estimated to be near 5,165 individuals per square kilometre (18) .Addis Ababa is located at 9°1′48″N 38°44′24″E. It has an elevation of 2,326 meters above sea level, at the lowest point around Bole International Airport in the southern periphery and it rises to over 3,000 metres above sea level in the Entoto Mountains to the North. The largescale assessment of the knowledge and practice in the prevention of COVID-19 was conducted from 14 to 30 April, 2020.A population assumed to be more likely within high risk groups of acquiring COVID-19 was the study population. More likely high-risk groups are classified as groups who have high exposure due to different risk factors of COVID-19 such as, exposure to public areas, travellers, recently been overseas, close contact of COVID-19 positive confirmed cases, and being in correctional and detention facilities. Health workers (including emergency services and non-clinical staff) regardless of their risk, and street children, prisons, schools, long-term living facilities, bus stations workers etc) were also classified as a high-risk.Most of the respondents were formal sector employees. These formal sector target facilities included; the bus stations, public transport drivers, airport, cargo, health facilities, public, and private pharmacies, hotels, government and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, children's villages, custody centers, geriatric centers, prison, detention centers and selected slum areas where people live in crowded housing (namely; Lideta, Atobis Tera, Kirkos).Random sampling method was applied to identify the study participants. In total, 6,007 people were included.Thirty-two teams, each of them with two members, were involved in the fieldwork. Sixtyfour health professionals (Medical Doctors, Public Health Officers, Laboratories, Nurses, Environmental health professional and Midwives) were trained for three days. The training included a classroom lecture and practical exercise on the use of the data collection tool.During the face-to-face interview, the field teams used all the necessary PPE. They also practiced all the necessary precautions such as practicing hand hygiene, to avert the risk of acquiring the infection from the study participants.The analysis was done on the data that was collected for the large-scale COVID-19 screening in Addis Ababa. The collected data includes socio-demographic information (such as age, sex, religion, and occupation), income, knowledge about the transmission and prevention methods. Personal practices towards the prevention of COVD-19 and reported symptoms were also captured.The knowledge on the transmission of COVID-19 was measured using four items. The items were; 1) during contacts (handshake and physical contact), 2) during coughing and sneezing, 3) during breathing, and 4) Eating and drinking contaminated foods. Good knowledge was classified when the scoring was ≥ 3 (75% and above) out of four items and below 3 indicated poor knowledge on the transmission methods of Covid-19.Knowledge on the prevention of COVID19 was measured using four items. The items were awareness on, 1) Physical distancing, 2) Hand washing, 3) Use of mask, and 4) Isolation and quarantine. Good knowledge of prevention was classified as when the scoring was The score of the practice was measured based on four items. These four items were, 1) practice of hand hygiene, 2) use of mask, 3) maintaining social distance and 4) staying home.To maintain the quality of the data, two days training was provided for data collectors on the aim of the study and methods of data collection. A computer-based data collection was used to control entry errors. Field level suppression was done to control the data collection and data quality.We obtained the data from EPHI. The data was collected for the routine surveillance and screening activity among more priority high risk groups of Addis Ababa people. Data were directly transferred from the field staff tablet to EPHI server whenever the field team completed each questionnaire.The items were first coded as ""1"" favouring the good outcome and ""0"" not favouring a good outcome. Then, all the items were added into one to represent the outcome. The new variable had a total score range from 0 to 4. A score of The experiences of COVID-19 related illness and communication were assessed. Among the study participants, 3% had a history of fever and an experience of respiratory illness within 14 days before the study. Of those who had an experience of respiratory illness, 51% had a cough, 34% had a runny nose, 18% had a sore throat and the rest, 11%, had shortness of breath. Free call centres and hotlines have been made publicly available to create awareness, receive information and for other COVID-19 related issues; however, only 11% of participants contacted these facilities.Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, occupation, income and having No 3015 2787 1 NB: 1=Reference category; * P-value 0.05-0.01; ** 0.01 -0.001; *** p value < 0.001Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, occupation, income, religion, and experience of respiratory illness 14 days before the study were significantly associated with knowledge on the prevention of COVID-19. At age 64 or greater, knowledge on the prevention methods of COVID-19 was 11 times higher than at ages below 18 years old.(AOR=11.46, 95%CI=5.57 -23.59). Regarding the occupation of respondents, health workers and grocery store workers were 4 and 2 times more likely, respectively, to be knowledgeable on the prevention methods, while drivers were 18%less likely to be knowledgeable about the prevention methods of COVID-19 than other occupants. Those participants who experienced respiratory illness in the past 14 days were 1.6 times (AOR=1.61, 95%CI =1.17 -2.21) more likely to be knowledgeable about the prevention methods of COVID-19 than those who did not experience respiratory illness (Table 4) . Using logistic regression analysis, the study found that occupation, religion, income, and knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were found to be associated with the practice of precautionary measures against COVID-19.As depicted in table 5, health care workers were more than two times (AOR=2.33 (95%IC: were found to be lower among higher income groups. Those who earned more than 10,000 ETB per month had 0.42 lower odds of practicing the precautionary measures against COVID-19 than those with lower income.The study found 52% and 60% overall knowledge of the respondents about transmission and prevention of COVID-19, respectively. The practice of the prevention of COVID-19 was low (49%). Regarding the factors, gender, age, occupation, income and having used the 8335 free call center were the factors associated with knowledge on the transmission of COVID-19.Age, occupation, income, religion, and experience of respiratory illness 14 days before the study were significantly associated with the knowledge on the prevention of COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, and knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures against COVID-19.This study was conducted two months after the first COVID-19 positive case was reported in the country; thus we expect the study community to have higher awareness now. However, the level of knowledge that this study identified was unexpectedly low. The Ethiopian study is compared and contrasted to some others globally. A study conducted in Iran revealed that knowledge about the mode of transmission of the disease found a similar figure of 56% (8) .In contrast, a study conducted in China revealed that the overall knowledge of COVID-19 was high at 90% (16) . Our study has found better knowledge on the prevention of COVID-19 than a study conducted in Thailand with a result of, 73.4% on the knowledge on prevention and control of COVID-19 (19) .In this study, age, occupation, and income have shown significant association with the knowledge on the transmission and prevention mechanisms of COVID-19. Gender, religion, and contacting the 8335 free call center were significantly associated with the knowledge on the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19, while participants who had a respiratory illness 14 days before the study were significantly associated with knowledge on the prevention mechanisms of COVID-19. The findings of women being more knowledgeable than men about the transmission of COVID-19 was in line with the studies conducted in China and Iran (8, 16) .Being a health professional was associated with better knowledge about COVID-19. This finding is supported by the study conducted in Iran (8) . A further similarity was found between two studies on the association between age groups and knowledge, with both studies showing better knowledge at older ages. The increase in income was inversely associated with being knowledgeable about the transmission methods of COVID-19. In addition, the study revealed that those participants who had contacted the 8335 free call center had better knowledge on the transmission methods of COVID-19, and those patients who have experience on respiratory illness 14 days before the study had better knowledge on the prevention of COVID-19.Our study was large and had a broad scope with several strengths. It was based on a large sample size and focused on participants from areas that were likely to be high risk; therefore, the findings can be generalized across the city's population. Unlike other studies, we did face-to-face interviews in this challenging situation, which is another strength. However, it has also limitations. The study did not gather important characteristics of the study participants, such as educational status, marital status and visiting public places, smoking etc that could affect knowledge on COVID19. Further, the initial assessment was done as part of the routine COVID-19 response rather than specifically for this study.The study pointed out that respondents had moderate knowledge about transmission modes, preventions mechanisms and practice on the prevention of COVID-19 areas of high risk in Addis Ababa. Awareness creation programs on more targeted groups, such as men, youth and those with higher incomes are required in order to improve the knowledge and practices on the prevention of COVID 19. Advocacy of the hand hygiene, physical distancing, use of mask and others strategies should fulfil the characteristics of the targeted individuals.Confidence IntervalCoronavirus disease 2019",Ethiopia,first author,2020-08-16,08
b308df7b06c3bdd38c91e68b1642c7da4f79d25d,"Population density, a factor in the spread of COVID-19 in Algeria: statistic study","Throughout history, humanity has encountered many epidemics that have forever transformed the social, economic, and architectural life of societies. The primary objective of these transformations is to curb the disease transmission within the population. Investigating the factors that cause this epidemic is the priority of the scientific community and epidemiologists considering the catastrophic human deaths and socio-economic effects on the population. Since November 2019, the world has been confronted to the COVID-19 epidemic commonly known as COVID-19. At the time of writing this article, COVID-19 caused 436,682 deaths and more than 8 million infected cases. The virus has spread to 213 countries according to the World Health Organization. A priori, people's proximity is the first advanced factor to explain the transmissibility of pandemic viruses. Several research studies have been questioned on the link between the density of the territories and the current epidemic and which have concluded that the relation is positive in most of the time (Bouda-Olga 2020). As well, a study of European countries and the United States of America (USA) deduced that population density has a small but substantial effect on the rate of spread of the virus. She goes on to argue that there is a significant correlation of R 2 = 0.23 in Europe and R 2 = 0.39 in the USA (Babbit et al. 2020) . Conversely, other analyses presume that the density of the population is not at issue and cannot be a determining factor in the proliferation of COVID-19. They present some cities like Singapore, Seoul, Shanghai, and New York as a counter-example because of their consequent population densities, and whose number of infections caused by COVID-19 is no different from that of cities with low urban density. Similarly, an empirical study in China on data collected for 284 Chinese cities, the results do not corroborate the idea that density is a key determinant of the risk of transmission of COVID-19. On either hand, the most afflicted cities are those with a relatively low density of between 5000 and 10,000 inhabitants per km 2 (Fang and Wahba 2020) .Between supporter and opponent, the density of the population cannot be discounted in the research of the factors of propagation of the diseases and each country must focus on this element and all the related variables. For this, we propose research on the effect of population density on the spread of COVID-19 in Algeria. The choice of this factor is not fortuitous as long as the first instruction to avoid contamination by this virus is social distancing.-We calculate the population density for each city: it is the number of individuals or inhabitants occupying an area of 1 km 2 (inhabitants/km 2 ); -To respond to the question of the study, we opted for cluster analysis and more precisely the hierarchical cluster method (Cornich 2007) in two cases:1. To group the cities according to the COVID-19 infection rate in order to provide an idea of the spread of the disease and to make comparisons between the contamination rates of the different cities of Algeria; 2. Create clusters of cities according to the rate of COVID-19 infection and population density to allow comparisons between communities with the highest and lowest rates.-We find the Pearson correlation coefficient (Schneider et al. 2010 ) and the coefficient of determination to determine the strength and the nature of the relationship between population density and the number of infected cases, through data for 48 cities, then according to geographic regions (coast, highlands, and the south); -We construct a simple linear model (Schneider et al. 2010) to illustrate the impact of population density on the number of cases of COVID-19 infection over a period from 02 March 2020 to 10 June 2020. The linear model is as follows:Y is the dependent variable that represents the number of cases of COVID-19 infection X is the independent variable that represents population density (inhabitants/km 2 ) B is the constant Then we deduce two models:Model 1: We use data from all cities to evaluate the relationship and degree of impact of population density on the spread of COVID-19 in Algeria; Model 2: In order to prove that population density is a factor in the spread of the virus in Algeria, we use data from cities that belong to the coastal region (which has 25 cities) whose population density is the highest (most of the Algerian population is concentrated on the coast).We will use the IBM SPSS Statistics 25 to apply these statistical methods analysis.Algeria is divided into 48 cities called Wilayas dispatched over an area of 2,381,741 km 2 (World population prospects 2020), constituting three major regions: coastal cities, high plateau cities, and southern cities. The population density of each region is respectively 274 inhabitants/km 2 , 70.6 inhabitants/km 2 , and 2 inhabitants/ km 2 (National Statistics Office of Algeria (ONS) 2008). In addition, the coastal region contains 25 cities, the high plateau region is composed of 14, and the Sahara region consists of 9 cities (Ministry of Interior 2016).Description of the various data included in the study:The Until researching the relationship between population density and the spread of COVID-19 in Algeria, we propose to give an idea of the classification of cities by number of cases infected with the virus.The use of the classification method in data analysis has allowed us to classify cities according to the degree of cases infected with the virus in the study period. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 1 . Figure 1 shows that the study population of 48 cities was divided into four groups, namely:-The first group: contains the 36 cities with an average of 105 infected cases; -The second group: includes 8 cities (Constantine, Tipaza, Aindefla, Bejaia, Ouaragla, Telemcen, Bordj-Bouariridj, Medea), with an average of 332 infected cases; -The third group: comprises the cities of Setif and Oran, with an average of 679 infected cases;-The fourth group: includes the cities of Algiers and Blida, with an average of 1227 infected cases.The cluster method enabled us to classify cities by cases of COVID-19 and population density for the study period. The results are illustrated in Fig. 2 . Figure 2 shows that the study population of 48 cities was divided into four groups, namely:-First group: contains the 44 cities with an average population density estimated at 127.64 inhabitants/ km 2 and an average number of COVID-19 cases estimated at 146 cases; -The fourth group: includes one city of Alger with an estimated population density of 2511.05 (inhabitants/km2) and 1166 cases of COVID-19.The cluster method has allowed us to isolate the city groups characterized by a high population density number of COVID-19 cases and those with lower population density and cases of COVID-19. So, can we say there is a relation between population density and COVID-19 spread?Indeed, we note from Table 1 the existence of a strong relation between the two variables estimated at 0.711. The population density explains the spread of COVID-19 in Algeria at a rate of 50.50%. The rest of the contamination is explained by other factors: sanitary, social, and economic. It is also noted that this relation differs from one region to another. It is significantly strong in the coastal region (R 2 = 0.531), marginally less strong in the high plateau region (R 2 = 0.232), and relatively low in the southern region (R 2 = 0.041).In order to explain the degree of influence of population density on the spread of COVID-19 in Algeria, two clouds of points were created. The first concerns population density and cases of COVID-19 for all Algerian cities (Fig. 3) . The second refers exclusively to coastal cities (Fig. 4) . Through Fig. 3 , we note that is a significant effect at the significance level of 5% of the population density on the increase in infections with COVID-19 because each time the population density increases by 1 individual/ km2, there is an increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 estimated at 0.48 for all Algerian cities (48 cities).We note also through Fig. 4 that is a significant effect at the significance level of 5% of the population density on the increase in infections with COVID-19 because each time the population density increases by 1 individual/km2, there is an increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 estimated at 0.48 for coastal cities.We note from the taxonomic analysis ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) that the big Algerian cities (Algiers, Blida, Oran, and Setif) with a high population density are the most affected by the COVID-19 epidemic compared to the less populated cities. Also, the correlation coefficient indicates the existence of a strong correlation between population density and the number of cases of COVID-19 in the coastal region, compared with that of the highlands which is less important.As for the southern region, the relationship between population density and COVID-19 spread is much lesser. We found that population density has a positive effect on increasing the number of cases of COVID-19 virus. As population density increases, the number of infections increases, especially in coastal regions (Figs. 3 and 4) .We deduce from this study that we carried out on the spread of the Covid-19 virus in Algeria over the period 02 March 2020 to 10 June 2020 that the higher the population density, the closer there is people in public places, which will increase the spread of the current virus.Therefore, we recommend through this study to take into account the population density factor and to provide all necessary measures to protect against the spread of the virus in Algeria and highlight the cities that have a high population density. Also, increase awareness of social distance within the population realizing adequately that it is a very difficult task in our society; it is accustomed to the proximity inherited by ancestral traditions.Abbreviations R: Correlation coefficient; R 2 : Coefficient of determination",Algeria,abstract,2020-08-20,08
0b7f2ac5328472f90b97ff37a38793c3c0d504b9,Seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State,"1 and inferential statistical analyses of the data generated. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State was found to be 25.41% and 2.16% for the positive IgG and IgM respectively.Seroprevalence among age groups, gender and by occupation varied widely. A seroprevalence of 37.21% was recorded among health care workers in Niger State. Among age groups, COVID-19 seroprevalence was found to be in order of 30-41 years (33.33%) > 42-53 years (32.42%) > 54-65 years (30%) > 66 years and above (25%) > 6-17 years (19.20%) > 18-29 years (17.65%) > 5 years and below (6.66%). A seroprevalence of 27.18% was recorded for males and 23.17% for females in the state. COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state was found to be 46.81%. The risk analyses showed that the chances of infection are almost the same for both urban and rural dwellers in the state. However, health care workers and those that have had contact with person (s) that travelled out of Nigeria in the last six (6) months are twice ( 2 times) at risk of being infected with the virus. More than half (54.59%) of the participants in this study did not practice social distancing at any time since the pandemic started. Discussions about knowledge, practice and attitude of the participants are included. The observed Niger State COVID-19 seroprevalence means that the herd immunity for COVID-19 is yet to be achieved and the population is still susceptible for more infection and transmission of the virus.If the prevalence stays as reported here, the population will definitely need COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. Niger State should fully enforce the use of face/nose masks and observation of social/physical distancing in gatherings including religious gatherings in order to stop or slow the spread of the virus. Pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2 that is believed to have crossed from bats to humans for the first time (Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 is an infectious disease of respiratory system of humans and animals and the virus can be transmitted through facial openings which include mouth, nostrils and maybe eyes (Lai et al., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) .Coronavirus Disease 2019 , like most of infectious diseases, the isolation of the aetiologic agent-SARS CoV-2 through tissue/cell plate culture technique would have been the gold standard method for the diagnostic test. However, plate culturing is usually laborious, time consuming, complex and costly and therefore impossible to use especially for epidemiological studies where large samples may be involved. Also, even though Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) have been predominantly used to test for the agent of COVID-19 world over including Nigeria (WHO, 2020a; 2020b) , it is laborious, time consuming, costly and complex.Infection by many pathogens including viruses do elicit production of antibodies in humans and animals even if no symptoms manifested. The detection of the antibodies in the whole blood/serum/plasma of humans and animals have been used as preliminary diagnoses of infectious diseases (WHO, 2020a (WHO, , 2020b 2020c; Xiao et al., 2020) . Also because of the relative ease of use and simplicity of the antigen-antibodies test kits compared to cell/tissue culture and PCR, they are mostly used in the epidemiological studies to determine infectious diseases prevalence, patterns, dynamics, and risk factors (WHO, 2020a (WHO, , 2020b Xiao et al., 2020) .Antigen-Antibody based kits unlike other methods can detect previous exposure to the infectious agents (WHO, 2020a; 2020b; 2020c; Xiao et al., 2020 )-this information is very important especially in COVID-19 with assumed high rate of asymptomatic cases in order to see how far the virus has spread and infection patterns, effectiveness of social distancing measures enforced and determination of herd immunity to the disease to know the extent of vaccination to do when COVID-19 vaccines become available. This study was aimed at determining the COVID-19 prevalence, patterns and dynamics and risk factors for contracting the disease in Niger State.Sterile lancets, cotton wool, face masks, hand gloves, methylated spirit, dustbin, dustbin bags, material transportation bags were all locally purchased. Also, three (3) laptops with EPIINFO 7.2.2.6 software installed were used: one laptop for each of the three (3) geopolitical zones of Niger State, Nigeria.Ethical approval (STA/495/Vol/152) for this study was given by the Research Ethics Committee of the Niger Sate Ministry of Health. Consents were also sought from each of the participants prior to tests and questionnaire administration, and only those individuals that have given full consent were used in the study. Parents/Guardians were responsible for the consents of their wards that participated in the study and were under 18 of age.The study area was Niger State and its residents were the study population ( Figure 1 ). Niger State ( Figure 1 ) is one of the federating geopolitical states in Nigeria. It has Minna as its capital.The COVID-19 IgG and IgM Rapid Test Kits were validated with the blood samples of those individuals that were confirmed by the NCDC through PCR as positive and or negative for COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Tests were carried out using the whole blood of the participants.It is qualitative membrane-based immunoassay for the detection of COVID 19 antibodies in whole blood. The tests were carried out and interpreted according to the kits manufacturer's instruction. The test result of each participant was recorded and entered into the EPIINFO questionnaire administered for that particular participant.A cross sectional study design and clustered-stratified-random sampling method were used to choose 185 participants across Niger State for this study that was aimed at determining the COVID-19 seroprevalence, patterns, dynamics, and risk factors in the state. Although the sample size is small, the sampling strategy employed made it a true representative of the state.COVID-19 Pandemic is ongoing and at the moment, no available vaccines for the disease. For now, the reliable ways of preventing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19 Pandemic) among human populations are social/physical distancing measures and good sanitation and hygiene practices. Adherence to these COVID-19 preventive measures should be impacted by the knowledge and beliefs of people about the disease since the measures involve some behavioural changes and practice. People can only believe what they know (aware of) and can practice when they believe.In order to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of the participants with regards to COVID-19 in Niger State, the participants were asked whether they know and believed that the disease is in the state. They were also asked about their adherence to the social distancing and face and hand hygiene. Overwhelming majority of the participants (81.62%) were aware and know about COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 3 A) . However, only 58.92% of the participants believed that the disease is in Niger State while 41.08% did not believe (Figure 3 B) . More than half (54.59%) of the participants in this study did not practice social distancing (Figure 3 C) at any time since the pandemic started even as the lockdown was once enforced in the state.Majority (61.62) of the participants practiced hand and face hygiene (Figure 3 D) .The second reason is the prevalence of disbeliefs, myths and conspiracy theories. Many people did not believe in the existence of COVID-19 (Figure 3 B) and especially about the highly contagious nature of the disease. This may be the chief reason why many people did not care to observe social/physical distancing (Figure 3 C) even when not enforced on them at the ATMs, markets, religious gatherings, motor parks, shops, supermarkets etc. Also, myths and conspiracy theories such as COVID-19 does not affect black people, that high environmental temperature and weather will kill off the virus, or that COVID-19 is for rich people and elites are some of the reasons why people are slow in accepting the enormity of the pandemic and therefore usually takes observance of social and physical distancing lightly (Majiya, 2020) .Thirdly, no efficient and robust housing and biometric data management systems where everyone is accounted for, especially for the purposes of employment, health, security and social welfare. If these are available, foods and other goods purchased online can be sent to houses with ease. In addition, utilities such as power, water, internet etc, are in most cases not provided or grossly inadequately supplied. It is difficult for people to stay back at home and observe social/physical distancing in such situations (Majiya, 2020) .The first confirmed case (index case) of COVID-19 in Nigeria was announced on 27 th February 2020 when a foreigner in Lagos tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Soon after that, many people including the contacts of the index case and those that came back into the country and their contacts tested positive for the virus. Although overseas travel prior to the border closures and lockdowns in Nigeria has been associated with the increased chance/risk of contracting COVID-19, this might have changed overtime to more of community transmission of the virus.system) were used to determine the presence or absence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of sampled participants across the Niger State as from 26 th June 2020 to 30 th June 2020.In order to determine the risk factors of COVID-19 and also the effectiveness of COVID-19 preventive measures enforced in the state, 2x2 table statistics was used to calculate odd and risk ratios for many scenarios (Table 1) . When gender of the participants and Positive COVID-19 IgG results were cross tabulated, the risk ratio recorded for female participants was 0.8524 (Table 1 ). This means that being a female is a protective factor against the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in Niger State. This also correlated with the COVID-19 Seroprevalence recorded among males and females participants (Figure 6 B) . The less risk of infection by the females in this study maybe due to the physical attributes such as the less mobility and activity of the females compared to that of males in our society.Although Niger State is out of the enforced lockdown, the COVID-19 cases keep increasing because the population is still susceptible for more infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This study shows that the virus is already here, and we must find ways of living with it such that it caused no or minimal human and socioeconomic losses in Niger State and Nigeria as a whole. Since this study recorded high COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state as well as observed mild symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in the communities, isolation and quarantine centers with no fatality, going back to the lockdown should never again be entertained.However, the state should fully enforce the use of face/nose masks and observation of social/physical distancing in gatherings including socioeconomic and religious gatherings in order to stop or slow the spread of the virus. PPEs should be made adequately available for all the health care workers in the state. If the prevalence stays as reported in this study, the population will need COVID-19 vaccines when they become available.",Nigeria,abstract,2020-08-05,08
12c0f2d7550487d22ef897f3f29851cc44482ee1,Archaeology of Two Pandemics and Teranga Aesthetic,"Résumé La pandémie du covid-19 a révélé à quel point la colonialité et le racisme sont endémiques dans la société moderne. Au début de la pandémie, cela s'est reflété dans de nombreux discours occidentaux sur l'Afrique, notamment en France, lesquels ont dévoilé de vieux antagonismes coloniaux, des projections, des stigmatisations et du paternalisme. L'articulation de tels discours, même chez des personnes bien informées et parfois bien intentionnées, appelle à une introspection et à une réflectivité plus profondes sur les pratiques archéologiques et les modalités de l'engagement communautaire. S'appuyant sur les multiples contributions de l'archéologie pour la connaissance du passé de l'Afrique et sur les pratiques de résilience observées au Sénégal par les individus ordinaires face à la propaga-Our contemporary moment is plagued by two major pandemics: COVID-19 on the one hand and racism and coloniality on the other. In this reflection on the present moment, I seek to exhume the way in which certain discourses on COVID-19 attest to the interconnections between these two pandemics in the Senegalese context. First, I start the essay with the western discourses on the novel coronavirus pandemic in Africa. The strong colonial and racist foundations of those discourses call for an equally robust deconstruction but also for archaeological interventions to reassert Africa's pivotal role in all historical processes of human development. Then, I comment on how the performative responses of the Senegalese state to the COVID-19 pandemic were framed by the French colonial legacies.Second, I reflect briefly on the kinds of reflexivity that archaeologists should develop when dealing with crises such as COVID-19 in the communities where they work. Finally, in the third part, I share the resilience strategies mobilized by Senegalese society against COVID-19. These strategies are structured by the principles of teranga aesthetic's sociability, and they yield critical insights on how to perceive and understand disasters in archaeological contexts.The announcement of the first person tested and declared positive for COVID-19 on Senegalese soil occurred on March 2, 2020. Ironically, that ""Patient 0,"" as to follow the nomenclature of Senegalese Health and Social Action Ministry, was a Frenchman who had just returned from a visit to France. That appearance of coronavirus disease in Senegal sparked fear that reignited colonial trauma in the popular imagination. On March 4, the Senegalese daily L'Évidence titled its front page ""France is coronizing Senegal"" with the subtitle that posed this question: ""Slave trade, economic colonization, epidemiological colonization?"" (Maillard 2020) .On March 23, Senegalese President, Macky Sall, announced two types of measures, the ""barrack measures"" (prohibitions, restrictions, repressions) on the one hand and the ""belly measures"" (distribution of rice, oil, sugar, and soap) on the other (Sall 2020) . To parody Foucault (1975) , these ""nourish and punish"" measures suggestively recalled the ""stick and carrot"" policy of the French colonial government. Between the appearance of ""Patient 0"" and the presidential address, the government took a series of measures, including the closure of schools, universities, and places of worship. During those two weeks, however, there were very few new COVID-19 cases and zero deaths. Yet, both the martial rhetoric, ""we are at war,"" and the public staging involved, curiously recalled French President Emmanuel Macron's speeches on COVID-19.The Eurocentric and mimetic nature of these measures gave rise to sharp public criticism. The criticism intensified when public opinion decried the exclusivity granted to Institut Pasteur, a private French biomedical research facility in Dakar, during the first fortnight of the pandemic to carry out virological tests at the expense of university laboratories and private practices owned by Senegalese nationals. Although Institut Pasteur's monopoly was later broken, thanks to public opinion's pressure and perhaps due to a growing number of cases, the debate on neocolonialism picked up more strongly a few days later. Particularly at stake in these debates was the issue of the sovereignty of the Senegalese postcolonial state whose management of the pandemic and practices of authority appeared to be carbon copies of those of the former European imperial power, France.On April 1, French medical doctors, Jean Paul Mira, head of the intensive care unit at the Cochin Hospital in Paris, and Camille Locht, research director at the Inserm (Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale ([National Institute for Health and Medical Research]), recommended on a French television channel (LCI) that a Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine against the coronavirus be tested on Africans. In the controversial exchange, Mira told Locht: ""If I can be provocative, shouldn't this study be done in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatment, no intensive care, a bit like it is done elsewhere on certain studies like AIDS, or on prostitutes: we try things because we know they are highly exposed. What do you think?"" And Locht replied: ""You are right, by the way. We are thinking in parallel to a study in Africa with the same type of approach, that does not prevent us from thinking in parallel to a study in Europe and Australia"" (France 24 2020a, b). The racial contempt for Africans and questionable comparisons that proposed the use of Africans as guinea pigs in medical research during that television exchange brought back painful memories of colonial medical practice and gave rise to incredible but justified anger both in the social and in traditional media.A few days before the Mira-Locht exchange, there had been an ecstatic reaction to the March 27 prediction of Antonio Guterres, the United Nations General Secretary, on France 24 television channel and Radio France International (RFI), that ""even if the population [in Africa] is younger than in developed countries, there will be necessarily millions of deaths"" on the continent due to the COVID-19 pandemic (France 24 2020a, b). Likewise, a memorandum from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated March 24, and titled ""The Pangolin Effect: The Storm Heading to Africa"" also forecasted a COVID-19 apocalypse in the continent (Mantelin 2020) . It predicted that the national health systems of African states will be declared ""automatically saturated"" and that African countries will not be able to protect their populations. So far, as I write this essay four months later, these predictions have not come to fruition.These representations and imaginations of Africa by ""highly educated"" French medical doctors, Euro-American scientists, and political experts, and by a top United Nations diplomat, did not take place in a vacuum. Rather, they are reflective of the dominant public opinion about Africa in the West, informed by colonial fantasy and fetishization. In these imaginations and representations of Africa, it is striking that the continent is still conflated with images of a land peopled by lesser human beings without problem-solving capacity. In this Eurocentric pathology, African bodies are only good for laboratory testing and experiments to satisfy western curiosity and anxieties about the pandemic. We should worry about these enduring colonial legacies that continue to undermine the significance of decades of archaeological efforts that conclusively assert Africa's strong contributions to all processes of human development, including the emergence of complex sociopolitical formations, food production, technological innovations, urban development, and much more.To me, the relevant questions for the present moment are: What can we learn from Africa's resilience and long history of coping with pandemics? How can we harness Africa's deep time experiences in handling human disasters and make it usable in the governance of COVID-19? These questions are contrary to the paternalist and alarmist calls that inundated the media and projected the colonial mindset of the aforementioned interlocutors about Africa. The fact that similar perspectives were aired on the Society of Africanist Archaeologists Listserv by well-meaning colleagues raised even more troubling questions. How do our political subjectivities shape our positionality? Is archaeological knowledge about Africa sufficiently accessible to diverse and global audiences, or is it still largely produced and consumed within the inner circle of professional archaeologists who brag about their finds and only thrive for career promotion? What kind of alternative archaeological practices, engagements, and interventions can these debates on COVID-19 pandemic inspire?What can archaeologists bring to the ongoing debates on COVID-19 pandemic, especially when it hits the communities we work with and to whom we have a strong attachment? I contend that the role of archaeologists in such contexts would be to deal with their own political subjectivities honestly. This would require selfreflection on the discourses and practices rooted in racism and coloniality and engage with communities not as experts but rather as students, listeners, and activists ready to lend our voices to fight paternalism and unsubstantiated projections on Africa. The assumption that a global pandemic must be worse in Africa relative to the global north implies the thought, even by wellmeaning people, that the continent has neither past nor present problem-solving capacity and initiative. This colonial mindset relegates Africans to a state of animality and denies them their humanity, a contradiction of the teachings of African archaeology in the past few decades. One would be saved from this erroneous thought by paying attention to the archives of the past, including the archaeological record, and to the resilient strategies of the moment which are rooted in the needs and demands of African communities, our ""ethical clients"" (Blakey and Rankin-Hill 2009) . Tapping into material, documentary, and memory archives can enrich our understanding of the present and the self-awareness of the communities with whom we work. This must, however, be done with a sense of care, responsibility, and caution because there is a lot of pain embedded in those archives.The catastrophic narratives in the initial western discourses as they relate to the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa had parallels in the wretched attitudes and the mimicry of some African leaders' rhetorical and performative responses to the crisis. However, on the ground in many parts of Africa, and Senegal in particular, the strategies leveraged by the general populations have been different from the racialized attitudes of the Global North. The management of the pandemic by the larger Senegalese society revealed a resilience inspired by deep-time lived experiences and memories.Although local populations generally followed the directives of the health authorities, they vehemently resorted to their culture, heritage, and religion to cope with the pandemic. They manufactured their own masks, especially when the western supply chains were broken; resorted to traditional therapy en masse; and gathered together to say prayers in ways that were inspired by the ancestral practices of coping, especially when the social body was threatened by illness and other crises. They resuscitated mythical figures, particularly in areas where the national police was not available to enforce restrictions on social gatherings. Different communities also observed various forms of teranga aesthetic, a Senegalese social value of ""good hospitality"" and sociability. In its mundane expression, teranga aesthetic prescribes treating guests with open arms (Riley 2016) . In deeper meaning, it acts as a catharsis for vivre ensemble or living together by creating a space where solidarity and mutual aid, exchanges and donations, gender bonding, communal sovereignty, political and religious alliances, sharing and circulation of information, and much more are deployed. It structures the social, cultural, and linguistic landscape with its vocabularies, gestures, and habitus and reinforces social solidarity in the face of crisis and uncertainty. Teranga aesthetic offers us possibilities for reading archaeological contexts that may relate to social stress and disasters, including pandemics. Such contexts may have unique signatures of artifact assemblages, settlement patterns, material circulations, and cultural interactions.Over the past few decades, archaeologists of the Senegambia have been struggling to explain the rapid development of numerous short-term archaeological sites spanning 20-50 years on average, particularly after 1500 (Canos-Donay 2016; Gueye 1998; Richard 2019; Thiaw 2012 Thiaw , 1999 Thilmans and Ravisé 1980) . This pattern of nucleated small-scale, short-term settlements often 100-300 m distant from one another has been identified with the growing insecurity during the Atlantic slave trade. However, recent experience is suggestive that this settlement pattern may be related to human disasters, including epidemics (Altschul et al. 2016; Thiaw et al. 2018) . A case in point is the bubonic plague that hit Dakar from April 1914 to January 1915, killing 3653 people out of a population of 26,000 inhabitants in less than a year. The French colonial government took a series of harsh decisions including the displacement and confinement of African populations in new neighborhoods, the imposition of new architectural standards with bricks and stones, the burning of huts and quarantine camps, issuance of movement passes for Africans, and the establishment of sanitary cordons, among many other measures (Bigon 2012) . In reaction to these, many Africans moved to the outskirt of Dakar, where they were welcomed with open hands by other Africans in accordance with the principle of teranga. According to narratives collected in the area, when the plague ultimately hit the multi-secular settlement of Dialaw in the outskirt of Dakar, the local African populations split and reorganized themselves into small-scale settlements 100-500 m distant from one another as a social distancing measure (Thiaw et al. 2018) . Subsequent resettlement shows a movement toward the Atlantic coast, but populations maintained affective and symbolic relations with one another as well as with the earlier site of Dialaw. There still stands a baobab tree in Dialaw where all newborns, descendants of the mythical Thialaw Sene, the founder of the town, must come for life protection against all sorts of harms. Sites recorded in the area show great homogeneity in the material assemblages despite ethnic diversity. Likewise, the material assemblages associated with post-1500 short-term settlements across northern Senegambia display the same kind of homogeneity. Although diseases and epidemics might not be the sole causes of site abandonment, settlement dynamics conform to the principles of a teranga aesthetic in that it instructs people to maintain social bonds and mutual assistance at times of disaster and uncertainty. The community-building approach of teranga and its practices of resilience constitute the building blocks of Senegalese culture. It is a heritage that Senegal (and indeed many other parts of Africa) can share with the rest of the world in crisis management.Racism and racialization have their deep roots in the European imagination, especially beginning with the eighteenth-century Enlightenment (Curran 2011; Quijano 2007) . It was built upon the negation of the humanity of non-European others. The dehumanization of black bodies in the context of the Atlantic slave trade and colonization went hand in hand with the European exploitation of Africa's human and natural resources. To attain and maintain this exploited relationship with Africa, Europe deployed complex strategies that were based on Eurocentric knowledge production. The results have been ecological and natural disasters with major political and socioeconomic consequences. These disasters are the precursors of the Anthropocene curse today (e.g., pollution, global warming, plundering of resources, overconsumption, environmental degradation, etc.). The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of coloniality and challenged its hegemonic pretensions (see also Chakrabarty 2000) , but it also calls attention to teranga aesthetic as a decolonial praxis (Rivera-Santana 2019). This is one area where we can start our search for decolonial epistemology in African archaeology and about crisis management in general.",Senegal,abstract,2020-08-25,08
4163f44f2fac445d22da44cab89ab91f72a3894d,The neglected role of Faith-based Organizations in prevention and control of COVID-19 in Africa,"Since the first reported outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 in China, the disease has quickly spread across the globe and has reached Africa where cases and deaths have increased by 29% (19 255 new cases) and 21% (493 new deaths), respectively, during the week between May 5 and 12, 2020. 1 There is serious widespread concern about the lives and economic toll that COVID-19 could claim across Africa if the epidemic progresses with the same rate of devastation seen in the economically wealthier parts of the world. Although several demographic or immune-related factors seem to play a role in mitigating the severity of cases in many African countries, 2 there is serious concern about underestimation due to insufficient testing. Especially in the sub-Saharan countries, COVID-19 may have devastating effects as the response required is challenged by inherent fragilities in the national health systems, high population density in metropolitan slums, a lack of services in rural settings, generally poor sanitation, food insecurity and undernutrition, as well as the high burden of comorbidities such as HIV infection and tuberculosis.In Africa, faith-based organizations (FBOs)-the values of which are based on religious and faith beliefs-which manage a vast number of health facilities in many low-income countries (for instance, approximately 40% of total health services and more than 1000 hospitals are managed by Catholic FBOs in Africa), 3-6 play an essential role in providing healthcare and prevention services, community education, and financing. FBOs are also undoubtedly crucial in promoting public awareness and addressing social and behavioral factors associated with COVID-19 spread. However, due to their importance for local communities, FBOs could become rapidly overwhelmed if the pandemic accelerates.We report here the status of preparedness to face COVID-19 and the assessment of needs of two health facilities run by us, the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus: Cabrini St Philip's Clinic in the rural Lubombo Region of eSwatini and St. Mary's Catholic Primary Hospital in the semi-rural area of Dubbo in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region of Ethiopia (as displayed in Table 1 ). In both missions, we have developed strategies to identify suspected COVID-19 cases and to isolate them in dedicated areas of the facility. In both, we have implemented a systematic triage at patients' point of entry and appropriate infection control measures. However, the existing shortage in supply 7 may hinder the performance and sustainability of the response in the short term period, especially if the influx of patients intensifies. Our hospital in Ethiopia, staffed by a low number of healthcare workers (HCWs) for the population served (25.5 HCWs and 1.3 medical doctors per 100 000 people, respectively), has at the moment very insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for both HWCs and patients, thus increasing the chance of nosocomial outbreaks. Our rural out-patient clinic in eSwatini, which has a higher ratio of HCWs (72/100 000 people) but no medical doctor, has PPE estimated to last for about a month in the best-case scenario, which is however rapidly changing due to intensification of patient influx in recent days. Key missing components in the preparedness of our two centers, besides PPE supply, are nasal swabs for molecular diagnostic tests and effective therapeutic options (e.g. oxygen support devices, anti-inflammatory and antiviral medicines commonly used in high-income settings, as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics). 8 Existing in-house basic laboratories cannot perform nucleic acid amplification tests on nasal swabs-both because these are technically challenging and are lacking in reagents 9 . Also, in normal circumstances, up to a week is required to obtain results from the referral laboratory, whose activities can be rapidly overwhelmed if cases increase, thus delaying diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.All these elements, together with the low availability of beds in the two health facilities-a limited number of beds in Dubbo, and none in the out-patient clinic in eSwatini-and the small number of well-equipped tertiary facilities nearby, suggest that effectively addressing COVID-19 in these settings is a challenge.In the African continent, preparedness for a pandemic like COVID-19 is a challenge given the need for rapid adaptation of already constrained health systems, scarcity of laboratories and reagents to test, limited training capacity, and poverty of resources in care provision and in general. 10 Yet, the simple Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene administrative structure of FBOs, with decision-making capacity at the grassroots level, makes them flexible and agile to rapidly adapt and respond to a health emergency, as long as fundamental tools are made available. However, due to the general shortage in PPE, diagnostic kits, and effective therapeutic options in countries like Ethiopia and eSwatini, most funds and key supply and equipment may be directed to governmental facilities rather than engaging the numerous FBOs and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing care. In addition, many African governments will not be able to confront this pandemic alone and international support is urgently needed. 11 This support, however, needs to be directed not solely to governmental facilities but also to the highly committed NGOs and FBOs that, operating at the grassroots level, are best placed to provide health services to people living in impoverished conditions, especially in rural settings. FBO and NGO facilities are often the only entry point for rural and semi-rural populations. They need to be engaged, urgently supported, and properly equipped to safely contribute to handle the pandemic and simultaneously manage the regular burden of the endemic diseases ravaging the continent.",Ethiopia,abstract,2020-08-27,08
739b3ab9c1cb02ce9f785d2f0fc8ff3d6df54ae1,Commentary COVID-19 pandemic and the widening gap to access cancer services in Uganda COVID-19 pandemic and the widening gap to access cancer services in Uganda,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its public health control measures have led to worldwide interruptions in healthcare service delivery, and cancer services are no exception. These interruptions have exacerbated the effects of previously reported barriers to accessing cancer care which was reportedly low even before the pandemic. If these effects are not mitigated, the achievements in cancer control that had already been made could be watered down. Measuring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on delivery of and access to cancer services in Uganda as well as other countries worldwide can inform the design of current and future responses to epidemics while putting into context other diseases like cancer that have a high burden.Worldwide, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (SARS-CoV-2) cases have increased rapidly since the first case was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [1] . As of 16 July 2020, there were 13,378,853 cases, reported from all continents along with 580,045 deaths [2] . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Uganda reported its first case of COVID-19 on 21 March 2019, and as of 16 July 2020, 1,043 cases of COVID-19, with 1,014 recoveries and zero COVID-19-associated deaths have been reported [2] . The COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide interruptions in healthcare service delivery, and cancer services are no exception. The Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) is an autonomous body, with the mandate by the Uganda Cancer Institute Act of 2016 to, among others, undertake and coordinate the prevention and treatment of cancer and cancer-related diseases in Uganda. UCI also serves as a Center of Excellence for Oncology in East Africa, and it is the only facility that can provide comprehensive cancer services in Uganda [3] . Estimates of the burden of cancer in Uganda and the impact of cancer control strategies have previously been measured by cancer registries in Uganda like the Kampala Cancer Registry. This is a population-based cancer registry that serves the population of Kyadondo County comprised of Wakiso district and Kampala, the capital of Uganda.The cancer burden is rising in Uganda; according to the 2018 GLOBOCAN estimates, over 32,617 new cases and 21,829 death related to cancer were estimated to have been registered in Uganda in 2018. The most common cancers among women are cervical cancer and breast cancer, with incidences of 50.2 and 31.2 per 100,000 of the population, respectively. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with an incidence of 58 per 100,000 of the population. Kaposi Sarcoma, lung cancer, and liver cancer also contribute to the burden of cancer in this population [4] . Among children under 18, the most common cancers reported are Burkitt´s lymphoma, Kaposi Sarcoma, non-Burkitt´s lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Wilms tumor [5] . The individual and healthcare burden posed by these cancers can be reduced through cancer preventive services, including early diagnosis through routine screening, adherence to treatment, and public health campaigns like those that promote engaging in physical activity and eating a healthy diet. These essential functions to reduce the burden of cancer in Uganda, and the East Africa region, are being affected by the current COVID-19 lockdown measures, restrictions on travel, and suspension of outreach and screening services [6, 7] .The COVID-19 lockdown measures implemented in Uganda are based on WHO-issued guidance and include the use of restrictive physical distancing to limit the spread of the virus. In this paper, we focus on restrictions of public and private transport, restriction on income-generating activities, observance of person-to-person physical distancing of 2-4 meters, and observance of a daily curfew because they could influence the delivery of and access to cancer care services [7] . To adhere to the social distancing measures, healthcare institutions suspended cancer screening and outreach programs and revised patient appointment schedules to maintain physical distance by limiting the number of patients that can move into the facility [6] . Other measures that indirectly affect cancer care delivery include task-shifting of health workers who previously delivered cancer care to be frontline health workers in health care facilities designated to handle COVID-19. These affect the delivery and access to cancer care services and exacerbate the barriers in access to care. These barriers include clinically significant delays, such as delay to seeking appropriate care, delay to reach an appropriate facility, and delay to receive adequate care at the facility.Cancer care services are already underutilized even before the COVID-19 pandemic as seen in the literature and this has been attributed to various barriers. The underutilization and delay to seek for cancer care services have been attributed to barriers to access of cancer care services (screening, diagnosis, and treatment) such as a limited number health facilities offering cancer care services, long distances to healthcare facilities, transport costs, treatment costs and a limited number of cancer care providers. These barriers affect the utilization of cancer care services with the degree of utilization varying by cancer type. For example, a study done in two districts in Eastern Uganda in 2016 found that only 4.8% of women had ever screened for cervical cancer [8] . Screening allows for early detection of cancer and leads to better treatment outcomes and survival. At diagnosis, delays in attending the first oncology appointment, first treatment, and subsequent treatment schedules have been also reported. For example, a study conducted in Uganda in 2019 found that it takes a median of 84 days from the first presentation to consultation with a specialist, and a median of 34 days from specialist consultation to treatment initiation [9] . Delays in seeking care, attending first oncologist appointment, and in initiating cancer treatment have been found to have a negative impact on the treatment outcomes of cancer patients. These include a late-stage presentation at first diagnosis and progression of cancer to advanced stages. These cases of late presentation and advanced disease have been reported previously. In Kyadondo County, Uganda, about 89% of breast cancer patients present with stage III/IV disease, about 80% of cervical cancer patients present with stage III/IV disease [10] .Cancer care service delivery has been disrupted during the pandemic and effects are likely to vary per country. In Uganda, the suspension of the screening services and outreach programs has disrupted the efforts from sensitization campaigns on screening to treatment services, and it poses a big threat to the early detection of cancer cases. Therefore, we anticipate an increase in the proportion of patients who present with advanced stages of cancer in the period after lifting the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures that restrict access to cancer care services. The difference in days between oncologist appointments and treatment schedules requires that patients move between their homes and the cancer care centers. Considering the current lockdown measures, like limitations in public transport, the barrier to transportation to cancer care facilities has been exacerbated. The cost of public transport has almost doubled for most of the routes plied by public transport companies, in a bid to cover the cost of the reduced carrying capacity of their vehicles. This increases the financial burden of seeking care for cancer patients. The restrictions on economic activities have rendered the proportion of the people impoverished, and they are unable to meet the costs involved in seeking care. These dynamics on utilization and access to care can lead to an observation of a decrease in the numbers of detected cases of cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic period and an increase in cases detected during the period when lockdown measures affectting access to cancer services are fully lifted. Also, there can be variation in the proportion of individuals who present with advanced-stage cancer during pre, during, and post-COVID-19 pandemic era. Furthermore, there can be an increase in loss to follow up of patients after a diagnosis of cancer, poor adherence to treatment schedules, delays in access to cancer care after a diagnosis (first oncology appointment, initiation of treatment modalities), and increased mortality and reduced survival rates of patients. To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic measures in Uganda have impacted on the utilization and access to cancer care services, data collected by cancer registries can be used to quantify the effect.Population-based cancer registries like the Kampala Cancer Registry are vital public health tools that can inform strategies for cancer control in a population and can be utilized to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care delivery and access in a population. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer registry data been providing information on cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, and cancer survival and mortality for a given population that they serve.COVID-19 control measures are going to affect the delivery of and reduce access to cancer care services in Uganda. These measures can exacerbate the effects of previously reported barriers to delivery of and access to cancer care services such as the limited number of health facilities offering cancer care services, long distances to healthcare facilities, transport costs, treatment costs, and a limited number of cancer care service providers. These can widen the gap to access cancer care services in Uganda. Also, there can be a reduction in the number of new cancer cases registered in the population-based cancer registries. There is a need to synthesize data collected by cancer registries to measure the impact of COVID-19 control measures on delivery of and access to cancer care services in Uganda to inform the current and future response to epidemics while putting into context other diseases like cancer that have a high burden. There is a need to explore innovative strategies that can ensure continued delivery of cancer care services while observing COVID-19 pandemic control measures to avoid watering down the achievements that had been made in cancer control and other health concerns in Uganda.",Uganda,abstract,2020-08-10,08
70b5cfd5fd7bcba565e8cf6065643dbce33e10a7,"viruses Study of a SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in a Belgian Military Education and Training Center in Maradi, Niger","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a single stranded-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus with a 29,903 nucleotides-long genome [1] . It was first identified in January 2020 in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly causing an ongoing worldwide pandemic. The Republic of the Niger is the largest country in West Africa, landlocked by Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Algeria. It has a population of about 22 million, living mostly in clusters in the far south and west of the country. Niger faces serious development challenges due to its desert terrain and overpopulation, but also due to attacks by ""Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb"", its use as a transit country for migrants, and the spillover of Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgency into southeastern Niger. French, American, and Belgian armed forces are currently assisting Niger in countering jihadist groups present in the Sahel [2] . Since the end of August 2019, Belgian military personnel have been deployed in the Maradi region nearby the southern border with Nigeria in the context of Operation New Nero (ONN). The Belgian military are based on the outskirts of the city of Maradi, the second-or third-largest city in the country. In 2012, it had about 267,000 inhabitants and it is one of Niger's most economically prosperous cities and the major transport, trade, and agricultural hub of South-Central Niger.A group of 70 Belgian soldiers was sent in two waves, one on 12 December 2019 and the other on 1 February 2020, to the Maradi camp. They formed the ""Mobile Education and Training Team"" (METT), which brings together 12 military trainers, members of the Special Forces group, around forty members of the 3rd Battalion Para and a ""Special Operations Surgical Team"". They trained a special intervention company made up of 150 Nigerien soldiers.The first case of COVID-19 in Belgium was confirmed on 3 February 2020 [3] . On 19 March, the first case of COVID-19 in Niger was reported in the Nigerien capital, Niamey: a 36-year-old Nigerien or Nigerien national (depending on the report), a storekeeper in a land transport company, who had travelled along the Lomé (Togo)-Accra (Ghana)-Abidjan (Ivory Coast)-Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) axis [4] . After that, two other COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Niamey: a Brazilian woman, who returned to Niger on 16 March 2020, coming from Switzerland, and a 51-year-old Italian man, who returned to Niger on 28 February 2020, from his home country of Italy [3] . On 24 March, the first death from the new coronavirus in Niger was recorded: a 62-year-old male, Brazilian national, who entered Niger from Senegal on 27 February [4] . Niger declared a national state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 27 March. Gatherings of more than 50 people were banned, places of worship closed, and obligatory epidemiological safety measures were instituted, including the wear of facemasks and social distancing in public places and public transport. On 2 April, the first two COVID-19 cases outside Niamey were confirmed in two residents of Maradi.At the beginning of May 2020, a handful of Belgian military service men developed COVID-19 suspicious symptoms. The METT returned to Belgium in two waves, on 13 May and 19 May 2020. Immediately upon their arrival in Brussels, nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were collected from all soldiers, symptomatic, and asymptomatic alike, for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. The returning military personnel were placed in quarantine nearby the military airport, awaiting test results and medical consultation later in the day. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads of the nasopharyngeal samples were determined using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), while two immunoassays were used to assess their antibody response to the virus. A rapid COVID-19 antibody test was used for first line screening, and a more widely available and evaluated double antigen sandwich assay was performed later on frozen serum samples. Two weeks later, all individuals were re-tested. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in RT-qPCR positive nasopharyngeal samples were sequenced. Viral genomes were evaluated and a retrospective epidemiological study was conducted to identify possible origins and routes of spread and to discuss measures to prevent or control future COVID-19 outbreaks, which pose a threat to the readiness of military forces and their ability to fulfill missions [5] .Nasopharyngeal sample collection kits (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA), consisting of a flexible minitip flocked swab in a tube filled with 1 mL Universal Transport Medium (UTM), were used for COVID-19 sample collection in all 70 returning service members, immediately upon arrival in Belgium (D0) and two weeks later (D14). Blood samples were collected, using VACUETTE serum gel tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Vilvoorde, Belgium), for COVID-19 antibody testing in all returning personnel on D0 and D14. Blood was allowed to clot for a minimum of 30 min in a vertical position and then centrifuged at room temperature in a swinging bucket rotor for 10 min at 1500 g. Serum samples were tested immediately and stored at −80 • C ± 5 • C for possible re-testing.RT-qPCR was performed on the nasopharyngeal swabs using the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Nucleic Acid Diagnostic Kit and Sample Release Reagent (both Sansure Biotech Inc., Changsha, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions, with some adaptations for the LightCycler 2.0 Instrument (Roche Diagnostics Belgium, Machelen, Belgium). The assay targets the ORF1ab and N genes, coding for a well-conserved replicase polyprotein and the nucleocapsid protein, respectively. Each test also contains an RNA internal control (RNAse P genes), which detects RT-PCR failure and/or inhibition. Swab samples were first inactivated at 56 • C for 30 min in a bead bath. Two hundred microliters of swab medium were pipetted into a 1.5 mL tube, which was centrifuged at 13,500 g for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded and 500 µL of sterile saline were added. The tubes were vortexed and again centrifuged at 13,500 g for 3 min, and after discarding the supernatant, about 20-40 µL of the liquid were retained. Thirty microliters of Sample Release Reagent (denatures proteins and frees SARS-CoV-2 RNA) were added and mixed by pipetting up and down. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Eight microliters of the sample supernatants, of the negative control (physiological saline), and of the positive control (in vitro transcriptional RNA of target genes ORF1ab and N) were subsequently pipetted into the corresponding capillaries, which were preloaded with 12 µL PCR Master Mix. The program cycle parameters were as follows: a reverse transcription step at 50 • C for 30 min, followed by a cDNA pre-denaturation at 95 • C for 1 min and then 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 • C for 15 s, and annealing, extension and fluorescence collection at 60 • C for 30 s. There was no need to apply color compensation files.Two SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were performed on the serum samples. The Multi-G COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test (MULTI-G, Antwerpen, Belgium), a lateral flow chromatographic membrane-based immunoassay, was used for the in vitro qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to 2019-nCoV in serum specimens. In this assay, the samples first react with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-coated particles and then migrate to react with anti-human IgG and/or IgM antibodies. According to the package insert, the relative specificity of the test is 98.0% for IgG and 96.0% for IgM. The relative sensitivity is 100% for IgG and 85.0% for IgM. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay on the Cobas e 601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Belgium, Machelen, Belgium) was used for the in vitro qualitative detection of antibodies (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples. This double antigen sandwich assay uses a mix of biotinylated and ruthenylated recombinant nucleocapsid (N) antigen of SARS-CoV-2 for determination of antibodies. A signal threshold ≥1 was defined as positive. A specificity of 99.81% and a sensitivity of 100% (≥14 days post PCR confirmation) were reported in the package insert. All immunoassays were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions.D0 nasopharyngeal samples with positive RT-qPCR results were selected for sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore MinION device using R9.4 flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), based on a protocol from Quick et al., 2017 [6] . Briefly, RNA was extracted from 200 µL UTM transport medium and eluted in 80 µL water using a Maxwell RSC Instrument. 7 µL RNA was then converted to cDNA using random hexamers and the ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK). Subsequently, a strain-specific multiplex PCR was performed in six reactions using an 800 bp SARS-CoV-2 primer scheme (Table S1 ) and Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Cycling conditions were 30 s at 98 • C, followed by 25-30 cycles at 98 • C for 10 s, 65 • C for 1.5 min, 72 • C for 2 min, and a final elongation step at 72 • C for 2 min. The resulting 800 bp PCR products were pooled and cleaned up using AmpureXP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay on a Qubit 3.0 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples were then barcoded using the Ultra II End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (New England Biolabs) and the native barcoding kits NBD104 and NBD114 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), cleaned up with magnetic beads and pooled at equimolar ratios prior to ligation of the AMII adapters with blunt/TA ligase master mix (New England Biolabs). Sequencing libraries were loaded onto the R9.4 flow cell using the ligation sequencing kit LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and sequencing data were collected overnight. Sequence reads were base called in high accuracy mode and demultiplexed using the Guppy algorithm v3.6 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Consensus genome sequences were produced by comparing two distinct bioinformatics pipelines. First, an in-house customized pipeline, which aligns reads to a SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GenBank MN908947.3) using Minimap2, was applied. After removal of primer sequences using a custom Python script, a majority rule consensus was produced for positions with ≥100x genome coverage, while regions with lower coverage, were masked with N characters [7] . In parallel, the Artic network's bioinformatics pipeline [8] was run, which incorporates base quality data as well as the nanopolish algorithm [9] to improve consensus sequence for a draft genome assembly.Whole Genome sequences were compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan genome (NC_045512.2) and to all SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted to the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) repository (https://www.gisaid.org) [10] (July 24 status) and to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). BLOSUM62 substitution scores were calculated to assess amino acid changes and their potential to alter or change the functionality of the involved protein [11] . Negative scores are predicted to be ""bad"" in terms of substitution, i.e., they are not frequently observed in Nature. After submission of the obtained SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to GISAID (Accession IDs: EPI_ISL_487433 to EPI_ISL_487436) they were automatically included into Nextstrain [12] , an open-source project providing a continually updated phylogenetic analysis and visualization of the evolutionary relationships of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. This analysis includes subsampling, alignment, maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference, temporal dating of ancestral nodes, and discrete trait geographic reconstruction. Nextstrain phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan. Full details on bioinformatic processing can be found at [13] .Demographics, COVID-19 suspicious symptoms and signs (cough, fever, sore throat, myalgia, headache, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, and/or diarrhea) and dates of symptom onset were extracted from the medical files of the 70 Belgian soldiers who took part in ONN in Maradi, Niger. Information on the duration of COVID-19 compatible signs and symptoms was not systematically recorded. Possible contacts between the Belgian soldiers and externs were traced. Background COVID-19 related epidemiological data were retrieved from online local media and from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases).Clinical samples were routinely processed in view of diagnosis. Results were analyzed in the context of retrospective epidemiological analysis and were not deemed prospective research.Seventy Belgian male soldiers returned from a mission in Maradi in two waves, one on 13 May and another on 19 May 2020. They had arrived in the Maradi military education and training center on 12 December 2019 and 1 February 2020, a few days before the first diagnosis of COVID-19 in Belgium, in a 54-year-old man, who was repatriated from Wuhan City on 3 February 2020 [3] . Mild symptoms indicative of COVID-19 were recorded in 22 (31.4%, 22/70) of these soldiers in the 3 week period (30 April to 19 May) preceding their return to Belgium (Tables 1 and 2 ). During that same period, approximately one sixth of the 150 Nigerien military trainees ran a fever. The Belgian soldiers were immediately tested (RT-qPCR and two immunoassays), nearby the military airport, upon their return to Belgium (D0) and again two weeks later (D14). Nine Belgian soldiers (12.9%, 9/70) had at least one positive COVID-19 diagnostic test result ( Table 2 ). Five of them (55.6%, 5/9) were trainers. The total number of trainers involved in the training mission was 12 (17.1%, 12/70). Trainers were thus disproportionately represented in the COVID-19 positive diagnosis population. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected in the D0 nasopharyngeal samples of four (5.7%, 4/70) soldiers (M4-M7), which persisted at D14 in three of them ( Table 2 ). The four RT-qPCR positive soldiers remained in isolation for two weeks. In these four D0 RT-qPCR positive soldiers, antibodies were not observed at D0, but all had seroconverted on D14 (Table 2 ). This indicates that these soldiers were recently infected and that the Maradi outbreak was still ongoing. The remaining five soldiers with negative RT-qPCR results, showed positive immunoassays at D0, which highlights the importance of serological testing to achieve more accurate estimates of the extent of a COVID-19 outbreak. However, for two individuals (M8 and M9), only the rapid antibody tests were positive, making it uncertain whether they actually had the disease ( Table 2) . Seroconversion is usually, and depending on the applied method, observed after a median of approximately two weeks after symptom onset for both IgM and IgG [14] and in contrast to IgG, the positive rate of IgM drops after 5 weeks [15] . Although seroconversion as well as the loss of IgM can clearly be observed in our antibody data, the timings do not always correspond. For example, in some patients IgMs disappeared more rapidly (e.g., M2 and M3) or were not detected at all (e.g., M7), but this was somewhat expected given person-related variations as well as the sensitivity of the different tests used ( Table 2) .Of interest, four (M6-M9) of the nine COVID-19 positive soldiers (including soldiers M8 and M9 with doubtful diagnosis) were asymptomatic ( Table 2 ). In two of them, SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected by RT-qPCR (Table 2 ). These infected asymptomatic soldiers (one of them a trainer) would have continued to work while shedding the virus. In addition, for two soldiers (M4 and M5), the onset of COVID-19 symptoms occurred on May 15 and 16, respectively, a few days before their return to Belgium. Hence, it is very likely that the timely return to Belgium prevented this becoming worse.For comparison, a COVID-19 outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt was characterized by widespread transmission with mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection (20%) among a similar population of mostly young healthy adults living in a congregate environment [16] . Of note, just like with the Belgian soldiers, anosmia and ageusia were the symptoms most strongly associated with infection, followed by fever [16] . Some scientists suggested that onset of anosmia should be considered SARS-CoV-2 related until proven otherwise and recommended immediate isolation and confirmatory testing [17] .To analyze possible patterns of spread across local and global epidemiological scales, we further determined the whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the four D0 RT-qPCR positive Belgian soldiers (sequencing statistic are given in Table S2 ). The genome sequences were submitted to GISAID under accession IDs EPI_ISL_487433-6, and were re-named C2181, C2182, C2183, and C2185 in Nextstrain (Table 3) . No other SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from patients with documented history of exposure or residence in Niger were present in the GISAID and NCBI databases. The four genome sequences were compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan genome (NC_045512.2) and with all SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted to the GISAID and NCBI repositories. Genomes C2181 and C2185 are identical and were found in soldiers M4 and M7, both trainers (Table 3) . Genomic sequences of samples collected from COVID-19 cases within one infection cluster are often identical or highly similar, especially within household pairs [18] . However, due to the relatively limited mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to know if both trainers were infected by the same source, by different sources, or passed it on to each other. Genome C2183 has one additional difference in comparison to genomes C2181 and C2185, i.e., mutation G20477T corresponding to a glycine (G) to valine (V) amino acid change in protein ORF1ab. Genome C2182 has two differences in comparison to genomes C2181 and C2185: mutations A8095C and C19164T, both in ORF1ab and both silent (Table 3) . Table 3 . Nucleotide and amino acid comparison of the 4 Maradi genomes to the reference SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan genome (NC_045512.2). Reference genome nucleotides and amino acids showing variations in any of the Maradi genomes are presented in dark green. Matches with the reference genome are indicated in light green, variations in red. The SARSCoV-2 genes harboring these variations are marked in orange, sky blue, air force blue, greige, purple and grey. ORF1abWith two genomes being indistinguishable and one differing by one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and another by two SNPs, the genomic variations observed in our cluster correspond with those observed in ""institutional outbreaks"". In three reported outbreaks where 12, 17, and 35 individuals had contracted the virus within one institution, up to two SNPs were detected [18] .To date, five major clades of SARS-CoV-2 were defined (i.e., GR, G, GH, L, O, S, and V), based on characteristic mutational events observed in the genomes submitted to GISAID (https: //www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/) (Figure 1 ) [19] . Phylogenetic examination using Nextstrain (accessed 11 August 2020) showed that all four Maradi genomes belonged to cluster 19B of GISAID's clade S (Figure 2 ). The S clade was first observed among travelers from Wuhan in the early days of the outbreak [20] and was prevalent in North America and in Europe [19] [20] [21] , but has now declined worldwide in favor of the G clades ( Figure 1B) . All four Maradi genomes bear the two signature mutations of clade S: the silent mutation C8782T and mutation T28144C, which causes a leucine (L) to serine (S) (hence the clade's name) change in the ORF8 protein [18] . In addition, our cluster shared 7 other mutations when compared to the reference NC_045512.2, four of which were previously reported and determine the tree topology (G28878A, G22468T, A361G, and G29742A), as indicated by the arrows in Figures 2 and 3 . Mutation G26152A, which causes a glycine (G) to arginine (R) amino acid change in ORF3a, and the silent mutation C3589T were previously observed in other SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The C18959T mutation, however, is unique to the Maradi genomes and results in an alanine (A) to valine (V) amino acid change in ORF1ab. Other infrequent variations, which are present in less than 10 reported genomes, are shown in Table 4 . The rare silent mutation A361G, present in all four Maradi genomes, was recently observed in Benin, Nigeria, and Mali (Table 4) , three neighboring countries of Niger, and places our genomes in a cluster of recent African descent (92% confidence), with its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) estimated between 28 February and 15 March 2020 (Figure 3 ). This is compatible with the suspected first COVID-19 case in Niger (reported on 19 March 2020), who had travelled to Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso [3] . The dates on which the first confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in these countries, according to ECDC, were 7 (1 case), 13 (2 cases), 12 (1 case), and 11 March 2020 (2 cases), respectively. The rare silent mutation A361G, present in all four Maradi genomes, was recently observed in Benin, Nigeria, and Mali (Table 4) , three neighboring countries of Niger, and places our genomes in a cluster of recent African descent (92% confidence), with its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) estimated between 28 February and 15 March 2020 (Figure 3 ). This is compatible with the suspected first COVID-19 case in Niger (reported on 19 March 2020), who had travelled to Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso [3] . The dates on which the first confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in these countries, according to ECDC, were 7 (1 case), 13 (2 cases), 12 (1 case), and 11 March 2020 (2 cases), respectively.Three amino acid changes, resulting from the individual mutation G20477T, the shared mutation G26152A, and the S clade signature mutation T28144C are predicted to result in significant alterations of the functionality of the involved proteins (negative BLOSUM62 scores) ( Table 3 ) [10] . The mutation predicted to have the most significant impact (exhibiting a BLOSUM score of −3), was G20477T, but has only been observed once so far, in March 2020, in isolate nCoV-19/France/10063BI/2020 (Table 4 ). It was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence diversity could be associated with virus pathogenicity and/or transmission. In Europe, several countries were associated with specific virus clades or mutations while the frequency in clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients also varied between these countries. It was therefore suggested that genome and patient symptom data should be combined to better understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and help develop adapted treatments [20] .A military camp is a semi-enclosed environment with a high population density and contained spaces (e.g., dining halls and recreational spaces) in which many soldiers (e.g., trainers and trainees) and a number of civilians interact. Communal living and training environments are renowned for person-to-person transmission of disease agents, a frequent problem for militaries worldwide [4]. During their entire stay at the Maradi training facility, the 70 Belgian military service men had sporadic contacts with Nigerien civilians (in the camp and in the city of Maradi), but especially the trainers had frequent contacts with 150 Nigerien military trainees (Table 5 ). Other non-Nigerien contacts occurred at least two weeks before the date on which the first COVID-19 cases were presumed to have appeared in Maradi (2 April) and more than six weeks before the onset of COVID-19-like symptoms in the Belgian military service men (30 April-16 May) (Tables 1 and 2). Considering that the incubation period for COVID-19 is currently estimated to be between one and 14 days [22] , it is unlikely that the Belgian soldiers contracted COVID-19 from these non-Nigerien contacts. In fact, the possible window of COVID-19 infection of the Belgian soldiers occurred short after high daily growth increases of COVID-19 cases in Niger (more than doubling for some days) (Figure 4) , as derived from data reported by the ECDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/ geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases).Overall, the data produced by this combined conventional (i.e., contact tracing) and genomic (i.e., African MRCA) epidemiological analysis, suggest that the Belgian soldiers were infected via direct contacts with locals and subsequently among themselves. Overall, the data produced by this combined conventional (i.e., contact tracing) and genomic (i.e., African MRCA) epidemiological analysis, suggest that the Belgian soldiers were infected via direct contacts with locals and subsequently among themselves.The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a Belgian military education and training center in Maradi, Niger, was characterized by mild symptoms in five soldiers and asymptomatic infection in two soldiers (one trainer), both having a viral load, as diagnosed upon their timely return to Belgium. The symptoms most strongly associated with COVID-19 infection were anosmia and ageusia. Trainers were disproportionately infected. Conventional and genomic epidemiological data suggest that the The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a Belgian military education and training center in Maradi, Niger, was characterized by mild symptoms in five soldiers and asymptomatic infection in two soldiers (one trainer), both having a viral load, as diagnosed upon their timely return to Belgium. The symptoms most strongly associated with COVID-19 infection were anosmia and ageusia. Trainers were disproportionately infected. Conventional and genomic epidemiological data suggest that the Belgian military servicemen were infected by a locally transmitted virus with a recent African common ancestor.Based, among others, on this epidemiological study, the medical military command decided to continue testing Belgian soldiers for SARS-CoV-2 viral load and antibodies, and this two to three days before a mission abroad or on the high seas, and for specific missions immediately upon their return. Soldiers in whom SARS-CoV-2 viral load is detected are isolated. Some military operational settings (e.g., training camps in austere environments and ships) were also equipped with mobile infectious disease (COVID-19) testing capacity. More specifically, the training center in Maradi is now using a GeneXpert machine for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/9/949/s1, Table S1 : SARS-CoV-2 primer scheme, Table S2 : SARS-CoV-2 sequencing statistics.",Niger,abstract,2020-08-27,08
e2ad2576a5d9f46f71be396eb51d1885d9de2e69,School curriculum in South Africa in the Covid-19 context: An opportunity for education for relevance,"to help keep lockdowns and social distancing rules in place. The severity of the disease became more evident when countries posted their respective statistics on a common media platform that reflected daily cumulative numbers of people infected and the number of persons dying from the disease. Saving human lives at the expense of the economy, job losses, hunger and poverty became the sole aim in many countries.Within South Africa it was no different. As news of the first and subsequent infections began to filter through the corridors of power and control, tracking and tracing those that might have been infected took precedence. Implementation of a high-level lockdown meant the closure of public spaces such as universities, schools, social and religious gatherings, in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. While this article is not about the epidemiology of the coronavirus, the sequence of events that unfolded within the country and perhaps globally in unison of process (rather than when they initiated the processes) was noted. Similar precautionary measures were taken in almost all countries that experienced the virus.This sequence of events provided a backdrop for responses by educational authorities in a quest to support the priorities of the country in attempting to curb and bring the severity of this Covid-19 pandemic under control. Institutions of teaching and learning closed schools and campuses (both basic education and higher education) with the initial intention to bring forward the Easter annual vacation and to respond to the social distancing call to curb the spread of the disease. More importantly, there was a pressing need to think about and respond to the envisaged prolonged period of lockdown and social distancing behaviour that was to become a new socializing norm in relation to educating the learners and students of the country.The closure of educational campuses (schools, colleges, and universities) and the realization that time to cover the curriculum was being lost led to various responses by leaders and teachers (school, college, and higher education) to address this growing concern to save the academic year.In this article I present a review of actions taken and examine proposals made to address the concerns and critique presented through the media, notices, social media and guides. Through this review of actual and potential solutions and suggestions for continuing, more specifically, school education, I argue that these actions and proposals constitute a missed opportunity to critically review the school curriculum to move beyond the notion of education for all, and to strive for education that is relevant at both local and global levels. The argument is based on a fundamental Spencerian curriculum question (Spencer 1884) in the context of Covid-19: What knowledge is most worthwhile?The uncertainty of the period of lockdown and the trajectory of the disease within the country compromised the ability to put together a final plan for the recovery of the academic year. In this uncertain period, several draft plans have been developed by the Ministry of Basic Education and political leaders who have made suggestions for catch-up and curriculum coverage within each of the nine Provinces in South Africa. Scenarios, concerns and suggestions have also been made by researchers and leading scholars of education.In this review, I capture the essence of these plans, suggestions, cautions and aspirations as published in various public documents, mainstream media, social media and reports, to highlight the fact that the central concern for school education during this period of school closure has been on curriculum coverage and extension of the academic year. These concerns relate to addressing time lost for the academic year and efforts to save its integrity. Apart from exploring online learning through digital platforms to enhance access to teaching and learning activities, little consideration has been given to reviewing the existing curriculum in terms of what needs to be taught and what needs to be learnt within a changed Covid-19 context.One of the leading distinguished education professors in South Africa, Professor Jonathan Jansen, in a Times Select posting (April 9, 2020) responding to the reality that ""we do not know when schools will reopen nor how they will reopen"", suggested that the school year is effectively over (Jansen 2020) . Recognizing the two school world context (Spaull 2013 ) that currently characterizes the South African school system, Jansen argued that if one is not part of the elite with privileges like access to the internet, Google Classroom and other digital learning platforms, one can get further left behind in an already compromised and divided education system. The two world schools that Spaull (2013) speaks of relate to the great variances in school infrastructure to support teaching and learning that learners from higher socio-economic families are exposed to, compared to the majority of learners from the lower socio-economic stratum of society in South Africa. Jansen (2020) suggested seven steps be taken and this included ""scrapping the academic year even if the curriculum is trimmed down"". In this suggestion he alluded to the possibility of trimming down the curriculum. The choice of words used in this proposal does not suggest a review of curriculum content, but rather a mechanistic reduction of content, that can be covered in the remaining time after schools reopen for the academic year.Another robust suggestion was that ""all learners from grade 1 to grade 11 be passed to the next grade for organizational reasons"". Here again, what needs to be taught and learnt is not the focus. Rather, the mechanism of school education in terms of access and exits prompted this suggestion to avoid clogging the system. For grade 12 learners, as his fourth and fifth proposal, he suggested, ""universities should commence three weeks earlier to bridge the gap"", presumably because of the lockdown and trimmed curriculum to complete the academic year. This comment is based on an assumption that all of the grade 12 learners will access higher education. The reality within the South African context is that only approximately 17 per cent of grade 12 learners access higher education (Council on Higher Education 2014). The question can be asked: What then happens to the majority of learners who do not access higher education? Once again, this suggestion reinforces the notion that the school curriculum streams learners towards higher education studies (Ramrathan 2017) . The Council on Higher Education (2014) in its vital statistics reports that 17 per cent of grade 12 learners access higher education given its capacity limitations despite aspiring, as part of its transformational agenda to increase higher education capacity to accommodate 25 per cent of grade 12 learners by 2030. The Council on Higher Education (2013) also notes that there is huge concern at the under-preparedness of grade 12 learners for higher education studies. In the contexts of these two concerns about capacity and under-preparedness of learners, what difference would a three-week post-school programme make in learners aspiring to higher education studies? Jonathan Jansen's third suggestion was to ""abandon all continuous assessment marks"", as he believes that these were ""not continuous"" in nature. Within the Curriculum and Assessment Policy statement (CAPS) (Department of Basic Education 2011) that guides teaching, learning, and assessment across all grades and subjects taught within South African schools, continuous assessment is a key component of teaching and learning within an assessment for learning philosophy (Black and William 2004 ) that integrates teaching, learning, and assessment. By doing away with continuous assessment marks the focus then shifts away from learning and into mechanical coverage of curriculum content which clearly then speaks to issues of accountability through curriculum coverage rather that accountability through competence or outcomes of learning.As I write this section of the article, I pause to read the Daily News (2020), a Provincial newspaper, where the editor of the column, Sne Masuku, entitles a section ""Don't scrap June exams -Professor"" wherein I am quoted as being in opposition to the scrapping of the mid-year examinations for learners. The article presents a call by the Congress of South African Students to the Minister of Basic Education to scrap the June exams. My reasoning, despite their argument that the exam period would be used to catch up with lost teaching and learning time, is that most learners do more learning prior to assessments and, if we remove assessment opportunities, we lose opportunities for deep and meaningful learning by learners as they spend more time in engaging with school work on their own. Jansen's other proposals included scrapping the June and September holidays, as well as to commence the new year much earlier and to offer psychological support to teachers and learners because they are not cognitive machines that can be switched on and off at will, hence the psychological support to these individuals. These suggestions generated a number of responses, both from the Ministry of Basic Education and others interested in the welfare of education. While some regard his proposal as radical, it nevertheless, stirred ongoing debates on matters of education, especially that of schooling in South Africa, not just within the context of Covid-19, but beyond this dreadful pandemic. Several media channels have broadcast television interviews with Jonathan Jansen on the issues he raised and the proposals made especially in the context of an ""overloaded CAPS curriculum"".The closure of schools in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the extended lockdown of the country, which may be further extended, means that the Department of Basic Education (DBE) would have to develop a plan to recover the missed school days. Plans by the DBE are emerging in various forms. There are a few through official statements by politicians responsible for basic education (Minister of Education and Provincial Members of the Executive Councils who are political leaders of basic education within each province in South Africa), and other pronouncements speculating what needs to happen in order to make up the lost schooling time. The ministry developed a draft plan in response to the school closure and lockdown measures which was leaked to the media. In summary these responses and speculations include exploiting the digital learning platforms, extending schooling into the pre-planned holidays, extended hours for schooling and lessons broadcast through radio stations. Many of these suggestions and plans yet again demonstrated that the focus has been largely on technical issues of curriculum coverage and modes of delivery, rather than an exploitation of the Covid-19 context to make school education relevant to the lives of the people, the community and the country.A staggered return to school policy was reported by the Times Live (2020) newspaper edited by Pregga Govender, in which plans were being considered in response to social distancing and loss of teaching days for school education. South Africa currently has approximately 11.9 million learners in its public schooling system with approximately 430 000 teachers. The staggered return plan was to get grade 12 and grade 7 learners back to school at the earliest. The rationale for the early return to school of these grades is that these are transition grades and the learners in these grades should have more time in school to cover as much curriculum content as possible. Other grades would include two grades at a time, grade 11 and grade 6 being the next batch of learners to return to school and progressively all grades to be back at school by mid-July, which is usually the date of return from the mid-year holidays. This staggered return to school was included in a document developed by the National Department of Basic Education entitled ""2020 recovery plan for post Covid-19 lockdown"". Other plans included extra hours and extra school days which would translate into an extension of the day by thirty minutes for the intermediate phase of schooling, one hour per day for senior phase schooling and two hours a day for further education and training phase of schooling. Extended days will be days taken away from pre-planned holidays including the December vacation and the inclusion of Saturdays as part of the school week. Another aspect of the plan was to do away with the June examination but keep the preparatory exams for grade 12 learners. Once again, all of these planned interventions for school education were directly in response to the threat of not achieving curriculum coverage as per the CAPS curriculum. Furthermore, in order to save the academic year, cramming of the curriculum into fewer teaching days has been the mode of choice for the recovery of school education.Proposals also included no testing of curriculum that has not been taught, suggesting that teaching to assessment would influence what gets taught and what is left out of the curriculum. There is an expectation that teachers would work outside of the normal hours with little consideration of what teacher's views are on this matter, or the impact of such proposals on the life of the teacher outside of teaching. Part of the catch-up programme included the use of digital platforms for learners and parents to access. In support of the use of digital platforms, some of the mobile network companies within South Africa zero rated (no charge) educational and informational websites, suggesting that there were extensive possibilities for collaboration in making education accessible during and outside of lockdown periods.Independent schools and public schools that have good infrastructure and financial resources and where most of its learners come from higher socio-economic backgrounds, have the added advantage of digital learning platforms and parental support in teaching and learning. Google Classrooms, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom have become the new modes of teaching and of learning. Learners, teachers, and parents are experiencing a new way of teaching and learning with some parents indicating that it has become a full-time job to keep [the children] focused (Sunday Tribune 2020b). A grade 7 learner connected online with his teachers and fellow classmates over the last two weeks during the lockdown (Sunday Tribune 2020a), suggested that independent learning is possible through guided support and adherence to a teaching and learning schedule. Parents, teachers, and learners are adjusting to schooling during the lockdown and closure of schools, but this situation amplifies the two-world school system (Spaull 2013 ) that exists within the South African context. This proliferation of the two-world schooling system has attracted severe criticisms from social justice scholars. They believe that digital learning further perpetuates inequalities because the large majority of learners do not have access to the internet, or weak internet access due to geographical locations and no access to computers or handheld electronic devices, like smart phones.What are we missing among the responses to school education during the Covid-19 pandemic? The closure of schools and catch-up programme for school education is not a new phenomenon in South Africa. The education system and, indeed, the school education system has found itself in similar situations for a number of years now, albeit under different circumstances. Schools were closed for extended periods largely because of protest actions by teachers facilitated by their unions, and by learners due to several issues including political struggles, poor infrastructure issues, violence, and preventable deaths of learners (Kgatle 2018; Mawokomayi and Dube 2018) . Catch-up plans then included shifting school holiday schedules, re-organizing teaching and learning processes and additional support to learners outside of normal school hours. Yet again, the responses have almost always been the same -a focus on curriculum coverage, additional time for teaching and learning, assessment changes, and support programmes. Curriculum reviewers were almost silent during all of these catch-up school programmes. The Covid-19 pandemic which brought the country and, indeed, the world to a standstill with severe lockdown measures to curb the infection rates among people, has disrupted school education to a point where it is difficult to predict when and how schools will reopen. In this high level of uncertainty, planning for re-opening of schools and catch-up of lost teaching and learning time is almost impossible. To save the academic year in terms of the curriculum policy that guides school education is equally impossible. What then would be an appropriate response to such a tentative situation regarding school education?The curriculum is where, I believe, we should focus our attention and where we should ask the fundamental curriculum question of what knowledge is most worthwhile (Spencer 1884) in the context of Covid-19 and why this knowledge is most worthwhile for learners. It is clear that the expected curriculum for the academic year as planned cannot be accomplished despite the proposed plans and suggested proposals by the DBE and distinguished scholars of education. Should Covid-19 be a subject of learning within the school education system in the time that is available for school in this academic year? What kind of education should learners be given to address the shortened school year and the organizational challenge that may present itself for learners who have not progressed to the next grade? These are some of the key questions that I will engage with in the following section and conclude with some suggestions related to these key curriculum questions.At the moment, the organizational matter of curriculum coverage and recovery programme to save the school academic year are the main subjects of scrutiny. If this scrutiny is shifted to the curriculum space, then the fundamental curriculum questions of what knowledge is most worthwhile and how that knowledge should be developed through the school curriculum in the context of Covid-19, would allow for innovative solutions to emerge. This would not only include questions related to technically saving the school academic year, but also to re-examining the purpose of school education that centres relevant learning for the individual, the family, the community, and the nation. The school education system spans more than twelve years of a learner's life. This means that there is sufficient time within the lifespan of the schooling for learners in lower grades to catch up with what might have been missed during this lockdown period. For learners who are in grades 10 to 12, it is an appropriate time for them to engage substantially more on guided self-study to engender an independent scholar attitude, largely in preparation for higher education studies where independent learning is a requirement and a key attribute for high achievement. Hence, curriculum coverage should not be the focus in saving the affected academic year of schooling. Rather, curriculum coverage should be considered across the remaining years of schooling. If this consideration is a possibility for addressing the immediate concern of catch-up time, one can then venture into the curriculum space for more innovative solutions to school education within the context of Covid-19. Three innovative curriculum solutions are possible within this pandemic context. The first is that Covid-19 becomes the medium through which multi-disciplinary engagement is made possible. Blignaut (2020, p. 5) argues in favour of this by claiming ""that curriculum and pedagogic change will only succeed if we embrace new ways of viewing knowledge and as well as embracing multiple knowledge traditions"". Unpacking this multi-disciplinary scrutiny would centre the Covid-19 context in the curriculum from which, amongst others, the economics of this disease could become the subject of learning. The immediacy of the disease itself could become a life science concern and the social learning related to disease control, socialization and social prejudices would become direct relevant learning for learners. Other disciplinary engagements are possible and could include mathematical modelling, extrapolations and predictions about the spread of and containment of the disease.The second possible solution would be a focus on the organizational aspect of school education. In this respect, a focus on progression competence within the existing CAPS curriculum could be distilled which would frame the teaching and learning when schools do open. Here, the central curriculum question would be to ask, what competence is, therefore, needed for learners to sufficiently engage with the expected curriculum in the next grade of schooling? This question would require a review of the content of each subject at each grade level, to ascertain the knowledge and skills that will be needed as foundational competence to progress into the next year of schooling. This means a fundamental review of the CAPS curriculum. In addition, this review will provide an opportunity to examine the duplications of key learnings across different subjects as well as integration of key learnings into individual subjects being taught in schools. This leads to the third possible solution for school education within the context of Covid-19.In order to maintain social distancing in schools that have a high population of learners, in some cases as high as 90 learners per class, a review of how subjects are taught in schools is needed. For example, the review could explore the need for every subject being taught each day of schooling. There could well be other possibilities like rearranging the timetable so that fewer subjects are taken each day, halving the learner numbers per class to maintain social distancing. As Jansen (2020) claimed in his live television interview, the CAPS curriculum is currently overloaded. What is the purpose of having a loaded curriculum? How can the curriculum be aligned to a re-purposed school education that embraces global infectious diseases like Covid-19 and national issues like profound social injustices and inequalities which are still evident in South Africa (Blignaut 2020) , and issues of global competence within a globalized population.There is grave concern that shifting teaching and learning into digital spaces would further widen the inequity gap that Spaull (2013) has alluded to through the two school world illuminations in his analysis of learner performance in South Africa. While digital platforms are very useful for supporting guided independent studies, the majority of learners in the country do not have access to the digital platforms, which is mostly related to affordability and geographic infrastructures. Hence being in a school or physical campus is still needed and will be a reality for a very long time, especially within the current context of high levels of inequalities that exist within South Africa. The review of the school curriculum in terms of a reviewed purpose of school education is quite central if any meaningful interventions are to be realized arising from the pandemic Covid-19 global situation. In this respect, I focus my attention to what this re-purposed school education might look like from a curriculum perspective. In doing this, I argue that it is an opportune time to shift our gaze from an education for all perspective to an education for relevance perspective.We need a new conceptual architecture of school education that straddles a contextualized and responsive curriculum addressing local educational needs and a global imperative formed by core literacies that will enable one to work within and be part of a globalized world context. Soudien and Harvey (2020) contend that there are multiple and different kinds of ""politics"" involved in the process of learning in schools, therefore, what gets ""learnt"" and what gets ""taught"" within the ""politics"" should now feature more strongly in our debates on school curriculum and intended learning. While Soudien and Harvey (2020) and Marope (2017) re-ignite the return to biology and brain study of learning into the social and contextual realities and possibilities, they work from the premise that learning is the critical bedrock from which education proceeds. This means that what is to be learnt should be the foundation for and the starting point of developing a school curriculum. The intended learning should then inform the purpose of school education.In trying to understand why education has not delivered on it promises, especially in the South African context of increasing inequalities, poor learner performances in spite of a substantial budget for education, increasing unemployment and poor economic outlook, Soudien and Harvey (2020) argue that crucial determinative factors present in particular contexts are not adequately engaged with and understood, because of the complexity of the politics surrounding the learning experience. It is proposed that implications of the Covid-19 lockdown have not been engaged with adequately nor have they been clearly understood. These reasons have contributed to the focus on the technical issues of curriculum coverage, catch-up time and use of digital platforms as suggestions for school during and post the Covid-19 lockdown period, instead of a focus on meaningful learning through shifting the discourse into curriculum spaces. The school recovery project within South Africa, through purely technical suggestions, is clear evidence of the politics of curriculum coverage. Hence, during periods of school disruption, as is the case of the Covid-19 lockdown, the politics of education emerge in guiding what and how education should proceed without focusing on what learners can and should learn through and from such incidences as Covid-19. Therefore, in the context of Covid-19 and future contextual challenges, what knowledge and, indeed, what learning is needed should become the focal point of engagement. In this respect, I propose a flexible school curriculum with two broad components, a core component that focuses on the various literacies that one needs as core learning, and a responsive component that focuses on critical elements of being human within a social, economic, and healthy environment.The core elements of schooling should include the five literacies: Communicative literacy, Numerical literacy, Financial literacy, Environmental literacy, and Digital literacy. The spread of these literacies could span over the different schooling years.Examples of responsive elements, determined by the needs of the community, of society, and of national development would include: Living a healthy lifestyle (within impoverished communities), Dealing with trauma and social ills, basic health care, stereotyping and socializing, accessible career-focused curriculum, and entrepreneurial education.Thus, a shift from ""Education for All"" to ""Education for Relevance"" would provide opportunities for learners to co-exist in both worlds that exist within South Africa. This context implies an impoverished world that requires an education that will enable them to live and have a healthy life in a healthy environment in their respective communities, and a post-modern world exposure with the literacies needed to sustain a global presence. The education for relevance is not a new concept. According to Knamiller (1984) , the concept ""education for relevance"" has been part of the education discourse for decades, citing that ""everyone believes in relevance"" (p. 60). More recently, it has become increasingly popular in education discourses especially in response to the envisaged skills and knowledge driving the 21 st century, which is characterized as being fast-changing, unpredictable with disruptive contextual challenges and opportunities (Marope 2017) . The Covid-19 pandemic is one such example of a disruptive, unpredictable, and fast-changing reality which people across the globe are currently experiencing.",South Africa,abstract,2020-08-06,08
d3b66388817a0839468c70cd6bf404ac3b04bc9d,The importance of supplementary immunisation activities to prevent measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has interrupted large parts of social interaction, the economy and important health services in Kenya and around the world. 1, 2 As of mid-July 2020, the incidence of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across most of Africa, implying that the current mitigation measures need to be maintained or extended for a period at least until the pandemic peaks. 3 Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) advisory to sustain routine immunization (RI), vaccine coverage has temporarily declined in many countries including Kenya that reports a 33% disruption of RI. [4] [5] [6] [7] Following guidance from the WHO, all countries suspended planned supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) for measles. [6] [7] [8] Measles control in Kenya is achieved by a delivery of a first dose of Measles Containing Vaccine (MCV1) at 9 months, and a second dose (MCV2) from 18 months. SIAs, first introduced in 2002 are conducted periodically among children <5 years or <15 years for accelerated control of measles. 9 Based on accumulation of susceptible children, timing of such campaigns has typically been chosen to close immunity gaps in time to prevent potentially large measles outbreaks. Measles SIA originally due in 2019 was rescheduled for February 2020 due to a shortfall in funding and postponed again following the COVID-19 pandemic.Following identification of the first COVID-19 case on March 13, 2020, Kenya imposed various mitigation measures: ban on large gatherings, suspension of international flights, closure of bars, cessation of movement from hotspot counties, restriction of restaurant operating hours and a nationwide curfew from 7pm to 5 am. While it is plausible that these physical distancing and lock down measures may reduce the risk of measles outbreaks, they are temporary and may be associated with rebound risk periods.The availability of recent measles serological data provided the opportunity to use Kenya as a case study to estimate the impact of reduced measles vaccination coverage and suspended SIAs due to COVID-19 on the risk of measles outbreaks.All rights reserved.

The samples were collected in July (107), August (73), September (33) and October (1) 2019. Measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected using a fluorescent-bead-based multiplex immunoassay and antibody concentrations ≥0.12 IU/ml were considered protective against measles. 12 For projections, we assumed these results reflected measles immunity in Kilifi in August 2019, and assumed 96% of persons >15 years had protective measles antibodies concentrations, similar to findings in adults in Nairobi in 2007-2009 13 (Table 1) . We also assumed no protection from maternal immunity since none of the infants <9 months old had protective antibodies.MCV1 national coverage in Kenya has been between 75% and 80% since it was introduced in 1985. 14 MCV2 was introduced into the RI programme in Kenya in 2013 and coverage rose to 45% in 2018 after introduction. 9 The last measles SIA in children aged 9 months to 14 years took place in 2016 and achieved 95% coverage. 15 We assumed national MCV1 and MCV2 coverage were 79% and 45% respectively in 2018, and that these stayed at the same level from August 2019 until the end of March 2020 when COVID-19 contact restrictions were introduced in Kenya. From April 2020, we explored the following routine vaccination coverage scenarios alongside a suspended SIA All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.We used an age-mixing matrix from a study conducted in Kilifi, Kenya. 16 The matrix which consisted of the number of contacts between six different age groups was used in generating contact-adjusted immunity estimates.We adapted a static cohort model of measles immunity 17 to estimate age stratified population immunity profile in Kilifi by combining recent measles serological data with new vaccine-derived immunity during the prediction period using the local vaccination schedule, MCV1 and MCV2 uptake, and vaccine efficacy. We assumed waning immunity or additional acquired immunity from natural exposure, and demographic changes in the short time frame considered were negligible. Hence, the key mechanisms of the projection model were that individuals are born at a constant rate, gain immunity through vaccination at the recommended age and at the observed coverage, and grow older.In extrapolating immunity for young infants under 9 months old, maternal immunity was assumed to be the same as the observed data. For ages 9 months to 17 months, immunity was estimated in accordance with the assumed MCV1 vaccination uptake and a vaccine effectiveness of 93%.For those ³18 months, we estimated the immunity based on the assumed uptake of MCV2 and the same vaccine effectiveness. We aggregated projected immunity to age groups given by contact data and weighted each age group according to population estimates before averaging them to estimate overall immunity. We did not explicitly model MCV2 delivery but rather assumed that the MCV1 effectiveness is an average of MCV1 and MCV2 efficacy weighted by proportion of children who receive MCV1 only or both doses. The underlying assumption here was that the same children who received MCV2 had also received MCV1. We predicted age stratified and population level immunity until December 2021. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.We obtained a crude estimate of the outbreak risk using the predicted immunity and herdimmunity threshold. The probability of a large outbreak, p, sparked by a single infected individual was given by p = 1-(1/R) I0 where I0 is the initial number infected and R is the effective reproductive number. R<1 implies that probability, p, is negative which is defined to be 0 for no outbreak.We assessed the impact of SIAs in two age categories; 9 months to 5 years and 9 months to 15 years, by predicting the post-SIA immunity profile and the corresponding risk for a large measles outbreak. We simulated SIAs in either October 2020, December 2020 or December 2021, assumed a coverage of 95% similar to the most recent national SIA in 2016, 15 and applied vaccine efficacy of MCV1. The SIA was simulated by reducing the age specific pool of susceptible by the effective coverage of the SIA.We assessed the sensitivity of our findings to uncertainty inherent in several of our assumptions via probabilistic re-sampling. We included uncertainty for population immunity profile, combined MCV1 and MCV2 vaccine effectiveness, and MCV1 and MCV2 coverage ( Table 1 ). As part of each parameter bootstrap, we also bootstrapped participants of the serological survey and hence the age stratified population immunity at the start of the simulation. We present median estimates including uncertainty quantified as per the 95% quantiles of the bootstrap analyses.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of a delay in receipt of MCV1 on outbreak probability. We delayed the age of receipt of MCV1 in our model by three months as reported for delayed vaccination in Kilifi. 20 We also predicted unadjusted population immunity in Kilifi and estimated the corresponding probability of a large outbreak All analyses were done in R 21 and are available on github at: https://github.com/CarolineNM/ncov_measles_Kenya Social mixing matrix from 2011/12 16 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Proportion of MCV1-eligible children with protective measles antibody concentrations was high in late 2019 ( Figure 1 ). All 25 children over 10 years old had protective levels. Similarly, 77 of 82 (94%) 5-9-year-olds were immune. Among children under 5 years eligible for MCV1, 86 of 97 (89%) were immune but none of the 10 children who were age ineligible for vaccination had protective antibodies.We estimate that in late 2019, population immunity adjusted for age-differences in social contacts was 91% (87-93). Predicted proportion immune was unchanged in February 2020, at the time of originally planned SIA.Following the start of COVID-19 pandemic and restriction measures that caused a decrease in vaccination coverage, we estimate that population immunity decreased quickly, depending on extent of reduction in vaccination coverage. If vaccine coverage is reduced by 15% from April 2020 onwards, contact-adjusted population immunity would decline to 90% (87-92) by and if, as a result of social distancing, measles transmission is reduced by 50%, herd immunity threshold drops to 86% (83-89) as seen in figure 2.Before contact restrictions came into effect in April 2020, age-adjusted immunity was slightly below herd immunity threshold: in 10% of simulations this immunity was below the herd immunity threshold (Figure 3 ). Reduction in herd immunity threshold temporarily mitigated immediate risk for measles outbreak as in all simulations immunity in April 2020 was above the reduced transmission herd immunity threshold. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Similarly, risk of a large measles outbreak from introduction of a single infectious individual increased quickly if routine vaccination coverage was impaired (Figure 3 ). If in October 2020, measles transmissibility was similar to that pre-COVID-19 and routine measles coverage since April 2020 reduced by 15%, 50% or 100%, we estimate probability for a large measles outbreak as 26% (8-49), 33% (11-52), 40% (24-56) respectively in the age-adjusted analysis. By the end of the year, the risk would increase to 28% (4-49), 35% (16-52) and 44% (29-57) respectively.SIAs in 9 months to 5-year-old children or 9 months to 15-year-olds immediately after lifting transmission-reducing COVID-19 mitigation measures can substantially reduce outbreak risk ( Figure 4 ).If routine measles vaccine coverage was reduced by 15%, 50% or 100% since April 2020, an SIA delivered to children 9 months to 5 years old in October 2020 with 95% coverage would reduce measles outbreak probability risk to 0% (0-11), 0% (0-12) and 0% (0-17) for coverage scenarios respectively in age-adjusted analysis. Even if RI coverage is impaired through to December 2021, the risk for a large measles outbreak would be mitigated through an SIA for under-fives if delivered before or immediately after contact restrictions are lifted ( Figure 4 ).Receipt of MCV delayed by 3 months in children resulted in a marginal increase in the risk of a large measles outbreak from introduction of a single infectious individual ( Figure S1 ).Predicted crude population immunity was slightly higher compared to age-adjusted immunity but followed the same declining trend over time ( Figure S3 ). Before contact restrictions came into place, 50% of simulations were below herd immunity threshold and by June 2021 and All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Our analysis suggests a decline in population immunity during COVID-19 pandemic will result in an increased risk of a measles outbreak depending on the extent to which routine vaccination coverage is reduced. We estimated the probability of a large measles outbreak from the introduction of a single infectious individual to be 26% (8-49), 33% (11-52), 40% (24-56) in October 2020 assuming a 15%, 50% or 100% reduction in routine measles vaccination coverage respectively since April 2020. This risk, which will increase to 28% (4-49), 35% (16-52) and 44% (29-57) by the end of the year will be greatly reduced if an SIA among children <5 years old is conducted before or immediately after all COVID-19 related restrictions on physical contact are lifted.We based our analysis on an immunity model that combined serological data and age-specific mixing patterns in Kenya. Combining the two is a better strategy for predicting outbreaks as opposed to using immunity profiles alone as it allows adjustment of overall immunity by taking into account contribution of each age-group to transmission. 17 As there is considerable uncertainty in actual reduction of routine vaccination uptake, we predicted population immunity for scenarios of routine vaccination coverage since April 2020 i.e. 15%, 50% and 100% reductions, and the corresponding outbreak risk. Our assumption of 15% reduction in vaccine coverage rates is based on reduction in vaccine clinic visits in Kilifi County (DHIS2 Routine Report) while the 50% reduction lies in the range of reported disruption in vaccination services from WHO immunisation pulse poll. 6 We assumed a 50% reduction in measles transmissibility given that COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented on 25th March 2020 were reported to have reduced social contacts and disease transmission by the same margin. 19 Although some restriction measures remain in place e.g. nationwide curfew, others like the partial lockdown have since been eased and ban on international flights was lifted on 1stAugust 2020. While the assumption of a 50% reduction in measles transmission was applicable at the beginning of the epidemic due to stringent measures imposed, current herd immunity threshold may be much higher than originally assumed but still lower than pre-COVID-19 threshold.All rights reserved.

Reduction in severity and timing of these outbreaks would be largely reduced if a measles vaccine campaign is delivered but it will also depend on time delay of catch-up campaigns and speed at which a campaign can be organised. In August 2020 for instance, an SIA would reduce outbreak risk to zero in all scenarios while in December 2020, outbreak risk would reduce to zero with an upper bound risk of 20% after delivery of SIA.The current disruption to vaccination services will cause further delays to vaccination, which is a challenge even in normal circumstances. We had previously reported consistently poor timeliness of MCV1 vaccination across 6 different birth-cohorts (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) in Kenya. 20 Here, a delay in age of MCV1 by 3 months resulted in a marginal increase in outbreak risk. For instance, assuming a 50% reduction in routine vaccination, a delay in vaccination would see the risk increase from 34% (15-51) to 41% (26-57) by the end of the year. This reiterates the importance of timeliness in administration of vaccines in children as even a slight delay may cause considerable immunity gaps. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Recently, measles outbreaks have been reported in five counties in Kenya 30 even with COVID-19 restrictions which suggests an adverse synergistic interaction between pre-existing gaps of susceptibility due to lower vaccination coverage rates (compared to national estimates) and a precipitous drop in RI coverage during this period. These outbreaks and our results are well aligned with recent Kenya measles outbreak risk assessment report and WHO guidance on catch up vaccination and closing the immunity gaps caused by COVID-19.As expected, majority of vaccine eligible children had protective antibody concentrations against measles but none of the 10 infants < 9 months old had protective concentrations. This suggests an extended period of susceptibility in young infants as a result of rapid maternal antibody decay. This phenomenon has been previously reported in areas where maternal immunity is increasingly from immunisation rather than natural infection. 31 A key strength of our study is availability of recent serological data which provides an excellent means of directly estimating levels of population protection against infection and can also be used to guide post-COVID-19 SIAs. In addition, availability of an age-mixing matrix from the same area allowed us to estimate overall immunity by taking into account the level of contact between different age-groups.Our study has a few limitations. Population immunity was only available for children <15 years but we varied observed immunity estimates in adults from a previous study in our model which resulted in a slight shift in overall immunity.

Interruptions to RI since the start of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Kenya have now widened the measles immunity gap, but associated risk of large measles outbreaks are partially mitigated if COVID-19 contact restrictions remain in place. As these measures are almost fully lifted, we estimate that measles outbreak risks will dramatically increase, necessitating an immediate SIA's to close the immunity gap.All rights reserved.

cbc2d76da1aae333c2397bf4cf579470a91ff49d,Simulating the progression of the COVID-19 disease in Cameroon using SIR models,"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China last November, presenting pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The first cases examined in China indicated that it was a new respiratory disease. However, The World Health Organization (WHO) began delivering the most recent discoveries related to this virus on January 7, 2020. By the end of January 2020, with the virus already spread to several countries, the WHO alerted the world, announcing that COVID-19 was an international sanitary crisis.On February 14, 2020, the WHO [1] reported the first confirmed case on the African continent in Egypt, and the Ministry of Public Health of Cameroon announced their first confirmed case on March 6, 2020 [2] . Following this announcement, the spread of the disease gradually increased within the population of Cameroon. Based on the current situation, there is a need to study the evolution of this virus and the efficiency of the measures adopted by local authorities to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Cameroon. The core of the article will give details on the successive steps that we followed for the forecasting exercise: collecting data from the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, designing and applying the model, performing simulations for varying rates of exposure and transmittance, and evaluating the results obtained. To explore the evolution of the coronavirus disease in Cameroon, the present paper uses data collected from the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health. According to the government, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected on March 6, 2020, in the capital, Yaoundé. The government decided to publish daily reports regarding the evolution of the disease including the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the number of deaths due to the virus, and the number of recoveries via public declaration. These daily declarations ended on April 10, 2020, which is why our dataset covers from March 6 to April 10. Fig 1 displays an overview of the evolution of the coronavirus disease in Cameroon during our period of study. It shows an exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases increases from 10 on March 17 to 820 on April 10, multiplying the total number of cases by 82 in less than a month. Moreover, the figure shows a slight increase in the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the country, from 1 on March 25 (the first death) to 12 on April 10. On the last day of our period of observation, the figure shows that the total number of recoveries from COVID-19 in Cameroon is 98, around 8 times more than the total number of deaths observed on the same date.To explore the evolution of the coronavirus disease in Cameroon, this paper uses a simple SIR (susceptible (S)-infectious (I)-recovered (R)) model known as a general stochastic epidemic model [3] [4] [5] [6] . This model is particularly suitable when dealing with a large population [7] . The initial model considers that individuals are at first Susceptible. If they are infected by the virus, they become immediately Infectious, and they remain infectious until they Recover, assuming immunity during the rest of the outbreak. In our paper, the last group was modified to ""Removed"" in order to account for the individuals who can no longer transmit the disease for reasons other than recovery, such as placement in quarantine, hospitalization, or dying from the virus [8] . To date (April 10, 2020), it is not certain whether, in the case of COVID-19, the recovered will be immunized for a very long period. In this paper, we assume that recovery confers immunity during the rest of the outbreak. We also assume that the population in our study is closed and that individuals mix uniformly in the community. Following Britton and Giardina [9] , we also assume that all individuals are equally susceptible to the disease and equally infectious if they get infected.

Thus, γ −1 refers to the average number of infectious days that an infected individual has to transmit the virus before being removed from the Infectious group (placed in quarantine, hospitalized, recovered, or died). During the infectious period, an individual has close contact with the rest of the population over the remaining time at a rate determined by the parameter β (also known as effective contact rate), which is the product of the average number of exposures per unit of time (τ) and the likelihood of infection at each occasion of exposure (μ) [3] .S(t), I(t), and R(t) respectively represent the number of susceptible, infectious, and removed individuals in the population at time t. Assuming that we have a closed population, the total population at time t is given as follows:Let's assume that at the beginning of the epidemic (S(0), I(0), R(0)) = (N-1, 1, 0) meaning that there is initially one infectious individual in the population and no removal. All other things being equal, the number of susceptible individuals decreases symmetrically by:Also, the variation in the number of people infected according to this measure is given by:The result is the following dynamic system, reflecting the generalized SIR Model:The simplicity of this dynamic system gives us rapid information on the rate of spread of the epidemic. Indeed, an epidemic occurs if the number of infected individuals increases continuously, i.e., dIAs highlighted by Jones [3] , at the outset of an epidemic, nearly everyone is susceptive. Thus, SðtÞ N can be approximated to 1 and the above equation can be written as:The parameter R 0 is called the basic reproduction rate. It is the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual during the infection period in a completely susceptible population [3, 10] . Regarding the value of the parameter, the severity of the epidemic can be summarized into two cases [11, 9] :• R 0 > 1: The Supercritical case. The epidemic increases exponentially: one infected individual infects more than one individual on average.• R 0 � 1: Critical case. No epidemic: the disease will surely die out without affecting a large share of the population Note that an R 0 > 1 does not always guarantee an epidemic in the population [12, 9] .To simulate the progression of the coronavirus disease in Cameroon, the next step consists in determining the parameters β and γ that best describe the current evolution of the virus in the country presented in section 2. For this step, knowing the period of observation, we chose to neglect the slight measures adopted by the Cameroonian local government to restrain the spread of the virus. The estimation is done using a Nelder-Mead and maximum likelihood optimization algorithm. The process implies finding β and γ in such a way that when these parameters are substituted in the equations described above, the difference between the data obtained and that recorded on the field is minimized. Computing β and γ using data recorded from March 6 to April 10 and a population of size N = 25,216,237. The results are summarized in Table 1 . The confidence intervals presented in the table are built using the distribution of the bootstrap realizations presented in the Appendix (Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4, Fig 5 and Fig 6) . Simulations conducted with the above parameters yield the results shown in Fig 7. All else unchanged, the evolution presented in Fig 7 should be a plausible scenario if no action is taken to reduce the spread of the virus. More precisely, the figure reveals that, if the situation remains as during the observed period (from March 6 to April 10), about 7.7% of the Cameroonian population might have ended up being infected, which is close to 2,015,200 individuals. In this case, the peak of the infection will occur between day number 78 and day number 85 starting from March 6, which is between 23th and 29th May. Additionally, assuming a rate of 15.8% of serious complications of the disease [13] approximately 318,402 Cameroonians might find themselves hospitalized in critical conditions. While considering a mortality rate of 3.4% (the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 announced by the WHO on March 3, 2020 [14] , the expected number of deaths due to coronavirus could be close to 68,517. Though these results might not be accurate, the approach gives a simple and quick means to figure out the evolution of the spread of the virus and paves the way for a better approach. Our model also suggests that the basic reproduction rate (R 0 ) of COVID-19 in Cameroon up to April 10 is about 1.567 persons, meaning that on average an infectious individual infects 1.567 susceptible individuals during his infection period.The question now is how can we flatten the infectious curve? What has been recommended since the beginning of this epidemic is to apply public health measures.Until an efficient medical treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is available, prevention and control strategies to reduce or stop the transmission of the disease only rely on measures adopted by public health officials. In this section, we model the effect of different public health interventions on the spread of the coronavirus disease in Cameroon.Physical or social distancing-keeping space between yourself and other people outside your home-plays a major role in public health interventions. Its objective is to reduce the probability of contact between infected individuals and susceptible ones to minimize the transmission of the disease. In practice, physical distancing [15] can be implemented by adopting the following habits:• Stay at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others • Do not gather in groups The main concern of public health interventions is to flatten the infectious curve. The shape of the infectious curve is a function of the effective contact rate β, which depends on the average number of exposures per unit of time (τ) and the likelihood of infection at each occasion of exposure (μ) (see section 3). Thus, adjusting τ and μ will influence the kinetics of the flattening curve [16] . More precisely, to simulate an increase in social or physical distancing, we can reduce the average number of exposures per day (τ), whereas, taking into consideration the hygiene measures, we can reduce the probability of infection at each occasion of exposure (μ).According to some studies on COVID-19, the probability of infection at each exposure varies from 1% to 5% [17] . In this paper, 5% is selected as the initial infection probability. As our parameter β = 0.6, we can estimate the initial average number of exposures per day to 12 exposures. Therefore, the goal of the public health interventions in Cameroon will be to progressively reduce the number of exposures (we will simulate using 12, 6, and 2 exposures per day) and the probability of infection (we will simulate using 5%, 2.5%, and 1%). The simulation was done using the R EpiModel package with a population of size N = 1,000 for computational matters [18] . Fig 8 gives the results.As we can see, a decrease in the number of exposures per day (from the left to the right on Fig 8) and a decrease in the likelihood of infection (from the top to the bottom of Fig 8) is associated with a flattening in the coronavirus epidemic curve. Furthermore, as the curve flattens, we can observe a decrease in the percentage of the population infected by the virus. Also, decreasing exposures per day or the infection probability prolongs the epidemic overall while slowing down the incidence rate.The present paper aims to analyze the evolution of the coronavirus disease in Cameroon. The study uses data collected by the Cameroonian health ministry between March 6 (date of the first confirmed case in the country) to April 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics show an exponential increase in the total number of infectious individuals. This gives a first idea of how the virus is spreading out in Cameroon. Starting from the natural evolution of the epidemic in the first days of propagation in the country, a SIR model was applied to the observed data. The results of the calibration show that, if actions undertaken by Cameroonians to fight against the coronavirus do not improve, the peak of the infection would occur at the end of May 2020, with about 7.7% of the Cameroonian population infected. Using the WHO mortality rate associated with COVID-19, the expected number of deaths due to the virus in Cameroon could be close to 70,000. At this time, and using the most recent information available for Cameroon to verify the accuracy of the modeling, one can observe that the epidemic indeed reached its peak at the end of May 2020, as suggested by the public health minister in an alarmist tweet on May 25 th [19] . For the first time on Twitter, the minister warned that the country was entering a complicated phase of the epidemic, and encourage preventive measures such as handwashing and wearing mask when going out. In later comments related to this tweet, he stated the peak was soon approaching [20] .However, by intensifying public health interventions, the epidemic curve could have flattened more, as suggested in the simulation. The results of the modeling seem to underline the value of appropriate communication campaigns from the government and the importance of the population's compliance with the public health measures recommended by the WHO to limit and stop the spread of the coronavirus disease, at least while waiting for possible preventive and/or curative treatments to be found. To date, some public measures have been taken by the Cameroonian government such as sensibilization through public media, shutting down schools, and the closing of public spaces and of some informal/formal businesses. However, these measures were relaxed just a few weeks after their execution due to their negative economic impact on most Cameroonian households. This quick renouncement to the measures may explain why the alarmist tweet of the health minister occurred exactly when the model predicted the peak without any intervention, precisely at the end of May [19] .Even though the paper has some limitations, such as the 'closed population' assumptions or the homogeneous mixture of the population (particularly across the geography of Cameroon), our model is particularly suitable while dealing with a large population of subjects, such as a human population observed at a country level [3] . We should also note that the basic reproduction rate, which is constant in this paper, may change depending on several variables (awareness of the population, intensity of trade, movement of people), and thus, create a timevarying basic reproduction rate [21, 22] . In all cases, knowing the paucity of the literature available for African countries, this paper enriches the knowledge by providing some quantitative evidence in support of the Cameroonian government's actions attempting to fight against the coronavirus. As an extension of this paper, studies with more sophisticated assumptions on the contact-matrix could be carried out (the matrix that accounts for the different interactions between the susceptible), as well as simulations showing, in parallel of the disease propagation, the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the Cameroonian population.Conceptualization: Ulrich Nguemdjo.

5f79606753f9818559ae6f2c4cedd3823ac17f2c,Harm reduction in an emergency response to homelessness during South Africa's COVID-19 lockdown,"Background COVID-19, as a novel, infectious disease, puts healthcare systems and healthcare service providers' front and centre of preparing and responding to the pandemic. However, and notwithstanding the primacy of medical science and clinical care, public health management by definition requires interdisciplinary, intersectoral and interagency cooperation [1] . This requirement is amplified in disasters and emergencies that emanate from pandemics.On 23 March 2020, the president of South Africa announced a 21-day national lockdown April, extended to 30 April) [2] . It followed from government's declaration of a national state of disaster on 15 March 2020 [3] that was triggered by the World Health Organisation's (WHO) [4] characterisation of COVID-19 as a pandemic (11 March 2020) and the identification and spread of infection in South Africa (Fig. 1) .Of particular note regarding lockdown is Regulation Section 11D [5] . It simultaneously mandates the state to create temporary shelters for the homeless and authorises enforcement officers to forcibly evacuate people to them in order to preserve their own and others' lives. It also mandates the provision of temporary sites to prevent transmission and enable treatment for people exposed to or infected with the new coronavirus who are unable to self-quarantine or self-isolate.In the 3 days before lockdown, while media attention focused on the frantic scramble for essential supplies by people with available income [6] , the announcement triggered an urgent effort to have a health and care response at municipal, district and facility level. Beginning 23 March 2020, the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Pretoria took several initiatives, including holding daily virtual COVID-19 pandemic response meetings to respond to the exigencies of sustaining essential primary healthcare in all projects and at all service sites.Participation in COVID-19 Family Medicine daily meetings draws on the existing multidisciplinary, multisectoral core of expertise of faculty and staff as well as not for profit and municipal, district and national government personnel. All participants are involved in healthcare research, education and service delivery at the university as well as in district and municipal facilities and projects. Collectively they combine years of clinical experience and expertise in providing generalist integrated community-oriented primary care [7] . They also are involved in best practice harm reduction and substance use management through the Community Oriented Substance Use Programme (COSUP) [8] implemented with the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality and Gauteng Department of Health's Tshwane District (South Africa). During the first COVID-19 daily meetings (23) (24) (25) (26) March 2020) the team identified seven priorities for action (Fig. 2) .Although the provision of an integrated primary health, substance use management response was anticipated ( Fig. 2: 5, 6 ) the need to create and provide services for people in temporary mass shelters was not foreseen. This is a case study of the Caledonian Stadium, the main mass temporary shelter created for homeless people in the City of Tshwane between 24 March and 3 April 2020.The objective of the article is to provide a qualitative, firsthand empirical account of the response to an emergency that emerged from the announcement of the COVID-19 lockdown.Using a narrative approach [9] , the content of the operational experiences of selected healthcare ""first responders"" is explored to gain an understanding of the immediate life-saving care that they and others provided and to uncover their continuous assessment of the nature and potential development of the emergency. Data are drawn from key informant interviews with three professionals directly involved in the organisation and delivery of COSUP services to the stadium population. Their accounts are supplemented by correspondence, meeting notes and memoranda, as well as standard operating procedures, guidelines, reports and official documents. In the process, situated, transient, partial and provisional knowledge was constructed into a narrative that makes sense of and creates order (chronological and categorical) about rapidly unfolding events [10] [11] [12] . Conversations and interviews with key informant experts were recorded or documented with the lead author and shared for review to ensure fact and portrayal accuracy. Primary documentary data (emails and WhatsApp™ messages) were sequenced and triangulated against interviewee accounts, official documents, internal and external reports and COVID-19 DFM daily meeting notes. Through repeated review of the data by the authors, the key elements of events were identified, organised and sequenced into a logical order and restoried.The three key informant experts are (1) the lead clinician (a postgraduate doctor specialising in family medicine) who was responsible for Caledonian shelter clinical service delivery, health screening and opioid substitution therapy (OST) prescription; (2) a clinical associate (midlevel medical professional) who supported OST screening and daily dosing; and (3) the COSUP stakeholder liaison officer who engaged with key government, university and third sector organisations before and during the lockdown.In the 3 days between the announcement of the lockdown and its implementation, COSUP and UP-DFM engaged in a series of meetings to plan a response to the lockdown. Internal meetings focused on identifying and working out how to render essential COSUP services. Meetings with partners focused on getting an understanding of the city's departmental responsibilities and plans and, especially, the expectations of social development, the lead agency responsible for sheltering the homeless. Particular concern was raised about meeting needs and ensuring humanitarian treatment of vulnerable populations during the disaster [13] .On the evening before the lockdown (26 March 2020), small groups of people started arriving at the Caledonian Stadium. They had heard that ""corona"" was coming and that they would have to be off the streets by the next day. They said they had been advised to come to the shelter by city and other community workers. They came of their own volition, because they were scared and did not want to get sick. They also did not want to be locked up or sent ""home"" by the police [13, 14] .The stadium, a long neglected, city-owned facility without electricity and connected sewerage [15] , was barely prepared. That evening, when the acting Provincial Member of the Executive for Social Development (Gauteng Province) arrived on site, provincial tents had been offloaded but not erected and there were water trucks and chemical toilets, but no lighting, mattresses, blankets or personal hygiene kits. Furthermore, there was no site management in place, although there was a small municipal police presence [13] .While some people continued to drift in throughout the night, by the morning (27 March 2020) they were arriving in significant numbers. Many walked from shelters, parks and derelict building ""homeless hotspots"" around town. On that first day of the lockdown, the South African Police Service 1 also began dropping off people whom they found walking to the stadium from the suburbs and townships around the city [13] .Tents were being set up and, although the bedding was ordered by city officials, no mattresses and only about 240 blankets arrived. No one took charge of ensuring that the shelter was organised to address COVID-19 public health requirements, manage resident intake or inform people about what to expect and do. The scale of the influx of people was completely unanticipated [13] .As the day progressed, people with opioid dependence became increasingly agitated as they struggled to deal with withdrawal [13, 16] . To respond to an untenable situation, the Head of the Department of Family Medicine undertook to lead a coordinated district, municipal and not-for-profit healthcare response through COSUP in Tshwane [17] . A clinical team was redirected to the stadium, while COSUP continued to provide essential services at pre-existing sites that included moving stable OST clients from daily observed treatment to weekly take home dosing and initiating a mobile OST service [18] . In anticipation of increased need to manage withdrawal, they also obtained permission from the city to procure additional methadone [19] .Early on Saturday morning (28 March 2020), a small COSUP clinical team created a make shift service point outside the stadium. With the help of the municipal police, people who were withdrawing or in need of medical care came forward. For each person, the clinical team did a health intake and general substance use screening, followed by a consultation. Clients with a history of opioid use and clinical signs of withdrawal (as measured on the clinical opiate withdrawal scale) were given low initiation doses of methadone (20-30 mg) without baseline urinalysis. They wrote scripts, fetched medicines and administered directly observed treatment for those in need of methadone. Equipped with surgical masks, gloves and hand wash, they worked ""on the fly"" through a seemingly never-ending queue of people crushing up against the gazebo [16] . Municipal police broke up fights and helped keep order, and the city community development workers helped disinfect the spoons used to administer methadone. Social development personnel were present, albeit observing from their cars. Several had expressed their opposition to a harm reduction approach to substance use [14, 16] . At the end of 7 h of uninterrupted service, the team debriefed, shared out their handwritten records and went home to capture the data onto an electronic spreadsheet for use in the morning.After considerable effort on the part of the Tshwane Homelessness Forum [20] , the city head of Social Development convened a Homelessness Task Team with them, COSUP and relevant divisional management representatives [13] . The task team adopted the provincially endorsed COVID-19 shelter plan developed by the Tshwane Homelessness Forum and formalised COSUP's role in COVID-19 screening, OST treatment and intake registration [13] .On the 29th of March, the stadium remained unmanaged. The numbers of people fluctuated, with an ebb and flow of people around meal time and COSUP clinical services. There was considerable overcrowding; people were not assigned places to sleep; there were no visible handwashing facilities; and the few toilets that were there were not being adequately serviced. Also, there was no place to separate anyone with respiratory symptoms, including those with TB [21] .After a family medicine operational review of COSUP sites [13] , the Caledonian clinical team was reinforced by three post-graduate family medicine registrars. Armed with additional human resources and a better understanding of the tasks of the day ahead, the COSUP clinical team created two service stations. They split the queue between people who had been given methadone the previous day and those who needed to be screened or required other services. While they queued inside the stadium gates, each person completed a form to indicate the service they wanted [13, 16] .A number of Caledonian residents voluntarily assisted with patient flow, releasing people in groups of 10 and arranging chairs for them to wait to see a doctor or receive their supervised methadone dose. Together with city community development workers, they also supported physical distancing and handwashing at the stations [16] .Although the start of services was delayed until municipal police arrived to maintain crowd control, the COSUP stadium clinical team was able to get through the queue by the end of the afternoon. By obtaining methadone in sufficient quantities to meet demand, they were able to significantly reduce the time spent going back and forth to the pharmacy to fill scripts. Also, the use of measuring cups made dosing easier and quicker [14] .In response to the SAPS Joint Operations Command directive that all homeless people were to be in shelters and that they would assist by supporting the process of shelter creation, COSUP and the Tshwane Homeless Forum advised on the size and composition of other temporary shelters, finalised protocols on intake and screening and mobilised partner organisations (Harmless and the Foundation for Professional Development) to provide additional clinical support [13, 22] .On Monday, 30 March, media reports of dire conditions and disgruntlement at the shelter [23] , led to a city management decision to enforce access control and restrict movement to better comply with the lockdown regulations [16] . At the time, there were between 1800 and 2000 people residing there.The Caledonian clinical team continued to provide OST services outside the main gates and were able to meet the daily demand for methadone, even though many people were coming into the stadium from outside and several were trying to double dose. On site, with assistance from a Tshwane Homelessness Forum pastor to attend to people's welfare needs, the COSUP team became the de facto face of care. The team, however, was still too small and lacked the space and resources to attend to people's other physical and mental health needs. They were unable to provide a full harm reduction package of care. Harmless, the organisation with the largest needle and syringe service in the city was asked to hold off as municipal and national police were actively confiscating needles and the city regarded the concurrent provision of needle and syringe services and OST as a form of mixed messaging. There also were no social development personnel to assist with basic social services and family contacting [16, 21] . COSUP and other Homelessness Task Team members spent the day working with partners to identify alternative COVID-19 shelters. Although many public, private, faith-based and non-governmental organisations wanted to assist, few were able to comply with the public and personal health stringencies of COVID-19. Two immediately available sites were identified, and the team worked through the night to set them up as shelters [13] .On the 31st of March, the COSUP clinical team was instructed by the city to deliver services inside the stadium to prevent ""walk-ins"" off the street accessing OST. The clinical team felt unsafe to set up stations inside, as over the previous days they had observed municipal police personnel to be insufficiently trained to deal with crowds [16] . The metro police did not arrive and the person responsible for the stadium management did not respond to their request for security and crowd control assistance [13] .The planned staggered re-sheltering of people at the Caledonian and other congested shelters also began that day. The first group of 431 men and women who were not receiving OST were bussed to two new shelters. The remainder were re-sheltered in batches over the next 6 days at newly created, smaller facilities (Table 1) .From 1 April onwards, the Caledonian clinical team delivered OST and other services from within the stadium. Space had been provided, but municipal police were only present at the beginning of the day and it was hard to create an orderly flow. These sub-optimal working conditions were made worse by a drop in temperature and insufficient tents; people were sleeping in groups at the entrance to shield themselves from the wind [24] .At the same time, the COSUP team involved in procuring methadone had to overcome pockets of bureaucratic resistance to its use for withdrawal management as well as difficulties in accessing it in sufficient quantities to meet demand [25] .On 2 April, the team saw 31 new clients. Most had been brought to the stadium by the police the previous evening, despite a directive to not do so. In the face of long queues, poor environmental and COVID-19 compliance at the site, and the impossibility of attending to the general health and wellbeing of residents, the COSUP clinical team urged that the process of resheltering be speeded up [21] .On 4 April, heavy rains flooded tents and washed people out of their sleeping places. The clinical team was forced to provide healthcare services to cold and drenched residents in a crowded narrow passage [16] . Over the next day and a half, the remainder of Caledonian residents were moved to alternative sites and the shelter was closed on 6 April.During the period of re-sheltering, COSUP and the University of Pretoria's Department of Family Medicine began to provide integrated primary healthcare at the 24 (8 permanent, 16 temporary) shelters in the city. Over and above providing OST to manage withdrawal, clinical care returned to an integrated community-oriented primary care approach to address acute and chronic conditions including infections, injuries, TB, HIV and mental health as well as the potential threat of COVID-19 in the homeless and substance-using populations [26] . However, needle and syringe service delivery was not permitted.The Caledonian Stadium emergency shelter is the outcome of an emergent emergency [27] . Arising rapidly and unexpectedly from complex, often unpredictable processes, the emergency was triggered by the decision to lockdown the country to contain COVID-19. Notwithstanding ministerial, National Department of Health and WHO Africa Office efforts to mobilise government COVID-19 preparedness in the 6 weeks before the declaration of a National State of Disaster [28] , the challenges of responding to the combination of homelessness and dependence on substances was neither foreseen nor planned for. Unlike preparation that is always anticipatory and hypothetical, this is not exceptional in emergencies, because responding to them is concrete, material and immediate [27] .This account tells a story of bottom-up selforganisation. Amid a chaotic and rapidly evolving environment, a network of organisations and actors coalesced to respond to the emergency through an effort to provide shelter, food and healthcare.Among the many differences in focus and priorities, the needs of people with opioid dependence took centre stage. In part, this was because of the imperative of managing the unpleasant physical, mental and social side effects of withdrawal from opioids, including elevated temperature, increased respiratory rate, anxiety, nausea and diarrhoea, tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, tearing, runny nose and bone and muscle pain. Given many similarities with COVID-19 symptoms, it was important to ensure that withdrawal was not confused with or masked novel coronavirus infection. There also was a need to prevent the risk of fatal overdose, given the known loss of opioid tolerance even after a relative short period of abstinence [29] .Many lockdown responders were opposed to COSUP's harm reduction approach to substance use and the need for OST. They had no grasp of the scale and physical effects of opioid dependence nor were they able to propose any practical options for the hundreds of people struggling with withdrawal inside and outside the stadium. In contrast, by providing methadone, COSUP's clinical interventions reduced volatility and tension at the shelters and prevented fatal overdoses among clients across the city. The provision of methadone also served as a way into harm reduction, even though the emergency nature of the situation made it impossible to provide several essential harm reduction components, follow standard OST protocols or provide integrated HIV, TB, viral hepatitis or other chronic disease detection, treatment adherence and support.Rendering a focused heathcare service alongside safely re-sheltering people in the midst of the lockdown required the deliberate nurturing of established relationships and the mobilisation of cooperation and collaborative practices among key organisations and individuals. Through a steady flow of communication, a diverse network of actors and skills were mobilised to respond to problems as they arose.However, the critical issue of communication with the people living in the shelter was overlooked entirely. This added to the levels of anxiety and uncertainty among shelter residents, since they were not informed about the work being done, the challenges being faced or the plans being made. Also, even though several individuals came forward of their own volition to help, the population itself was insufficiently informed about or mobilised to protect their health and the health of others. More generally, by demonstrating an effective response to street homelessness and substance use disorder under exceptional conditions, the Caledonian stadium experience made evident to policy makers and practitioners the possibility and necessity of providing shelter and healthcare services to homeless people and people who use drugs in ""normal"" times. As a consequence, a combined comprehensive approach to deliver services to these populations is being planned for longterm implementation by the city, the university and the relevant partner organisations.The Caledonian Stadium story also talks to the portentous challenges of public and individual health in the COVID-19 pandemic. COSUP and other partners repeatedly warned of the inadequacy of the setup, layout and provision of essential utilities to ensure basic public health. Although there were no instances of COVID-19 among residents or healthcare providers, this was due mainly to chance and the stage of the epidemic in the city during lockdown. Had the epidemic been more advanced, the fact of the matter is that the creation of a poorly managed, inadequately prepared mass shelter would have been the perfect petri dish to culture the pandemic in the city. Equally, had the Department of Family Medicine and its partners not been able to surmount the multitude of bureaucratic, policy and personal belief barriers to providing methadone to manage withdrawal and prevent heroin overdose, the emergent emergency could have become a socially explosive, personal disaster for thousands of vulnerable city residents.This account of the first 2 weeks of work has several limitations. By definition, it is partial both in terms of perspective and in time. The voices of other responders as well as the people coming in and outside the shelter would enrich the narrative. The story, too is still unfolding as the lockdown and the pandemic are far from over. Lastly, in the immediacy of the response data inevitably are partial and in places inconsistent, but the experience, threads and lessons override these gaps.The story of the Caledonian shelter is an account of organisational resilience in the face of a dual emergency around shelter and substance use that was triggered by the lockdown on 27 March 2020. Over 2 weeks, the Department of Family Medicine, through COSUP, navigated a clinically led, bottom-up, collaborative response to address the immediate needs of people who are homeless and may or may not use drugs in the City of Tshwane. Time, resources and urgency all combined to compress services in the emergency warp, until things were more stabilised. Through this response to contain the disruptive potential of an emergent emergency, a better, more sustainable COVID-19 intervention evolved. The key lessons learnt were the importance of communicating with people directly affected by emergencies, the value of using methadone to reduce harms during emergencies and the imperative of including OST in essential primary healthcare.interventions require a harm reduction approach that is bottom-up, inclusive, collaborative and multisectoral. 2. OST and related harm reduction services need to be enabled and applied. 3. It is critical to foreground communication with people directly affected by emergencies as well as those responding to them. 4. Best practice clinical therapy in opioid dependence, including in emergencies, needs to enable and apply OST and related harm reduction services. 5. The provision of essential comprehensive mental and physical healthcare for vulnerable populations during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic is an imperative.Abbreviations COSUP: Community Oriented Substance Use Programme; WHO: World Health Organisation; OST: Opioid substitution therapy",South Africa,abstract,2020-08-24,08
c9e60dfe0bada604b84eb844fd526d734e50b132,Journal Pre-proof Translation of genomic epidemiology of infectious pathogens: Enhancing African genomics hubs for outbreaks Translation of genomic epidemiology of infectious pathogens; enhancing African genomics hubs for outbreaks,"Deadly emerging infectious pathogens place unprecedented challenge on health systems and economies, especially across Africa where health care infrastructures are weak, and poverty rates remain high. Genomic technologies have been vital in enhancing the understanding and development of intervention approaches against these, such as Ebola, and recently the novel coronavirus disease 2019 .Africa has contributed a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the global pool in growing open access repositories. To bridge this gap, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) is coordinating initiatives across the continent to establish genomic hubs in selected well-resourced African centres of excellence. This will allow for standardisation, efficient and rapid data generation and curation. However, the strategy to ensure capacity for high-throughput genomics at selected genomics hubs should not overshadow the deployment of portable, field-friendly and technically less demanding genomics technologies in all affected countries. This will enhance small scale local genomic surveillance in outbreaks, leaving validation and large-scale approaches at central genomic hubs.The ACDC needs to scale-up its campaign for government support across African Union countries to ensure sustainable financing of its strategy for increased pathogen genomic intelligence and other interventions in current and inevitable future epidemics in Africa.COVID-19, Africa, GISAID, ACDC, genomic hubs.The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 30 th January J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f integrate this into our decision making processes on managing COVID-19 outbreak within the continent. This set back is primarily due to limited skillset and infrastructure deficiencies (Devex 2020) . Till date, only 900 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 14 African countries are represented out of a total of 62,267 whole-genome sequences uploaded in GISAID (GISAID 2020); an online database for the rapid sharing of most viral genomes, clinical and epidemiological data. Africa has recorded approximately 642, 387 cases and close to 10,789 deaths from COVID-19 (WHO 2020a). This significantly outnumber the available African SARS-CoV-2 genomes, putting the continent at disadvantage in global genetic epidemiology studies of SARS-CoV-2 and consideration in design of vaccines that would provide broad potency against all virus strains circulating in the continent. The above narrative could be different if each country appreciated the need for genetic data and deliberately empower at least one molecular laboratory involved in COVID-19 detection and diagnostics with sequencing technologies. The transition to sequencing viral genomes could adopt cost-effective, easily deployable and portable sequencing platforms with less restricted access to reagents and readily available protocol sharing global networks.It is evident that during an epidemic or a pandemic, most countries close their land borders and airspace to restrict movement and curb the spread of the infectious pathogen. Therefore, if viral sequencing platforms are not available in-country, they would have to rely on shipping samples to other laboratories in order to generate sequences. This makes real-time contribution to the global sequences challenging and unrealistic. Therefore, while ACDC aims for a coordinated, centralised approach for high throughput next-generation sequencing using platforms such as the Next-seq and Hi-Seq, consideration for generation of moderate quality data using Miseq, capillary electrophoresis and Nanopore technology should be prioritised. This model has been tested in the United Kingdom with reported success stories (GenomicsEngland 2017).Lack of concerted financial commitment, skilled personnel and advanced infrastructure are top amongst the many hurdles facing biomedical science research in Africa (Omoleke et al. 2018; Gilbert et al. 2020) . Unlike in the global North, capacities are heterogeneous with wide differences between most sub-Saharan African countries and South Africa for Example.Moreover, research activities are hardly coordinated across borders, disallowing meaningful continental approaches. This is largely driven by lack of political will and buy-in by various African Center for Disease Control. Besides data generating platforms, there is also an acute shortage of expertise in genetic and genomic data analysis and interpretation for translation into public health interventions. This lack of trained human capacity has resulted in heavy reliance on research collaborators and donor funding from the global North for limited quality and valid data outputs. Hence, the benefit of using genetic epidemiology data in real-time to inform policy is currently largely unrealistic. The ACDC has taken up a continental, coordinated perspective to define strategies that will address some of the challenges impeding derivation of full benefit from currently available technologies that facilitate interventions against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging pathogens (ACDC 2020). The big picture is the setting up of centralised genomics laboratory hubs, coordinated by the Pathogen Genomics Intelligence Institute (ACDC 2020). The main goal is to strengthen and link health systems with these institutions for effective surveillance, detection, tracking and monitoring outbreaks before they occur across the continent. To substantiate their effort, Illumina, one of the leading genomics companies, has donated $1.4 million in equipment, software, and reagents to the region through the ACDC (Devex 2020). 7 of already establish centres such as the European and American CDCs to put in place regulation and structures that will facilitate and sustaine cross-border collaborative platforms for more robust epidemic preparedness, readiness and response across the continent in the near future.Despite the efforts of Africa CDC towards centralised genomic hubs, a situation analysis of continental needs and priority areas in epidemic preparedness and genomic intelligence is required. The current state of institutions, infrastructure and human resources for data generation, management and analysis need urgent attention. In the event of epidemics such as COVID-19, genomic data generation for real-time decision making could be enhanced by the adoption and decentralised application of small, portable, easily operated experimental tools such as Oxford Nanopore technology-MinION sequencer, Illumina MiniSeq or the BGI-DNBSeq across all countries. These easily deployable, user-friendly field-based technologies were very instrumental in the sequencing of the Ebola virus (EBOV) during the last outbreak in west and central Africa (Arias et al. 2016; Hoenen et al. 2016; Quick et al. 2016) . Data generated were useful in strategizing and ensuring the efficacy of interventions, including tracking and stopping the spread of EBOV and to evaluate vaccine efficacy.Already established genomics hubs strategically located in the four geographic regions (West, East, South and North) of the continent could collate samples from each country for validation and high throughput production of data since they have the requisite technical expertise and infrastructure. In this regard, standardised operating procedures, quality-assured operations, and data curation strategy can be assured and disseminated as well. This can provide the benchmark for future comparative data analysis.To build on its current gains, the ACDC should engage in a massive campaign for stronger political commitment from member states in funding genomics as a tool for surveillance and monitoring disease outbreaks. Better engagement approaches will enable government buyand ensure the financial strength and sustainability of established genomics institutions towards rapid containment of emerging infectious disease epidemics.",Nigeria,abstract,2020-08-13,08
4740e61066791dbebf806ce45d196e31bdc45acb,R E V I E W A Review on Novel Drug Targets and Future Directions for COVID-19 Treatment,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) sustains to spread swiftly across the globe. As of July 26, 2020, more than 16.2 million confirmed cases were reported from 213 countries. 1 To date, deaths have surpassed 648,866. 1 Currently, some clinical studies reported the use of a few drugs in severe cases. Of these, the steroid dexamethasone improves survival in severe cases of COVID-19. 2 In addition, another study revealed that compassionate use of remdesivir produced clinical improvement in 68% of hospitalized patients with severe cases of COVID-19, though measurement of efficacy requires ongoing randomized, placebo controlled trials. 3 In the face of all this burden, researchers were looking for the identification of potential drug targets to SARS-COV-2. Most recent findings give strong attention to proteins which are involved in viral nucleic acid synthesis and replication, structural proteins that have a role in viral entry and fusion, virulence factors, host-specific receptors and enzymes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and immune response modulating signaling pathways. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Therefore, the following sections dwell on the aforementioned targets, physiological features, structural makeup and some pipeline antiviral drugs.These proteins are getting the current and future attention as drug targets for COVID-19 treatment. Among them, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), papain-like protease (PLpro), and helicase are the most considered targets for the discovery of different therapeutic agents due to their clear vital enzyme active site and biological functions. 4RdRp also known as Nsp12 is a conserved protein in COVID-19 which is an essential enzyme for RNA transcription and replication of this virus. The RdRp domain of polymerase is located at the C-terminus, and has a conserved Ser-Asp-Asp motif. 4 Enzymatic activity and binding of Nsp12 to RNA is increased by the Nsp7-Nsp8 complex. 5, 6 On the other hand, inhibition of RdRp is one of the antiviral drug development strategies, and clinical drugs as well as new compounds are tested for their effect on it. Drugs like favipiravir, ribavirin, penciclovir, remdesivir, galidesivir, itraconazole, novobiocin, chenodeoxycholic acid, cortisone, idarubicin, silybin, pancuronium bromide, dabigatran etexilate 6ʹ-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues, acyclovir, and fleximer analogues exhibited RdRp inhibition. 7 In principle, selective inhibition of RdRp by these agents could not cause significant side effects and toxicity on host cells. 8 In addition, natural compounds and their derivatives with anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and antivirus effects such as gnidicin and gniditrin from Gnidia lamprantha, and betulonal from Cassine xylocarpa showed high binding affinity to RdRp with promising anti-COVID-19 activity, though further investigations are needed. 9PLpro exists in all coronaviruses and has been found to be vital for the release of non-structure proteins 1, 2, and 3 from the N-terminal part of polyproteins 1a and 1ab. 10 In addition, the PLpro of SARS-COV has been shown to have deubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities, thus preventing interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and blocking the nuclear factor-j-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFjB) pathway. 11 This enzyme is considered to be a potential antiviral drug target. Clinically known protease inhibitors such as disulfiram, lopinavir, and ritonavir have been reported to be active against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV). 12, 13 Despite the lack of clinical evidence, disulfiram has been revealed to inhibit MERS and SARS papain-like protease in cell cultures. On the other hand, clinical trials have been initiated to test ritonavir and lopinavir in patients infected with COVID-19. 14 These drugs were initially assumed to inhibit SARS and MERS 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, and appeared to be associated with SARS patients' improved clinical outcomes in a nonrandomized open-label trial. Nevertheless, it is debatable whether these drugs could effectively inhibit COVID-19 papain-like and 3-chymotrypsin-like proteases. 14 Besides, a study reported that 6-thioguanine (6TG) and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) inhibit SARS-COV PLpro. 15 Helicases are universal motor proteins that separate and/or rearrange duplexes of nucleic acid in reactions driven by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 16 Nsp13, a superfamily 1 helicase, is a multi-functional protein with an N-terminal metal binding domain (MBD) and a helicase domain (Hel). The N-terminal forms a Zn binding domain while the C-terminal forms a helicase domain with a conserved motif, and participate in unravelling double-stranded (ds) DNA and RNA of the virus along the 5′-3′ direction in a nucleoside triphosphate-dependent manner. A study reports that Nsp13 dependent unravelling is an essential process for the replication, transcription, and translation of SARS-COV-2. 17 Therefore, helicases are promising anti-COVID-19 drug targets. Different scientific literature has recently reported various potent inhibitors of helicases encoded by SARS-COV-2. Some inhibitors like bananins, 5-hydroxychromone derivative, ADKs, and SSYA10-001 are under preclinical studies for the treatment of SARS-COV-2. 18 3CLpro (Nsp5) mediates Nsps maturation, which is vital for the life cycle of the virus. 3CLpro is first cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes, and then further cleaves downstream Nsps at 11 sites to release Nsp4-Nsp16. 19 In-depth investigation of the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3CLpro makes 3CLpro an interesting target for anti-COVID-19 drug development. Peptide inhibitors and small-molecule inhibitors are targeting 3CLpro of SARS-COV. 20 Velpatasvir, ledipasvir, lymecycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, nicardipine, telmisartan, conivaptan, and montelukast exhibited highest binding affinity to 3CLpro. 20 In silico studies revealed that bepotastine, colistin, epirubicin, valrubicin, icatibant, epoprostenol, vapreotide, caspofungin, aprepitant, and perphenazine also bind to the lopinavir/ritonavir-binding site on SARS-COV. 21 The Viral Structural Proteins Spike ProteinThe genome of beta-coronavirus encodes many structural proteins, including the glycosylated spike (S) protein which is a major inducer of host immune responses. 22 The spike protein is a clove-shaped type I-transmembrane protein. This protein has three segments. These are: the ectodomain (ED) region, transmembrane region, and intracellular domain. The intracellular domain comprises the intracellular short tail part, the receptor binding S1 domain (three S1 heads), and the membrane fusion subunit S2 (trimeric stalk) on the C-terminal together with the ED. 23, 24 Membrane fusion and virus entry activation require the cleavage at the junction of S1-S2. Hence, due to its vital role in the interaction between the virus and the cell receptor, spike protein is an important potential target for antiviral agents. 25 Consequently, monoclonal antibodies targeting the S1 subunit and fusion inhibitors targeting the S2 subunit may be effective therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19 infections. A serine endoprotease, furin, cleaves off S1-S2 and, thus, could be a suitable anti-COVID-19 agent. 26 A red-algaderived lectin, griffithsin, binds to SARS-COV spike glycoprotein and HIV glycoprotein 120. 27 As a result, griffithsin has been tested for HIV prevention in Phase I studies as a gel or an enema and produced promising effect. However, the delivery systems and potency of S inhibitors in general should be re-evaluated for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. 27 In addition, nafamostat which is under clinical investigation for COVID-19 treatment inhibits spikemediated membrane fusion of the virus. Moreover, Yang et al revealed that, in a mouse model, a DNA vaccine encoding the full-length S protein SARS-COV urbani strain could induce both the responses of protective immunity and production of neutralizing antibody by the T cells. 28 The E (envelope) protein is the smallest transmembrane structural protein of coronaviruses. 29 Two different domains constitute the E protein: the charged cytoplasmic tail and the hydrophobic domain. The E protein possesses vital biological functions for the structural integrity coronaviruses and host virulence. 30 The other structural protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, is conserved across different members of the coronavirus families. 31 The most important function of the N protein N-terminal domain (NTD) is binding of RNA, while the primary function of the C-terminal domain (CTD) is dimerization. 31, 32 On the other hand, the main function of the membrane (M) protein is maintenance of the shape of the viral envelope. It performs this activity by interacting with other coronavirus proteins, incorporating Golgi complex into new virions, and stabilizing of N protein. 33 Therefore, E, N, and M proteins can be considered as targets for the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. Many antiviral, anti-bacterial, anti-asthmatic, anti-inflammatory. and anti-tumor drugs were found to have comparatively good affinity to these targets, thereby inhibiting the viral replication in the host cells. Moreover, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed strong binding affinity for 220-241 and 460-480 regions of M protein mRNA. 9Based on the result of many findings, the host ACE2 has been evidenced to be the specific receptor for the spike RNA binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV. 34 A recent study shows that the host receptor of SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV. In addition, the spike RBD sequence of SARS-COV-2 is also found to be nearly identical to SARS-COV RBD. Moreover, an interaction between the key amino acid residue of RBD receptorbinding motif and ACE2 is an important process for anti-COVID-19 drug development. 34 According to the present research progress, ACE2 is considered as a host target for the discovery of COVID-19 therapy. Clinical drugs such as troglitazone, losartan, ergotamine, cefmenoxime, and silybin were found to bind with ACE2 receptor with low energy. 35 On the other hand, the enzyme transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), triggers the infection of SARS-COV and MERS-COV by cutting the viral spike protein. 35 Inhibiting the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2 can prevent some coronaviruses from entering into host cells. To this effect, pivampicillin, hetacillin, cefoperazone, clindamycin, kouitchenside I, phyllaemblicin G7,Wondmkun and MohammedBiologics: Targets and Therapy 2020:14 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress and neoandrographolide are predicted to be potential inhibitors of TMPRSS2. 36A study showed that coronaviruses have three virulence factors which are Nsp1, Nsp3c, and ORF7a that interfere with the host's innate immunity and assist virus immune escape. 37 Nsp1 interacts with the host 40S ribosomal subunit that triggers mainly host mRNA degradation and also inhibits production of type-I interferon. 37 On the other hand, Nsp3c has the ability to bind with the host's adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose to help coronaviruses to resist host innate immunity. 38 ORF7a directly binds to bone marrow matrix antigen 2 (BST-2) and inhibits its activity by blocking the glycosylation of BST-2. 39 BST-2 is responsible for inhibition of the release of newlyassembled coronaviruses from host cells. These evidences suggest that Nsp1, Nsp3c, and ORF7a may be potential targets for anti-COVID-19 drug development. 40 Studies showed that many of the clinical drugs and natural products with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, such as piperacillin, cefpiramide, streptomycin, lymecycline, and tetracycline, exhibited relatively high binding affinity to these three target proteins. 41Cytokines are glycoproteins that play as chemical signals in the immune response to pathogen. Our immune cells produce so many cytokines in the body. Out of these, the pro-inflammatory cytokines have deleterious impact when they are released in response to viruses like SARS-COV-2. SARS-COV-2 infects the lower and upper respiratory tract and causes mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6. 41 Its binding to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the lung commonly causes the release of pro-IL-1β which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1β that is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever, and fibrosis. 42 Pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 suppression are expected to produce a therapeutic effect in COVID-19. This could be achieved by non-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-37 and IL-38. IL-37 has the capability to inhibit inflammation by binding to IL-18Ra receptor, and suppress molecules of class II histocompatibility complex, IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrotic factor. 43,44 IL-37 suppresses IL-1β in an inflammatory state induced by COVID-19 to produce a novel therapeutic effect. Similarly, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, IL-38, is also a suppressor cytokine which interferes with IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory IL-family members. Moreover, it inhibits inflammation in viral infections including that caused by COVID-19, to be considered as a potential therapeutic cytokine. 45 Furthermore, the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is a key signaling mechanism for many types of cytokines, and essential to cellular response to exogenous signals in the immune system. JAK inhibitors exhibited a significant role in inhibiting and blocking cytokine release. 46 Potent and selective JAK-STAT signaling inhibitors baricitinib, fedratinib, and ruxolitinib are reported to be effective against the impacts of the higher levels of cytokines (including interferon-γ) particularly observed in patients with COVID-19. 47 Besides, inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1a and tylophorine-based compounds showed anti-COVID-19 activities in different studies. 46, 48 In the near future, vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, and nucleic acid-based therapies targeting viral structural glycoproteins, papain-like protease, RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, helicases, IL-1, IL-6, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways should be developed to prevent and treat COVID-19. Despite the current development and various recently reported drug repositioning studies, there is no as such potent and selective approved drug for COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, more investigations are clearly need to be done soon enough to get rid of the catastrophic impacts of COVID-19. Indeed, ongoing in silico and preclinical investigations on different compounds are being carried out by research companies. But, still rapid clinical trials on these compounds and further investigations of novel compounds are needed unequivocally. Finally, vaccine development by considering the above mentioned targets is an indispensable task.COVID-19, coronavirus disease-2019; 3CLpro, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease; E, envelope; JAK/STAT, Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription; M, membrane protein; N, nucleocapsid protein; Nsp, non-structure protein; PLpro, papain-like protease; RdRp, RNA-dependence RNA polymerase; SARS-COV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; S, spike.",Ethiopia,first author,2020-08-25,08
23968f63dd793a7824cee64fe97b844c52f94539,Interest of the thoracic scanner in the diagnosis of COVID-19: study of 35 cases in the Republic of Guinea Interest of the thoracic scanner in the diagnosis of COVID-19: study of 35 cases in the Republic of Guinea,"A series of pneumonias caused by coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019 with unprecedented expansion in the rest of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus epidemic a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [1] . To date, there are 7,495,776 cases worldwide [2] with 4258 positive cases recorded to date in Guinea Conakry [3] . In contrast to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MRS), asymptomatic patients with COVID- 19 have been reported to be contagious [4] . COVID-19's transmission capacity may be greater than that of SARS. SARS CoV-2 can be easily transmitted from person to person through close contact, droplets and aerosols [5, 6] . The most common symptoms of VCOS-RAS-2 infection include fever; cough; myalgia; physical asthenia; and less common symptoms such as productive cough; hemoptysis; and diarrhea [7, 8] . The incubation period is 5.1 days [9] . Thus, early diagnosis and immediate isolation of positive patients are crucial to break the chain of transmission and thus control the epidemic. To date, the polymerase chain reaction retro-transcriptase (RT-PCR) is the Gold Standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, there is a high rate of false negatives, and a shortage of RT-PCR, resulting in delayed diagnosis and loss of cases in our context. Apart from the clinical presentation, chest lesions visible on a chest CT scan are essential for early diagnosis and evaluation of the disease [10] as they allow COVID-19-induced pneumonia to be quickly distinguished from other viral pneumonias. The typical CT involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia consists of bilateral, peripheral subpleural, often posterior and basal frosted glass areas [11] . In this study, we analyzed 35 patients with symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 and diagnosed positive on chest CT despite negative RT-PCR test. The aim of the work is to expose the advantage of thoracic computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to establish its systematization in front of any suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 in Guinea.It was a retrospective study carried out over a period of 2 months from 30 March to 30 May 2020. It involved all patients (3415) presenting symptoms of SARS-Cov-2 infection and followed up at the national centre for the fight against infectious pathologies in Conakry. Only those (35) who performed a chest CT scan without injection of contrast material while awaiting the result of the RT-PCR test were included. Not included are those who did or did not perform a chest CT scan after confirmation of the diagnosis by RT-PCR. The clinical data analyzed were age, sex, COVID-19 infectivity, comorbidity, symptoms, and chest CT results. All images were consistently analyzed by a certified respirologist and chest radiologist. Patient data were collected and analyzed using STATA/SE version 11.2 software. Anonymity without implying any potential risk to patients and in compliance with the ethical rules in agreement with the National Health Security Agency (ANSS) was the norm. There was no connection between patients and researchers.Of the 35 patients followed in this study, 23 were male with an M/F sex ratio of 1.92. The mean age of the patients was 41 ± 9.034 years. The anamnesis revealed that 22.85% of the patients had been in contact with a patient confirmed positive for COVID-19, compared to 77.14% who were unaware of having been in contact or not with a person carrying the virus. Co-morbidities of cardiovascular disease and smoking were found in 20% of patients. The predominant symptoms in the clinic were respectively: flu-like symptoms; fever above 39°C and dyspnea distributed in the following proportions: 94.28%; 88.57; 54.28. Other clinical characteristics of patients are summarized in (Table  1) . Due to the delay in RT-PCR diagnosis in our setting, the patients in this study were those who performed a chest CT scan without contrast injection while waiting for the RT-PCR result. Eighty percent (80%) of patients had lesions characteristic of COVID-19 viral pneumonia on chest CT. The reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) test was later found to be positive in 33 patients (94.28%) and negative in 2 patients (5.71%) whose CT scan was positive for COVID-19. The CT scan showed a sensitivity of 80% versus a specificity of 0% (Table  2) . Lesions were peripheral, posterior and basal in 65.71% of cases ( Figure 1 ); and 80% were multifocal and bilateral. Of the 35 patients who tested negative for RT-PCR, 28 patients or 80% had characteristic lesions with peripheral, multifocal and bilateral frosted glass opacification type and consolidation in a proportion of 22.85% (Figure 2 ). Multifocal and bilateral presence of Kerley lines (thickening of the interlobar septa) was noted in 54.28% of patients ( Figure 3 ). In addition, the degree of severity of the lesions was assessed by the radiologist in percentage terms, taking into account the volume of the pulmonary parenchyma. It was noted that 28.57% of the lesions were minor (lesion < 25% of parenchymal volume); moderate lesions were 25-50% and only 2.85% of the lesions were greater than 50% of parenchymal volume (Table 3 ).According to the currently available diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, the nucleic acid test is the main diagnostic tool for COVID-19 [12] . However, the test result is very time-consuming and may even give false negative results due to laboratory error or insufficient viral material in the specimen [13] . Among the 3415 patients followed up at the national centre for infectious diseases, 35 patients underwent chest CT scan, the result of which was characteristic of a COVID-19 viral infection in 80% (28/35) of cases. This result is comparable to that of Ai et al. who reported in 88% (888/1014) of initially negative patients, scan characteristics suggesting the presence of COVID-19 [14] . The RT-PCR test was later positive in 33 patients (94.28%) and negative in 2 patients (5.71%) whose CT scan was positive for COVID-19. These various reports show that in some cases, patients may have negative RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal or throat swabs and at the same time present CT features typical of the disease. Many authors have already reported similar results. Bingjie Li et al. found false negatives with a positive CT scan on a symptomatology suggestive of COVID-19 [10] . It is believed that the conditions under which the examination is performed and the sample is stored are conducive to the negativity of the test in our context. Both sexes were found with a sex ratio of 1.91. The average age was 41 ± 9.034 years. More than half (77.14%) of the patients are unaware of having been in contact with people carrying the virus in their daily activities. Since the disease is contagious even to asymptomatic patients [15] , the risk of transmission and spread is always considerable. This probably explains why 27 (77.14%) of the patients presented in this work felt that they did not know whether they had been in contact with subjects carrying the virus. The clinical symptoms found in this series are consistent with those reported in the literature [7, 8] .Eighty percent (80%) of patients had lesions characteristic of COVID-19 viral pneumonia on chest CT. Coronavirus 2019 disease has different imaging manifestations at different stages. Early stage COVID-19 lesions are relatively localized and are manifested primarily by inflammatory infiltration limited to the subpleural or peribronchovascular regions of one or both lungs. We report in this work, 20% negative chest CT. Very few cases present negative CT scan results at an early stage [16] . The sensitivity of the chest CT to covivid-19 is already known [16] . It should be noted that the chest CT scan had a sensitivity of 80% versus a specificity of 0% in this work. This means that there is an 80% chance that a patient diagnosed positive for COVID-19 on chest CT will be confirmed positive by RT-PCR. However, there are many abnormalities to look for on the chest CT scan of patients suspected of being COVID-19 positive. Extensive ground glass opacities, peripheral multifocal and bilateral opacities were found in all of our CT positive patients. According to some recent studies [11, 17] , lesions classically predominate in the peripheral, posterior and basal regions. The results of this study show a peripheral redistribution of the lesions with more marked involvement of the posterior and basal areas in 65.71% of patients. Pulmonary consolidation was found as an associated lesion in 22.85% of patients. This feature of CT scanning in patients with COVID-19 is worrisome as it is considered a sign of disease progression [18] . According to some reports, greater consolidation indicated disease progression, while absorption and smaller size of these lesions indicated improvement [19, 20] . In addition, thickening of the interlobar septa in 54.28% of patients, indicating an interstitial syndrome. Taking into account the parenchymal volume, lesions less than 25% are considered minor and those between 25-50% are said to be moderate. This result illustrates the extent of the lesions caused by VCOS-RAS-2 on the lung and justifies the respiratory distress which is most often symptomatologically consistent. Treatment was symptomatic in all patients and the outcome was favourable in all. We believe that a future study on monitoring the evolution of CT lesions will provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis in order to limit damage to the lungs.Although the positive nucleic acid test remains the reference examination for the positive diagnosis of COVID-19, the characteristics of the scanner can be used for the clinical diagnosis of infection despite negative nucleic acid test results. This study revealed lesions characteristic of COVID-19 viral pneumonia on chest CT in 80% of patients who tested negative for RT-CPR. Given the sensitivity of chest CT to COVID-19 lesions, and the irreplaceable role it has played in the detection of these patients, we believe that its systematization in all patients suspected of having COVID-19 would facilitate diagnosis and monitoring of response to treatment. It should be noted, however, that a negative chest CT scan does not rule out a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, particularly in the early stages of the disease. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay allows healthcare workers to confirm COVID-19 infection.We would like to thank the researchers and study participants for their contributions.

259aeb4c22c509b41ceac8cf486b064da0beb3fb,The Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Youth Living with HIV in Western Kenya,"Adolescents and young adults (ages 10-24) living with HIV (ALHIV) are a vulnerable group, with higher loss to followup, virologic failure, and mortality than older adults in HIV care [1] . COVID-19-related disruptions in social contact and health service delivery could negatively affect psychosocial and clinical outcomes, as well as reduce participation in research, among the approximately 190,000 ALHIV in Kenya [2] . Understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on ALHIV HIV care, as well as the feasibility of conducting remote research with ALHIV, can inform interventions to support this population during and after the pandemic.After the first case of COVID was confirmed on March 13, 2020, the Kenyan government enacted policies to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including closing schools and higher-level learning institutions, limiting travel, banning social gatherings, enacting curfews, and requiring face masks in public spaces [3] . The Kenyan Ministry of Health (MOH) issued guidance for facilities providing HIV care that aimed to ensure continuation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) while decreasing clinic visit frequency. Recommendations included provision of up to 3 months of ART at each visit, regardless of age and viral load, even for ALHIV who typically get monthly refills. Additionally, facilities were encouraged to promote flexible ART delivery models, such as community-based ART groups. Prior to COVID-19, these differentiated treatment models were not recommended for adolescents below age 20 in Kenya [4].These social and service delivery changes may specifically affect ALHIV, as they no longer have access to clinicbased adherence counseling and peer support groups or school-based support networks, increasing risk of isolation, anxiety, depression, and violence [5] [6] [7] . We assessed the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 within an ongoing cohort study of ALHIV.The Data-informed Stepped Care to Improve Adolescent Outcomes (DiSC) cohort includes 1386 ALHIV ages 10-24 years receiving HIV care at nine health facilities in Western Kenya. Following COVID-19-related clinical care changes in Kenya, we adapted our protocol to administer telephone rather than in-person follow-up surveys and included questions about COVID-19. All participants had previously provided informed consent at enrollment, and ethical review committees of Maseno University in Kenya and University of Washington, Seattle, United States, approved the phone interviews and additional COVID-19 questions.During each call, study staff read a standard introduction, obtained oral consent to participate by phone, requested participants find a private location, and inquired about the battery life of the phone. If no private location was available or battery life was low, study staff would offer the option to re-schedule the survey. Special considerations were incorporated for 10-17 year old minors who had received parental consent to participate. Study staff first spoke with the caregiver on record and reminded them of the survey contents before speaking with the minor. To minimize risk of inadvertent disclosure of HIV status, study staff were provided information from enrollment data about participant knowledge of status and who else knows their status.COVID-19 questions included whether ALHIV had heard of COVID-19 and how COVID-19 has affected their daily life (school has been closed, can no longer go to clinic, can no longer get medication refills, and/or can no longer go outside). Participants could also volunteer other ways COVID-19 has affected their lives; study staff paraphrased these responses and entered them into an open text field on an electronic tablet. Depression severity was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) tool, categorized as either none-minimal (score 0-4) or mild-severe (score ≥ 5). Psychological resilience was evaluated using the 2-item (score range from 0 to 8) Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), a measure of ""bounce-back"" and adaptability [8] . Categorical responses were compared across age groups using a Fisher's exact test, and mean scores using one way ANOVA. Lastly, study staff could enter a comment about the phone survey experience. COVID-19 survey data collection began March 2020, and is ongoing.The study team made 977 phone calls to 685 ALHIV participants and completed 486 surveys by phone. Thirty-one percent (n = 152) of ALHIV were 10-14 years old, 39% (n = 188) 15-19 years old, and 30% (n = 146) 20-24 years old; most of the older adolescents were female (84%) ( Table 1 ). All of the younger adolescents reported being enrolled in school. Knowledge of one's own HIV status was high among the two older groups (97%) and lower among 10-14 year olds (59%). Adherence was relatively high, with 6% of participants reporting missing their ARVs for 2 days or more in a row in the last 30 days.Nearly all participants (99%) reported having heard of COVID-19, 23% reported no longer being able to go outside, 17% reported that they could no longer go to their regular clinic for medical care, and 3% reported that they could no longer get medication refills. There were no significant differences across age groups for these four ways in which COVID has affected participants. Among 359 ALHIV enrolled in school, 92% reported school closures. Of 486 adolescents, 41% (n = 200) reported more than one challenge related to COVID-19 with significant differences across age groups (p = 0.002).PHQ-9 screening information was provided by 479 ALHIV (7 missing) and CD-RISC scores from 481 ALHIV (5 missing). Nine percent of ALHIV (n = 45) reported mild depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score of 5-9), and 1% (n = 3) moderate-to-severe depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10). Young adults 20-24 years old had more mild to severe depressive symptoms than the younger age groups (p < 0.001). Among 481 adolescents (5 missing), the mean CD-RISC score was 5.8 (± 1.6) ( Table 1) . No statistical differences were found in mean resilience scores across age groups.Over one third of participants (n = 187, 38%) selected 'other' and explained ways they have been affected with young adults 20-24 years old selecting 'other' the most frequently.Responses to this open-ended question were grouped into three categories: mobility and social effects, economic effects and other effects including disruptions to regular activities and feelings of fear (Table 2) . Of the 486 ALHIV interviewed, 99 (20%) volunteered information about mobility and social impacts. Participants mentioned restricted opportunities to be with other people, including the inability to go to church, travel, attend markets, visit places, or leave their homes after a certain hour. Fourteen participants mentioned their social life was limited by the elimination of gatherings and inability to see friends.Ten participants reported people in their life dying from COVID-19.The most common economic effects reported (n = 50) were losing employment, not being able to access their job, Mean CD-RISC (SD) 6.0 (± 1.6) 5.9 (± 1.4) 5.7 (± 1.8) 5.8 (± 1.6) 0.32 or business being slow. The majority of those who mentioned employment issues were 20-24 years old (n = 40).One 22 year old participant noted that she can no longer sell in the market because it has been closed, which has led to ruined finances. Eleven participants described increases in general cost of living, food, and transportation; eight mentioned that they or their caregiver had reduced income due to COVID-19; and eight mentioned unmet basic needs, hunger, and food scarcity.Of 486 phone surveys conducted, study staff included a comment about the survey in 414 (85%). Overall, staff reported that the phone interviews went smoothly, with only 86 (18%) reporting challenges. The most frequently cited challenge was participant demeanor (n = 30, 6%). Study staff noted that ""quiet"" ""shy"" or ""nervous"" participants led to difficult surveys as a result of the participant not speaking a lot. Study staff also reported challenges with the telephone network (n = 28, 6%), and 'interruptions' (n = 21, 4%) including children crying, phone disconnections, rain, low phone battery, or the participant being in a public location. Participant comprehension was noted as a challenge in 7 surveys (1%), primarily among participants under 14 years old. In these instances, the study staff had to repeat and explain questions/answers to ensure comprehension, which lengthened survey duration.These findings provide a glimpse into the effects of COVID-19 on ALHIV during the first 10-weeks following detection of the first case in Kenya. Despite school closure, social distancing, substantial economic impacts, and lost opportunities for social events, we found few ALHIV with moderate to severe depressive symptoms and resilience scores comparable to the normative population scores of students and young adults in other research [8] . Additionally, this study demonstrates that pivoting from in-person to surveys conducted by phone is feasible with ALHIV in rural Kenya. It will be important to follow ALHIV over a longer period to understand sustained impact of social distancing and other COVID-19 effects such as adolescent mental health, resilience, and social support. In the meantime, proactive approaches to support ALHIV during COVID-19 are likely to be helpful. Peer-support groups or individualized mentalhealth care could be offered through telehealth or virtual platforms to individual reporting symptoms of anxiety or depression, or to compensate for missed clinic interactions during periods of social distancing. ALHIV under age 20 who maintain high levels of resilience without frequent clinic attendance may benefit from enrollment in differentiated care services, including support-person ART refills, multi-month prescriptions, and pharmacy-based refills, allowing those with the highest needs to attend and maintain safe distances during in-person care. Staggered scheduling of adolescent days at facilities to maintain social distance and decrease time in the clinic could further provide direct access to those most in need. Many ALHIV reported substantial economic difficulties as a result of COVID-19 social-distancing policies, and programs should consider financial subsidies or food vouchers to support the health and well-being of this population. Lessons learned from health services adaptations during COVID-19 offer promise to optimize ALHIV care both during the COVID-19 epidemic and beyond.",Kenya,abstract,2020-08-20,08
b0580ca358838bf6e5c9673386f34c87bf9243c2,Managing Resident Workforce and Residency Training During COVID-19 Pandemic: Scoping Review of Adaptive Approaches,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. 1, 2 Since then many countries have implemented different COVID-19 mitigation measures including physical distancing and lockdown. As part of international crises in the health care system, many residency trainings are being affected by SARS-COV-2 and mitigation measures implemented. Any gathering with more than 5 people recently recommended to be avoided by the Centers for Disease Control. 3 As a result, in-person residency academic activities should be avoided disrupting all pillars of residency education. The clinical education and handson training are affected by the disruption of formal health care delivery like elective surgeries, disruption of skill-based teaching activities, and deployment of residents to COVID-19 related service. Many government institutions and professional associations including the American College of Surgeons (ACS) is recommending against the continuation of elective surgery 4 and minimizing participants in any operation which will undoubtedly decrease resident case volume. Academics and didactic teaching of residents were also disrupted because of the interruption of bedsides, morbidity and mortality conferences, rounds, and seminar teaching. The same is true for the resident's research activity. Additionally, the rotation of residents between different hospitals and between two sites within the same hospital should also be limited.Many programs have restructured their call schedules to reduce their number of in-house residents, while others face the possibility of resident redeployment to service with greater demand (eg, trauma, intensive care). Residents during their dedicated research years grapple with institutional suspensions of critical research activities, which threaten their scientific progress. 5 Given all these sudden changes, residents, especially in the surgical discipline, will see a significant reduction in resident's exposure to all pillars of their training, with no clear endpoint. This might result in an overall reduction in the experience and competency of the residents posing a problem on the accreditation process. This huge burden for residency directors and consultants, yet there are no universal or multi-institutional recommendations.These unfathomable circumstances require flexibility and creativity with novel interventions to ensure training is provided without compromising quality. These need to be done while maintaining the safety of the residents, consultants, and patients. Although there is no substitute for time in the operating room for surgical disciplines, residency programs have been quick to migrate the didactic components of the training curriculum online. Webbased educational platforms have become the frontier of innovation in the era of COVID-19. Learning experiences well suited for online platforms include video teleconferencing, lectures, case conferences, and journal clubs, among many others. 6 There have also been efforts to ameliorate the for the diminished surgical exposure by implementing virtual surgery atlases, live surgical video. 7 Considering the above facts, we did a scoping review to synthesize evidence on adaptive (innovative) ways of maintaining residency education activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. We looked for websites of different specialty associations and international or national specialty accreditation institutions. We looked for the website and publication of the following: Additionally, we also developed a search strategy using keywords residency, residents, education, training, COVID-19 to look for available documents. We searched the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar (Table 1) . We prepared this scoping review according to Preferred Reporting Items for a systematic scoping review 8 (Table S1 ). We used the following inclusion parameters:We included residents on training programs in different specialty programs.The review considered studies, reviews, position statements, or recommendations addressing the resident's education program during the pandemic.Included worldwide records or recommendations addressing resident's education programs during the pandemic. We considered studies (any form), reviews or editorials, perspectives, short or special communications, and position papers on residency education during the pandemic. The search is limited to the past year as the outbreak happened in December 2019.Two independent reviewers extracted data using a customized tool that was developed to record the key information relevant to the review question. Types of record, author of the document, field of residency training, the domain of residency education, month and year of publication, and recommendations of the documents were extracted. The difference between the two authors on data extraction was resolved by discussion. We searched for the resident's clinical teaching, didactic, and research activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We categorized identified evidence into the following thematic areas: staffing, safety, and clinical coverage, clinical education, surgical education, didactic teaching, research activity, and accreditation process. We described findings narratively ( Table 2: Data  extraction table) .Formal ethical permission is not required for this review and all data used were included in the manuscript and supplementary material.We reviewed different websites, Google scholar, PubMed, and EMBASE. We identified a total of 404 records. After removing duplicates, we screened titles and abstracts of 334 documents and retained 34 papers for full-text review. Based on the inclusion criteria, we included 13 records in the scoping review ( Figure 1 ).We retained 13 documents for scoping review according to predefined inclusion criteria. Three were articles,5 short or special communications and the rest editorials and perspectives (Table 3 below) Staffing, safety and clinical service organization (resident safety, emotional and psychological integrity amid COVID- 19) We identified nine documents reporting on resident staffing and safety amid COVID-19. 5, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Reorganizing residents staffing to ensure safety during the pandemics is very important. Besides residents must be trained in infection prevention in a clinical setting including appropriate use of protective equipment and personal hygiene. 13, 16 These trainings can be conducted online via different virtual platforms. 7, 9, 16 Many recommend creating social media platforms communications to keep residents and staff stay in communication with each other to ease fear and anxiety about the pandemic. 13, 14 Crosby and Sharma on Otolaryngology residency training recommended virtual sessions for social connectedness to help residents suffering from the added pandemic anxiety of worrying about not only their safety but also for the safety of patients, friends, and family. To preserve the workforce and minimize transmission of the virus among residents many residency programs have designed different innovative staffing mechanisms. Most of the resident staffing techniques amid COVID-19 involves significantly reducing the number of residents staying in hospital by dividing them into two groups and rotating every 1-2 weeks. One group involved in clinical service (active inpatient or on service group) and the other group will stay at home remotely providing tele supervision, consultation, and arrange different virtual teaching programs. 5, 7, 10, 11, [13] [14] [15] Naser et al reported experience of restructuring of general surgery residents during pandemics into three exclusive groups (inpatient, operative, and clinic) rotating weekly to practice appropriate physical distancing and reduce the possibility of transmission among residents. 12 Resident clinical education (Morning, case presentations, bedsides, round, seminars (management session), journal club) Few residency programs suspend resident clinical teachings 9 while many residency training programs designed alternative innovative technologies to maintain resident clinical education during COVID-19 pandemic. 5, 7, 11, [13] [14] [15] 17, 18 Bambakidis reported experience of neurosurgery at Cleveland Medical Center that one or two residents to be in place with patient discussion with the team by teleconference. 7 Similarly, Schwartz et al recommended post-clinic videoenabled telemedicine between attendings and on-service residents for clinical education. 5 Ground round webinars live interactive virtual visiting professor sessions, virtual academic conference, case-based conferences and morning session webinar, journal club webinar, email-based clinical vignettes with associated questions and clinical images, virtual live or recorded conferences were being used for clinical education in a different residency program. 7, 11, [13] [14] [15] 17, 18 In these different virtual teachings used in different residency programs, many recommended using different mechanisms such as using tools that promote interaction and audience participation. 6, 13 Resident Surgical Education (Hands-on Training)The shutdown of elective surgeries caused a dramatic reduction of case volume and operating room exposure time which will not be replaced by simple academic conferences and telehealth. Many residency programs had instituted alternative surgical teaching methods during COVID-19. 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 18 For example, Stambough et al reported on orthopedic surgical education by using videos, such as the Orthopedic Video Theater (OVT) and Orthopedic Video Theater plus (OVT plus), cadaver and bone-substitute simulations. 9 Tomlinson reported Neurosurgical Atlas and 3D models and web-based simulations as innovative neurosurgical hands-on training amid COVID-19 at the University of Rochester Medical Center, New York. 7 Neurosurgical Atlas is a free, online, multimedia resource focused on operative techniques and microsurgical anatomy. Vargo et al reported on the experience of Cleveland Clinic on videoconference teaching of high-priority elective"" robotic cases with intraoperative surgical principles for general urology residency program's. 11 Department of Orthopedics, Emory University School of Medicine are using virtual reality or simulation training for orthopedic surgical education. Exemplary virtual reality and surgical simulators platforms have been developed for total knee and total hip arthroplasty surgery. 5 Tele mentoring of surgical procedures simulation, online training modules, skills labs, online practice questions and facilitated use of surgical videos were among other methods used for surgical education by different residency programs. 6, 14, 18 Nine of identified records reported on alternative virtual didactic residency education during COVID-19. 19 These virtual didactics include virtual lectures, journal clubs, flipped DovePress virtual classrooms, and teleconferences. The University of California uses novel methods of social-media-based Facebook platform groups titled ""ABSITE Daily"". The platform is used to provide practice questions and discussion platforms to prepare trainees for the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE). This platform in addition to allowing daily exposure to practice questions provides an avenue of discussion of surgical topics without any need for in-person meetings. 6Research activity has been disrupted at many institutions during the pandemics. To overcome such factors, some residency programs are using alternative ways of continuing residency research programs. 5, [13] [14] [15] Video enabled virtual research meetings and encouraging residents working from home (nonclinical resident) to develop research projects during the off-work week is recommended. This can be done by weekly virtual meetings with their research mentor. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Otolaryngology Department is using such methods to maintain resident's research activity. They designed in a way that, weekly virtual research meeting is held for all residents. On each meeting, one resident presents details of the update on their project and they review all the in-depth of the research methodology including statistical analyses specific to that project. 14 Four USA based radiology residency programs encourage research mentors and their trainees to have ongoing discussions on other projects during the pandemic, including securing funding and reshaping works-inprogress into publishable or presentable material. 15The pandemic is affecting the current accreditation process and will have an undue effect to get minimum case log or minimum activity volume (MAV) required to sit for board examinations graduate. 16 America Board of Orthopedic Surgery (ABOS) suspended all current accreditation processes but states that graduation decisions should be decided by the program director. 9 ABOS swiftly responded to the pandemic crisis by adding the ""time away"" from residency training per academic year to DovePress provide flexibility and also stressed that program directors to work to make sure residents meet ACGME minimum case requirements. 9, 16 As of March 9, ACGME has also indefinitely postponed all scheduled and requested accreditation site visits. 16 The American Board of Radiology has delayed the board certification test up to September 1, 2020. 20 Such postponed graduation and credentialing might impact subsequent onboarding time for incoming residents. Radiology and Otolaryngology residency programs in the USA suggested minimum requirement for graduation, using additional didactic sessions to fulfill the requirements and closely working with accreditation bodies and with their local clinical competency committee to solve the problems. [13] [14] [15] ConclusionsThe undue effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency training is well recognized across many residency programs. Residency directors must reorganize residents staffing to ensure health and safety during the pandemics. Besides residents must be trained in infection prevention in a clinical setting including appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and personal hygiene. Different innovative alternative teaching methods were evolving to substitute the former face to face teaching to maintain residency didactic, clinical, surgical education, and research activity. During COVID-19 pandemic alternative teaching methods such as video teleconferencing, virtual lectures, virtual ground rounds, virtual case conferences, journal club webinars, e-learning modules, online textbooks, email clinical vignettes with associated questions and clinical images, live interactive virtual visiting professor sessions, video database platforms, Podcasts, online blogs, Webinars, E-literature searches, surgical simulators, and virtual reality (VR) platforms can be used to maintain all pillars of residency education. Residency directors also must closely work with accreditation bodies and with their local clinical competency committee to ease the impact of COVID-19 on the accreditation process. One drawback of innovative teaching methods is the necessity of having a good internet connection. Therefore, residency directors in developing where there is no stable connection should work with responsible bodies to make sure that residents have access to the internet.This scoping review is very timely putting together evidence for keeping residency training amid COVID-19 pandemic. However, the current review has its limitations that worth considerations. The documents included in this scoping review were mainly from surgical areas such as orthopedics, neurosurgery, urology, otolaryngology, and radiology residency. This is because of a paucity of data published on the subject matter with the possibility of publication bias. Besides, the included studies where not critically appraised. Nevertheless, with the above limitations in mind, the scoping review provides insight into the necessity of innovative and alternative methods of residency education. Such preliminary evidence might be an input to generate hypothesis or design rigorous research projects that will inform practice and policy decisions. Therefore, we recommend the generation of more evidence on innovative alternative teaching methods used worldwide across different residency programs which might be used to shape future residency education.Conceptualization ",Ethiopia,first author,2020-08-10,08
d8ba6adcb0d834c53a9bc232a640a3e8a089a9dc,"Factors determining the knowledge and prevention practice of healthcare workers towards COVID-19 in Amhara region, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional survey Mulusew Andualem Asemahagn","World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, after 11 days of being declared as a public health emergency [1, 2] . The COVID-19 has been reported as a continuing global epidemic since its first appearance in December 2019 from Wuhan City in China [2, 3] . The COVID-19 is a zoonotic contagious disease that can transmit from animal to human and from human to human [4] . The major transmission route of COVID-19 is respiratory droplets produced from an infected person while sneezing and coughing. It is also transmitted by infected surfaces and objects since the virus can survive everywhere [3, 5, 6] . The COVID-19 has been characterized by wide clinical futures ranging from no symptoms to a severe form of respiratory illness [7] [8] [9] . The typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough and shortness of breath [4, [6] [7] [8] 10 ]. Occasionally, symptoms including headache, muscle pain, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, hemoptysis, and diarrhea were observed [9, 11] .The burden of COVID-19 has increased worldwide in terms of morbidity, mortality and economic crisis [2, 12, 13] . Globally, as of 27 July 2020, over 16 249 165 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 649 208 deaths were reported [14] . Although the spread of COVID-19 is highest in Europe and America, it has been alarmingly increased in Africa [13, [15] [16] [17] . The situation might be serious in Sub-Saharan Africa due to high comorbidities (HIV, TB and malaria), poverty, and poor healthcare service quality and access to health facilities [13, 15] . As of 27 July 2020, 847,628 confirmed cases and 17,759 deaths were reported from Africa. The situation has no exception in Ethiopia, where the burden of COVID-19 has increased and about 13,968 confirmed cases and 223 deaths have been reported as of 27 July 2020 [14] .HWs are the highest risk groups for COVID-19 due to the nature of their occupation that exposed them to infectious people with COVID-19 every day. Several HWs have infected by COVID-19 and lost their lives globally due to job-related COVID-19 [12, 18, 19] . Unless special attention is given to make HWs and their working places safe, the system will lose many HWs and highly compromise the capacity of anti-COVID-19 and other infectious diseases worldwide. Unlike other people, the HWs have double sources of infection to COVID-19 from the community and working places. The main reasons for acquiring COVID-19 among HWs include long-time exposure, shortage and poor quality of PPE [18, 20] . The HWs are typical infection sources of families, patients and the community [15, 20, 21] .To date, much is known about the distribution, transmission, prevention, and supports, but no curative treatment or vaccine that has been recommended for the COVID-19 [1, 6, 8, 22] . The WHO recommends the prevention of human-to-human transmission by avoiding close contacts, frequent handwashing with soap, and/or alcohol-based hand rubbing sanitizer, wearing PPE (facemask, shields and glove) and avoid going to crowded places [10, 22, 23] . Also, improving the knowledge and prevention practice of HWs and the community through regular updates about COVID-19 is crucial [10, 23] . If HWs have access to information sources, they will upgrade their knowledge and apply preventive devices to prevent COVID-19 and give appropriate care to patients, families and the community [15, 18, 23] .Recent literature on infection prevention (IP) practice of HWs in Ethiopia also depicted the presence of relatively better knowledge and attitude on infection prevention practices. The prevention practice of most HWs however did not go with their knowledge and attitude levels [21, [24] [25] [26] . This might be related to less attention to IP and work safety, absence and poor quality of PPE, negligence of HWs and less comfortable working offices. Also, there is no recent evidence on the existing prevention practice of HWs towards COVID-19 in Ethiopia, in particular, the Amhara Region. Thus, this study aimed to assess the prevention practice and associated factors of HWs towards COVID-19 in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia. This might play a vital role in preventing COVID-19 among HWs and stop the spread of infections to the community.Due to the country's lockdown for COVID-19 prevention, an online cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May 2020 among HWs working in public hospitals and health centers (HCs) of the Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Amhara Region is the second-largest region in Ethiopia. Amhara Region is divided into 10 administrative zones (third administration level in Ethiopia) and 3 town administrations. The capital city of the region is Bahir Dar city, where the regional health bureau and Amhara regional Public Health Institute are located. Based on the 2018 regional health bureau report, the region has about 4267 public health facilities (77 hospitals, 848 HCs, and 3342 health posts) to offer healthcare services to a total population of 21,841, 999:4, 089,997 urban and 17,752,002 rural. A total of 38,000 HWs with different professional disciplines are working in those healthcare facilities [27] .The sample size of the study participants (442) was determined using a single population proportion formula based on the following assumption: 50% proportion to prevention practice among HWs since no previous study on COVID-19 prevention practice, 95% confidence level, 5% margin of error, and 15% non-response rate by considering high delayed responses and non-respondents since it is an online survey. The study participants were selected randomly from the alphabetical list of all HWs in the Amhara Regional Health Bureau using the Stat Trek Random Number Generator tool [28] . Then, the investigator addressed sampled HWs through the regional health bureau, zonal health departments and human resource managers of health facilities. Based on the selected HWs, 70 health facilities (10 hospitals and 60 health centers) were study sites.Data were collected online using a structured questionnaire and using email and telegram services of HWs working in different units of hospitals and HCs. The questionnaire was designed using Google Forms (via docs. google.com/forms) by referring to former studies on IP and the WHO IP guidelines [15, 16, 18, 23, 26, 29] . The questionnaire consists of questions related to demographics, information sources, risk assessment, knowledge and practice towards the COVID-19. The clarity, appropriateness and redundancy of questions were revised based on findings from the pretest. HWs had been informed well about the purpose of the study, data confidentiality and data collection procedures. After they became clear about the study and its procedure, the investigator asked each participant for consent by sending the consent form before data collection. After collecting the signed consent form from each health worker, the investigator sent the Google form link (questionnaire) to HWs for data collection. Data were collected from 5 April to 25 May 2020. In this study, HWs are health professionals who had primary contact with patients during clinical examination and biological specimen collection that include physicians, nurses, health officers and laboratory technicians/technologists.The questionnaire was designed with ease of use and pretested before data collection. Cronbach alpha was used to check the validity of the tool and the value of 'α' was 8.92. HWs had been informed of detailed information with practice on how to complete and sent the questionnaire. Duplication of responses was controlled by restricting to one response. The incompleteness of responses was reduced by making each ""*required"" to pass to the next question.The collected data were checked for completeness and exported to the MS-excel format. The excel data were then exported to SPSS version 25 for editing and analysis. There were 16 knowledge questions with ""yes = 1"" or ""no = 0"" responses to give values ranging from 0 to 16. A health worker who scored 80% and above was grouped as having ""good knowledge"" and who scored below 80% was grouped as having ""poor knowledge."" On the other hand, there were 11 practice-related questions responded as ""always = 1"" and ""rarely = 0"" with total values ranging from 0 to 11. A health worker who scored 75% and above was grouped as ""good practitioner"" and who scored below 75% was grouped as ""poor practitioner"" [15] . The reason for using a 75% cut off value for practice was by considering the seriousness of the COVID-19, and the study participants are health workers to whom the prevention practice is mandatory to keep themselves families safe from COVID-19 and be a role model to their patients and the rest of the community. Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, range, cross-tabulations and proportions were computed. The model fitness was checked by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test before the regression analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with HWs' knowledge and practice towards COVID-19. Variables with a p value of < 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were used to fit the multivariable model to control the confounding effect. Variables with a p value of < 0.05 in the multivariable model were considered as significant factors. Associations between study and outcome variables were described using the odds ratio at 95% CI.Of the total 442 HWs, 398(90% response rate) responded to the online survey interview and 231(58%) were males. Over half, 207(53%) HWs, aged ≥ 34 years (mean age = 34 ± 5 years). Over half, 225(56%) HWs, were working in rural health facilities. Nearly half, 191(48%), of the HWs were nurses and 243 (61%) were from HCs. Only 88(22%) HWs had histories of domestic travel in recent times. A small number of HWs, 60 (15%), 48 (12%) and 179 (45%), had histories of chronic illness, smoking and taking alcohol in any amount, respectively. A limited number of HWs, 151 (38%) took training in IP in recent times. A significant number of HWs, 239 (60%) and 259 (65%), used social media and television and or radio as information sources about COVID-19, respectively. Over half, 207(52%), of the HWs noted the presence of adequate PPE in their health facilities. However, only 159 (40%) HWS stated the presence of IP guidelines in their working areas. Less than half, 167(42%), of the HWs reported as high workload prevented them from practicing COVID-19-prevention ( Table 1) .Of the surveyed HWs, 279(70%) had demonstrated good knowledge about COVID-19. Most, 351(88%) and 339(85%) of the HWs reported that COVID-19 is a viral disease and has no effective treatment or vaccine yet, respectively. Over two-thirds, 275(69%) HWs stated as animals and humans are the primary sources of infection to COVID-19. Also, 263(66%) HWs mentioned respiratory droplets and close contact are the main transmission routes of COVID-19. Nearly half, 191(48%) HWs, also reported contaminated objects and surfaces as potential transmission routes. The majority, 338 (85%) HWs identified chronically ill people are at the highest risk of COVID-19. In addition, 303(76%) HWs pointed out that fever, dry cough and shortness of breath are typical signs and symptoms of people who had COVID-19. Also, 318(80%) and 315(79%) HWs knew that frequent handwashing and social distance are important to prevent COVID-19. Moreover, 85% and 80% HWs mentioned that COVID-19 had no cure treatment or vaccine, and isolation of suspected people is crucial to prevent COVID-19, respectively (Fig. 1) .In this study, 247(62%) HWs had good prevention practices towards COVID-19. The majority, 326(82%) and 318(80%) HWs regularly practice handwashing or alcohol-based sanitizer and wearing facemasks, respectively. Similarly, 271(68%) HWs frequently cover their mouth and nose while sneezing and 231(58%) of them disposed of the covering materials they used during sneezing properly to the dustbin. Also, 231(58%), 223(56%), and 215(54%) HWs avoid handshaking/shoulder kissing/touching mouth/nose/eye with unwashed hands and go to the crowded places, respectively. Only 116(29%) HWs always use disinfectants (Fig. 2 ).Based on the multivariable logistic regression model, HWs < 34 years of age were double times to have good knowledge about COVID-19 compared to people aged 34 years and above (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.25-3.62). HWs from rural health facilities were 56% times less likely to have good knowledge about COVID-19 compared to the counterpart HWs (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.26-0.70). Similarly, the odds of having good knowledge among HWs who got training in IP was over twice than the counterpart HWs (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1. 36-4.21) . HWs who used social media as information sources were 2.51 times knowledgeable compared to HWs who did not access information using social media (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.42-4.53). The odds of having good knowledge among HWs who had access to IP guideline was nearly three times more compared to the counterpart HWs (AOR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.64-4.62) ( Table 2) .HWs from rural areas were 55% times less likely to have good COVID-19 prevention practices than their counterpart HWs (AOR 0.45, 95% CI = 0.31-0.75). The odds of having good COVID-19 prevention was twice among HWs who took training in IP and who had access to IP guideline (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.35-4.16; AOR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.21-3.45), respectively. Also, HWs who had good knowledge of COVID-19 were triple times to prevent it compared to HWs who had poor knowledge (AOR = 2.98, 95% CI = 2. 15-5.27 ). The odds of having good preventive practice were twice among HWs who had chronic illnesses than the counterpart HWs. Moreover, HWs who had limited access to PPE, high workload, and HWs from health centers were 58%, 60%, and 60% times less likely to have good COVID-19 prevention practice, respectively (Table 3) .This study assessed the knowledge and practice of HWs concerning COVID-19 and identified factors associated with knowledge and infection control practices of HWs about COVID-19. The outputs of this study are crucial to HWs, health facilities, health offices and researchers to halt the spread of COVID-19 and fill literature gap [20, 23, 30] . Because HWs are at the front line in the COVID-19 prevention system, they have the highest risk of acquiring the infection and spreading it to their families and the community [16, 24, 25] . In addition, HWs have faced psychological stress and social stigma because of COVID-19 and their occupation [12, 18, 31] . This study depicted that over two-thirds (70%) HWs had good knowledge about COVID-19. This finding is higher compared to findings from Bale Zone [24] and Addis Ababa [26] , Ethiopia where the knowledge of HWs about IP practices in health facilities was 55.4% and 38.6%, respectively. This difference might be related to variations in the study period, study area coverage and the nature of the topic. This study included large area coverage (region level), whereas the former studies were at zonal levels (administrations within a region). When we see the time and nature of the topic, our study is knowledge about COVID-19 which is a timely issue but the former studies were about knowledge on overall IP practice and work safety of health facilities. Thus, COVID-19 has gotten global attention and advertised via social and mass media to inform the population at large.On the other hand, the current knowledge level was found to be lower compared to former study findings of COVID-19 and IP practices. It was found lower than 81.6% from Gondar University Hospital [25] , 86.4% from Dessie Hospital [32] , 84% from Bahir Dar City [33] , and 84.6% from Debremarkos Town [34] . All the former studies were about knowledge of HWs on the general IP practices but this study is HWs' knowledge about COVID-19. The time of the study and studied topic might also contribute to this variation. This study is about HWs' knowledge of COVID-19 that is not well known and fully practiced in rural health facilities due to no diagnostic and treatment services. This might lower the HWs' knowledge about COVID-19. Moreover, this finding was found lower than 82.4% knowledge on COVID-19 from Uganda [15] , 78.6% from Nigeria [16] , 93.2% from Pakistan [30] , 89% and 90% from China [35, 36] , and 80% from the USA [37] . This variation might be caused by differences in the study area and population, geographic coverage, and number and type of questions used. The current study used large area coverage where most participants were from rural areas that had limited access to information sources, IP practices and COVID-19 diagnosis and support services than the situation in the abroad that included urban health facilities with better access to information sources, IP facilities and COVID-19 prevention practices.In this study, HWs had 80-85% scores for the causative agent (virus), knowing highest risk population groups, no treatment/vaccine, and prevention mechanisms (isolation, social distance, and handwashing of . This is in line with findings from the former studies on COVID-19 [30, [35] [36] [37] . HWs however had lower scores (45-76%) for questions related to transmission routes of COVID-19. This is a critical issue that needs special attention from the concerned offices because prevention might be in place if HWs knew well the transmission routes. The low scores might be due to including more HWs from rural health facilities that had limited access to information sources and preventive devices [13, 38, 39] .This study demonstrated the main information sources to HWs where 60% and 65% accessed information about COVID-19 from TV and social media (Facebook, Youtube, Telegram and Twitter), respectively. This is because of easily accessible to most HWs at home and working areas through the mobile internet. This was different from the situation in Saudi Arabia where most of the HWs accessed information about COVID-19 and other infectious diseases form the website of the Ministry of Health [40] . This implied that the Ethiopian Government and the Ministry of Health need to use social media and television to disseminate information to HWs.This study indicated that the knowledge and practice of HWs were not matching. Only 62% of HWs had good prevention practices towards COVID-19. This implied that more HWs who had good knowledge had poor prevention practices. It might be due to the absence and /or poor quality of PPE and reservation from using PPE due to some discomforts. Thus, priority needs to be given to improve prevention practices parallel to awareness creation and making PPE available. Handwashing and wearing of facemasks and glove were frequently practiced and had up to 82% of scores. Differently, only 29% of HWs always disinfect tables, chairs, other materials and their rooms before and after work. It was incomparable with study findings from Nigeria [16] where the use of disinfectants among HWs was 83.9%. This might be either because of no access to disinfectants or less attention to the values of disinfectants in Ethiopia.The overall practice score was almost consistent with study findings from Addis Ababa [26] and Wolita Sodo [41] , Ethiopia, where the infection prevention practices of HWs were 66.1% and 60.5%, respectively. On the other hand, it was higher than 36.8% from Bale zone [24] , 57.4% from Gondar University Hospital [25] , 23% from Dessie Town [32] , 54.2% from Bahir Dar City [33] , 56.8% from Nigeria [16] and 57.3% from Debremarkos Town [34] . This difference might be related to variations in the study period, study topic, presence of IP guideline and PPE materials, access to IP training and commitment of HWs [15, 24, 25] .In contrast, this finding was lower than study findings from Uganda [15] , China [35] and Pakistan [30] in which 74%, 89.7% and 88.7% of HWs practiced COVID-19 prevention strategies, respectively. This inconsistency might be related to variations in the geographic area, the incidence of COVID-19, availability of PPE, IP policies among countries, training access, information sources and awareness levels of HWs [24, 42] . Based on the analysis, the rural residence was found to have an inverse association with the knowledge and practice of HWs towards COVID-19. HWs from rural health facilities had less likely odds to have good knowledge and practice (Tables 2 and 3 ). This might be related to limited access to health information sources such as guidelines, training, and the internet to update themselves. There is also limited access to PPE, washing facilities, isolation rooms and disinfectants [24, 32, 42] . Also, from personal observation, the rural community had less awareness of COVID-19. All these might lead them to have limited knowledge and prevention practices about COVID-19 compared to HWs in urban settings.Based on the multivariable model, being trained in IP and having IP guidelines were positively associated with the knowledge and prevention practice of HWs towards COVID-19. This was supported by findings from formers studies [15, 25, 26, 42] that reported training was a predictor to improve the knowledge and practice of IP among HWs. The primary aim of training in IP is to improve the knowledge of HWs about preventive mechanisms and how to apply them to prevent infections at working places and accessing the required IP equipment and guidelines. If HWs have IP guidelines and know well how to prevent and the risk of not practicing preventive strategies, they will apply all the possible preventive mechanisms to avoid infections. Most of the time, good knowledge from training and IP guidelines is a predisposing factor for having better infection prevention practices [24, 26, 30] .HWs who used social media as information sources had over double times odd to have good knowledge about COVID-19 compared to the counterpart HWs. This result was supported by former study findings from China [35, 36] and Iran [43] in which the main source of knowledge about infection prevention was using social media. It might be linked to ease of use and access the service using everywhere using mobile internet and social media (Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and others) are have been used worldwide. So, everybody can update his knowledge and information demand using these media. The informants (government and ministry of health) need to assess the media preference of HWs and the community to offer information concerning the COVID-19 and other health-related information effectively.In this study, health facility type was found to be statistically associated with infection prevention practices of HWs. HWs who worked in HCs were 60% times less likely to practice COVID-19 prevention than hospital health workers. This was supported by previous studies [16, 24, 33, 42] where HWs working in urban and advanced hospitals had better infection prevention practices than the rural and primary care health facilities. This might be attributed to the availability of better training, PPE, IP guidelines, personal commitments and follow-up, and advanced healthcare procedures (surgery) that lead to infection. There might also more COVID-19 [15, 26, 30, 33, 41] . It is true that if HWs have better knowledge about IP and its importance, they will possibly apply it in their working areas and make themselves safe from acquiring work-related infections. This indicates that regular update of HWs through training and availing IP guidelines is needed from the health system managers.Having chronic illnesses among HWs was positively associated with IP practices of HWs. HWs who had chronic illnesses were twice to have good IP practice than HWs who had no history of chronic illnesses. This is linked to the nature of COVID-19 and fears that people with chronic illnesses (DM, hypertension, cardiac problems, renal failure, respiratory problems and others). People with such health problems have been identified as the highest risk groups to acquire COVID-19 and become seriously ill from the infection including loss of life than other people [5-8, 11, 22] . Thus, HWs with such health problems would implement all preventive strategies not to get the infection compared to other HWs.Furthermore, the shortage of PPE and high workload were negatively associated with the IP practice of HWS (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.32-0.74, and AOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.36-0.87), respectively. The study findings from former studies supported these associations [13, 15, 16, 18, 26] . If there is no access to PPE among HWs, they will not practice IP even if they have adequate knowledge and attitude about IP. In addition to the shortage of PPE, HWs may not apply IP strategies and use PPE properly if they are busy and overloaded with tasks.Although this study has a wide area coverage, the second largest region in Ethiopia, it has some limitations that might have minimal impact on the study findings and external validity. It was based on online data collection techniques using email and telegram. Some of the health workers might not have access to such services due to limited access to technology, internet service and electric power. Thus, they might not be sampled even if they are important to this study. Also, this study included HWs working only in government health facilities. These might have some limitations in the external validity of the research findings while considering the whole HWs found in the region. Since it is a one-time study, it shared the limitations of a cross-sectional study to establish cause-effect relationships.In conclusion, the majority of HWs in the Amhara Region had good knowledge of COVID-19 despite limited prevention practices during the outbreak. Lower age, rural residence, access to training in IP, work with IP guidelines and using social media as information sources were statistically significant factors of HWs' knowledge about COVID-19. Whereas, rural residence, facility type, presence of IP training and guidelines, knowledge about COVID-19, having chronic illnesses, lack of PPE and high workload were significant factors associated with the IP practice of HWs. Thus, a consistent supply of PPE and improving health workers' knowledge through training, and making IP guidelines and information sources available are crucial to prevent COVID-19 infection. Also, managing chronic illnesses and balancing the workloads are required to reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection.Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s41182-020-00254-3.Additional file 1.

734e6342c587dcbb0c00f3bc7b83383e1a6644a4,"Unspoken inequality: how COVID-19 has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities of asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in South Africa","(Continued from previous page) mentale et des problèmes de santé secondaires. Une réponse efficace aux défis socioéconomiques imposés par la pandémie du COVID-19 devrait tenir compte de l'impact économique et sanitaire de la pandémie sur les demandeurs d'asile, les réfugiés et les migrants sans papiers.South Africa (SA) has been a preferred destination for many migrants from other parts of Africa, particularly those from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. An estimated 2 million foreignborn migrants of working age were living in SA in 2017, representing 5.3% of the South African labor force. Between 2012 and 2017, there was a 1.4% increase in international migrants of working age in SA [1] . Unofficially, the foreign-born migrant population in SA today is estimated to be around 4.2 million [2] .SA's commitment to upholding human rights and the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees make the country an attractive destination for people fleeing their home countries in the quest for a more dignifying and humane existence. The economy of SA, which is one of the most advanced on the African continent, has contributed to the exponential increase in the number of people seeking asylum from the continent and the world at large.The unprecedented flow of asylum-seekers and refugees into SA has compromised the government's stance to adhere to its commitment towards upholding human rights while delivering its promise to uplift the socioeconomic welfare of its citizens; especially those that still feel the brunt of apartheida system of institutionalized racial segregation. While there is the political will to accommodate and cater for asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in SA, the increasing economic and financial woes of the country has led to the government adopting and frequently changing laws that in many ways, have impacted negatively on the lives of these foreign-born migrants.The South African Refugees Act provides the right for asylum-seekers and refugees to work and study, to access medical services and life-saving treatment and freedom of movement [3] . SA's considerate assertion to these rights partly accounts for the influx of asylumseekers and refugees. However, failure to regularize the national asylum system, bureaucratic inefficiency, and corruption have engendered issues such as lack of personnel capacity and logistics to deal with the volume of asylum-seekers and refugees, consequently, creating a backlog in the processing and adjudication of the documents [3] [4] [5] . To this end, many foreign-born migrants remain undocumented and/or asylum-seekers for years, and those with refugee status find it difficult to obtain documents like the refugee identity or travel document [4] .The difficulty in obtaining or renewing documents on time makes it challenging for most asylum-seekers and refugees and, of course, impossible for undocumented migrants to gain any meaningful and long-term employment even if they are qualified. Most of them are relegated to the informal sector and nudged to reside in underprivileged communities. Foreign-born migrants are, therefore, more likely to be informally employed and face precarious employment conditions [1] . According to the African Centre for Migration and Society [1] , a foreign-born migrant with the same age, gender, and level of education, belonging to the same 'population group' and living in the same place as a South African, has a higher probability of being employed than a South African. Therefore, there is the conception in most communities where these foreign-born migrants reside and work that they deprive South Africans of employment and other business opportunities and are a strain on the limited social services and amenities, constituting the main drivers of xenophobia [6] . To avoid the killing of foreign-born migrants by the general population, the South African government enacted bylaws that make it challenging for foreign-born migrants to gain employment in SA. The abovementioned structural and practical xenophobia have plunged foreign-born migrants living in SA into abject poverty and misery [6, 7] .Most asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants entering SA come from regions with endemic malaria, HIV, and TB infections [8] [9] [10] . In addition to these infections, there is equally a huge burden of non-communicable diseases among foreignborn migrants living in SA [11] . Migration also involves going through certain stages involving lack of preparedness, difficulties in adjusting to the new environment, the complexity of the local system, language difficulties, cultural disparities and adverse experiences, which can cause distress and anxiety to the foreign-born migrants with a negative impact on their mental well-being [12] . Despite this high disease burden, foreign-born migrants face various challenges accessing preventative and curative healthcare services including the lack of migration-aware and mobilitycompetent health systems programs [11] .On the 23 of March 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a nation-wide lockdown to help curb the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in SA [13] and to enable the health systems to prepare for the increasing influx of moderate to severe COVID-19 cases [14] . In addition to the national lockdown, other social distancing measures such as isolation of individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and quarantining of those who may have been exposed to or were in contact with an infected person are also encouraged or enforced [15] . In spite of these containment measures, SA has the highest number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 in Africa with more than a 100,000 cases and 2000 deaths reported as of the middle of June 2020 [16] . While these containment measures are estimated to have negatively affected all those living in SA, asylumseekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants disproportionally experience the negative impacts of the pandemic because of existing vulnerabilities affecting this population Fig. 1 [17] .Before the lockdown containment measures, foreignborn migrants living in SA had relatively weakened social support structures, bleak socio-economic prospects, unequal access to health care and social services, precarious housing conditions, tenuous living and working conditions, and higher risks of exploitation and abuse [18] . The lockdown containment measures worsened their conditions as they found themselves suddenly jobless, being evicted from their homes, hunger insecure, and trapped in dormitories or camps where adequate physical distancing is impossible [19] . These conditions have created and continue to fuel feelings of uncertainty, distress, anxiety, fear, anger, and hopelessness; conditions considered as precursors and prodromes of mental health illnesses such as anxiety and depression [20, 21] , and secondary health concernsneglect of self-care, respiratory infections, HIV, and substance abuse [22] . Studies conducted in other countries have demonstrated that nation-wide lockdown is associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleeping disturbances [23, 24] .Organizations working with foreign-born migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures have raised concerns regarding the arrest and detention of foreign-born migrants [25] , their placement in, and subsequent repatriation from camps and shelters. There are also reports that foreign-born migrants are more likely to be arrested for minor offenses during the lockdown period and less likely to be released on bail because of expired documentation [25] . The closure of the Department of Home Affairs, which is responsible for renewing and issuing refugee permits, asylum permits, and residence permits, has made many foreign-born migrants vulnerable to harassment and extortion by law enforcement agents who are likely to ignore the moratorium on arrests of all those whose permits expired during the lockdown [2] . Migrants are consequently less willing to seek testing or care for COVID-19 symptoms as they are afraid of being detained or deported. These repatriation centers and prison stations are also prone to overcrowding, making it challenging to practice social distancing and recommended hygiene measures [26] . Under such conditions, these foreign-born migrants are at heightened risks of contracting COVID-19 but tend not to seek care when they notice the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, which makes them more likely to spread or die from the disease.During the mandatory nationwide lockdown, asylum seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants found themselves trapped indoors leading to the feeling of isolation [27] . Isolation, scarcity of resources, and the lack of social contacts may have created and continue to fuel Fig. 1 Crisis impacting foreign-born migrants -Adapted from United Nations [17] a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being [28, 29] . Also, with an increasing number of cases in SA, there has been a significant increase in the stigmatization of anyone remotely related to COVID-19. Stigma and discrimination that stems from COVID-19 can occur when people associate it with nationality or being a foreign-born migrants and can lead to further social avoidance, denial of health care, and perhaps even violence fueling secondary health concerns [30] . Stigma also makes people feel isolated; even to the point of feeling abandoned and increases the chances of anxiety and depression [31] .Although lockdown is comparatively easier for people who live in houses with big gardens, it is harder for those who live in crowded homes and camps, sharing their living spaces and toilets with non-relatives and strangers such as is the condition of most asylumseekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants living in SA [32] . Under these conditions, the risk of abuse (emotional and sexual), exploitation, and violence are heightened. Evidence shows that foreign-born migrants living under such circumstances in sub-Saharan Africa have consistently poorer physical and mental health outcomes than others [33] .To address some of the socio-economic hardship that the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures have placed on the South African population, the South African government adopted various economic and hunger alleviation measures. First, the government announced the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant of R350 ($20) to all South Africans who are unemployed including those who lost their job as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic for a period of 6 months from May 2020. Secondly, the South African government increased the value of the child and social support grants until October 2020. Thirdly, the government pledged a Business Relief Fund of R500 million ($30 million) for businesses that may have their operations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the government is providing tax subsidies for small businesses and individuals and lowering contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF).While these strategies are commendable, it is unclear how asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants living in similar or worse situations are being considered. Not only are they no longer able to acquire finances through work of any kind, but they also are not being considered in any of the government's plans to mitigate the impact of the lockdown measures. For instance, the African Centre for Migration and Society [1] report indicates that foreign-born migrants of working age living in SA are more likely to own a business and be employers. Unfortunately, most of these businesses owned by asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants, although their operations are equally affected by the COVID-19 crisis, are not considered for the Business Relief Fund as they are automatically excluded based on the qualification criteriabusinesses must be 100% South African owned, at least 70% of employees must be South Africans and recipients must be tax compliant [34] .For asylum-seekers and special-permit holders who were employed in the formal sector and who paid the mandatory taxes into unemployment before the lockdown measures were imposed, their UIF payments are not being paid while the South African employees in the same companies receive theirs [35] . The argument for non-payment of foreign-born migrants' UIF is that the electronic system used by the UIF does not recognize foreign passport numbers [35] . The Department of Employment and Labour made these payments to help individuals cope with the worst effects of the national lockdown. For the South African citizens, the UIF provided some relief, as this income replacement allowed them to take care of their families. However, the socioeconomic situation of refugees, asylum-seekers and special-permit holders not receiving the UIF has deteriorated further.The South African government also embarked on providing food parcels to those who are threatened by food insecurity. During these food distribution campaigns, it has been observed that foreign-born migrants form a significant number of attendees [36] . Similar to accessing the Social Relief of Distress grant of R350 ($20) and receiving UIF payments, a South African national ID or special permit is required to receive food parcels, which foreign-born migrants are unlikely to possess. [36] . In this way, asylum seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants are excluded from the government's food relief programs [37] .The South African Department of Home Affairs announced they will ensure that anyone whose immigration status permit expires before the end of the lockdown period will not be penalized as long as they present themselves to a refugee reception office within 30 days of the lockdown ending. Nevertheless, some asylumseekers have been undocumented for months and even years prior to the national lockdown [4] . These undocumented migrants are most vulnerable to harm and infection with COVID-19 as they are most likely to be homeless and their access to basic human rights and services is particularly limited. Consequently, the lockdown containment measures can potentially increase their vulnerabilities regarding mental health and secondary health concerns as people who are homeless are already prone to mental health issues and problems in physical health [12] due to neglect of self-care, leading to the prevalence of respiratory infections, HIV, and substance abuse.There is an overall poor engagement of SA's public healthcare system with migrants, therefore, testing and treatment responses within public health systems fail to engage with asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants [38] . As discussed earlier, undocumented migrants are also usually reluctant to seek medical and other assistance due to their lack of documentation for fear of possible arrest, detention, and even deportation. According to Kruger [39] , where someone suspected of having symptoms related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection refuses to take a test, an enforcement officer should apply to a magistrate for a warrant to compel such testing. Unfortunately, this cannot be applied to undocumented migrants as individuals are required to provide information on their 'nationality' and identification details to take a SARS-CoV-2 test in most parts in South Africa [2] . Therefore, early detection, testing, diagnosis, contact tracing, and seeking care for Covid-19 becomes challenging for undocumented migrants, thus increasing the risk of outbreaks among migrants and the general population, as COVID-19 is associated with clusters and outbreaks [14] . Their exclusion from accessing testing, treatment, and the palliative measures put in place during this COVID-19 period will, ultimately, undermine the government's efforts to curb the spread of the virus.Some civil societies such as the Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town are working to address the conditions of asylum-seekers and migrants. The Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town is a non-governmental organization based in Cape Town, SA that provides specialized services for refugee, migrant, and South African communities. For instance, the Centre has, in coordination with the major banks of SA, managed to not freeze the bank accounts of asylum-seekers and refugees whose permits got expired during the period of the national lockdown. This is meant to permit them to have access to their finances to buy food and purchase other essential goods and services. Unfortunately, many foreign-born migrants with expired permits report that their accounts are still frozen. Also, the Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town has recently won a Court Order that may ensure some of SA's asylum-seekers and special-permit holders to be able to apply for the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant. Other non-governmental organizations have focused on hunger alleviation by providing food parcels.While the efforts made by these civil societies to alleviate hunger and provide some relief to the economic situation of asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants are commendable, these efforts are not sustainable without the government's support. According to the United Nations [17] , four basic tenets should drive efforts to support foreign-born migrants in the era of COVID-19 and moving forward: (1) Their exclusion is costly in the long-run whereas their inclusion pays off for everyone. (2) The response to COVID-19 and protecting the human rights of migrants are not mutually exclusive. (3) No-one is safe until everyone is safe. (4) Migrants are part of the solution. The International Labour Organization (ILO) also confirms that the inclusion of foreign-born migrants in national COVID-19 policy responses can help to ensure the realization of equality and social justice [40] . Equality and social justice could be achieved by engaging with and including migrant-led organizations, civil societies, international organizations, and researchers working with migrant groups towards developing programs that consider migrants.ILO also suggests that governments should include asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in their national income and related policy responses. To achieve this, foreign-born migrants living in SA will require their status in SA to be legalized as many forms of access are contingent upon having proper documentation, such as access to healthcare, education, food parcels, banking services, unemployment benefits, social grants, or even, at times, freedom of movement. The COVID-19 pandemic and its implications necessitate an inclusive approach, which leaves no one behind because our individual and collective wellbeing is precariously interconnected. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, a narrow citizenship approach will be inadequate in dealing with an intertwined sociality.The South African government should also extend access to health services and social protection coverage to this category of our society [40] . For instance, provide healthcare to foreign-born migrants irrespective of migration status. The International Organization for Migration [21] also reiterates its call to ensure that foreign-born migrants and displaced persons are included in governments' plans for mental and psychosocial support provision in the context of COVID-19 and moving forward.The response to COVID-19 and ensuring the health and well-being of asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants are not mutually exclusive. The first step to effectively address the socioeconomic and psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on foreign-born migrants while reducing inequities between them and local communities involves developing policies that take their realities into account. Although these migration-aware and mobilitycompetent policies do not necessarily translate in practice, the South African government should engage with and include migrant-led organizations, civil society, international organizations, and researchers working with migrant groups in the development of appropriate responses. Leaving this category of our society out of the national response safety nets may engender negative coping strategies leading to mental health issues, and secondary health concerns.

c816601051ab9b8cf7c5bcd984b72bdd5714a22d,To appear in: Vaccine,"In 1924, Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin developed Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) [1] , which serves as the only available vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) since then. BCG has a protection duration from 10 to 25 years [2] , [3] . The world health organization (WHO) recommends a single birth dose of the vaccine in a setting with high risk of TB [4] . The introduction of the vaccine has resulted in a vastly positive effect in eliminating severe disease following TB infections especially among children [5] .Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are infections that attack either the upper or the lower respiratory organs of an individual. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) include laryngitis, common cold, acute rhinitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute rhinosinusitis and acute otitis media. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), on the other hand, include bronchiolitis, acute bronchitis, pneumonia and tracheitis [6] . Other infections attack both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Infections like different forms of Coronavirus attack the upper and lower airways [7] . These infections range from mild to severe, some are even fatal. Most of them are highly contagious and affect many people who are at risk [8] , [9] .Various studies have implied that the BCG vaccine reduces severe diseases related to other infections other than TB [10] , [11] . For instance, a review by Moorlag and his colleagues indicated that BCG vaccination improved antibody production against viral infections [11] . Furthermore, BCG reduces nontuberculosis mycobacterial infections like leprosy and Buruli ulcer [12] . There is also evidence that shows BCG has a preventive effect on bladder cancer and atopic disorders including asthma [13] , [14] . BCG vaccination minimized and eliminated morbidities and mortalities from various upper and lower respirator viral ifections [15] - [17] . We aimed to evaluate the effect BCG vaccination in preventing severe infectious respiratory diseases other than TB as evidence input to guide the strategy of COVID 19 prevention. Therefore the review was 'What is the effect of BCG vaccination in preventing severe infectious respiratory diseases other than TB?'.We developed the review protocol and get it registred on PROSPERO with registration number: CRD42020177274. Two reviewers conducted the literature search and selection of eligible publications.As a means of monitoring quality and consistency, the identified papers were appraised with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool for each of the study design.Human with infectious respiratory disease. There was no exclusion based on age, geographic limit and type of respiratory infection.Vaccination with BCG.Not vaccinated with BCG.Severity of infectious respiratory disease of URTIs or LRTIs, viral or any other form, except TB. There was no time limit to measure outcome of injection with BCG. Outcome of BCG on the participants was considered at any time from one injected with BCG vaccine strains.In this review we included both experimental and quasi-experimental study designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and before and after studies. Furthermore, analytical observational studies including cohort studies, case-control studies and analytical cross-sectional studies were inclued. Only studies published in English were included. We did not set a time limit for studies.An iterative process was used to search the literature aimed to find both published and unpublished studies. To find potentially relevant articles, a comprehensive search with no date limits was performed in MEDLINE, and PubMed platforms followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract and the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all the identified keywords and index terms was undertaken across the same databases with no time limit. The search strategies used for the databases searched are detailed in Annex I. The search for unpublished studies/grey literature was performed in Google scholar and through the review of reference lists and input of content experts. Finally, the reference lists of all reports and articles selected for critical appraisal were searched for additional studies.The final selection was informed by the agreed PICO question. Studies identified by our search strategy were collated and uploaded into Mendeley [18] software and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers for assessment against the inclusion criteria for the review. Full texts of potentially eligible studies were retrieved and assessed in detail against the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. Full-text studies that didn't meet the inclusion criteria were excluded, and reasons for exclusion are provided in Annex II. Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion. The search of the literature was conducted between April and July 2020. All papers published until 9 July 2020 were considered. The search used the following keywords: ""Effect"", ""BCG vaccine"", ""prevention"", ""infectious"", ""severe"", ""respiratory disease"", ""other than"", ""tuberculosis"", ""non-specific effect"". The search terms were used separately and in combination using Boolean operators like ""AND"", ""OR"" and ""NOT"" (Annex I). The results of the search were reported in full in the final systematic review and presented in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity before inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from JBI for all types of studies [19] - [23] . Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion. All studies regardless of their methodological quality underwent data extraction and synthesis. The findings of the quality assessment were presented under Annex III.Data from included articles were extracted using a standardized data extraction format from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) [24] , by two independent reviewers. The data extracted included specific details about the intervention, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question. For the outcome (prevalence), the data extraction format included primary author, publication year, country where the study was conducted, study area, study design, sample size, and prevalence with 95% CI. Any disagreements during the data extraction were resolved through discussion and consensus. Authors of papers were contacted to request missing or additional data where required.Pieces of evidences were synthesized descriptively meta-analysis was not feable because of the methodological and study subject heterogeneity of the included studies. Thus, variables were synthesized narratively and summarized as frequencies and proportions in tables.The intial comprehensive literature search yielded 1,9010 articles which reported on the non-specific effect of BCG vaccination in preventing severe infectious respiratory diseases ( Figure 1 ). Of these, 1197 articles were excluded due to duplication and the unrelated topic of interest. From the remaining 713 articles, 276 articles were excluded after review of their titles and abstracts confirmed non-relevance to this review. Then, 437 articles were screened and among these, 383 were excluded from the reading of the abstracts. Therefore, 54 articles were retrieved for full-text review. Forty-five articles were excluded after full text review. Annex II lists the excluded articles with the rationale for exclusion.The nine studies reviewed aimed to show effect of BCG vaccine on either URTIs or LRTIs, represented both in low and high income settings ( Table 1 ). The study period ranged from 2005 to 2020.Respiratory tract infections attack one or more parts of the respiratory organs of an individual. Most of them are caused by either virus or bacteria. Some of them attack mostly the lower part of the respiratory tract and the others may affect the upper part and some both [9] , [25] . The infection can vary from mild to severe. Although there are infections that can be treated or prevented effectively, there are not effective vaccine or treatment for some [26] - [28] . Although it has been used to develop antibody against mycobacterium Tuberculosis, according to studies BCG vaccine has a non-specific preventive effect on respiratory tract infections other than TB [11] , [29] .Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination was found to have a strong relationship with on COVID-19 disease burden and mortality: 60 individuals per 1 million people were infected in countries with universal BCG vaccination compared with 265 per 1 million people in countries with no BCG vaccination policy. Miller A et al. [30] showed that countries without universal BCG vaccination like Italy, Netherland and the USA have been more severely affected with COVID-19 compared to countries with universal and longlasting BCG vaccination. Most of the low-income countries with universal BCG vaccination had no reproted COVID-19 related deaths. In 55 countries with universal BCG policy, mortality from COVID-19 was less than one individual per 1 million people compared to 16 per 1 million in countries where BCG vaccination is not universal. The starting time of universal BCG policy was also found to affect death caused by COVID-19. Those late starter countries were highly affected in this regard. For instance Iran has declared universal BCG policy in 1984. The death in this country is among the highest ( Table 2) .Another global study in 22 countries by Escobar et al. [31] has strangthend this argument with an imperical analysis. The study categorize countries in to three groups including countries with current BCG policy, interrupted BCG vaccination and never have BCG policy. The findings indicated that countries with current BCG vaccination have lower mortality of COVID -19 as compared to those with interapted vaccine and never had BCG vaccine. Moreover, they found a negative association between mean BCG coverage and death per one million population. The study generally shown there is a 10.4% reduction in COVID -19 related deaths for every 10% increase in the BCG index (Table 2 ).An experimental study by Leentjens et al. [32] has shown that BCG vaccination significantly enhanced antibody which protects the human body from the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). In BCG-vaccinated subjects, hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody responses against the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccine strain were significantly enhanced, compared with the placebo group, and there was a trend toward more-rapid seroconversion. At the baseline, there was no significant difference between BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. Afterward, those in the experimental group developed a significantly higher HI antibody to protect against H1N1 influenza ( Table 2 ).Another experimental study by Hollm-Delgado, et al. [16] revealed that BCG vaccination has a protective effect against acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). They have tested that BCG vaccination reduced the risk of suspected ALRI by 17% to 37%. Age at vaccination was a major factor that created variation in BCG's protective effect on ALRI. If the vaccination is given for those less than or equal to three months at the time of vaccination, it has a better protective effect. When the BCG vaccine was given before diphtheriatetanus-pertussis (DTP) it was found to have a better protective effect than with or after DTP (Table 2) . Stensballe LG. et al. [33] have shown that BCG vaccination has a non-targeted protective effect on minimizing the risk of ALRI among children. The effect was found to be even better among girls. Among BCG unvaccinated children, 9.3% were caught by ALRI while only 4.4% were BCG unvaccinated from healthy infants. ALRI case infants were about three times more likely to be unvaccinated as compared to ALRI negative infants. Stensballe LG. et al. [33] specifically looked at the effect of BCG vaccination on URTIs. The study has showed that BCG vaccination has a protective effect against acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI). In comparison between two groups in the period of the study, it was uncovered that there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of AURTI in the BCG group. There was also a significant increase in IFN-γ and IL-10 levels in the BCG group compared to the non-BCG (placebo) group. However, the change in pre-and post-BCG on IFN-γ and IL-10 levels was insignificant. The increase of the IFN-γ level was positively and significantly correlated with the increase of the infiltrate and scar diameters in the BCG group (Table 2) .De Castro MJ et al. [34] found out that BCG vaccination at birth may decrease hospitalization due to respiratory infections not related to TB through heterologous protection. They showed that 90% of admissions due to respiratory infection not attributable to TB occurred in children under 4 years old. Only 11 028 (2.5%) of the cases were in BCG-vaccinated children which was significantly lower compared with in non-BCG-vaccinated children giving total prevention fraction of 41.4% (Table 3) .Roth et al. [35] have identfied variability in the overall mortality ratio by BCG vaccination status. They found that five major causes of mortality in the study were malaria, pneumonia, acute diarrhea, chronic diarrhea, and meningitis/encephalitis. The number of deaths per 100 person-year caused by pneumonia among BCG vaccinated children was 0.31 as compared to 0.44 among the unvaccinated ones ( Table 3) .A study by Kleinnijenhuis et al. [36] demonstrated that monocytes can be functionally reprogrammed or 'trained' to exhibit an enhanced and lasting phenotype after vaccination with BCG. Additionally, it was implied that vaccination with BCG induces two types of immune responses. First, it induces a classic specific immune response involving antigen-specific T cells and memory leading to protection against TB. Second, BCG induces adaptive trained immunity based on functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects not only against TB but also against other infections. In a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments, the researchers demonstrate that a NOD2-mediated epigenetic change at the level of histone methylation (H3K4me3) is the mechanism through which BCG enhances innate immune responses. In conclusion, the study showed that innate immunity in humans has adaptive features and that it has the capacity to display an enhanced response upon re-infection. The immune response of BCG vaccine has a further effect on hospitalization and death.Improvements in a body's clearance of apoptotic or dead cells by alveolar phagocytes could be facilitated by BCG vaccines. It is also evident in an experimental study that [37] BCG vaccine brings about a TH1/TH17 T cell repertoire. This process then facilitates an efficient virus clearance and also it protects the lung from inflammation. It was also seen that BCG is a strong inducer of T-helper type 1 immune responses [15] .Though BCG vaccine was developed targeting childhood TB, its non-specific immune effects have been figured out [38] . For instance, it has a protective effect against those respiratory tract infections that have no specific vaccine-like RSV [37] , [39] . Generally, BCG vaccine reduced morbidity and mortality among children from severe infectious diseases such as pneumonia. There is also evidence that BCG vaccine halve the deaths caused by non-TB infections [40] - [42] .Although BCG protected against both the upper and lower respiratory system infections [29] , [33] , [34] , the majority of the studies identified in this review focused on LRTI of viral origin. A study by Miller A et al, [30] for instance, revealed that BCG vaccination has a strong protective effect on the current pandemic of COVID 19. This argument was strongly supported by Escobar et al. [31] . A significant reduction in COVID -19 realted mortality was achived in countries with BCG vaccine policy. It was argued that in countries with universal BCG vaccination like Japan, the incidence and the spread of the virus is lower than countries with no universal BCG vaccination like the USA, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. The spread rate and number of deaths in these countries supported the authors' argument [43] . A significant amount of risk of acute LRTIs has been reduced with BCG vaccine among children under-five years of age [16] . Similarly, Stensballe et al have uncovered the protective effect of BCG vaccine against ALRTIs in Guinea-Bissau, with girls better protected than boys [33] .The 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) was known for its fast spread [44] , [45] . A clinical trial conducted in 2015 has shown that a combined vaccination of BCG and influenza vaccine strains had a better effect on preventing the virus [32] . The vaccine plays a significant role in the clearance of apoptotic or dead cells. This enables the body to prevent lethal influenza A virus pneumonia. Human RSV, another major cause for hospitalization mostly among immune-compromised individuals, can be curbed with BCG vaccine [37] . A commentary by Rey-Jurado E. et al. suggested that BCG vector vaccine is a safe and efficient mechanism to prevent hRSV [39] .Respiratory tract infections also attack the upper respiratory tract in humans [46] , [47] . These infections are common among old age population [48] . The immune system changes with age. Though the number of T cells does not decrease with aging, their function decreases significantly. Therefore, individuals with old age are susceptible for infectious diseases [49] , [50] . BCG vaccine was found to protect against AURTIs among old age population [29] . The vaccine increased the Th1 response, shown by the increase of IFN-γ level, reflecting through the formation of infiltrates and scars at the site of the BGC vaccinations.The effect of BCG vaccine included reduction in mortality and hospitalization. For example, Roth A. et al [35] . showed that BCG vaccine can significantly reduce mortality from pneumonia among children. Similar findings were also reported by others [51] , [52] . Furthermore, hospitalization related to respiratory tract infection among BCG vaccinated children was significantly lower than in non-vaccinated children [34] .We recognize the difference in susceptibility to infectious respiratory infections among BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. This disparity is perhaps because of BCG's effect on the immune system. The immune response to BCG vaccine is twofold. It is evident that the vaccine strengthens the human T cell immunity against respiratory tract infections [36] , [37] . BCG facilitates development of immune memory leading to protection against TB via classic specific immune response involving antigen-specific T cells. Secondly, it induces adaptive trained immunity based on functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects not only against tuberculosis but also against other infections. There is also an evidence immunization with BCG significantly improved efferocytosis (the clearance of apoptotic or dead cells) by alveolar phagocytes and rendered 100% protection against lethal influenza A virus pneumonia [53] .There are certain limitations of this review. The studies lacked homogeneity due to the differences in the study populations and outcome measures. Hence, the dissimilarity between the study design and populations of the studies limited the ability to synthesize results for a meta-analysis. Additionally, the search strategy limited the results to English and therefore limited the number of studies available for review.BCG vaccine has been shown a tremendous effect in averting severe cases of childhood TB since its introduction. Its protective effect, however, goes beyond TB to include other bacterial and viral respiratory infections through immune modluations. This reviewe showed that both URTIs and LRTIs were lower among BCG vaccinated individuals. The incidence of and mortality from COVID 19 was significantly lower in countries with universal BCG vaccination as compared to countries without such a policy.As synthesized in this review BCG vaccine has the potential to offer nonspecific immune protection against many respiratory tract infections including COVID 19. We recommend countries with universal BCG vaccination to enhance effective vaccination coverage. Countries with no universal policy of BCG vaccination should reintroduce the vaccine targeting those groups highly exposed to COVID 19 indlcusing frontlone ehalth workers and individuals with high risk of dealth such as those above 60 years of age.Given the potential benefits of BCG vaccination in preventing severe infectious respiratory infections, it is crucial to deterime the mechanism. Further, research is needed to continue to develop the evidence base on the effect of BCG vaccination in preventing severe infectious respiratory diseases like COVID-19. Welldesigned studies such as randomized control trials with appropriate sample size and power are recommended to establish whether the vaccine could be beneficial in special populations such as the health workforce. Evidence that reflects on the effect of BCG vaccination overtime, in different context and across age groups in the prevention of severe infectious respiratory diseases are also lacking. Additionally, new research will help to determine cost savings related to BCG vaccination in preventing severe infectious respiratory diseases.The authors declare that they have no any conflict of interest.The rapid spread of the Coronavirus pandemic and its significant health and social impact urges the search for effective and readily avaiabel solutions to mitigate the damages. Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has attracted attention. The aim of this review was evidence synthesis on the effect of BCG vaccine in preventing severe infectious respiratory disease including COVD-19, but not tuberculosis. We considered studies conducted on human participants of any study design from any country setting that were published in Enlgish. We did a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Scopus and Google scholar databases and a free search on Google. The identified studies were appraised and relevant data were extracted using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. The extracted findings were synthesized with tables and narrative summary. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicated that BCG vaccine has a strong protective effect against both upper and lower acute respiratory tract infections. For instance in countries with universal BCG vaccination policy, the incidence of COVID-19 was lower compared to the counterparts. Addtionally, BCG vaccine was found to protect against infections like lethal influenza A virus, pandemic influenza (H1N1), and other acute respiratory tract infections. BCG improved the human body's immune response involving antigen-specific T cells and memory cells. It also induced adaptive functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects against different respiratory infections other than tuberculosis. In countries with universal BCG vaccination, the incidence and death from acute respiratory viral infection including COVID -19 is significantly low. However, there is an urgent need for further evidence from well-designed studies to understand the possible role of BCG vaccination over time and across age groups, its possible benefits in special populations such as health workers and cost-savings related to a policy of universal BCG vaccination.

72d1b67f458e79e632d317cf136b7694ebfb0a2b,Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 spreading with asymptomatic infected and interacting peoples,"The infectious diseases was always a challenge of scientific to prevent the pandemic spreading. Virology, biology, medicine, epidemiology as well as mathematical modeling are involved in the understanding and fights against the spreading of virus. Mathematicians have addressed this problem several years ago, giving birth to a new pattern of the epidemiology, the so-called ""mathematical epidemiology"", [1, 8, 9, 13, 25] . Compartmental models was built, with several configurations, to describe the dynamic of the virus, [5, 9, 19, 21, 22, 25] . In 1927, the concept of threshold was highlighted by Kermack and Mc Kendrick who established the famous threshold theorem [13] . It was proved that a threshold, representing the number of new cases resulting by an infectious individual in a susceptible population, and quantified by the basic reproduction number R 0 , allows crucial information on spreading of the disease. Indeed, R 0 aims to ensure the stability of an equilibrium, mainly, a Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE), since if R 0 < 1 then the DFE is stable whereas it will be unstable if R 0 > 1, [3, 6, 7, 13, 18] .In this work we are interested by the new disease Covid-19. It is well known that this disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus which is a member of Coronavirus family. Covid-19 causes respiratory infections that may escalate to severe effects. The main transmission routes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are through coughing, sneezing, contacting infected people, or touching items or surfaces that are contaminated with fecal traces [2] . The severity of this virus lies in its spreading speed throughout the world to becomes an epidemic.In absence of the vaccine, governments adopted different types of strategies to prevent worsening of the epidemic, as containment, quarantine,... Against to government that opt for no restriction of people moving and following the idea that virus when infecting population, this last becomes immune to it and then the pandemic decreases to be a standard influenza infection, the Moroccan government has taken several measures to prevent the propagation of the virus: the hospital isolation of the individual that are confirmed to be infected, the quarantine of interacting people and the strictest containment strategy was imposed across the country, to restrict the population mobility.Our goal in this work is to build a modified compartmental epidemiological (SIR) model describing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus under the policies adopted in Morocco. In this model we incorporates the isolation of infected people, we take account on the people moving freely and are infected but don't have symptoms and added the measure of the quarantine of the people interacting with an affected individual. The model is then described by a dynamical system enclosing a closed population with Susceptible (S), confirmed Infected (I ), Asymptomatic (A), Quarantined (Q), Recovered (R) and Died (D), peoples respectively. In literature, Several papers analyze the evolution of Covid-19 disease using (SIR) models, [4, [10] [11] [12] 14, 15, 20, 24, 27] , in which asymptomatic and quarantined peoples are considered. the aim of these works is the calculus of the basic reproduction number R 0 , the study of the local and global equilibria stability and to analyze the impact of several factors as seasonal succession [24] , meteorological conditions, vaccination strategy, free medical care for the diagnostic COVID-19 patient, [11] and some local control strategies adopted for some cities [12] . In some cases, an attention is given to stochastic approach, [15] .Our approach is different, since the relationship between the compartments is different, we observe that the totality of confirmed infected individual comes from the asymptomatic infected and quarantined people not from susceptible as explained in the beginning of the following section. The second feature lies in the fact that the model does not admit a stable endemic equilibrium point, but several Disease-Free Equilib-ria (DFE), since a coexistence of a stable number of infected and uninfected people is not realistic due to the nature of Covid-19 virus spreading. Actually, as observed, after the containment breaking, the number of new contamination increases in several countries. Finally, our object is different, since we establish a relationship between the pertinence of the containment strategies and a containment control coefficient.Based on those considerations we build the model, study the positivity, boundness and calculate the basic reproduction number R 0 for a Disease-Free Equilibrium. We discuss the containment strategy and establish a relationship between R 0 and the containment control coefficient c 0 , describing the degree of containment. We simulate several scenarios by changing c 0 and analyze the peaks of different situations and diagram phases. We highlight in these simulations the required relation between the c 0 and R 0 together with the stability of a (DFE). Finally, we investigate in the simulations a worst scenario in which the containment is not respected in the same way with time, which leads to different coefficient c 0 . Using three values of c 0 , corresponding to three phases in the Morocco containment, we produce simulations that are very close to real data of active infected in Morocco.This paper is organized as follows, in the second section we describe the model compartments, study the positivity, compute the basic reproduction number R 0 . In Sect. 3, we introduce the containment and establish the relation between R 0 and the containment control coefficient c 0 . Section 4, is devoted to simulations and discussion. We termine by a conclusion and perspectives.Our model is a modified (SIR) model, it is conceptually different from literature [11, 12, 15, 24] since to build our model we formulates some assumptions governing the interaction between compartments: firstly, we assume that the totality of confirmed infected individual comes from the asymptomatic infected and quarantined people not from susceptible. In fact, a susceptible person can be contaminated by an asymptomatic infected individuals and then becomes themselves, in the first step, asymptomatic infected. Indeed, in one hand, the contaminated individuals are contagious when they are asymptomatic, otherwise, they are hospitalized and isolated and then can't infect others. On the other hand, once infected, a susceptible person goes through a virus incubation period (3-14 days) [2] , at this stage, this person has no symptoms. Secondly, we assume that the time scale is short enough so that natural births and deaths are neglected. We suppose also that a recovered person will be immunized and can't be infected again.Finally, we suppose that the population is closed and divided on six compartments of individuals, that are,The evolution of susceptible people is given by the following equatioṅ where −β S A describes susceptible individual that interacts with asymptomatic infected individuals, acquires infection with transmission rate (contact rate) β and becomes hence asymptomatic infected. −αβ S I models the proportion of susceptible people who have contacted a confirmed infected individual and are putted in quarantine with rate α. ξ Q is the proportion of quarantined population that are negatively diagnosed with a release rate of quarantined compartment ξ . The second equation describes infected individualṡThe term θ Q describes the proportion of quarantined people that are diagnosed positive, θ is the rate of becoming contaminated. δ A is the proportion of asymptomatic people that becoming symptomatic with a rate δ, the term μI represents the portion of recovered people and d I is the disease death rate. The third equation describes the evolution of asymptomatic infected people,where λA represents the portion of asymptomatic individual that recovering by their own immune systems, λ is the recovering rate. The equation of quarantined individual is given aṡall terms are already evoked. Equations of recovered and died peoples are respectivelẏThe schematic diagram of all compartments interconnection is given in the Fig. 1 . All parameters involved in the model are positive constants.Using the above depiction, the dynamical system modeling the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is given as follows:(1) The total accumulative population N :First of all, it is natural to ask whether this dynamical system provides a non-negative trajectories or not.Proposition 1 All trajectories of the the system (1) starting in R 6 + are non-negative.Proof Remark firstly that from the equation of asymptomatic infected population in system (1), we getȦwhich implies thatHence, for A(0) ≥ 0, we obtain thatNow we check the sign of vector field in the boundaries of R 6 + . For I = 0 and Q ≥ 0 we haveİso, the vector field of I is pointed inside R 6 + . Similarly, for Q = 0 and S, I ≥ 0 we obtaiṅand hence the vector field of Q is pointed inside R 6 + . Using the same argument we prove that vector fields of S, R and D are pointed inside R 6 + . We conclude then that all trajectories starting in R 6 + remains in it thereafter.Proposition 2 All trajectories of the system (1) starting in R 6 + are bounded.Proof The positivity of the trajectories and the fact that d N dt (t) = 0, leads to boundedness of them. It follows that all trajectories starting in R 6 + , belong toA practical and efficient tool to prevent the spread of an epidemic, is the basic reproduction number R 0 , it can be interpreted as ""the number of secondary infections resulting from a single primary infection into an otherwise susceptible population"", see [3, 18] . Mathematically, we are interested by the value of R 0 at an equilibrium corresponding to a constant susceptible population in absence of the infectious agent, commonly called the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). R 0 aims to check the stability of DFE, if R 0 > 1, then DFE is unstable and a sustainable spread of the pandemic occurs while if R 0 < 1, DFE is asymptotically stable and the disease will die out. We invoke the theory of next generation operator [3, 6, 18] , to compute the basic reproduction number. Note that since the population is closed then we can compute D ashence we restrict our self to infected, susceptible and recovered variables (A, I , Q, S, R), see [3, 18] . Consider now a DFE equilibrium X * = (S * , 0, 0, 0, R * , D * ) of the full system (1), with S * = N − R * − D * and Y * = (0, 0, 0, S * , R * ) its restriction to subsystem (A, I , Q, S, R).Following the same approach of [3] , we consider the infected bloc I c = (A, I , Q) ,where Y = (A, I , Q, S, R) andConsider now, the Jacobian matrix A = D I * C H , where I * C is such that Y * = (I * C , S * , R * ) = (0, 0, 0, S * , R * ) is the DFE equilibrium.We getThe matrix A can be decomposed onWe observe that M ≥ 0 and D > 0 is a diagonal matrix.With those considerations, the basic reproduction number R 0 is given bywhere ρ(B) denotes the spectral radius of the matrix B.We obtain hence the following result which highlights the link between the stability of the DFE equilibrium X * = (S * , 0, 0, 0, R * , D * ) of the full system (1) and the threshold 1 of R 0 (S * ).If R 0 (S * ) > 1 then the DFE equilibrium X * is unstable. If R 0 (S * ) < 1, then the DFE equilibrium X * is asymptotically stable.For the proof we can see [3] .As shown for the reproduction number, the eradication of the pandemic depends on the threshold value, 1, of R 0 (S * ) at the disease-free equilibrium point, but this value depends on several parameters, among others β and S * . According to the expression of R 0 (S * ) at a DFE equilibrium X * = (S * , 0, 0, 0, R * , D * ), the eradication of the pandemic is constrained bywhich is equivalent to fulfill β (δ + λ) S * < 1 Fig. 2 The components (S 1 ,which are equivalent toSo, it's necessary that the transmission rate β of the virus must be lower than a critical level β c (S * ) depending on S * . Hence, with a high spreading virus (β large), to be stable, a DFE must have δ + λ S * and (μ + d I )(ξ + θ) αθ S * sufficiently larges, which can occurs with small values of S * and in presence of suitable parameters values. This fact can be interpreted, since the population is closed, as there is a large number of infected individuals and the pandemic achieves a high peak before to decrease, as shown in Fig. 2 .To avoid the outbreak of the pandemic, the transmission rate must be controlled, but it is well known that β depends on whether the virus is spreading, which depends itself on the population managing strategy adopted by governments. Among control strategies used to prevent spreading of disease, the containment for all people throughout the country, is used to restrict the population mobility and limit the possibility of contamination. With this strategy we can reduce the spreading rate.Let c 0 be the containment control coefficient with which we can reduce spreading of pandemic, the value of c 0 is correlated to whether the containment is made. We define hence a new rate of contamination (contact)and substitute in the model (1) the factor β by β . We show now that a DFE equilibrium point X * = (S * , 0, 0, 0, R * , D * ), to be stable, must be such that the containment control coefficient c 0 is upper than the basic reproduction number R 0 for the model without containment.Corollary 1 Consider the system (1) with containment control coefficient c 0 . Then a DFE equilibrium point X * = (S * , 0, 0, 0,Proof In the case where β is substituted by β of the Eq. (4), the basic reproduction number will be given byAs shown in theorem (1), to be stable, the DFE point X * must be such thatwe get thenLet us remark that for c 0 = 1 there is no containment and in this caseOur hope in this section is to illustrate with simulations the outcomes of previous sections. Let us first discuss the estimation of the parameters values based on literature and the publicly announced data by Moroccan government. The contamination rate where s is te number of contacts that a person can meet in one day, estimated at s = 40 persons, and p is the percentage of contamination for an infected individual in one day, estimated at p ≈ 3%, see [17, 23] . N = 37 · 10 6 is the Moroccan population. HenceThe rate of quarantined individual that becoming infected, θ is estimated by using the average of confirmed infected individual proportions among quarantined peoples, see [16] . The Release rate from quarantined to susceptible people is given aswhere θ = Number of quarantined people becoming infected Number of quarantined people .The value of θ is given in Table 1 with an interval range taking account of data in [16] . All values of parameters are listed in the Table 1 .We simulate the actual and forecast evolution of the epidemic in Morocco under different values of the control coefficient c 0 using Matlab software.We suppose the evolution starts from (S 0 , I 0 , A 0 , Q 0 , R 0 , D 0 ) = (N −68, 1, 7 , 60, 0, 0) at 02 march 2020. For S * = N − 10 6 = S * = 3.6 · 10 7 , the pandemic is still spreading, and we havewhich bear out the condition (5), since Figure 5 shows that the higher is the containment control coefficient c 0 (i.e. containment more respected), the more susceptible population is conserved. Figure 6 illustrates the evolution of infected population. The higher is c 0 , the lower is the peak.The same conclusion can made for Figs. 7 and 8 since increasing c 0 has as consequence the decrease of peak of asymptomatic and quarantined population respectively. Figure 9 is an illustration of the phase diagram (S, I ), it is observed that the higher is the coefficient c 0 , the lower is the peak of infected people and the higher is the Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 spreading with… The simulations of the containment strategy throughout the control containment coefficient c 0 show the efficiency of this strategy to reduce the magnitude of the epidemic and prevent spreading of it.In this subsection of simulation we would test a worst case in which the home containment is not respected in the same way throughout all duration of the containment. This fact can be interpreted by the changing in the containment control coefficient. As remarked in the pandemic situation in Morocco, the confinement passes through three phases: the first phase was the establishment of the containment, the second phase was the prolongation of it with less respect, and the third phase is the actual critical phase in which the containment is very badly respect by population and a widely non-compliance with the instructions is observed. The Fig. 10 shows a comparison between the infected population produced by the model with three phases of c 0 (red curve) and the real situation of the active infected people (star-curve ( * )) in Morocco, see [16] . Figure 11 presents the diagram phase of the susceptible/infected population in the case of three phases home containment. Comparing this curve with that of the Fig. 9 (c 0 = 1 0.844 ), we show that the new curve has three local maximums, describing the change of the infection rate, instead one global maximum.Let us analyze the basic reproduction numbers of S * 7 = 3.63 · 10 7 and S * 8 = 3.645 · 10 7 . Firstly, we have In this work, a (S I AQ R D) was built, integrating asymptomatic people and the isolation of infected person, the quarantine of contacting people and the home containment of all population, strategies. It is established by theoretical investigation and illustrated by simulations that the level of containment is very important to prevent the disease spreading in the absence of vaccine. Several scenarios are tested with different values of the containment control coefficient c 0 . A relation between the basic reproduction number and c 0 was carried out, showing that, a home containment not suitably practiced may lead to a persistence of the pandemic beyond the provided period.However, we know that the information on the evolution of the pandemic depends on various factors, as the number of tests, which vary considerably each day, detection of person who contacting an infected people,... So, without full data on the real evolution of the pandemic, especially for asymptomatic infected people, it is very hard to estimate parameters, our contribution on the estimation of them is an assignment that must be performed in the next work. Secondly, the choice of containment control values are made theoretically, and it is shown that some values coincide with the real situation in Morocco, it will be interesting to correlate these values with a percentage of the quality of the home containment level, obviously with an important work on the quantification of the confinement.",Morocco,abstract,2020-08-17,08
9ee3386d7a8b4db7a4b21992da7d91642021cdfa,Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 response in low-and middle-income countries: don't overlook the role of mobile phone communication COVID-19 response in low-and middle-income countries: don't overlook the role of mobile phone communication Perspective,"The 2019 coronavirus pandemic illustrates the importance of public health response strategies for timely control of the outbreak. The failure of well-resourced countries such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom to adequately contain this pandemic highlights the complexity of large-scale containment measures and raises concerns for its impact in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), where fragile health systems, competing priorities, poverty and crowding affect the capacity to manage health emergencies (Agyeman et al. 2020) . Indeed, a recent analysis of health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 showed that many LMICs are not operationally ready to prevent, detect, or control an outbreak (Kandel et al. 2020) . In fact, public health measures useful in other settings can negatively impact disadvantaged people in LMICs. For example, many migrant workers found themselves without jobs after the announcement of the India lockdown, compelling them to unexpectedly return home on crowded trains and buses with transmission implications (Pulla 2020) . However, the rapidly increased access to mobile phones and smartphone technology in health care staff and amongst citizens provides huge potential for public health workers, frontline clinicians and institutions to communicate and act swiftly in a setting of rapidly changing COVID-19 guidelines (Wallis et al. 2017) . In this article, reflecting on worldwide initiatives as well as our experience at Tygerberg Hospital (TBH) in the Western Cape province of South Africa, we discuss three ways in which mobile phone communication helps support patient care and disseminate information during the COVID-19 pandemic.Since 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched several calls to scale-up affordable and practical health technologies in less resourced settings (WHO 2015 (WHO -2017 .Today, mobile apps are widely used, thus enabling healthcare workers to use their smartphone to share information with and request opinions from specialists, public health J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f institutions and governmental agencies. In addition, these apps allow individuals and groups with different roles and responsibilities to rapidly communicate. In the COVID-19 and other infectious diseases epidemics, such as diphtheria and measles, medical groups from TBH, the second largest hospital in South Africa, have successfully used broadcast groups to rapidly communicate key issues and guidelines. Group members include medical, nursing, security, administrative, and laboratory staff as well as the ambulance service, disaster management experts and provincial public health officials. Communication is overseen by a medical manager and excludes patient identifying details.Medical facilities in LMICs are generally spread over several buildings in large areas. These facilities operate like villages with thousands of medical personnel units working together on any given day. A sudden increase in patients requires localized reorganization and rapid communication between staff members and facilities to effectively handle emergency situations while receiving continuously updated information on relevant protocols. Local referral for acute care and clinical review can be conducted through free apps, such as Vula mobile (vulamobile.com), a healthcare app that connects primary healthcare workers with oncall specialists in South Africa. This start-up is now supported by the South African National Department of Health and is being rolled out across all nine provinces. In most African countries, intensive care unit (ICU) beds and personnel trained in critical care are limited to tertiary hospitals. Up-to-date information on the availability of ICU beds in the nearest tertiary hospital can be shared daily in designated mobile phone groups. This facilitates the expeditious transfer of patients and judicious use of ambulance services (Salman et al. 2020 ). Finally, in many LMICs, community health workers are integral in the primary healthcare system as they liaise between communities and healthcare facilities. These community workers are generally based in small hospitals in underserved areas. Often, they will be the first point of contact for ill people in the community, stressing the importance of keeping them informed on containment measures, case definitions, the spread and clinical characteristics of disease and referral pathways. Previous studies show that the successful J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f use of mobile phone interaction between community health workers and hospital-based physicians can address health issues related to maternal and child health, family planning, infectious diseases and trauma (Braun et al. 2013; Anstey Watkins et al. 2018; Feroz et al. 2020 ). In addition, having clinical guidelines on mobile phones, in a structured interactive workflow, can reduce community health workers' errors in diagnosis and management by more than one third (Florez-Arango et al. 2011).Monitoring cases as COVID-19 spreads appears crucial in order to contain the impact of the pandemic, to facilitate rapid implementation of isolation measures, to perform epidemiologic research on the origin and spread of the outbreak and to communicate the characteristics of high risk patients. Collecting data can be difficult in rural areas where infrastructure and communication channels are limited. By supporting direct communication between frontline workers and program managers, mobile phones can be a gamechanger (Table 1 ). In addition, if inadequate laboratory capacity requires clinical case definitions of suspected cases, rapid and clear communication between clinicians and public health agencies is central to effective monitoring. Cell phone messaging technology was effectively used for community epidemic surveillance in peripheral health facilities during the Sierra Leone Ebola virus epidemic (Jia and Mohamed 2015) and for rabies surveillance in Tanzania (Mtema et al. 2016) . Further, the dispatch of mobile phones led to a functional infectious disease surveillance system after the Sichuan earthquake in China (Yang et al. 2009 ). Whenever possible, mobile phones with global positioning system capacity can be used to integrate coordinate data to track cases in a high spatial resolution. Contract tracing has been used for several infectious disease outbreaks, including the Ebola epidemic (Sacks et al. 2015) . Both China and South Korea have achieved sustained COVID-19 epidemic suppression while using mobile phone apps aimed at instantaneous digital case and contact tracing for restrictions on movement and recommendations on risk-stratified quarantine. A mathematical simulation study suggested J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that a mobile app is the best way to implement fast and efficient contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic (Ferretti et al. 2020) . The South African government has recently partnered with cell phone companies to track mobile location data to trace contacts of an infected person for possible testing and quarantine (Table 1) .The mobility and popularity of mobile technologies means that most people always have their The mHealth Assessment and Planning for Scale Toolkit, established through a collaboration between the United Nations Foundation and the WHO, is specifically aimed at facilitating successful scaling up of mobile health products for long-term sustainability (WHO 2015).In the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, TBH personnel use mobile phone applications to communicate health messages on social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. Also, short video's sent to patients awaiting test results explain self-isolation. In addition, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), using public WIFI, allows for calls to inform patients about test results without using mobile data. Further, messages discouraging irrational behaviour may counteract fake news. The messages are often sent by a healthcare provider known to the recipient, which likely increases their impact and limits misinformation and stigmatizing of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patients. Since many healthcare workers in LMICs communicate with their (chronic) patients via mobile phone messages, this route can now also be used to remotely monitor patients for acute and chronic conditions, particularly when combined with video conferencing. However, the appropriateness of the communication platform and the type of information the doctor can share must be considered to ensure that boundaries of doctor-patient interaction do not become blurred.In conclusion, it is evident from these three examples that mobile phones have helped healthcare workers in LMICs in data collection and reporting, organization of their workflow, and communication with other healthcare workers, public health institutions and patients.Therefore, we recommend that crisis management plans to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs strongly consider incorporating a centrally coordinated reporting and communication system using mobile phones. This may require the delivery of mobile phones to healthcare workers without their own devices. Access to public WIFI may be a limiting factor. Other challenges include ethical concerns around patient privacy and consent and concerns regarding equipment maintenance (Ferretti et al. 2020) . Familial sharing of phones and the possibility that individuals own multiple SIM cards or mobiles can affect the accuracy of information sharing and lead to privacy issues. Also, there are concerns related to the possible leakage of medical information via contact tracing apps. The purpose of an automated decentralized contact tracing system is to identify contacts of a COVID-19 case, inherently requiring at least a limited amount of personal information potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access (Bengio et al. 2020) . A scoring method or scale to objectively assess app privacy could be a key tool for systematically comparing apps and make decisions on their use in specific settings (Benjumea et al. 2020) . Finally, careful precautions must be taken to avoid mobile phones themselves being a vector for virus transmission since previous data show that respiratory viruses, including e.g. influenza virus, are found on up to 38% of health-care workers' mobile phones (Pillet et al. 2016) . The safe use of mobile phone devices and protecting personal health information transmitted over mobile phones is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f essential, as is ensuring that we utilize every resource available in settings where the preparedness to respond to outbreaks is relatively weak.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.No ethical approval was required.All the authors have no conflict of interest to declare.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Direct availability of a reliable response to individual concerns prevents the spread of fake news and reduces public anxiety.sacoronavirus.co.za",South Africa,first author,2020-08-04,08
91d90719bfafa42ba73d80e8ba06327621dafb85,Management Strategies of Patients with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 , is the third known virus of the coronaviridae family to cause outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome. 1 Since the recognition of the disease as a pandemic, concerns have arisen over patients suffering immune-mediated illnesses requiring management with immunomodulatory (IM) or immunosuppressant (IS) therapies, given their higher risk for suffering more severe forms of COVID-19. 2 This review discusses the challenges in treating neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in the COVID-19 era and proposes algorithms for tailoring potential management of acute relapses as well as the use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during this critical period.The NMOSD represents a group of immunologically mediated, inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disorders, involving the production of auto-reactive antibodies (Abs) against various neuroglial structures. Autoantibodies against water channel aquaporin-4 (Anti AQP-4 IgG1) are the most common Abs, 3 although other known overlapping Abs include those against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG (anti-MOG) 4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). 5 Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) contributes to the pathophysiology, where polarization of T-lymphocytes towards helper Th-17 and Th-2 subtypes results in cytokine network alteration 6, 7 and promotes pro-inflammatory cascades and milieu conducive for B-lymphocytes. A major pathophysiologic role is played by Interleukin (IL) 6, a cytokine specifically involved in relapse severity, CNS injury and degree of disability. 8 Disability in NMOSD is highly related to relapses; reduction of relapse frequency and adequate relapse management are thus of paramount importance. 9Innate immunity is initially activated following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with increased expression of inflammatory markers (eg CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin) and type-1 interferons (IFN) in an attempt to limit viral replication and spread. Ensuing activation of phagocytosis targets infected cells. 2 Eventually, adaptive immunity is activated, and a major role is played by CMI via activation of virus-specific T-cytotoxic cells (Tc-CD8). Antibody-mediated immunity and the complement cascade (particularly involving C3, C5) additionally aid antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. 10 Under optimal conditions, the immune response is well regulated and results in effective viral clearance and a good clinical outcome. 2 However, in other conditions, viral virulence mechanisms result in dysregulation of the immune response and unrestrained viral replication, increased viral load, delayed IFN production, accumulation of neutrophils and monocytes, and reduction in B and T cells. A storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines follows, characterized by pooling of IL-2, −6, −8, −10, and −21, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-ß. 11 This creates a vicious circle of overactive innate and dampened adaptive immune responses that are usually associated with clinical deterioration, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thrombophilia and multiple systems organ failure. 4 Older age, male gender, smoking, the presence of comorbidities (particularly diabetes, cardiac and respiratory diseases) and immunosuppression were all found to be factors predisposing to dysregulation of the immune response and thus a worse clinical course among COVID-19 positive patients. 2, 4, 12 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created unparalleled challenges for neurologists to deliver the best care to patients suffering NMOSD. Questions that are yet to be addressed include: (1) whether exposure to certain DMT regimens poses a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection that may require discontinuation, transient interruption or substitution of therapies, encouraging adoption of appropriate risk-stratification strategies in the context of individual patient profiles as well as of drug properties; (2) whether infection with COVID-19, even if asymptomatic, can precipitate acute relapses in otherwise stable patients, as can any other infection although shared immunopathological pathways between the two disorders would necessitate further risk stratification.Limiting unnecessary procedures in medical centers to preserve resources and reduce person-to-person contact warrant consideration (eg delaying follow-up MRI scans and reducing the frequency of routine laboratory monitoring in stable patients). Further measures, such as suspending non-essential in-person consultations and clinic visits or substituting it with remote interventions should also be encouraged (eg checking laboratory or MRI results through telecommunications). 13 Tailored recommendations for neurologists managing NMOSD patients are currently needed, especially in the case of patients acquiring COVID-19.In patients with NMOSD, studies have shown that permanent damage from relapses leads to cumulative disability; therefore, the consensus among NMOSD experts is that every relapse requires treatment and that rescue medications should be initiated as early as possible. Preventive treatments should be continued during relapse management as they play a role in recovery and ameliorating relapse severity. 5, 14, 15 Treatment decisions regarding NMOSD relapses should be individualized according to COVID-19 suspicion, relapse manifestations, need for hospitalization and previous patient responses. Escalation of relapse treatment improves outcome, and the sequence of therapies is crucial until a satisfactory response is achieved. Administration of intravenous methylprednisolone, 1 g daily for 5-7 consecutive days, is typically considered to be the initial treatment of choice and patients are encouraged to receive infusions at home whenever possible. [16] [17] [18] [19] However, in severe relapses (expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores ≥2 points), this first-line treatment is not sufficient and additional strategies are required to minimize any residual impairments. [20] [21] [22] In view of the pathophysiology of NMOSD where a strong humoral response underlies the disease process, plasma exchange (PLEX) seems to be the most appropriate therapy in severe relapses and it is accepted as the second-line therapy for severe steroid-refractory NMOSD attacks with more favorable outcome. 23, 24 The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) considers NMOSD to be a category II indication for PLEX.With the evidence of complex interactions between the cytokine storm, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombophilia resulting from COVID-19 infection 25, 26 PLEX offers effective removal of inflammatory cytokines from the blood, stabilization of endothelial membranes, and reversal of hypercoagulability. [25] [26] [27] However, PLEX is an invasive procedure with a longer hospital stay as well as a higher risk of infections and hemodynamic instability when compared to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), especially for patients on immunosuppressants. 28 Hence, IVIG administration could be a relatively safer option with favorable results in relapse treatment in patients with neurological manifestations not warranting hospital admission [29] [30] [31] (Figure 1) .Furthermore, high IVIG doses administered to patients with severe COVID-19 were found to successfully halt the progression of the illness and improve clinical outcomes. 33, 34 Monthly IVIG administration is also considered to be an effective treatment option in preventing NMOSD relapses in patients with anti-MOG disease, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to its immune-boosting and antiviral properties. [35] [36] [37] Various immunosuppressive agents including azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and cyclophosphamide (CTX), as well as monoclonal antibodies including rituximab (RTX), eculizumab, and tocilizumab have been reported effective in reducing the annualized relapse rate and stabilizing EDSS scores of NMOSD patients. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] The suggested treatment algorithm for the initiation and maintenance of DMTs is outlined in Figure 2 .This purine antimetabolite is structurally similar to endogenous purine bases and interferes with DNA synthesis. This results in T cell apoptosis and subsequent immunosuppression. 43 As an immunosuppressive medication, this drug increases the risk of bacterial, viral and fungal infection especially when combined with corticosteroids. 43 Lymphopenia (especially grade 3 and 4; <500 cells/mL) was found to increase the risk of opportunistic infection, so frequent WBC monitoring as well as dose reduction or even medication cessation should be considered. 44, 45 In the management of NMOSD, AZA is considered to be a first-line therapy, and no evidence to date has Recommendations AZA can be continued as a maintenance therapy in NMOSD patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with regular blood count monitoring. Dosages can be adjusted based on individual patient profile, disease severity and lymphocytic counts. 45 However, it is likely safer not to start AZA in newly diagnosed patients.This monoclonal antibody against CD20-expressing B lymphocytes has not been found to increase the risk of viral infection; there is likewise no evidence to date that RTX increases the risk of developing COVID-19. 47 Anti-CD20 therapies leave the CD8-positive T cell compartment of the immune system relatively intact, which is important to eradicate the virus. However, it is not preferable to initiate B cell-depleting agents during a pandemic because they may preclude the formation of long-lasting immunity against reinfection as well as response to vaccines when they become available. 48 The timing of RTX doses can be determined by monitoring CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells and does not necessarily follow the 6-month interval dosing. Disease control in NMOSD patients can be achieved with RTX for an average of 6-9 months, [49] [50] [51] and it is now obvious from the Swedish experience in multiple sclerosis that rituximab remains effective at controlling disease activity beyond 6 months. 50 Recommendations Initiation of RTX in NMOSD patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic is not preferable. Stable patients already undergoing RTX treatment are advised to have their next infusion postponed for 3 months especially if CD19+ and CD27+ memory B cell counts are severely decreased.In situations where CD19+ and CD27+ memory B cell levels have stabilized or when 9 months have passed since the prior infusion, the next medication dose cannot be postponed and it is recommended to either shift from RTX to one of the other approved safer monoclonal antibodies, or to continue the patient on the same drug after explaining potential risks and benefits.A prodrug of mycophenolic acid, MMF causes depletion of guanosine and deoxyguanosine in both T and B lymphocyte lines via inhibition of inosine-5′monophosphate dehydrogenase (type II), an enzyme that facilitates the production of an intermediate metabolite of guanosine. 52 Net effects include the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis and the suppression of DNA synthesis with subsequent interference in both T and B lymphocyte proliferation, decrease in cytotoxic T cell activity and diminished antibody formation. [53] [54] [55] Promising results have been reported in the setting of many immunemediated neurological illnesses including NMOSD. 56, 57 Compared to AZA, MMF was more effective at achieving remission in some patients with NMOSD and did so with fewer adverse events. 58 This drug interferes with IL-17 production by Th17 cells. A potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial rule in COVID-19 infection, chronic use of MMF could have a protective role against serious clinical complications of the disease. 59, 60 Recommendations It is likely safer not to start MMF in newly diagnosed NMOSD patients throughout the pandemic. For patients who are already being treated with MMF, treatment can be maintained with regular blood count monitoring.A folate antagonist that has multiple dose-related mechanisms of action, MTX inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and thus DNA synthesis in high-dose regimens and aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide in low-dose regimens, ultimately interfering with T-cell function, augmenting the release of intra-and extracellular adenosine that suppresses inflammation, suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12) and enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory mediators (eg IL-10 and IL-1). 61 In the treatment of NMOSD, MTX is considered to be a second-line option when first-line medications fail or are inappropriate. 62 In addition, MTX therapy is associated with increased risk of infection and myelosuppression 63 while in up to 14% of patients treated with low-dose MTX, a troublesome adverse event mimicking symptoms of COVID-19, termed MTX-induced pneumonitis (MIP), has been reported. It typically presents with dyspnea, dry cough and fever, as well as ground glass opacities on chest CT imaging. Cessation of MTX and glucocorticoids typically results in a favorable outcome, although, in some cases, it may be fatal. 64 An interim Australia/New Zealand recommendation for patients with severe inflammatory skin disorders was to reduce MTX dosing to less than 10 mg/week to protect against COVID-19 infection. 45 Recommendations As a second-line agent, it is preferable not to initiate MTX in NMOSD patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequent clinical evaluations and complete blood count monitoring of patients treated with MTX are recommended; reduction of doses to less than 10 mg/week should be considered for patients already undergoing MTX therapy based on individual profiles and disease severity. If patients develop MIP, are infected with COVID-19 or if lymphocytic count falls below 1100/mL, MTX should be stopped.An alkylating antineoplastic agent, CTX exerts its effects via the active metabolite phosphoramide, resulting in crosslinkages within and between adjacent DNA strands, ultimately leading to induction of apoptosis. 65 This medication also selectively suppresses T cells and increases the secretion of Th2 cytokines (eg IL-4, IL-10) and decreases the secretion of INF-gamma and IL-12 both in the CSF and peripherally. 66 Common adverse events include hemorrhagic cystitis, gonadal toxicity and myelosuppression 67 . Myelosuppression increases the risk of infection, which may trigger sepsis, particularly at high treatment doses 68 . Furthermore, immunosuppression induced by CTX in a murine model infected with influenza A revealed viral persistence with prolonged shedding. 69 The European Medicines Agency approves CTX as a second-line maintenance therapy for NMOSD patients, especially for those with comorbid systemic lupus erythematosus or systemic sclerosis.It is not preferable to initiate CTX in NMOSD patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As CTX is a secondline agent, the choice of another alternative as maintenance therapy is preferable.Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of NMOSD in patients who are AQP4-IgG-seropositive. It binds with high affinity to C5, thereby blocking the activation of the terminal complement pathway. 70 The complements C3a and C5a in particular have very potent pro-inflammatory properties as they trigger neutrophil recruitment and activation, thus playing a vital role in the immune response to COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, anti-C5aR antibody was reported to alleviate lung and tissue damage in Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected mice. 71 Despite the fact that experience with the novel monoclonal antibodies in NMOSD treatment is very limited, Initiation and maintenance therapy with eculizumab in NMOSD patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic is likely safe, even in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. However, careful monitoring for possible upper respiratory infections as well as bacterial pneumonia is warranted.Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-6 receptors and thus blocks their binding IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine with a major role in NMOSD pathogenesis. 38 Tocilizumab is highly effective for aggressive cases of NMOSD refractory to RTX therapy. Notably, tocilizumab has an additional role in the effective management of chronic neuropathic pain and fatigue in NMOSD patients. 74 In patients with COVID-19 infection, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse outcomes. Thus, tocilizumab was found to effectively dampen the inflammatory response and improve patient outcomes. [75] [76] [77] Tocilizumab is generally a safe drug with injection site reactions the commonest adverse effect (10%). However, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes may rarely occur. 78 Importantly, impaired IL-6 signaling results in normalization of CRP levels and body temperature even in the presence of systemic infection. 79 Suspicion of COVID-19 infection in patients receiving IL-6 inhibitors should be high in the setting of relevant symptomology.Initiation and maintenance therapy with tocilizumab in NMOSD patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic is likely safe, even in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as tocilizumab is possibly dually effective.Satralizumab is another humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the IL-6 receptor but exhibits a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile than tocilizumab due to a prolonged elimination half-life. 80 As an IL-6 inhibitor, satralizumab is likely beneficial in the setting of COVID-19 infection; however, this drug has not been investigated in COVID-19 patients.Initiation and maintenance therapy with satralizumab in NMOSD patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic is likely safe even in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.There is little evidence to formulate specific recommendations for patients with NMOSD receiving immunomodulatory treatment with regards to COVID-19. However, in everyday clinical practice throughout the pandemic, health care providers face several obstacles regarding acute and preventive management of NMOSD patients. Here, we listed recommendations based on the mechanism of action of each drug and its preferential effects on the immune system, taking into consideration currently available data, ongoing studies and expert opinion. However, treatment decisions regarding NMOSD patients should be individualized according to disease duration, course and severity, as well as COVID-19 risk.The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management is an international, peerreviewed journal of clinical therapeutics and risk management, focusing on concise rapid reporting of clinical studies in all therapeutic areas, outcomes, safety, and programs for the effective, safe, and sustained use of medicines.

f81dc78595763e87979a8816f6aef402b710947e,"Does life expectancy, death rate and public health expenditure matter in sustaining economic growth under COVID-19: Empirical evidence from Nigeria?","importance of good quality of life and its relationship with economic growth, and so the Nigerian government is encouraged to priorities building a healthy population (Yaqub et al., 2012) .In late 2019 a virus caused a disaster in Wuhan, Hubei province China named ""Novel Pneumonia Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)"" and was declared as a global pandemic Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020 . The virus outbreak was disturbing due to its fastspreading ability and contagious, The world health organization daily record list for the virus cases keeps emerging globally, however, a decline was seen from China infected cases where it was first prominent as of when this article was drafted, meanwhile, a drastic increase in infected cases emerged in Europe, America, and Africa. Emergency action was taken by the WHO to protect human life due to the risk prevalent of the virus. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has increased mortality rate and beyond that, a severe diminish is seen on the global economy due to the decrease in production, consumption, unemployment, and decrease in quality of life. Even thou the global economic diminish seems unavoidable the governments are putting more effort to sustain the economic development during and after the pandemic. Fernandes (2020) .Based on the highlighted position, the current study seeks to explore to what extent public health expenditure impede/engender sustainable economic growth for the case of global south-Nigeria. In a nutshell, the present study aims to find solution to the question?Looking at the severe outbreak of (COVID-19), Will economic growth be sustainable or crash amidst the global health pandemic crises? This study aims to use Nigeria as a case study for the global south blocs for more insightful and policy constructions in the country and region at large to attain the ""vision 2030"" of the UN and much more the goal-3 of UNSDG's.The remainder of this study is structured as: Section 2 presents the review of related literature. Section 3 renders the data and methodological sequences while empirical results and discussion. The conclusion and policy blueprint are highlighted in Section 5.Various studies have been conducted for the past years similar to this by different scholars, aiming to draw the attention of government, public, and private sector to how health care, environment, and health status has a significant impact on economic growth and also to investigate if the government can establish sustainable growth in economic especially for the period of health crises. Piabuo and Tieguhong (2017) conducted an analytical research study on five African countries that achieved the MDGs goal from 2001 to 2013 and countries in the CEMAC sub-region. Econometric technics analysis was used which results indicate an increase in GDP per capita by 0.38 unit for five African countries that meet the target of allocating 15% of their government expenditure on health and 0.3unit for CEMAC, signifying that significant change in GDP per capital can only be prominent if there is a positive change in health expenditure. Ibikunle (2019) supported this, indicating a positive increase in GDP using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and the Granger causality test techniques to analyze the impact of health on economic growth, which was concluded that an increase in government expenditure on health should be considered so to achieve the goal of economic growth. On contrary to this, Olisakwe (2019) argued that an increase in budgetary allocation for health has negative outcomes on economic growth this was proven by extracting data from 1981 to 2017 in Nigeria using a classical linear regression technique to conduct the investigation. Nwani and Kelikume (2019) deducted the same conclusion asOlisakwe (2019) 3 | DATA, MODEL, AND METHODThis section presents the data, variables description and methodological procedures applied to address the hypothesized study claim for the case of Nigeria. 2 Subsequently the materials and method accordingly.To carry out the empirical assessment necessary to achieve the aim of this study, we present a standard growth equation with labor, capital, trade and foreign direct investment as the required control variable.However, as a novelty, we introduced three different measures for the health sector. First is the standard health expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Results from this are compared with other health sector proxies such as life expectancy and death rate. Given that COVID-19 has significantly influenced the death rate across many countries, the death rate and its impact on real GDP will provide valuable insights in times of pandemic such as this. Hence, our model is shown in the following equations below:The autoregressive distributed lag model is used to estimate the models in Equations (1) Table 2 gives the descriptive statistics of the variables of interests employed in the study which includes mean value, SD, minimum and maximum. The total number of observations is pegged at 30. As shown in Table 2 Lastly, the table also presents the SD which explains the degree at which the data varies from their mean values.To have a better understanding of the variables, Figure 1 shows the graphical illustrations of the trend of the variables of interest. As shown in Figure 1 , capital investment (CAP) is revealed to be the most fluctuating variable followed by the real GDP and health expenditure.This implies the inconsistencies of the variables over time. Table 3 presents the results of the correlation analysis between the variables of interest. The result of the association between real GDP and health expenditure as well as life expectancy reveals that there is a strong and significant positive association that supports the theoretical construct in the literature while a strong and significant negative relationship is discovered between real GDP and death rate.The association between real GDP and terms of trade as well as labor force is found to be strong, positive and significant, whereas, a weak and significant negative relationship is found between real GDP and foreign direct investment. Capital investment is shown to have a strong and significant negative relationship with real GDP.We confirm the validity of the estimated model using analytical tests presented in Table 4 and Figure 2 . Subsequently, after exploring the summary statistics and correlation matrix, it is also imperative to examine the stationary properties of the variables of interest. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2010 U.S. dollars.The World Bank CAP = capital investment as a percent of GDP Gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories. Fixed assets include land improvements (fences, ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings. Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and ""work in progress."" According to the 1993 SNA, net acquisitions of valuables are also considered capital formation.The World Bank LAB = labor force, million people Labor force comprises people ages 15 and older who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period. It includes people who are currently employed and people who are unemployed but seeking work as well as first-time jobseekers. Not everyone who works is included, however. Unpaid workers, family workers, and students are often omitted, and some countries do not count members of the armed forces. Labor force size tends to vary during the year as seasonal workers enter and leave.The World Bank TOT = terms of trade, base year = 2000 Net barter terms of trade index is calculated as the percentage ratio of the export unit value indexes to the import unit value indexes, measured relative to the base year 2000. Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD's estimates using the previous year's trade values at the standard international trade classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the standard international trade classification revision 3 using UNCTAD's commodity Price statistics, internaχtional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year's trade values as weights.The United Nations FDI = foreign direct investment, percent of GDP Foreign direct investment is the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10% or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. This series shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign investors and is divided by GDP. After conducting the tests for the unit roots, the next step is to examine if at all there is the existence of long run equilibrium between the variables. Therefore, ARDL bound test technique coined by Pesaran et al (2001) is employed in this current study to test for cointegration as shown in Table 6 . The results of ARDL bound test approach shows that, in most cases, the F-statistics is valued above at least the 10% upper bound which is an avenue to establish long run equilibrium between the variables of interest.Since the ARDL bound test approach has confirmed that that the variables of interest to this study are cointegrated, the long run and short-run equilibrium can then be estimated. Table 7 shows the empirical findings of the short run and long run equilibrium nexus using the ARDL modeling approach and the analysis covers three models with real GDP as the sole dependent variable. Accordingly, the result of the impact of health expenditure on real GDP is found to be negative and insignificant both in the short run and the long run.Specifically, a 1% increase in health expenditure will lead to an including Nigeria. This implies that more capital accumulation tends to cause the Nigerian economy to experience a downturn due to ways through which the capital is channeled. The results obtained from the analysis also indicate that labor force across the three models has negative but insignificant impact on health expenditure both in short run and long run in such a way that a 1% increase in results 28.26% reduction in GDP for the first model. Meanwhile, the results of analyses modeled for life expectancy and death rate reveal a negative and significant effect of labor force on GDP both in the short run and long run such that a percent increase in labor force will reduce the GDP by 7.05 and 9.04%, respectively in the short run and by 8.58 and 10.83%, respectively in the long run. This implies that labor force has neutrally disrupted the advancement of the economy of Nigeria. While Table 7 indicates that all the tests carried out in the study are well behaved and align with expectations attached to the estimated results, the stability of the estimated model is also confirmed with Figure 2 that presents the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ plotted within 95% degree of confidence. Therefore, there is a possibility of making unbiased statistical derivations, interpretations and policy recommendations.The presence of cointegration between the variables of interest has provided the evidence for the existence of at least one causality nexus between the variables though could not provide the direction of the causality. Thus, we employ the popular Granger causality test in this study to examine which variable serves as a causative agent to the other. The Granger causality test results are presented in Table 8 .Empirical evidence shows that, there exists a one-way directional relationship moving from the health expenditure to productivity growth while no causal relationship is found between economic growth and life expectancy and also between economic growth and death rate.The empirical results obtained from the causality tests reveal the validity of feedback hypothesis such that bi-directional causal relationship is discovered between economic growth and capital investment, unidirectional relationship separately running from labor force and terms of trade to economic growth. Meanwhile, no causality is F I G U R E 2 Recursive cusum discovered between foreign direct investment (FDI) and productivity growth.Efforts to compare the results of the current study to the previous show that one-way directional causal relationship exists moving from expenditure on healthcare to productivity growth found in this current study is contrary to the empirical study of Dincer, Hacioglu, and Yüksel (2018) and Mehrara and Musai (2011) who also found a one-way directional causal relationship running from economic growth to health expenditure for E7 countries and Iran respectively.Another conflicting result is that of Ecevit (2013) who found a oneway directional causal relationship moving from life expectancy to productivity growth. The expected empirical result is found for the impact of death rate on economic growth and of which is negative and significant.Regarding the causality test, no causal relationship is found between economic growths between death rate as duly expected theoretically.This result suggests that if death rate becomes consistent in the country, it could hinder the economic growth and development of the country through labor force channel.From the findings stated above, it is therefore recommended that the Nigerian government to prioritize investment in human capital development through the provision of healthcare facilities, personnel training, monitoring and evaluation, and making the access to the healthcare facilities affordable. Embarking on these will not only assure the provision of the quality labor force but also translate to an increase in the productive capacity of the country and an increase in economic growth.Furthermore, since it is clear that the health sector in Nigeria is underfunded and underdeveloped, this is a call on the government to increase the investment in the health sector in the country and such investments should be directed towards fighting off leading deathcausing diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia and influenza that tend to cut the life expectancy in the country short.Lastly, the Nigerian government should strongly consider the provision of an economically friendly environment as well as a secured Note: *, **, and *** represent significance at 10, 5, and 1%, respectively.Gloria Nnadwa Alhassan is currently a Ph.D. student at the fac- ",Nigeria,abstract,2020-08-24,08
f654c5cf3d0100d53086e93fb89cbf87ccda820f,Letter to the editor Improved COVID-19 testing by extraction free SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR,"The new emergence of the novel human coronavirus in January 2019 in Wuhan City (China), rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. The virus was confirmed to have spread to Algeria in February 2020, which put notable pressure on public and private health laboratories as they attempt to keep up with demands for SARSCoV-2 testing despite shortage of reagents (1) . Currently, the widely used protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection is RT-qPCR assay preceded by purification of viral RNA from patient sample, typically from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab as described by CDC and WHO (2) (3) (4) . However, nucleic acid purification step is not only laborious and time-consuming, but the additional steps requiring manual handling can result in experimental errors, especially false positive results due to specimen-to-specimen carryover (5) . To address this issue, recent attempts have been made to circumvent RNA extraction in COVID-19 testing by performing RT-qPCR directly on heat-inactivated subject samples (65°C for 30 min or 95°C for 10min) or directly loading patient swab medium into RT-PCR reaction mix. Using heatinactivation approach the sensitivity ranged from 92 to 96% and specificity from 93 to 100% (6) . Here, we tested the direct method of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR on heat-treated (Hit-RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab samples and compared the results with RNA-extraction based RT-PCR results.This study was conducted at the clinical laboratory of INSTITUT PASTEUR OF M'SILA, ALGERIA. Clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from patients with high likelihood for COVID-19 were collected by medical infectiologists and deposited in viral transport medium at different healthcare institution of the city of M'sila. Arrived to the laboratory, samples were stored at -20°C until extracted and tested within 72h. For routine analysis, RNA was extracted from 140 μ L of NP samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR were performed using the Biogerm® novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid kit following the manufacturer instructions : Total reactions of 25μl were obtained by mixing 20μl of master mix (primers and probe mix: ORF1ab, N and RNase P genes) and 5 μ l of clinical sample to fill the reaction. The thermal cycling steps were: Stage1: 50°C for 10 min, stage2: 95°C for 5 min, stage3: 95°C for 10 sec, 55°C for 40 sec, 40 cycles. The RT-qPCR was performed on a Rotor-Gen Q real time PCR machine (Qiagen®) using the Rotor-Gen Software v2.3.We initially aimed to validate heat-treatment method to get an accurate view of its performance in a real world clinical diagnostic setting. We blindly heated a panel of aliquots from 60 NP samples representing intermediate (CT of 20 -30) and low (CT of more than 30) viral RNA loads by direct RT-qPCR. The SARS-CoV-2 Ct levels (ORF1ab and N) in these samples were previously determined by RT-qPCR that included RNA extraction (Ct cutoff ≤ 38).NP swab samples were thermally treated in water bath at 65°C for 30 min.Samples were then placed in room temperature for 15 min, vortexed for 10 seconds and 5µl of the supernatant was directly loaded into RT-qPCR reaction. Comparably, aliquots from 161 NP samples were subjected to heat-treatment but with increasing heating time to 60 min.We found a weak agreement when NP samples were heated for 30min (PPA: 58%, 95%CI: 45 to 69%).But, the agreement increased (PPA: 78%, 95%CI: 70 to 84%) when we increased the heating time to (60 min). We also found a substantial agreement between N gene results of extracted and heat-inactivated samples (overall agreement 78%, 95%CI 70 to 83%) but a weak agreement for ORF1ab gene (overall agreement 45%, 95%CI 37 to 52%). Ct values of N gene for hid-RT-qPCR samples were higher than for RNA eluates of the same samples (mean difference =1.9 Ct). Surprisingly, three samples were identified as COVID-19 positive by 60 min heat-inactivation RT-qPCR (one sample positif for N and ORF1ab and two for only N) but were negative on extracted RNA (Table. 2, sample 17, 19 and 84). Supplementary data represented by Heatmap1 and 2 shows the full results of this experiment while Table 3 provides a summary.Clinical laboratories of the developing world are overwhelmed with COVID-19 testing demands. As a means to validate heat-treatment RT-PCR method in our clinical laboratory, we have shown that prior heating at 65°C for 30 min was less accurate compared to prior heating at 65°C for 60 min. Our observation were not corroborated by previous results which showed that prior heating at 65°C for 30 min was adequate to correctly identify 92 to 96% of screened samples. This could be explained by difference in the composition of viral transport medium used (Inhibitory agents from the swab and medium may inhibit RT-qPCR) or a mutations in the Algerian strain of SARS-cov2, rendering the virus more resistant to heat inactivation. Our improved protocol correctly identified 100% of clinical samples with viral load between (20 and 30 Ct). The only samples missed were those among lower Ct range (Ct> 30). Of the 2065 cases with a positive diagnosis at ""Institut Pasteur of M'sila"" by our clinical laboratory at the time of writing, only 27% would fall in this low Ct range, which demonstrate that our improved protocol will accurately detect the majority of COVID-19 patients. Evidence that analytical sensitivity of hid-RT-qPCR was inferior (higher Ct values) compared to extraction-based RT-qPCR is that heating for long time may degrade RNA in presence of metal ions and/or RNases and that more RNA was loaded for eluates compared to Hic-RT-PCR. Furthermore, the higher performance of primers and probes targeting short amplicon (N, 110 bp) confirmed previous reports. Hence, short amplicons targets may be more suitable for Hic-RT-qPCR protocol.A surprising finding was that hic-RT-PCR identified three samples as COVID-19 positive while they had been identified as COVID-19 negative by conventional protocol. The Ct values of hic-RT-PCR samples were high (> 30) suggesting one possible explanation of this phenomenon: NP samples may had very low viral RNA load that was below the limit of detection -i.e the lowest concentration level with a detection rate of 95% for positive results-of the RT-PCR kit (1000 copies/ml) (9) . So, negative results in patients with typical symptoms of COVID-19 may become detectable by repeating the test. Unfortunately, we were unable to confirmed COVID-19 positivity by collection of a new swab samples.",Algeria,first author,2020-08-12,08
1835f6dccc63e2a66ad5bcddd14d1fdc17e6c987,Associated Factors in Mizan-Aman Town,"Coronavirus (CoV) infections are emerging respiratory viruses and are known to cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 1 Its clinical presentations are characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, bleeding and coagulation dysfunction. 2 The previous outbreaks of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2003 and 2015 showed similarities to the novel coronavirus, which was first reported by Chinese authorities in Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China at the end of December 2019. It is currently the disease resulting in a worldwide outbreak. 3, 4 The virus is transmitted from humans to human via droplets coughed or exhaled by infected persons, and also by touching droplet-contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth. 5, 6 The most commonly reported clinical symptom in laboratory-confirmed cases is fever, followed by dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnea, sore throat, headache with myalgia or arthralgia. 7 Despite a global health crisis, there is currently no proven prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to COVID-19 and treatment for those who go on to develop COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19. 8, 9 The battle against COVID-19 is still continuing all over the world. 10 The world Health Organization (WHO) set strategies to prevent and decline the transmission of COVID-19 such as frequent hand-washing with soap, avoiding close contact, staying home, covering mouth and nose with flexed elbow and maintaining social distancing. To guarantee the final success, people's adherence to these control measures is essential, which is largely affected by their knowledge of COVID-19. 11, 12 To facilitate outbreak management of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, there is an urgent need to assess the public's awareness of COVID-19 at this critical moment. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge of COVID-19 and its associated factors among the community of Mizan-Aman town, southwest Ethiopia. The findings of this study will help the responsible body organize the necessary interventional programs (education, demonstration) in order to provide up-to-date information to control COVID-19 disease.This study was conducted in Mizan-Aman town, southwest Ethiopia, from April 14 to May 14, 2020. Mizan-Aman is a zonal town of the Benchi-Sheko Zone. It is one of the zones in Southern nation, nationalities, and people's region. It is 583 kilometers from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, to the southwest direction. Mizan-Tepi University, Mizan-Aman College of Health Science and Mizan-Aman Town Health office disseminate health information to the residents face to face while Fana FM and Debub FM radios were delivering information using their stations.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Mizan-Aman town to assess the community's knowledge of COVID-19. All adults of Mizan-Aman town were the source population and all selected individuals who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were the study population.Adults (age≥18 years) and who were permanent residents (greater than 6 months) of Mizan-Aman town were included in the study, whereas adults who were unwilling to respond and houses closed during data collection were excluded from the study.The sample size was determined based on the single population proportion formula: n= [(Z α/2 ) 2 p (1-p)]/d 2 with the assumption of a 95% confidence interval (Zα/ 2 = 1.96), marginal error (d) of 5% and P=50% with a 10% non-response rate, the required total sample size was 423. Systematic random sampling was used to select sample households that represent the entire town. The interval, K, was calculated by dividing total households by 423. The sample household was selected systematically by jumping every 30 households. The first household was selected by the lottery method. From the selected household, the study participant was chosen by the lottery method if more than one eligible individual present.In this study, the dependent variable was Knowledge, whereas independent variables included sex, age, marital status, ethnicity, religion, educational status, occupational status and presence of health professionals in the household.A structured questionnaire was adapted from similar literature, which contains 2 parts. Part I includes respondent's background data and Part II includes knowledgerelated questions. The questionnaire was translated into the local language (Amharic) by persons who were proficient in both languages. Then, the questionnaire was pre-tested on a 5% of the total sample size in a Kite Town, which is 8 Km away from Mizan-Aman Town, and modified based on the pretest. Five experienced BSc public health and two supervisors were recruited and trained for data collection and supervision, respectively. The training was given for two days on how to ensure confidentiality, tool, how to protect themselves and community from infection and interview techniques. Additionally, the data collectors and supervisors adhered to the WHO and Ethiopian Ministry of Health guidelines on COVID-19 prevention. 13, 14 Accordingly, they maintained social distance, worn personal protective equipment and used an alcohol-based hand sanitizer during the data collection period. Data were collected through face-to-face interview method. The supervisors and principal investigators supervised the process of data collection on a daily basis.A knowledge questionnaire was developed from different studies. [15] [16] [17] The questionnaire had 12 questions with 3 regarding clinical presentations, 4 regarding transmission routes, and 5 regarding prevention and control of COVID-19. These questions were answered on a true/false basis with an additional ""I don't know"" option. A correct answer was assigned 1 point and an incorrect/unknown answer was assigned 0 point. During the analysis, negatively worded items of knowledge (number 7 and 10) were reversely scored. The total knowledge score ranged from 0 to 12, with a higher score denoting a better knowledge of COVID-19. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the knowledge questionnaire was calculated to the check internal consistency of the tool, which was 0.78.Data quality was assured by careful selection and collection of complete and appropriate data. The clarity and completeness of data collection formats were checked before the actual data collection. Data were cleared before entered into Epi data manager version 4.0.2.101. The collected data were processed and retained cautiously in line with its objective. A 5% sample pretest was performed on randomly selected residents before the beginning of the study.The data on questionnaire were entered into Epi data manager version 4.0.2.101 and double entry verification was made. The data were exported to SPSS version 24 statistical packages for analysis. The data were explored to check for outliers, missing data and assumptions. During analysis, frequencies and percentages were used to describe categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were used to describe continuous variables. Bivariate analysis was performed to select variables for multivariate analysis. Variables with a p-value <0.25 in the bivariate analysis were taken as candidates for multivariable analysis. Finally, a multivariable logistic model was created to predict the determinants of knowledge. P-value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant variables.Knowledge Each correct answer in relation to the knowledge of COVID-19 was given one point. The total knowledge score varied between 0 (with no correct answer) and 12 (for all correct answers), and a cut off level of <8 was evaluated as poor knowledge, and ≥8 indicated good knowledge. 15 Ethical clearance was obtained from Mizan-Tepi University Ethics Review Board. The Mizan-Aman town administration office was informed about the purpose of the study to get permission. Both data collectors and supervisors adhered to the WHO and Ethiopian Ministry of Health COVID-19 prevention guidelines during data collection. Confidentiality of the respondents was secured by excluding respondent's identifiers like name and house number from the data collection format. Informed consent was obtained from the respondents before conducting the study.From a total of 423 sampled populations, 393 (92.9%) of the study population responded to the questionnaire. The mean age of the study population was 33.85 (SD±13.79) years. Two hundred thirty-three (59.3%) were male, 250 (63.6%) were married, 158 (40.2%) were orthodox and 133 (33.8%) were Bench in ethnicity. Eighteen percent of the participants had health care professionals in their homes (Table 1) .Mixed responses were obtained for 12 knowledge items. The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 8.97±1.7. More than 85% of respondents were well aware of the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19, its transmission by close contact, its prevention by not going to crowded places and isolation of infected persons. Additionally, 84.2% of the participants responded correctly for not all persons with COVID-19 will develop to severe cases, and (77.4%) of them knew as COVID-19 virus spreads via respiratory droplets of infected individuals. Furthermore, two-thirds of participants knew that eating or contacting wild animals would result in infection and ordinary residents can wear general medical masks to prevent infection. However, when respondents asked questions related to transmission of COVID 19 in the absence of fever in infected persons, the importance of taking measures for infants and young children to prevent the infection and uncommon symptoms of COVID 19 compared to common cold, 66.4%, 54.7% and 49.1% of them were unable to identify correct answers, respectively. Generally, 35.4% of the population had poor knowledge (Table 2) . Differences in knowledge scores among different demographic characteristics were assessed using t-tests. The results show that knowledge scores were significantly different across age categories, educational status, presence of health professionals in households, occupation status and marital status ( Table 3 ).Sex (male), age (35-54 and >55 years), marital status (single), educational status (no formal education), occupational status (farmer, student, unemployed/housewife) were significantly associated with poor knowledge of COVID-19 (Table 4 ).Currently, COVID-19 is a global discussion topic in the media and among the public. Until now, the outbreak is considered an emergency and the community has an increased risk of infection. However, up to our knowledge, there is no investigation of the community's knowledge of COVID-19 and its associated factors in this study area.The findings in our study showed that the overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 74.75%. This is lower than the study done in China where the overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. 15 This discrepancy might be due to the difference in technology access and educational level between the study populations. In general, in our study, 35.4% of participants had poor knowledge about the disease, its mode of transmission, prevention and control.In this study, 87.5% of the respondents knew that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, fatigue, dry cough, and myalgia and 73.8% of them knew as currently, there is no effective cure for COVID-2019, but early symptomatic and supportive treatment can help most patients recover from the infection. This is similar to the finding reported by Kebede et al 18 where 83% of the respondents knew that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and myalgia and 72.1% of respondents knew that currently, there is no effective cure for COVID-2019, but early symptomatic Multiple logistic regression analysis of this finding showed that being male was significantly associated with poor knowledge of COVID-19 as compared to females. This is similar to a study done in China and Saudi Arabia, where male was significantly associated with low knowledge scores. 15, 19 In our finding age above 35 years was significantly associated with poor knowledge. This is in agreement with the study done in Egypt, where respondents' age older than 50 years were significantly associated with poor knowledge. 16 However, this is in contrast to a study done in China where age above 30 years was associated with good knowledge. 15 Lack of formal education was significantly associated with poor knowledge. This is similar to a previous study. 15 The possible justification might be formal education providing basic infectious disease (such as the SARS-CoV) concept, mode of transmission and prevention. In this study, being unemployed was significantly associated with poor knowledge of COVID-19. This is in agreement with a previous report finding. 15 In addition to this being farmer, daily laborer and merchants were significantly associated with poor knowledge of COVID-19.However, being single in marital status was less likely associated with poor knowledge. Similarly, other previous study also demonstrated that being unmarried was associated with good knowledge. 20 The possible reason might be that unmarried persons have less social and family responsibility, which reduces psychosocial burden, which in turn increases their knowledge.One-third of the respondents had poor knowledge of the COVID-19 concept, transmission, prevention and control. Being male, age above 35 years, lack of formal education, being farmer, daily laborer, merchant and unemployed/ house wife were significantly associated with poor knowledge, whereas being single was less likely associated with poor knowledge of COVID-19. syndrome; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; WHO, World Health Organization.All relevant data are within the paper.The International Journal of General Medicine is an international, peer-reviewed open-access journal that focuses on general and internal medicine, pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment protocols.

d352f897a85dfd8cd4b335ac59e96463d6bcc1e2,,"The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, causes massive death, threatens the life and health of the world population, and intensive economic loss since it is declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 The virus is characterized by a high transmission rate, which causes difficulty in controlling the spread of the disease. 2 Implementation of public health measures, which include the promotion of the use of personal protective practices such as the use of face masks, wearing of gloves, frequent hand washing, restriction of movement to the more affected areas, maintaining social/physical distance, avoiding touching the nose, mouth, and eyes, were found to be the only proven preventive option to halter the pandemic. 3 The effectiveness of outbreak control will mainly depend on the behavioral response of the society and adherence level to the recommended precautionary measures. 4 In different countries, the health-care system designed effective planning to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries face health workforce challenges, including shortages, mal-distribution and misalignment between population health needs and health worker competencies 5 and the case is not exceptional in Ethiopia. Following the wide spread of COVID-19 in African region and Ethiopia, concerns have been raised on safeguarding the health professionals as they are highly vulnerable to the outbreak. Unprecedented spread of the infection largely affected the health professionals and generated shortage. 6 Poor understanding and risk perception of the disease among health-care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed recognition and treatment, resulting in the rapid spread of the infection. 7 Interventions targeted in increasing the knowledge of health-care providers that are dealing with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 can significantly limit the spread of the outbreak. 8 Furthermore, health professionals are working with inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and many have died, and thousands have tested positive. 9 Evidence from a cross-sectional study points out a significant number of health-care workers have inadequate knowledge about COVID-19. According to this study, 61% and 63.6% of HCWs had a poor understanding of COVID-19 transmission and symptom onset, respectively. Besides, a significant number of HCWs (22%) showed negative perceptions of COVID-19. 7 Since June 9, 2020, there are about 2156 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 27 deaths reported in Ethiopia, and more than a hundred health professionals are affected by the illness. 10 During this period, the outbreak is prevalent in the major cities and towns in the gateways. As the country is in the early stage of infectious disease, the chance of limiting the spread is more feasible during this stage. Thus, this survey designed to explore health professionals' knowledge and precautionary behavioral practice toward COVID-19. This finding is crucial in limiting the spread of the pandemic and recommending policymakers to institute effective intervention strategies that safeguard the lives of health professionals and the public at large.A self-administered online survey designed on Google form from May 1 to 14, 2020, and this manuscript is a part of an online study titled COVID-19 pandemic: psychological impact, perceived risk and preparedness among health care providers working in public university hospitals in Ethiopia: web-based survey.The university hospitals are namely: Jimma Medical Center (JMC), Mizan Tepi University Hospital, Wollega University Hospital, Hawassa University Hospital, Wolayta Sodo University Hospital, and Arba Minch University Hospital. University hospitals were engaged in delivering curative treatment and preventive and rehabilitative services for millions of people in southern, southwestern, and western Ethiopia. For the current COVID-19 pandemic, each university hospital, including its clinical staff, were prepared for testing, treatment, and quarantine center.All teaching and clinical staff working in the selected public university hospitals in Ethiopia was considered a source population. Those who were volunteers to take part, filled, and re-submitted the survey questionnaire were considered the study population. A total of 273 health professionals took part in the study. Those who were on work leave did not take part in the survey.The minimum number of the sample size required for this study was determined by using the formula to estimate a single population proportion. The minimum sample size determination formula used is:where n denotes the minimum sample size, Z α/2 is the reliability coefficient of the standard error at a 5% level of significance = 1.96, and p is the proportion of health-care providers who had a poor perception about COVID-19 = 22%. 7 Accordingly, the study participants were consecutively selected until the calculated sample size required is fulfilled; which took two weeks.Data were collected using an electronically administered questionnaire. All staff invited to participate in the online survey. Official university e-mail addresses, personal e-mail addresses, and social media networking sites: Facebook and Telegram used to share the survey link to the staff. The URL link of the survey questionn a i r e i s h t t p s :In the introduction section of the survey, the purpose of the study, informed consent, and the way to maintain confidentiality stated. The survey questions prepared to be delivered electronically by the English language to get a rapid response of individuals COVID-19 related knowledge and precautionary behavioral response. The first part of the instrument includes the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants (age, sex, educational status, type of profession, and professional engagement). Participants' knowledge was assessed using a 9-items questionnaire addressing clinical symptoms, mode of transmission, and knowledge of prevention strategies. The precautionary behavioral responses of respondents in undertook major protective measures to COVID-19 were assessed using 5-point Likert scale questions. The questions address the respondent's practice of avoiding sneezing/couching, avoiding touching the face, nose, and eyes, avoiding large gatherings and public places, avoiding traveling to the affected areas, staying at home, using alcohol-based disinfectants, and wearing mask/gloves. The study tools were adapted from the WHO and other studies, 4,11 and more detail of the questionnaire found as (Supplementary file 1).The collected data were checked, coded, and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 statistical software for cleaning and analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed and presented with a frequency table indicating the mean value and standard deviation with a 95% confidence interval. After checking for assumption, a factor score generated for knowledge question items through principal component analysis, and factors was load into components. The resulting score distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Linear regression analysis used to determine the relationship between individuals' risk perception and behavioral response after verifying the lack of multicollinearity among explanatory variables, the linearity of relations, and the normality of the distribution. The variance inflation factor and tolerance test for the explanatory variables found to be less than 2 and 1, respectively. Statistical significance of independent predictors declared at a 95% confidence level and (p-value < 0.05) and Unstandardized β used for interpretation.A total of 273 health professionals participated in this study. The mean (± SD) age of participants was 31.03 ± 5.11 years and ranged from 23 to 48 years. Two-thirds (64.8%) of the study participants were engaged in academic service. Regarding educational attainment, type of profession, and sex of respondents, 61.5%, 26%, and 89% of participants attended Master's Degree (MSc), medical doctors, and male by sex, respectively (Table 1) . Knowledge and Source of Information Related to COVID-19All study participants responded correctly to all preventive knowledge questions. Regarding the other knowledge components, the items that were least answered correctly by study participants were the knowledge of causative microorganism n = 191 (70%) and knowledge of incubation period n = 220 (80.6%) ( Figure 1 ).The recommended precautionary behavioral response of study participants assessed using a 10-item questionnaire that was scored on a 5-point (1-5) Likert scale. The lowest mean scores were wearing gloves (1.82 ± 1.15), followed by wearing a mask (2.54 ± 1.82). Avoiding while people sneeze or cough had the highest mean score (4.0 ± 1.06) ( Figure 2 ) and more complete data found in (Supplementary file 2) .The final multiple linear regression model indicated that participants' knowledge of the source of COVID-19 infection (β = 3.53, P < 0.01), knowledge of the mode of disease transmission (β = 7.51, P < 0.01), knowledge of the incubation period (β = 11.33, P < 0.01), and knowledge of the presence of curative treatment for COVID-19 (β = 8.1, P < 0.01) found to be independent predictors. Participants who knew the source of COVID-19 infection had 3.53 times more likely to practice recommended precautionary behavioral practices. Similarly, participants who knew of the incubation period of COVID-19 were eight times more likely to implement recommended precautionary behavioral practice (Table 3 ).This study provides evidence of knowledge and precautionary behavior practice toward COVID-19 among health professionals working in public university hospitals in Ethiopia. The findings of this study found out that the items that were least responded correctly by study participants were knowledge of causative microorganism and the incubation period. All health professionals responded correctly to all questions of the coronavirus disease preventive knowledge questions. Regarding the practice of recommended health behavior, almost all recommended protective measures practiced to the highest level. However, regarding wearing masks and gloves, the study found a significant gap between the level of knowledge and practical implementation of the recommended precautionary measures. The final multiple linear regression analysis indicated a positive association between knowledge of the source of infection, incubation period, and mode of disease transmission with recommended behavioral practice.The knowledge of the study participants regarding preventive strategies or techniques in this study found to be much higher than the study by Bhagavathula et al. 7 A similar cross-sectional study done in the Republic of China, China indicated that 89% of health-care providers are knowledgeable regarding preventive methods. 12 The possible reason for the variation might be study participants in this study majority of professionals who were involved in both delivering academic and professional services that allow them to have a better understanding and updated information regarding the disease. The majority of the study participants attended a Masters Degree and above in educational status. Furthermore, the nature of their work and sense of responsibility as health professionals drive them to acquire more knowledge, which is supported by a similar study. 13 Concerning knowledge related to the incubation period, treatment, and complications, more than 80% of participants found to correctly respond to these items, which is higher than another study. 7 However, those items we least correctly answered from knowledge items. Additionally, many health professionals had knowledge gaps in treatment options and reported the presence of antiviral treatment and vaccine for the virus. The finding might be explained that the majority of health professionals obtained information from unauthenticated sources like social media. The vast diversity of information available through web media is spreading quickly and prone to bias, which can misguide the professionals.The majority of participants' implemented the recommended precautionary measures to an acceptable level except for wearing masks and gloves. The finding might be due to the study subjects were well educated, which helped them to better exercise protective behavior, and the higher perceived vulnerability level of the illness. This finding is supported by other studies. 14 Regarding wearing masks and gloves, the study found a significant gap between the level of knowledge and implementation of the recommended precautionary measures. The mean scores of wearing masks and gloves in the current study found to be the lowest for items 2.54 and 1.82, respectively. The practice is less frequent, despite these is being an essential recommended protective measures by the WHO. 15 The lower levels of usage declared in our study may be attributable to the poor habit of mask and glovewearing, a perception that they interfere with performing tasks, lack of time, and shortage of PPE in the health facilities. A study done in China indicated inadequate PPE as a reason for health professionals becoming infected with the virus. 16 The scientific understanding and precautionary behavioral practice of health professionals in the current study area is promising. However, a significant gap DovePress is observed between overall knowledge and the application of behavioral practice for wearing masks and gloves. Thus, there is a need to further intensification of more effective ways of creating behavioral change in supporting professionals to adhere to major health precautionary measures is important. The health facilities need to in place a safety protocol that encourages and enforces the protective behavioral response. Furthermore, continues monitoring of the adherence protocol need to be followed by the monitory team and ways to positively reinforce the professionals need to be exercised.The main strength of this study is that researchers used a Likert scale to measure the outcome variable, which is much better to measure behavior than the dichotomized response. The limitation of this study was that the How often do you avoid people sneezing or coughing?How often do you avoid large gathering?How often do you avoid touching face, mouth, nose and eyes?How often do you wash hands frequently?How often do you avoid public places/public transportation?How often do you avoid travel to affected areas?How often do you use alcohol based disinfectant?How often do you avoid spitting on the ground?How often are you wearing a mask?How often are you wearing gloves?Mean Figure 2 Mean score (on a 5-point Likert scale) of specific precautionary health behavior practice of health professionals working in Ethiopia University Hospitals, May 2020 (n = 273). measurement tools used relied on participants' selfreported data, which were prone to recall bias, and the data collection method allows the participants to overreport the precautionary behavioral practice. Furthermore, the population in the current survey mostly consisted of higher degree health professionals this may over-estimate the outcomes of the study.The knowledge of the study participants regarding preventive strategies or techniques in this study found to be much higher. Although most participants applied recommended protective measures to an acceptable level, the finding found a significant gap between knowledge and behavioral practice for wearing masks and gloves. Furthermore, the finding indicated a statistically significant positive association between participants' knowledge of the source of infection, incubation period, and mode of disease transmission with recommended behavioral practice.

47c3a493fb81627ac79ae2decee3b86ef81260b2,Case report Relapse of rare diseases during COVID-19 pandemic: bicytopenia in an adult patient with thiamine- responsive megaloblastic anaemia Relapse of rare diseases during COVID-19 pandemic: bicytopenia in an adult patient with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia,"In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, with the obligation of containment and social distancing, patients suffering from rare syndromes may have difficulty to maintain their medical monitoring and their treatment. Among these rare diseases, the Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA) which is an autosomal recessive disorder with features that include megaloblastic anemia, sensorineural deafness and diabetes mellitus. In this disease, the active thiamine absorption into cells is disturbed. Treatment with pharmacological doses of thiamine ameliorates the megaloblastic anemia and diabetes mellitus. This supplementation must be continued for life otherwise relapse of anemia or even a bi or pancytopenia is inevitable. We present a case of bicytopenia in a young adult with known TRMA.Case presentation: a 19-year-old man known for TRMA, who presented in the emergency department because of progressively worsening dyspnea, chest pain and paleness. He was born in Tunisia to non-consanguineous Tunisian parents. At the age of 12 months, diagnosed megaloblastic anaemia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and severe bilateral sensorineural hearing raised suspicion of TRMA. Thiamine treatment (300 mg orally daily) led to normalization of hemoglobin level. Permanent insulin treatment with three fixed doses per day was necessary because of elevated glucose levels. The patient had consulted our emergency service on July, 2020. We found the notion of stopping treatment for three months since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our patient lives in a rural area where there was a shortage of oral vitamin B treatment (combination of vitamin B1, B6 and B12) and because of general containment and the curfew in Tunisia the patient's family did not have been able to obtain this treatment.Investigations: on admission, Body temperature and physical examination, as well as ECG, chest radiograph and urinalysis were normal. Blood tests revealed bicytopenia (haemoglobin 5.4 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 92 fL, haematocrit 23%, reticulocytes 30×10 9 /L (1%), thrombocytes 38×10 9 /L, leucocytes 6.2×10 9 /L) and negative C reactive protein. Serum ferritin level was 289 μg/L, folate concentration 45.4 nmol/L. There was no coagulopathy (D-dimer, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen values were normal). Fasting and postprandial serum glucose levels were elevated (between 8 and 18.6 mmol/L without ketosis), as well as the HbA1c level (7.8%). To rule out the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in front of the chest pain presented by the patient, the ECG, repeated several times, was normal, two points of hypersensitive troponin was negative, a cardiac ultrasound had shown pericardial effusion of two millimeters circumferential ( Figure 1 (A, B) ), good left ventricle function with 74% of ejection fraction, without ischemic signs and without valve diseases, right cavities were normal. Treatment: parenteral thiamine supplementation (100 mg a day during the first 10 days) was started on day 1, followed by oral supplementation (300 mg one time a day).Outcome and follow-up: within 10 days of thiamine supplementation, reticulocytes rose to 200 ×10 9 /L, haemoglobin level to 9.8 g/dL, and platelets to 740 ×10 9 /L. Probably caused by the rapid onset of anemia, dyspnea and chest pain disappeared once anemia was partially corrected. The insulin requirements did not change. The patient was discharged on day 7 and oral thiamine supplementation (300 mg daily) was continued. Three weeks after initiation of treatment, the blood cell counts returned to normal values ( Figure 2 ).Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA) is also known as Roger's syndrome named after Roger et al. credited for being the pioneer group to report the disorder in 1969 [1] . TRMA is an uncommon genetic disorder caused by mutation of the SLC19A2 gene responsible for the production a transport protein called thiamine transporter [2] . The result is an abnormal thiamine transportation and thiamine deficiency in the cells. The anemia is corrected with high doses of thiamine and recurred when thiamine is withdrawn. In addition, supplement of high dose of thiamine could improve in the clinical symptoms of the disease including a reduction in the need for exogenous insulin in these patients [3] . The medical history and initial presentation of our patient were similar to other cases reports with the classic triad of manifestations: megaloblastic anaemia, diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness, diagnosis made during childhood. Most cases have been reported in consanguineous families [4] our patient did not have a family history of consanguinity. Most cases of TRMA have been reported in children population, with anaemia. A case of pancytopenia have been reported in a 25-year-old woman [5] , the clinical presentation of this patient was similar to that of our patient. Pancytopenia appeared 5 weeks after the discontinuation of thiamine supplementation, probably because of depletion of thiamine reserves and complete recovery of haematopoiesis was obtained within 3 weeks once thiamine supplementation was reintroduced [5] . On the other hand, pericardial effusion, associated directly with decompensation of TRMA syndrome, has not been reported. It can be attributed most likely to vitamin B1 deficiency, this has been described in patients with beriberi syndrome [6, 7] . The hypotheses on the etiology of bicytopenia in our patient was the discontinuation of thiamine supplementation, iron and vitamin deficiencies and an acute infection. In view of the complete recovery of haematopoiesis obtained within 3 weeks once thiamine supplementation was reintroduced, the etiology of the haematological disorders was attributed to the discontinuation of thiamine supplementation because of the containment during COVID-19 pandemic.After the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic by the WHO (World Health Association) on March 11, 2020 [8] , general containment in Tunisia began on March 22, 2020 and lasted 10 weeks. Outings prohibited except extreme emergency and by respecting the barrier measures. Moving between governorates was forbidden during this period. This period was hardly lived over the world and recent studies have shown that SARS-COV 2 infection containment measures have substantial short-and long-term consequences [9, 10] ; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will diminish physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, also reduce treatment adherence thus increasing rare and chronic diseases risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms [9, 10] . The discontinuation of oral thiamine-based treatment in our case can be explained by the non-availability of treatment and the difficulties in accessing care during the containment imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Depressive behavior cannot be eliminated in the face of the psychological impact of this unprecedented global crisis, which has been suggested by several studies [11, 12] .General containment, imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, was at the origin of an anarchy in the medical follow-up and the management of several uncommon diseases such as the Thiamineresponsive megaloblastic anemia.This syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by megaloblastic anaemia, diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness. Lifelong daily oral thiamine supplementation is necessary. Adult patients may present severe hematological manifestations in case of thiamine deficiency. This case report illustrated the isolation and silent suffering of patients with rare diseases during this particular situation of COVID-19 pandemic and has shown the universal new need for virtual communication especially for caregiver who must adopt telehealth technologys to support their patients.

090c0ee78909aef82565c3b56606c91d88023b5b,0123456789) 1 3 Community Mental Health Journal,"The evolution of the novel Corona Virus Disease and its expeditious dissemination have led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a pandemic on 11 March 2020 (WHO 2020a). As of 16 May 2020, there have been 4,425,485 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 302,059 related deaths worldwide and Egypt has been among the most affected countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region with 11,228 confirmed cases and 592 deaths (WHO 2020b).As a consequence, many countries, including Egypt, have set a state of lockdown to hinder the spread of infection among people resulting in a global atmosphere of depression and anxiety associated with social isolation, fears of getting infected, breaks in the supply chains, financial distress, disrupted travel plans, and future uncertainty (Hiremath et al. 2020; Ho et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020) . Several epidemiological studies from China detected a high prevalence of psychological disturbances among the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, a large online survey of 56,679 individuals from 34 provinces in China reported numerous psychological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic: depression (27.9%), anxiety (31.6%), stress (24.4%), and insomnia (29.2%) (Shi et al. 2020 ). Also, a study conducted on 4872 Chinese people from 31 provinces showed a high prevalence of depression (48.3%) and anxiety (22.6%) related to the COVID-19 pandemic (Gao et al. 2020) . A similar study revealed depression (20.1%), anxiety (35.1%), and poor sleeping (18.2%) among 7236 Chinese people (Huang and Zhao 2020) . Another study conducted on 7143 college students in China detected anxiety among 25% of them (Cao et al. 2020) .In low-and middle-income countries, such as Egypt, where infection control precautions, surveillance programs, laboratory capacity, and public health resources are limited (Asbu et al. 2017) , the response to the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging and, as a result, the psychological impacts of the pandemic on the public can be even worse. Thus, we conducted this cross-sectional study to evaluate several forms of psychological disturbances (depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping) and their associating factors among the public in four governorates in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that the findings of this study can help in spotting the population at high risk of psychological disturbances in Egypt and detecting potential associations for possible psychological interventions during this pandemic or future waves of infection.As per the Egyptian Government guidelines to the public for reducing face-to-face communication and home isolation, we used an online snowball sampling procedure to collect data from people aged ≥ 18 years old and residing in Egypt during the period between 16 and 30 April 2020.The lowest sample size was calculated using the Epi-Info version 7 StatCalc, which is available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO. After reviewing previous studies, we determined the following criteria to calculate the least sample size: population size of 999,999, expected frequency of 50%, confidence level of 95%, and a margin of error of 5%. However, we then more than quadrupled the least sample size to serve in stratifying statistical analyses of depression, anxiety, and stress into mild to moderate and severe to very severe forms and to overcome any unexpected invalid questionnaires.Four Egyptian governorates: Alexandria and Cairo in northern Egypt and Beni-Suef and Assiut in southern Egypt were nonrandomly selected for data collection. Cairo is the Capital of Egypt and the most populous governorate in the country while Assiut is the most populous governorate in southern Egypt. Beni-Suef is one of the most underprivileged governorates in the country with major deficits in health and educational services whereas Alexandria represents the country's modern face with better health and educational services (CAPMAS 2017).We designed a semi-structured questionnaire using Google forms, then, we shared the link to the questionnaire to numerous Facebook groups hosting netizens from the four governorates. Facebook is the most widespread social network among the Egyptian netizens (Arafa et al. 2019a) . We used the names of the four governorates as search terms to select the appropriate Facebook groups for sharing our link.Respondents were asked to forward the questionnaire to their eligible friends in their social network contact lists. We managed to collect 425 questionnaires from each governorate; therefore, data collection was terminated in the governorates that reached the required sample before the due date of 30 April 2020 (Beni-Suef: 28 April, Assiut: 29 April, Cairo: 29 April, and Alexandria 30 April). Eventually, 1700 questionnaires were obtained from the four governorates before 71 questionnaires were excluded for being invalid questionnaires or the respondents reported staying outside Egypt during the time of data collection.The questionnaire was composed of two sections. The first section included questions about sociodemographic characteristics including age (18-30, 31-35, or > 45 years), sex (man or woman), governorate (Alexandria, Cairo, Beni-Suef, or Assiut), current work sector (health, education, services, instruction, trading, industry, other sectors, or none), education (elementary or high), living with children (yes or no) or old people (yes or no), watching or reading news about the pandemic (< 2, 2-4, or > 4 h/day), receiving enough emotional support from family (yes or no) and society (yes or no) during the pandemic, and sleeping hours/ day during the past month (≥ 6 or < 6 h/day). The second section included the Arabic version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Based on 21 statements, people were asked to decide on how close the DASS-21 statements expressed their status during the previous week on a four-point scale between zero and three with higher scores indicating worse psychological status. The depression statements assessed hopelessness, dysphoria, self-deprecation, devaluation of life, lack of interest, anhedonia, and inertia. The anxiety statements evaluated skeletal muscle effects, autonomic arousal, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale evaluated nervous arousal, difficulties in relaxation, and being easily upset or over-reactive. Scores of statements under the same emotional category (seven statements each) were summed and multiplied in two. Out of 42, the cut-off values for mild to moderate depression, anxiety, and stress were 10, 8, and 15, and for severe to very severe were 22, 16, and 26, respectively (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995) . The Cronbach's α for the Arabic version of DASS-21 was 0.88 (Ali et al. 2017) . In this study, depression, anxiety, stress, and sleeping < 6 h/ day (referred to as inadequate sleeping) were considered outcomes.Expedited ethics approval was received from the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Beni-Suef University which adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All respondents replied to a question if they agree to participate in this study before filling out the questionnaire.Data were analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Frequency measures were used to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping among the public. The logistic regression analyses were used to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of different sociodemographic factors for people with severe to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress and inadequate sleep compared with people without the corresponding psychological conditions. The following covariates were included in the regression model: age, sex, governorate, profession, education, living with children and older adults, watching/reading COVID-19 news, and getting emotional support from family and society.This study included 1629 people (25.0% from Alexandria, 24.5% from Cairo, 25.1% from Beni-Suef, and 25.4% from Assiut). Of them, 48.1% were aged ≤ 30 years, 42.4% were men, and 20% were working in the health sector (Table 1) .The results revealed a high prevalence of depression (67.1%: mild to moderate 44.6% and severe to very severe 22.5%), anxiety (53.5%: mild to moderate 30.6% and severe to very severe 22.9%), stress (48.8%: mild to moderate 33.8% and severe to very severe 15.0%), and inadequate sleeping 23.1% (Table 2 ).In the multivariable-adjusted regression model, female sex, working in sectors other than the health sector, watching/reading COVID-19 news ≥ 2 h/day, and lack of emotional support from family and society associated with a high prevalence of psychological disturbances. Compared with men, women reported more severe to very severe depression (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09, 1.78), anxiety (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.85, 3.29), and stress (OR 2.90, 95% CI 2.04, 4.11). Watching/reading COVID-19 news ≥ 2 h/day was associated with severe to very severe depression (OR 3.60, 95% CI 2.64, 4.90), anxiety (OR 3.16, 95% CI 2.39, 4.19) , and stress (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.88, 3.54). Lack of emotional support from family and society was also associated with severe to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress (Table 3) .This study is one of the earliest studies to evaluate the prevalence of several psychological disturbances among the public outside China during the COVID-19 pandemic. We indicated a high prevalence of depression (67.1%), anxiety (53.5%), stress (48.8%), and inadequate sleeping (23.1%) among the public in Egypt during the pandemic. We could also determine many sociodemographic associations with severe to very severe forms of depression, anxiety, and stress.It should be noted that comparing our results with the previous Chinese studies could be challenging due to the wide differences in sociodemographic characteristics and cultural perspectives between both populations in addition to the variations in the scales assessing psychological conditions across studies. However, we could notice that the prevalence of psychological conditions among our sample was higher than that among the Chinese populations. This could be explained by the limited health services in Egypt in comparison with China which led to worse psychological conditions. This explanation is supported by our findings that showed more severe to very severe depression and anxiety among southern governorates (Beni-Suef and Assiut) than northern governorates (Cairo and Alexandria). The health system in southern Egypt is inferior to that in northern Egypt with many financial, structural, and cultural barriers to health services in the southern governorates (Chiang et al. 2013) . Moreover, the lower income, that characterizes the Egyptian population compared with the Chinese one and the southern Egyptians compared with the northern ones, was shown to augment the psychological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic (Shi et al. 2020; Cao et al. 2020) .Surprisingly, people working in non-health sectors reported more psychological disturbances than people working in the health sector. In line with our findings, a meta-analysis of studies assessing the psychological conditions among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that the prevalence of depression was 5.1% and 25.5% lower than two large Chinese studies conducted on the general population (Pappa et al. 2020; Shi et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2020 ). This could be partially explained by the possible better knowledge and more positive attitude towards the pandemic among healthcare workers compared with other occupations, therefore, they would be more able to develop coping strategies with the pandemic. In contrast, a web-based cross-sectional survey from China showed that healthcare workers were more likely to suffer mental health problems than the public during the COVID-19 pandemic (Huang and Zhao 2020) .Our results showed that women were more likely to suffer psychological disturbances than men which reflects the already known gender gap for depression and anxiety (Albert 2015) . In agreement, pooling the results of five recent studies showed a depression prevalence of 20.3% among men and 26.9% among women. Also, pooling the results of six studies showed an anxiety prevalence of 20.9% among men and 29.1% among women (Pappa et al. 2020) .Further, watching/reading COVID-19 news ≥ 2 h/day, in this study, was associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Exposure to social media and thinking about the pandemic for a long time were associated with worse psychological consequences (Gao et al. 2020; Huang and Zhao 2020) . Dong and Zheng (2020) recently described what they referred to as ""headline stress disorder"" among 1206 general public in China due to news related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Alike, media coverage of the Ebola outbreak was associated with anxiety among the public in Africa (Kilgo et al. 2019) .Moreover, people who lacked emotional support from family and society showed worse psychological consequences compared with their counterparts who were offered support. A study conducted on college students in China showed that social support correlated negatively with their level of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic (Cao et al. 2020) . Greater attention, therefore, should be paid to the public mental health by actively providing them with psychological support and counsel.Although this study evaluated the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a large sample of netizens from northern and southern Egypt using a validated assessment tool, some limitations should be considered. First, because of the cross-sectional design of the study, a causality association cannot be implied. Second, the possibility of non-response bias remains a major shortcoming of online questionnaires (Arafa et al. 2019b) . To minimize the effect of this bias, the questionnaire did not involve sensitive questions and used simple multi-choice questions. Still, we cannot guarantee the representativeness of the study population because all respondents were internet users who could read and write. Egypt suffers high illiteracy rates and illiterate people are significantly different from the educated people regarding their sociodemographic characteristics (CAPMAS 2017). Third, some potential confounders that can modify the mental health impacts of the pandemic such as leisure activities were not investigated. Fourth, receiving emotional support from family and society was subjectively assessed using two yes/no questions. Using more detailed scales to assess emotional support would have been more informative.In conclusion, the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the public were enormous, especially among women and people not working in the health sector, therefore, providing psychological support to the public is highly desirable.

62c89a38a95825b7a5599795955856f81f46653b,Managing cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic: a North African oncological center experience Managing cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic: a North African oncological center experience,"Since December 2019, the world has known the outbreak of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 that first appeared in Wuhan (Hubei province, China). Since then, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressively involved countries outside China leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to recognize it as a pandemic. It is therefore considered an emerging health threat (WHO, 2020) [1] . The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Morocco on March 2 nd , 2020 when the first case was reported [2] . Because of the virus´s rapid human-to-human transmission and potential severity, the Government of Morocco has announced by the 20 th of March a ""Health State of Emergency"" as part of its policy to limit the spread of the virus. Thus, a lockdown has been applied with restriction of movements within and between the cities along with sealing the national borders. During this crisis, the Moroccan Health System underwent an important pressure and remarkable efforts were spent to provide efficient reactions to this emergency. Public hospitals have set adapted strategies dedicated to overcoming the overload of COVID-19 patients. Currently, the Emergency Medical System is being implemented with material supplies such as respirators, personal protection equipment (PPE), and treatment. But also with healthcare providers. For this purpose, medical doctors from different departments and specialties were recruited to provide their assistance in managing patients suffering from COVID-19.In this very unusual situation, cancer patients are considered as a highly vulnerable group and more susceptible to infections as compared to general population due to systemic immunosuppression secondary to both the malignancy and anticancer treatments. In the literature, Gwan et al. were the first to focus on oncological cases affected by COVID-19, through their study they concluded that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in cancer patients deteriorating more rapidly and presenting higher risks of severe events including the necessity for admission to the ICU and death. Interestingly, older adults and patients with preexisting comorbidities (commonly diabetes and cardiovascular disease) are facing the most severe and critical consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, the current emergency is of particular concern to medical oncologists, radiotherapists, and their patients [3] . The Oncology and Hematology Center (OHC) as part of the Mohamed VIth University Teaching Hospital of Marrakesh, Morocco has implemented a flexible adapted strategy aiming to reduce the burden of COVID-19. Our infection control protocol consisted of three measures: To enhance safety measures for both patients and workers in the center, to prioritize and adapt treatment protocols, and to provide appropriate care without delays for urgent patients. In the present paper, we report our singlecenter experience on the detailed infection control measures that were undertaken to minimize virus transmission between cancer patients and between the patients and the healthcare workers. Measures entailing screening of suspect cases, reorganization of the treatment facility, and protection of patients and healthcare workers were described. With our infection control protocol, we recorded zero COVID-19 cases among the patients and healthcare workers between March 2 nd and April 20 th , 2020.Patients' cohort: we reviewed all patients who were treated at the Oncology and Hematology Center (OHC) of Mohammed VIth University Teaching Hospital of Marrakesh, Morocco, from March 2 nd to April 20 th , 2020. The starting date of this study preceded the country lockdown by 18 days, as measures were taken since the detection of the first COVID-19 case to ensure the protection of patients and healthcare providers. Patient´s data such as medical history, contact with a COVID-19 positive patient, suspected symptoms and clinical examination, biological investigations, and possible chest imaging, were retrospectively collected and anonymized.Infection control measures: strong infection control measures were implemented all over the OHC, including a new sorting area dedicated to patient screening, a special clinical unit to manage suspected COVID-19 cases, and adapted schedules for healthcare workers and treatment administration.Screening/sorting zone: the sorting zone was an interface area situated at the entrance of the OHC. A strict and safe triaging procedure was performed to assess any COVID-19 symptoms as shown in Figure 1 . Thus, all patients were checked for their body temperature before accessing the center followed by a quick check-up for COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, diarrhea and asthenia, and history of contact with SARS-Cov 2 infected patients. In the case of isolated fever, dedicated medical staff performed clinical and biological investigations in order to diagnose an underlying etiology. Suspected COVID-19 patients were isolated in a dedicated area, and then referred to COVID-19 facilities for further examinations. Nonsuspected patients were given surgical masks and put under primary hygiene measures such as hands and accessories disinfection and shoes and wheelchairs cleaning using a carpet soaked with Sodium Hypochlorite.Organization measures: during the COVID-19 pandemic, the units of OHC were managed to ensure both, the protection and good care delivery for all cancer patients as shown in Figure 2 . For this purpose, several measures were established: 1) Entry/exit points were reduced, marking separately ""staff"" and ""patients"" entrances to facilitate communication and policy adherence. 2) The reception was shifted to the main entrance, and patients in wait were separated by a security distance of 2 meters using soil-markers. 3) Center attendance was limited to the patient and one visitor accompanying children and patients with special needs. 4) In waiting rooms, patients were educated to respect strict social distancing and avoid communicating with each other. Different educational posters and live TV broadcasts were displayed to highlight the importance of hygiene measures and distancing. The waiting room chairs were disinfected continuously. 5) OHC outpatient´s care Units were managed to receive a limited number of patients within specific daily time slots. Telemedicine was adopted to reduce in-person hospital visits during an infectious pandemic. 6) Hospitalization unit was managed to assure treatment for patients undergoing chemotherapy in individual rooms, equipped with disposable materials to prevent any risks of transmission. Moreover, rooms were disinfected on a daily basis. The prophylactic use of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) was expanded from high risk to intermediate risk regimens in order to minimize risk of febrile neutropenia. 7) Ambulatory care hospital was supplied with 20 medical armchairs, distanced by 1.5 meters to ensure optimal distancing between patients, and all armchairs were disinfected between patients. The switch from intravenous chemotherapy to acceptable oral alternative was considered on a case-by-case basis as well as the use of 3 weeks protocols instead of weekly chemotherapy. 8) In Radiation therapy unit, the immobilization devices, CT scanner, and treatment tables were disinfected following each use. Patients´ overcrowding was limited by scheduling treatment sessions of 20-40 min for each patient and hypo-fractionated protocols were adopted for validated indications. 9) Finally, internal and multidisciplinary meetings were maintained using video-conference platforms. Protection of healthcare workers given the high risk of COVID-19 pneumonia for frontline medical staff, measures were implemented to mitigate the risk of cross-infection from patients to healthcare workers. Training sessions on the management of Covid-19 patients and selfprotection were organized, the availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was assured following the WHO recommendations and healthcare providers were dispatched in two teams ensuring one shift every two days.Statistical analysis: for descriptive analysis, continuous variables were presented as the mean with standard deviation or as median with interquartile range (IQR), as appropriate. Categorical variables are presented as percentages (%). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normality of data distribution.All the demographic features included in the present study describe the period from March 2 nd to April 20 th , 2020, and are summarized in Table 1,  Table 2, and Table 3 . Radiation therapy unit: a total of 167 patients were admitted for CT-scanner simulation and 142 for treatment. The median age was 51 years old (IQR: 4-84). Breast cancer (35%), Head and Neck Cancer mainly nasopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer (22%), and Gynecological Tumors including Cervix cancer (14%) comprised the majority of the cases. Among these patients, 47% received Adjuvant RT, 39% received definitive RT while 14% received palliative treatments. Before and during the lockdown, the mean number of admitted patients per day was relatively constant (96 ± 3 patients).The screening area received a total of 5267 patients from March 2 nd to April 20 th , 2020, with an average of 105 patients per day. Interestingly, only 8 patients showed symptoms of fever and cough, after deep investigations we report that: 1) One patient had a contact history with a confirmed COVID-19 case, the Rt-PCR result was negative and the patient displayed a normal chest CT scan. 2) One patient had tuberculosis with a negative Rt-PCR. 3) Two patients presented suspected CT scan profiles (ground-glass opacity) but the Rt-PCR results were negative. 4) Four patients underwent Rt-PCR for unexplained fever and respiratory symptoms but all came back negative. However, since those 8 patients were admitted mainly for chemotherapy, their treatment was postponed and they remained on quarantine for 14 days. Concerning healthcare providers, one staff member (A Radiation therapist) presented suspect symptoms including fever and cough with no previous contact history with a COVID-19 patient. He underwent an Rt-PCR and chest CT scan that came out negative. Thus, the OHC is considered as a COVID-19 free center with zero cases among patients and healthcare providers.The present report describes the contingency plan established by the Oncology and Hematology Center (OHC) of Mohammed VI th University Teaching Hospital of Marrakesh, Morocco. We shared our single-institution experience in the safety and management of cancer patients in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak. Overall, the national COVID-19 situation is particularly under control in Morocco, this was challenging to achieve and to maintain for both national healthcare system and OHC which attracts patients from all the southern regions of the country. It is well established that due to their immunosuppressive state, cancer patients present higher vulnerability for infections [4] [5] [6] . This information was corroborated by the Liang et al. cohort describing that cancer patients had a higher risk of developing severe events (intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, or death) compared with general population (39% Vs 8%, p=0.0003). Moreover, according to the same study, patients who received antitumor treatment within 14 days before COVID-19 diagnosis, including, radiotherapy, systemic therapies, and surgery had a higher risk of developing severe events with borderline statistical significance [7] . Several other factors could account for an elevated risk for acquiring COVID-19 and serious complications in cancer patients, including frequent hospital visits and admissions, advanced age, and poor functional status [3] .Assuming these implications, several international guidelines were published concerning the management of cancer patients´ treatment during COVID-19 pandemic [8] along with oncological expert centers all around the world implementing drastic safety measures to ensure the protection of their patients and staff while guaranteeing the best care possible to their patients [9, 10] . International experts´ recommendations shed lights on the importance of home management of cancer patients (e.g. telemedicine), as well as the replacement of intravenous drugs with adapted oral alternatives on a case by case basis (e.g., 5 Fluoro-Uracil and Capecitabine) [8] . Furthermore, the adjustment of dosing schedules of chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments was recommended to reduce the frequency of hospital admissions (e.g., Paclitaxel every 3 weeks, rather than weekly administration and hypo-fractionated radiotherapy) [11] . OHC´s management strategy was in line with these international recommendations [11, 12] . Our infection control protocol was covering a stepwise clinical pathway to manage suspect cases (symptomatic assessment, CT-scan, and RT-PCR assays). Many other measures were implemented, mainly on-site screening, re-organization of the OHC facilities, and protection of patients and healthcare workers.Obviously, delayed or interrupted oncology treatments (e.g. surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) may lead to disease progression and compromise survival outcomes. It was a major concern for us during this difficult period. We reported a diminishing number of outpatient visits and performed chemotherapy sessions, mainly because of the health emergency state and the inter-cities transport being suspended. It is mandatory, especially in the context of a limited resource system, to balance the potential benefit of containment measures, such as postponing scheduled procedures, with negative health and social costs. COVID-19 infection Diagnosis in cancer patients was particularly challenging, due to multiple factors. First of them would be the similarities of symptoms between the infection and the underlying disease, especially in lung cancer patients and patients with pulmonary metastasis which can hide an underlying COVID-19 infection causing a delay of diagnosis [13] . Adding to this, Cancer patients might have radiographic findings similar to those of a SAR-CoV-2 infection that can be misleading or paradoxically having atypical radiologic features of COVID-19 infection [14] . In our study, we conducted a systematic CT scan and RT-PCR to our suspected patients and due to the heterogeneity of radiological and biological findings, those patients were systematically put in quarantine and their cancer treatment was delayed. None of our patients or healthcare workers were infected which attests to the efficiency of our measures. We should point out that the actual global policy of diverting the attention exclusively to the COVID-19 pandemic and overshadowing other clinical conditions may have substantial negative implications for cancer patients and lead to an eventual spike of cancer deaths in Morocco within the next few months.Our main goal was to develop an adapted strategy to protect our patients and healthcare workers from contracting the novel coronavirus disease without impacting the quality of our healthcare services. By having 0% rate of infection, the efficiency of our measures is proven, but efforts are still needed as we have to measure the impact of this pandemic in our cancer management, and certainly more studies are yet to come to show this impact in our patients.

e30a70e67257a6badbf195d72a03b64cee8e2e60,"Neonatal COVID-19 Pneumonia: Report of the First Case in a Preterm Neonate in Mayotte, an Overseas Department of France","On 31 December 2019, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown causes in the city of Wuhan [1] .This pneumonia was linked to a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] . This disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly to many countries all over the world in a few months, and we are currently still in the midst of a pandemic. The first cases detected in Europe were reported from France on 24 January 2020.In Mayotte, one of the French overseas departments in the Indian Ocean with a population estimated at 256,000 and a significant birth rate of 10,000 births per year, a COVID-19 infection was first reported on 14 March 2020. As of 24 June 2020, the French public health agency (Santé Publique France) has identified 2467 cases of COVID-19 on the island [3] . Little is known about its clinical characteristics and outcomes in neonates, especially preterm infants. We report, in the present paper, the first case in Mayotte of neonatal COVID-19 thus far, in a preterm infant who showed clinical symptoms and (presumably) vertical transmission. This case highlights the need for a cautious extended follow-up as well as clear and evidence-based guidelines.A 36-year-old multiparous woman, with a history of idiopathic bronchiectasis and gestational diabetes, was admitted to the delivery emergencies unit for active labor at 33 weeks of gestation. On admission, her body temperature was 37.4 • C, and her respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were within the normal ranges. Maternal antibiotic therapy and intramuscular corticosteroids for fetal pulmonary maturation were not administrated due to a rapid labor that lead to the vaginal birth, with meconium-stained amniotic fluid, of a preterm male infant. During the vaginal delivery, the mother developed a persistent cough and dyspnea, so she was suspected of being infected with COVID-19, and droplet and contact precautions were immediately initiated. RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab from the mother was performed just after delivery and was positive for SARS-COV2 (130,000 copies/uL) and her thoracic CT scan showed peripheral ground glass opacities associated with unilateral bronchiectasis. The neonate was born weighing 1830 g with an Apgar score of five at 1 min, seven at 5 min, and nine at 10 min. Skin-to-skin contact with his mother was not performed; he was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on non-invasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation. He was in a closed incubator throughout his admission, and the mother's access was not permitted in the NICU as she was symptomatic.On admission, he was clinically stable on non-invasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation with a mild transient respiratory distress that resolved within 24 h; his fractional concentrations of oxygen in inspired air (FiO2) remained at 21%. Furthermore, he was exclusively formula fed and was given prophylactic intravenous antibiotic therapy (Cefotaxim and Gentallin) that was stopped at 48 h as the blood culture was negative and the C-reactive protein (CRP) was normal. A nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR was performed at 24 h of life and showed a positive result for SARS-COV2 with a viral load of 918,000 copies/uL. The RNA extraction was done with the QIAsymphony DSP Virus/pathogen Midi Kit (QIAGEN®).The chest X-ray showed normal lung aeration without pneumonia ( Figure 1a ). The infant remained stable and was switched to nasal continuous positive airway pressure at 2 days of life, and gradually weaned to low nasal flow cannula for 48 h; he was then completely weaned to room air at around 7 days of life.By 14 days of life, the infant developed a fever with progressive signs of increased breathing difficulties, such tachypnea and chest retractions, but his hemodynamic status remained normal.A thoracic CT scan revealed bilateral ground glass opacities and consolidations ( Figure 1b ). Echocardiography showed a mild pericardial effusion (3 mm). A new nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR was performed at 14 days of life and was positive for SARS-COV2. The Table 1 summarizes the results of the laboratory tests. Nosocomial infection was ruled out, a high nasal flow cannula was initiated, and oral azithromycin was administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 5 days. A nasopharyngeal swab analyzed via RT-PCR was negative at 21 days of life.The follow-up showed mild respiratory worsening by day 35; a secondary infection was ruled out and the patient was switched to nasal continuous positive airway pressure. He was weaned to room air after 45 days of life and discharged by day 50. Follow-up visits were planned for one week and one month following the discharge.Children 2020, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 5 fetal pulmonary maturation were not administrated due to a rapid labor that lead to the vaginal birth, with meconium-stained amniotic fluid, of a preterm male infant.

Echocardiography showed a mild pericardial effusion (3 mm). A new nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR was performed at 14 days of life and was positive for SARS-COV2. The Table 1 summarizes the results of the laboratory tests. Nosocomial infection was ruled out, a high nasal flow cannula was initiated, and oral azithromycin was administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 5 days. A nasopharyngeal swab analyzed via RT-PCR was negative at 21 days of life.The follow-up showed mild respiratory worsening by day 35; a secondary infection was ruled out and the patient was switched to nasal continuous positive airway pressure. He was weaned to room air after 45 days of life and discharged by day 50. Follow-up visits were planned for one week and one month following the discharge. Mothers with COVID-19 infection may present with obstetrical complications such as preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction and neonatal death. In our case, preterm labor is presumably linked to the mother's COVID-19 infection, as there was no other evident cause. In neonates, COVID-19 infection in the mother may cause severe acute respiratory distress and biological disorders, including thrombocytopenia and abnormal liver function [4] . Laboratory tests in the present case showed a normal liver function and platelet count. Many cohort and case studies have strongly supported the absence of vertical transmission [5] [6] [7] [8] , However, Lan Dong et al. [9] reported a possible in utero infection in a newborn with elevated IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 born to a mother with COVID-19. Alzamora et al. reported [10] a possible vertical transmission in a case report. Finally, the group from Antoine-Béclère Hospital (France) recently reported a proven in utero trans placental transmission of SARS-Cov2 from a pregnant woman infected with COVID-19 [11] .The mode of transmission in our case is most likely to be vertical given the short time it took for the neonate to become SARS-CoV-2 positive after delivery (24 h), the absence of skin-to-skin contact at birth and throughout admission, and the absence of visits by the mother as she was symptomatic. In addition, the baby remained in a closed incubator with droplet and contact precautions, as COVID-19 was suspected during delivery; therefore, it seems unlikely that the infant was infected by the nosocomial spread of aerosolized virus or by an infected healthcare worker. Breastfeeding was excluded as the route of transmission as the infant was exclusively formula fed. However, our report has some limitations, including the fact that it presents a single case, a vaginal delivery and due to the absence of serology testing and PCR testing of the amniotic fluid, placenta and umbilical cord, as well as the mother's vaginal secretions.Transmission through breastfeeding needs to be elucidated. In our unit, the use of maternal expressed breast milk is contraindicated in mothers with COVID-19. Skin-to-skin contact is not permitted given the benefit-risk balance. More studies are therefore needed in order to provide accurate evidence-based management guidelines.In the present paper, we noted a symptom-free interval between initial transient respiratory distress that was most likely related to the preterm birth, and the secondary respiratory distress that appeared by day 14, with a prolonged need for respiratory support and a longer length of stay compared to other reported pediatric studies [12] [13] [14] .This emphasizes the need for a cautious and close follow-up period for asymptomatic neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 infection who can develop severe pneumonia.Premature infants born to mothers with a COVID-19 infection may also have a COVID-19 infection, presumably via vertical transmission. Further studies are needed to confirm this route of transmission. The need for an extended and cautious follow-up period for asymptomatic neonates with COVID-19 should be kept in mind, as symptoms may appear secondarily with rapidly severe respiratory symptoms that may require prolonged respiratory support. The authors declare no conflict of interest.",Mayotte,abstract,2020-08-03,08
5eeb232946a8cb21f750fb7929efad7a2f64da0b,COVID-19 and Gynecological Cancers: A Summary of International Recommendations,"Morocco and the rest of the world are experiencing a pandemic of a new coronavirus known as COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) [1] . On August 22, 2020 , the spread of the virus in Morocco had caused more than 52,000 cases and 880 deaths.Cancer patients are more susceptible to develop an infection than people without cancer because of their immunosuppression caused by the disease and treatments, such as chemotherapy and/or surgery. Therefore, these patients are at higher risk of infection with COVID-19 and a much higher risk of developing more serious forms [1] .Given this epidemiological context, it is important to establish recommendations that may still offer these patients effective treatment while at the same time limit their exposure and infection with the virus.In fact, a recent Turkish study of 200 patients who received surgery for gynecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that gynecological cancer surgery can be performed safely when appropriate measures to protect patients and staff from the exposure to COVID-19 are taken preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. Only 1% of cases developed symptoms of COVID-19 after surgery, and no member of the surgical team developed symptoms related to COVID-19 disease [2] .Two precautions seem to be important for our patients [3, 4] :1) Limiting the consequences of very high-risk situations such as surgery and chemotherapy; 2) Limiting exposure of patients to treatment stations.To protect patients and healthcare staff form COVID-19 contamination, screening of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients should be recommended before initial management.Screening should be based on clinical evaluation of symptoms suggestive on COVID-19 infection, systematic temperature taking at the entrance to cancer units, and, on PCR test, possibly coupled with a chest CT scan, depending on availability, in addition to blood tests to look for eosinopenia, lymphopenia, and an increase in inflammatory parameters.Teleconsultation is an interesting monitoring tool that ensures continuity of care for cancer patients and thus reduces the unnecessary physical travel to care facilities, by selecting those who really need it.In this paper, we sought to report useful recommendations to reduce the impact of this pandemic in patients with gynecologic cancers. Face masks can provide source control (protecting others from respiratory secretions from the mask wearer) and protection (protecting the wearer from secretions from others), but not all masks play both roles. For example, surgical masks provide source control with limited or no wearer protection, while N95 (or FFP2 mask) respirator masks provide source control and wearer protection. N95 respirators are also recommended for the care of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients [5] .Access to rapid and reliable tests to detect the presence of an active infection by the virus has been a major challenge during this pandemic due to the limited capacities of testing. The CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov) and many medical institutions rapidly developed PCR tests in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs.Clinical screening is based on the evaluation of symptoms of a viral infection (fever, dry cough, tiredness, etc.), systematic temperature taking at the entrance to cancer units, and research of potential contact with high-risk individuals, including those in quarantine. All patients should undergo clinical screening by teleconsultation prior to visit, before the entrance to the cancer center, and immediately prior to surgery, etc. [5] .Diagnostic testing involves identifying specific genes for SARS-CoV-2 (core or envelope) by real-time RT-PCR, with most results expected within 12 to 48 h. Theoretically, RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 is very sensitive to detect the presence of viral RNA. However, the limit of detection differs for different respiratory tract sources. The performance of RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal secretions varies depending on the time since symptom onset or exposure to COVID-19 virus, the false-negative rate ranged from 20 to 100%. Routine preoperative COVID-19 testing is recommended due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic cases. A single negative test cannot exclude the wearing of N95 masks, when available, during AGP (aerosol-generating procedures). In surgical emergencies, surgery should be performed on the assumption that the patient is positive if test results are not available [5] .Preoperative screening by chest computed tomography (CT) may be relevant in patients at risk. Indeed, nearly 19% of COVID-19 pneumonia occurs in asymptomatic patients. In settings where RT-PCR testing is not available and in areas of high prevalence of COVID-19, chest CT may be the only option as a preoperative test. However, the CDC (https:// www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov) and the American College of Radiology do not recommend performing chest CT as a test for COVID-19 but reserve it for diagnostic purposes in symptomatic patients [5] .The American College of Surgeons (ACS) and other international societies have established recommendations to protect patients and medical staff from COVID-19 contamination and to preserve hospital resources. Patients with gynecological cancers often require surgery which is particularly disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, accurate triage of urgent vs elective surgical cases is crucial in order to preserve the availability of medical resources to face a growing number of COVID-19-positive patients. In addition, hospitals are an important vector for the virus spread therefore guidelines should be strategic to ensure the safety of patients and staff [2, 5] .Most cancer-related interventions, including those for gynecologic cancers, are given a high priority level (semiurgent) [2, 5] .The surgical prioritization is determined according to: The highest priority should be given to the surgical treatment of high-risk cancers, especially those candidates for minimally invasive surgery (such as robotic surgery) and short hospital stay, in addition to potentially curative procedures for early-stage cancers. In addition, women with advanced ovarian and uterine cancers, requiring cytoreductive interval surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be given priority when possible. However, in the restricted surgical areas of high COVID-19 prevalence, cytoreduction (primary/interval) should be postponed, and chemotherapy started (or continued up to 6 cycles) to prevent exposure of immunocompromised patients to the virus and to conserve hospital resources [5] .According to the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), surgery for high-grade dysplasia may be delayed for up to 3 months and dysplasia of lower grade surgery can be delayed for 6 to 12 months. In contrast, patients with invasive disease should be treated within 1 month [5] .During surgery, the most dangerous time in a COVID-19positive or unknown patient is endotracheal intubation and extubation considered as aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). AGPs are more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, speaking, or breathing. Therefore, enhanced security measures are necessary [5] .The following recommendations allow a fast and safe intubation/extubation process for all operating room staff [5] :& Only necessary personnel should be in the operating room during the intubation/extubation process. The rest of the surgical team should stay out of the room, and the time of re-entry depends on the type of mask they wear and the level of air renewal in the room. In a standard operating room, 99% of airborne pathogens are cleared from the room within 18 min, after which time staff can re-enter safely with surgical masks and eye protection. The surgeon and operating room staff may also wear an N95 respirator with goggles if they cannot leave the room (patient not masked). & Rapid sequence intubation and video laryngoscopy reduce the risk of aerosolization and promote accuracy and increase the distance between the intubator and the patient. & All surgeons should wear the usual cap, gowns, protective shoes, and double gloves. N95 masks and eye protection are recommended for AGP procedures; a surgical mask with eye protection can be used for non-AGP procedures.Robotic surgery has major advantages over laparoscopic surgery. Robotic surgery can be performed safely with pressures low than 10 mmHg. This lower pressure requirement probably reduces the risk of transmission of viral particles to the medical staff. Another advantage is the reduced number of healthcare professionals in an operating room and the distance between team members. In conventional laparoscopic surgery, the surgical team traditionally includes the surgeon, an assistant, a technician, and a nurse. These members are very close to each other. With robotic surgery, the surgeon's console is separated from the robot, providing more space between team members. Additionally, robotic surgery may require fewer assistants, which means less overall exposure [6] .During the COVID-19 pandemic, precautions should be done in order to reduce the spread of the virus in brachytherapy unit:& Management of cancer patients should be done in ""COVID-19-negative"" units For patients with cervical cancers, to minimize the risk of contamination, prefer the schemes with a reduced number of fractions: 3 × 8 Gy or 4 × 7 Gy by using an HDR ICBT schedule of 7 Gy per fraction for 4 fractions in 2 insertions 1 week apart. For patients over 70 years of age or with significant comorbidities who have small tumors or responding well to external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), a more shortened schedule of 9 Gy per fraction in 2 fractions at 1 week apart may be considered.In stage I, low-risk endometrial cancer, it is recommended to postpone brachytherapy up to 12 weeks. For patients with significant comorbidities, exposing them to the risk of severe complications of COVID-19 infection, it may be judicious to delay brachytherapy for 6 months. Patients, who should start vaginal vault brachytherapy (VVB), should consider the schedule of 7 Gy for 3 fractions, to limit the number of patient displacement. An interval spacing of 14 days between the fractions is also acceptable. However, for high-risk patients who received adjuvant external RT, omitting BVV may be reasonable.For stage II endometrial cancers, adjuvant VVB is delivered exclusively (if invasion < 50% of the myometrium, G1 and 2) or after EBRT (if invasion > 50% of the myometrium, G3). In both cases, consider to postpone brachytherapy by 1 to 2 months. In the case of a COVID-19-positive patient, postpone treatment for at least 24 days [7] .For low-grade cervical dysplasia, the diagnostic evaluation may be postponed for 6 to 12 months. However, in the case of high-grade dysplasia (CIN3 or CIS), the diagnostic evaluation should be done within 3 months [4, 5] .For patients with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA, IB1, IB2, and IIa stages), if surgery is still allowed in the institution, consider standard treatment with surgery. However, when access to surgery is limited, the following procedures may be considered [3] [4] [5] [6] 8] :& For limited disease, consider to postpone surgical treatment (trachelectomy or radical hysterectomy) for a period of 8 weeks or until the crisis resolves; & For microscopic disease (stage IA) or low-risk disease (< 2 cm, low-risk histology excluding adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma), consider conization or a simple trachelectomy + sentinel node mapping (if available) or pelvic lymphadenectomy; & For large tumor > 2 cm (stage IB2 or IIa), surgical staging is more accurate than clinical and radiological staging and should be discussed on a case by case basis. The primary treatment is either surgery or radiotherapy/brachytherapy. Radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection ± para-aortic lymph node dissection is the preferred surgical option. Radiotherapy/brachytherapy should be considered in the case of limited access to surgery or for patients who are not eligible for hysterectomy [9] .For locally advanced stages of the disease (FIGO stages IB3, IB2-IVA), concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by brachytherapy is recommended and should be started on time without delay [7, 8] . Consider hypo-fractionated radiotherapy to reduce the frequency of patient exposure to treatment stations [4] .Patient with metastatic cervical cancer should be considered for first-line chemotherapy based on paclitaxelcarboplatin ± bevacizumab (prefer carboplatin to cisplatin) [10] . However, second-line treatment has a low benefit and limited priority.For early-stage disease (IA and IB), surgery is the primary treatment [11, 12] . Minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery/ robotic surgery results in lower perioperative complication and should be the preferred option if available [611] . Useful preoperative prognostic factors to guide treatment strategy are age, lympho-vascular invasion, tumor size, depth of uterine invasion, and lymph node involvement [11] . For low-risk cancers (stage IA, grade 1 and 2), consider total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TH/BSO) with sentinel lymph node procedure (if available) or lymph node dissection. For intermediate risks (IB, grade 1 and 2), radical surgery plus vaginal brachytherapy is the preferred strategy [4, 7, 11] . For elderly women and for patients with comorbidities, initial systemic therapy with hormone therapy (for estrogen and progesterone receptor positive), and postpone surgery until the crisis resolves [4, 11] . For high-risk cancers (IB grade 3 or high-risk histology type 2), the recommended surgical procedure includes TH/BSO with surgical staging and lymph node dissection in a single-incision surgery [11] . Adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy without brachytherapy is recommended and should be started within 3 months [7, 13, 14] . Systemic adjuvant therapy using carboplatin AUC5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/ m 2 for 4 cycles is to be considered in high-risk disease. Consider granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSF) to limit the risk of febrile neutropenia. In stage II endometrial cancer, proceed with radical surgery and consider adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk factors (same as stage I). For locally advanced stages (III and IVA), surgical treatment is the treatment of choice [3, 4, 11] . Adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy ± vaginal brachytherapy is recommended. In the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (plus GCSF) is the preferred regimen for 6 cycles [15, 16] . For patients who are not suited for surgery, radiotherapy/ brachytherapy is an effective treatment and may be considered with or without chemotherapy [17] . For metastatic disease (FIGO IVB stage), chemotherapy based on carboplatin/ paclitaxel plus GCSF is recommended. Elderly patients or pauci-symptomatic patients with low-grade histology favor mono-chemotherapy (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, carboplatin) or hormone therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancers) [3, 4] .Early-stage ovarian cancer proceeds with oophorectomy on the suspect mass; then, the decision to complete surgical staging is based on final histological analysis [3, 4] . Consider adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin-paclitaxel (4 cycles) for patients with high-grade serous and endometrial ovarian carcinoma. For early-stage non-serous, non-endometrioid, or low-grade histological cancers, the benefit of chemotherapy is controversial and surveillance is the preferred option. For stages IC and II (with high-risk factors), consider adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel-carboplatin plus GCSF for 4 cycles [18] . For patients with advanced stage (stages III/IV) high-grade epithelial (serous or endometrioid) ovarian cancer, the standard treatment is based on primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (protocol based on the result of the surgery). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) strategy is the preferred option even in patients who are candidates for primary surgery because of the occupancy of intensive care unit beds by COVID-19 patients [5] . In addition, randomized trials have reported a significant reduction in operative time and complications in favor of NAC. Carboplatin AUC 5/paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles is the recommended regimen, following neoadjuvant treatment, consideration of maximum debulking surgery with total hysterectomy (TH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and complete resection of all visible disease. In the case of R0 surgery first, adjuvant treatment based on carboplatin/paclitaxel for 6 cycles is recommended without maintenance chemotherapy [18, 19] . For patients with high-risk factors (R1 and R2 resection, and stage IV disease), maintenance treatment with bevacizumab is recommended [20] . For patients with a germ line or somatic BRCA1/2 mutation, maintenance therapy with PARP inhibitor is the preferred option (if available) [4] . For patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, consideration of extending treatment for six cycles until the crisis resolves and postpone surgery at a later date, due to the unavailability of ICU beds . For patients not eligible for surgery, chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel and bevacizumab for 6 cycles followed by maintenance bevacizumab is recommended. For patients with BRCA mutation, consider the early start of maintenance therapy with PARP inhibitors after 4 cycles of chemotherapy [18, 19] . After disease progression, chemotherapy may be indicated for symptomatic patients [3, 4] .For early-stage vulvar cancer (T1 or T2), primary surgery is the treatment of choice [21] . Inguino-femoral lymph node dissection is recommended for T1 or T2 stages with a depth of invasion > 1 mm. Consider adjuvant radiotherapy for high-risk disease with adverse prognostic factors in the pathology report (lymph node involvement, positive vascular emboli, marginal < 8 mm or positive tumor margins, tumor size > 4 cm, and or depth of invasion) [22] . When surgical management would require very heavy surgery, consider concurrent chemoradiotherapy. For elderly women with early-stage disease, postpone treatment by 4-8 weeks. For locally advanced vulvar cancer (T2-T3), standard treatment is based on concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin or 5-FU/cisplatin [21] . For metastatic disease, consider radiotherapy for symptoms palliation and local control [22] . Chemotherapy and supportive care are two alternatives in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [3] .For early-stage I squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina, if < 5 mm of invasion, exclusive brachytherapy is the treatment of choice. In patients with significant comorbidities (old age, chronic respiratory pathology or cardiac, immunosuppression ...), consider to postpone brachytherapy by 1 to 2 months. If invasion > 5 mm, consider radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy.For patients with stage I vaginal adenocarcinoma, consider radical vaginectomy and hysterectomy with lymph node dissection. Adjuvant RT should be considered in the case of close or positive surgical margins [23] .For patients with advanced stage vagina cancer (II, III, and Iva), radio-chemotherapy and brachytherapy are the treatment of choice [3] . For stage IVb vaginal cancer, palliative chemotherapy based on 5fluorouracil-carboplatin is the preferred option [7, 23] .Recognizing that the morbidity and mortality from postoperative COVID-19 pneumonia is significant, surgery should be delayed in COVID-19-positive patients until they are asymptomatic for more than 3 weeks; some teams recommend a negative control test by RT-PCR [1, 5] .The largest series (n = 121) analyzing patients with gynecological cancer and COVID-19 infection is that of the New York City, an area highly exposed to the coronavirus. Overall mortality among patients infected with COVID-19 and having gynecologic cancer was 14%, while mortality among hospitalized patients was 25.8%. These results show that the mortality rate among patients hospitalized in this series is lower compared with the rate reported in the general population of the New York region which is 34.3%. This suggests that patients with gynecologic cancer and COVID-19 infection do not have a higher risk of COVID-19-related mortality compared with the general population [24] .A dedicated circuit should be implemented for COVID-19positive patients whose management cannot be postponed. During urgent surgery for COVID-19-positive patients, patient and staff safety must be the priority. Each center should consider assigning a dedicated team of surgeons to provide surgical care for COVID-19 patients. Professional at high risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 should avoid participating in the surgical care of COVID-19-positive patients. According to the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ 2019-ncov), these persons are those aged > 65 or those with chronic lung disease, moderate/severe asthma, severe heart disease, immunosuppressive disease or therapy, cancer, etc. It is also desirable to limit the exposure of pregnant women to COVID-19 patients [1, 5] . Very high priority: curative chemotherapy with high benefit (> 50%):Chemotherapy for trophoblastic and germ cell tumors. Concurrent chemoradiation in cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers.High priority: curative treatment with intermediate benefit (15 to 50%) compared with local treatment alone:Chemotherapy in high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer.Medium priority: curative treatment with low benefit (10-15%):High-grade ovarian cancer during the first platinumsensitive relapse. High-grade advanced endometrial cancer.Low priority: palliative treatment with high benefit:Palliative chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and endometrial. Very low priority: palliative treatment with low benefit Chemotherapy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Palliative radiotherapy for symptom control: palliative radiotherapy for metastases and symptomatic pelvic masses.Authors' Contributions All authors contributed to the conception and design, drafting, and critical revision of this manuscript.

Since the beginning of 2020, there has been an exponential growth in the volume of COVID-19 related publications, from clinical trials to research papers to commentaries and opinion pieces. 1 The rate at which articles are being published has made it an insurmountable task to keep abreast of the new information. 2 Yet, it is debatable as to whether or not this rapid increase in publications has been borne from quality research. 3 In fact, a recent analysis by Girolamo and Reynders (2020) indicated that much of the research has not led to new knowledge. 3 Pharmacists desire and need evidence to inform practice, and without credible and scientifically sound research studies, partly due to the rush to publish, there is not only a pandemic but an ""infodemic"". 3, 4 Hence, there is an urgent need to focus our research efforts to provide pharmacists and other healthcare providers with trusted information and evidence to inform patient care, pharmacy practice, and policy changes in the midst of COVID-19.To address this challenge, methodologically robust, practitioner-led research is needed. It has been argued that ""research"" is not just for academics but is about authentic issues affecting the public, patients and pharmacists. 5 In many cases, professional organizations are collating information and providing resources for pharmacists in a variety of settings, with some that are more country-or apandemic. The difference is the ability to adapt research and test new models in light of the rapidly changing conditions in which we might be working. Thus, the ""best"" research continues to be that which is grounded in solid theory, rigorous methods and execution, with a well-constructed plan for streams of research that are cogent and complementary to one another. A well-planned research agenda based in theory and rooted in the literature is not ""interrupted"" by a sudden pandemic. Rather, the well-planned research agenda can be adapted toward and help meet the needs of an unexpected health crisis.Most researchers in pharmacy practice were not conducting research on COVID-19, itself, until after it took a hold on an unsuspecting world populace. However, a glance at some of the initial, wellregarded, and highly cited papers published in Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy (RSAP) and elsewhere reveals carefully executed research strategies and highly instructive commentary by researchers employing strong backbone and adaptation of their existing line of inquiry.For example, Carico et al. provide insight into how pharmacists can apply the health belief model toward risk mitigation communication with patients. 15 They describe how communication grounded in a well-tested model can assist patients come to their own realization of the benefits of certain behaviors in addition to improving their knowledge of their susceptibility to, and danger posed by, COVID-19 not through paternalistic communication but through guiding the patient in self-discovery.Research by Park et al. evinced that persons believing they were at less risk of contracting the disease were less likely to take part in risk mitigation strategies. 16 Lam discussed the quick mobilization of pharmacists in Macau in assisting other health professionals and serving on the proverbial front lines of care not only to treat patients but also to bolster mitigation strategies among a public with close geographic and familial ties with those at the original epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, China. 17 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f This was made possible due to protocols and interdisciplinary mitigation strategies for various type of emergencies that had already been in place and had been constructed through scientific evidence and best practice.Zheng et al. prepared recommendations for pharmacists' practice in light of the pandemic, again, coming from near its origins in China. 18 While emphasizing the need for flexibility and adaptability in the face of the pandemic, the recommendations were rooted in evidence-based practice from solid research accounting for evolutions in pharmacy practice prior to the pandemic. This group of researchers have long been involved in research proffering roles for pharmacists to ensure patient safety and to advance the roles of clinical pharmacists even prior to the pandemic. 19 Cadogan and Hughes wrote of pharmacists' priorities and shifts in practice during the COVID-19pandemic, but likewise, basing these on prior research on pharmacists' roles during unexpected emergencies, in a broader sense. 20 To that end, research in pharmacy practice, while grounded in solid frameworks, must be multifaceted. It takes myriad system factors and people to optimize pharmacists' roles and patient outcomes. Thus, research must examine communication, operations, the interaction of health systems and economic factors, social support, patient and pharmacist/student education, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological aspects of therapy.Basheti et al. evaluated pharmacists' readiness to engage in these various aspects of practice, including management of actual and potential medicinesshortages and weaknesses in the supply chain. 22 Karasneh evaluated the effect of media coverage of the pandemic on pharmacists' awareness and practice activities finding perhaps an undue influence by lay media, as opposed to relying solely on medical and professional resources. 23 Bahlol and Dewey found pharmacists' preparedness to practice amidst the pandemic to be adequate, but lacking in reporting frequency, mechanisms, and structure. 24 Indeed, if pharmacists are to be more integrated into public health systems, they must participate avidly in reporting of adverse events, triaging of patients, and informing health authorities of suspected health trends.Dawoud described these and other activities that must be carried out by pharmacists, including adapting to technology, serving as vaccination hubs, and continuously gaining the public trust as critical means in which pharmacists can help society move forward post-lockdown and past the eventual ebb of the pandemic. 25 In a study employing the transtheoretical model of change, Hoti et al.found pharmacists to outweigh pros versus cons and be in high levels of readiness to engage in risk mitigation strategies related to COVID-19. 26 Austin and Gregory studied resilience of pharmacists during the pandemic and found significant themes in ability to adapt to new technology, provision of personal protective equipment by the organization, and dedicated support staff. 27 As such, future research can leverage these findings to assume that pharmacists want to and are prepared to evolve practice, but might need to adapt to and advocate for change in systems that make this more a reality. Doing so must be placed within the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f context of improving patient outcomes, rather than improving pharmacists' ""lot in life"" for the sake of doing so.Koster et al. demonstrated that emerging patient-centric pharmacist services have been deleteriously impacted by the pandemic and urged leaders to embrace tele-pharmacy even post-pandemic in a changed world, with all that new models of delivery entail. 28 Amariles et al. worked with researchers outside of pharmacy to project future numbers of cases, morbidity, and hospitalizations not merely to project numbers but for anticipation of their country's needs for pharmacists to continue delivering the necessary care to patients with and without COVID-19 and help ensure adequate supply chain of pharmacological therapies for weeks and even months into the future. 29 Forecasting can and should become an even greater priority for pharmacy practice researchers, and Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Africa during the pandemic. 37 The services provided by pharmacists ranged from essential and extended services, services developed to ensure continuity of care, and supply of essential medicines as well as the responsibilities in emergency care. In another paper, Elbeddini et al emphasized mental health issues impacting pharmacists during COVID-19, highlighting increasing workloads as well as workplace harassment. 38 The pandemic also has pharmacy educators contemplating adaptations and transitions to be made in educating future pharmacists, both in the content of the education and in the logistics, or manner in which it is to be provided. COVID-19 has brought a plethora of challenges, as well as opportunities for pharmacists to contribute. The community pharmacy sector is seeing increasing numbers of patients and the public.The current crisis has also seen an impact on medicines supply lines and health systems throughout the globe. This has been seen in high-, middle-and low-income countries. Access to and availability of essential medicines have been impacted, medicinesshortages were noted and there were reports on the use of substandard and falsified medicines. 39, 40 The quality and safety of pharmaceuticals are increasingly important when a large number of people are relying on them.• As has always been the case, research conducted will be grounded in proven theory and rigorous methods. Undergraduate transition and how we can better support students and early career practitioners, who seem particularly anxious about learning environments and career development support in early years.Despite the local to global havoc caused by COVID-19, pharmacy practice researchers have made a considerable effort to respond to this global emergency and their research output is starting to inform practice across the world.Reflecting on this output, we should plan carefully for the coming stage to ensure that the impact and value of this research are maximised. The recommendations made by this panel of experts goes some way towards informing pharmacy practice researchers' and research funders'priorities in the next phase of this battle against the most disruptive pandemic that we have witnessed for decades.",Egypt,first author,2020-08-26,08
8897666114da779618ea6597028bd1d25a4bc7a1,Journal Pre-proof A Moroccan Plastic Surgery Department approach during COVID-19 Pandemic A Moroccan Plastic Surgery Department approach during COVID-19 Pandemic,"COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Originally identified in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province of central China, in December 2019, the virus has since spread rapidly across the world, on March 11, 2020, pandemic status was confirmed by the World Health Organization(1) new infections are rising exponentially as of MAY 15, 2020, there are over 4 621 414 confirmed cases worldwide (whose 6 652 in Morocco), with over 282 388 deaths attributed to the COVID-19 virus (2) . The strict lockdown and social distancing and restricted mobility started by March 20 in Morocco. A full reorganization of the health system was initiated countrywide, creating regional admission centers, specific testing departments within a COVID-19 pathway, and specialty hubs for continuous medical service. In this paper, we share our experience in managing plastic surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic at the Mohamed VI university hospital in Marrakech.Early during the outbreak of the pandemic, the Marrakech-Safi region (4.5 million people) turned out to be one of the 3 most affected regions. As soon as the national lockdown was in force, extensive measures and departments remodeling was needed: Scheduled activity was stopped, and special COVID-19 pathways were created. Most departments were converted into COVID-19 facilities. Ibn tofail hospital, considered as an off-site hospital, was assigned to manage all non-COVID patients with urgent surgical pathology.Concerning our plastic surgery department, it's a tertiary center managing acute infections, trauma, tumors and burns, as well as elective reconstructive procedures and research, it had to prioritize emergency work over elective work like recommended by The American College of Surgeons(3), and be prepared to continue with a reduced workforce. The focus on COVID-19 mustn't adversely affect the acute response needed to deal with plastic surgery emergencies. The staff is composed of 10 doctors and 16 nurses. Since the last week of March, we have modified the calls and the team has been split into two independent units: COVID-19 positive unit circuit with 5 doctors (50% of our team) and 6 nurses to assist the fight against COVID-19 and a non-COVID unit with 5 doctors and 10 nurses. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided by the hospital including N95 masks every 06 hours with a medical cap, a disposable overcoat, glasses, and overshoe.Patients were either admitted directly or referred from regional hospitals (indirect admission). Before admission, patients residency is asked to see if it's a cluster or not, undergo medical history checking to look for any cough, shortness of breath, chills, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell and fever testing was a systematic procedure and if the patient had one of these criteria a CT-SCAN was made and the coordinator is called to make PCR test. Fortunately, we never had this situation. Telemedicine, clinical imaging, and symptom help us to carry out the operating program.Admission was limited to a maximum of 2 patients per room, each room has 4 beds and we have a total of 8 beds dedicated to plastic surgery. Patient movement around the hospital is restricted. To reduce the length of stay by 30% from an average of 13 days last year to 10 days in this period, patients were admitted 24 to 48 hours before surgery. During hospitalization, only 1 visitor per day per patient was allowed for one-hour maximum. All wore surgical masks provided by the hospital (2 per day). During this period, 70% wore tumors (12 patients), 18% infections (3 patients), and 12% loss of substance (2 patients). The number of patients has decreased 50% compared to last year's data of the same period but the part of each type has been the same. The majority of tumors 57 % wore head and neck surgery (25% the face, 19% the scalp, and 13 % the Neck). The discharge was made early, and patients followed up over telemedicine to keep contact with our team. When necessary, the patient's consultation is realized with a doctor in the treatment room with all protective required equipment.The COVID-19 Pandemic forces us to change operation room protocols. While achieving a reduced surgical load (6 surgeries a week) because of sharing the operation room with Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) department. The operative team has been reduced. These cases are performed with three surgeons (one attending and two residents) which allows us to decrease the protective equipment used during a case.Several changes in our clinical practice were made due to the COVID-19 pandemic, plastic surgery teams must adapt quickly because this pandemic is far from over, the sustainability of this system may be questionable for the long term, it has proven to be efficient in preserving the non-COVID status of the hospital so far, but for how long with exhausted teams.Many cases cannot be postponed and some patients don't come to the hospital because they are scared to get infected in the hospital, we need to encourage and persuaded patients to consult and ensure providing safety precautions.",Morocco,first author,2020-08-11,08
2207161f8078dda824927608ffccded2243fc7b3,Journal Pre-proof Self-management of diabetes mellitus during the Covid-19 pandemic: Recommendations for a resource limited setting SELF-MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A RESOURCE LIMITED SETTING,"The first imported COVID-19 case in Zimbabwe was reported on 21 March 2020 while local transmission started on 24 March 2020. 1 About half (454) of the 926 COVID-19 cases reported in Zimbabwe from 20 March to 9 July were recent returnees from neighbouring countries, notably, South Africa and Botswana. From 1 April to 22 July, over 12, 650 Zimbabwean migrants returned to Zimbabwe from neighbouring countries. As of today (1 August 2020), about 1,500 returnees are quarantined. 1 Many of the reported cases, a month ago, were imported rather than locally transmitted. As of today (1 August 2020), there are 3382 confirmed cases of COVID 19 and 79 deaths have been recorded in Zimbabwe. Local transmission cases have risen steeply in the last 4 weeks resulting in an exponential increase in reported cases and deaths. This is in a country with an estimated 9.7% population with diabetes mellitus (DM). 2 Diabetes mellitus is generally a major risk factor for the development of severe pneumonia and sepsis due to virus infections. Data from studies conducted early on during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests the risk for death from COVID-19 to be up to 50% higher in people with DM than those without. 3 Although the pathophysiological mechanisms are still not understood, it has been observed that most severe and fatal cases with COVID-19 have occurred in the elderly or in patients with underlying CVDs, diabetes, chronic lung and renal disease, hypertension, and cancer. [4] [5] [6] [7] Findings of an earlier meta-analysis revealed that prevalent cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities with COVID-19 were hypertension (17.1%, 95% CI 9.9 -24.4%) and cardio-cerebrovascular disease (16.4%, 95% CI 6.6 -26.1%), followed by DM (9.7%, 95% CI 6.9 -12.5%). Patients with DM or hypertension in this report, had a 2-fold increase in risk of severe disease and requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients with DM are immunocompromised hosts because they have a dysfunction of immunity related to capability against infection. 8 The course of the infection is also more complicated, probably due to the said defects in immunity. These include alterations in proliferation of T cells and macrophages and impairment in natural killer cells and B cell function. This results in abnormal innate and adaptive immunity. 8, 9 Maintaining good glycemic control is an effective approach to prevention of COVID-19 transmission in diabetic patients. 10, 11 However, in Zimbabwe, like in many other countries, the imposed social distancing and lock downs to curb spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus have resulted in challenges in both institutional and self-management of DM. Many people with DM have difficulties accessing medications, healthcare, fresh food, and being physically active because of confinement. 10 It is very vital that health care workers (predominantly nurses and doctors in Zimbabwe) be involved in disseminating appropriate and accurate information to facilitate self-care in people with DM amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In countries with high prevalence of diabetes, such as India, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the physician-centered approach of DM care that is primarily based on routine clinic visits. 10 The prevalence of DM in Zimbabwe is 9.7% 12 and DM ranks 6 th among leading causes of death having accounted for 3.02% of total deaths in Zimbabwe in 2018. 13 It is also worrying that more than 60% of cases of DM in most low income countries, Zimbabwe included, are undiagnosed. 14 There is therefore, a significant proportion of the population more at risk of both diabetic complications and infection with the Sars-Cov-2 virus. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to document a culturally appropriated selfmanagement plan for people with DM in resource limited settings during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Electronic databases, namely; Pubmed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched for literature. Search terms were ""corona virus"", ""COVID-19"", ""diabetes self-care"", ""diabetes self-management education"", ""DSME"", ""diabetes self-management"", ""diabetes self-care in low income countries"" and ""diabetes management in Zimbabwe"". Articles selected mainly focussed on self-management of diabetes mellitus.Literature review focussed on health education to promote self-management amid the COVID-9 pandemic. Components of health education comprised, medications, diet, physical activity, self-monitoring of blood glucose, stress management, foot care, smoking and drinking general preventive measures.People with DM are bound to miss physician's appointments and routine clinic visits for finetuning of anti-diabetic medications among other things, due to the imposed lockdowns. This can result in sustained periods of unattended to hyperglycemia and probably hypoglycemia. 10 This is the time to be utilising telemedicine for optimum health of people with diabetes. Health care workers need to scale up health education on drug interactions of medications for diabetes. There is so much information circulating on home remedies and probable cures for COVID-19. 10 The current buzz on social media about hydroxychloroquine is one such example. Patients should be made aware of contraindications of hydroxychloroquine (diabetic retinopathy or seizure history) to prevent inappropriate use of the drug as an antidiabetic amid the COVID 19 pandemic. 10 DM educators could help patients access antidiabetic medications via online stores. Though teleconsultations could ensure medication adherence, this might only be possible to very few individuals who can afford health care from private institutions. Currently government institutions are paralysed by strikes, lack of resources and shortage of staff as more and more people self-isolate at home after contact with people with COVID-19. Some health insurance companies have introduced the Medic-Express TM service where prescription refill requests are made online then medications are delivered in homes. Unfortunately, very few people can afford the service. It is also advisable that patients start the process of prescription refill 2 weeks before medications run out to ensure continuity of therapy.Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) Good glycemic control reduces the risk and severity of any infection including COVID-19. More frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is required during this pandemic. Good glycemic control may also lessen chances of superimposed bacterial pneumonia. 15 A recent study from China during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that elderly subjects with type 2 DM experienced worsening of glycemic control manifesting as higher fasting blood glucose. 16 The impact of social distancing, quarantine and lockdown on lifestyles would have probably led to worsening of glucose control. 10 Earlier studies in people with DM conducted in Zimbabwe have revealed that patients generally do not afford meticulous SMBG. 17, 18 However, for patients on oral hypoglycemic agents with acceptable control, measuring fasting and post-prandial capillary blood glucose once or twice a week is acceptable. This will be far much better than not monitoring blood glucose at all. Unfortunately, people on insulin with poor glycemic control or recurrent hypoglycemia, require SMBG at least 4 times/day. This is a challenge as glucose strips are generally very expensive with very few people affording them. One suggestion around this problem reported in a study conducted in Zimbabwe 17 is to subsidise the price of glucose testing strips or even to make them freely available to people with DM.Restriction in food supplies during the lockdown might force people with DM to alter their dietary habits that were earlier associated with good glycemic control. 19 Attention to nutrition and adequate protein intake is important. 6 There is generally high consumption of carbohydrate rich foods in resource limited settings, Zimbabwe included. The daily carbohydrate intake should be approximately 50-60% of the total calorie intake. 20 Pure water should be preferred over fruit juice, aerated beverages and sugar syrups which are also very expensive. 21 Patients should keep well-hydrated at all times. Fats should provide not more than 30% of total daily caloric requirements and ideally three teaspoons of polyunsaturated oil per day (eg from groundnut/ cottonseed/ olive oil) should be used in cooking. Protein intake should be 1 g/kg/day, but should be less (0.8 g/kg/day) in people with renal problems (diabetic nephropathy and macroalbuminuria). 21 Telehealth delivered dietary interventions targeting dietary patterns have been shown to improve diet quality, fruit and vegetable intake and dietary sodium intake. 22 Patients with access to nutritionists are therefore, encouraged to keep regular touch with them. It is also advised to make use of general messages from authentic organisations such as the Ministry of Health and Child Care of Zimbabwe, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and the Centres for Disease Control (CDC).Physical activity is a part of routine DM self-care. Unfortunately, lockdown and social distancing have restricted outdoor physical activities of people with diabetes. There are other alternative physical activity programs that can be undertaken within the safe confines of home. Regular exercise training has been advocated as part of numerous practice guidelines, including the ADA, the American College of Sports Medicine, the American Heart Association (AHA), and the Canadian Diabetes Association. 23 Exercise has been shown to improve immunity, though it might be prudent to be careful and avoid crowded places like gymnasia or swimming pools. 15 Regular physical activity helps to reduce back pain, constipation, bloating and swelling. It increases energy and improves mood, promotes restful sleep, minimises weight gain and reduces post prandial hyperglycemia. 24 Intensity and type of physical activity should be individualised according to ability and fitness level and caution must be exercised for patients with co-existing heart diseases and history of hypoglycemia. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose to check blood glucose in type I diabetic patients during exercise is important because of the risk of hypoglycemia. 19 Foot care Patients with DM should continue with routine foot care practices. However, findings from various studies conducted in Africa have revealed a general neglect of foot care in people with diabetes. 14, 25-27 Recommended foot care practices in diabetic patients include regular inspection of feet, wearing appropriate footwear, avoiding risks such as sharp instruments and abrasives, and regular physical examination of feet for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and peripheral neuropathy (PN). 28 Diabetic foot care practices also include daily foot inspection of injuries, callosities and edema, foot wash with lukewarm water and mild soap, thorough foot drying especially between toes, and foot protection with comfortable, well-fitting shoes. It is important to avoid direct heat, heating pads and hot water bottles to the feet, hot pavements, hot sandy beaches and limitation of exposure to cold with simple devices like warm socks. 27 Application of a thin coat of petroleum jelly, cutting the nails straight across after a sock with warm water, avoidance of caustic antiseptics, wearing footwear at all times, daily exercises to promote circulation, discontinuation of smoking, early reporting of all injuries and blisters and avoidance of self-medication for foot problems are good self-care practices. 27 Careful inspection of the diabetic foot on a regular basis is one of the easiest and most effective ways to prevent foot complications. The purpose of the inspection is to identify early warnings signs of nerve damage or minor injuries that could lead to ulcers later on.Stress management Patients should utilise telecommunication in discussing psychological issues with their caregivers during these times. Caregivers should also inquire about the mental health of patients. Social support can also help in alleviating the distress imposed by the COVID-19 disease and its multifaceted effects on populations. These include physical, psychological, social and even spiritual problems. Health care workers need to be on the fore front of health educating people especially in the face of a lot of fake news circulating unabated. Psychological stress can be alleviated by voluntarily giving up the feeling of being locked up in homes and in return spend quality time loved ones. 10 It is also advisable to intentionally minimize watching, reading or listening to news about COVID- 19. 30 Smoking and drinking Unhealthy habits of smoking, drinking and betel chewing should be avoided. Studies have confirmed that nicotine, found in cigarettes renders insulin ineffective and people with DM who smoke need larger doses of insulin. They are also at high risk of heart and kidney disease, poor blood flow in the legs and feet that can lead to foot infections, ulcers, and possible amputation of toes or feet; retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy. 31 Complications People with DM and their caregivers should be made aware of the common symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity, nausea and vomiting and very dry mouth) 32 and hypoglycemia and measures to prevent them. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are shaking, anxiety, sweating, chills, clamminess, irritability, confusion, tachycardia, dizziness, hunger, nausea, pallor, drowsiness, malaise, blurred vision, tingling or numbness in the lips, tongue, or cheeks, headache, lack of coordination, nightmares and seizures. 33 Hypoglycemia can be a major deterrent to comprehensive DM care amid the ongoing pandemic. 10 The current period of distress imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic can also perpetuate hypoglycemia. Stressful situations have also been shown to precipitate hypoglycemic episodes in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 34 Skipping of meals should be discouraged as this predisposes to hypoglycemia. People with DM are really encouraged to stay with caregivers in case such complications occur. Patients and caregivers should be educated about measures to take at home in an unfortunate situation of hypoglycemia. In case of a hypoglycemic attack, one should eat or drink 15 to 20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates such as (soft drinks, honey or sugary candy). For those with resources, recheck blood sugar levels 15 minutes after treatment and if they are still under 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), eat or drink another 15 to 20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate, and recheck the blood sugar level again in 15 minutes. Repeat these steps until the blood sugar is above 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Have a snack or meal once blood sugar is normal to stabilize it and replenish the body's glycogen stores. 3, 34 Patients are advised to keep a stock of glucose (energy drink, sweets or sugar) at home. It should be emphasised that a regular meal be taken following termination of an episode of hypoglycemia with oral carbohydrate.People with DM are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and of having worsening symptoms if they do contract the disease. Prevention is mainly through meticulous diabetes self-care in addition to general prevention practices for COVID-19. It is very important to reemphasise health education on glycemic control to minimize the devastating effects of COVID-19 among populations.",Zimbabwe,abstract,2020-08-23,08
ece291ef8d3fb8810e83284f77525488712e3ee9,"Supplement Collateral damage: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of a patient with tuberculous neuroretinitis in Lagos, Nigeria Collateral damage: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of a patient with tuberculous neuroretinitis in Lagos, Nigeria","Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable, disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the diagnosis and treatment of which is a burden, particularly in developing countries, which bear the greater burden of the disease [1] . While the disease primarily affects the lungs, it may also affect the eye and as high as 60% of patients who present with intraocular tuberculosis (IOTB) do not have pulmonary TB [1] . This further complicates the diagnosis of the disease as there is no gold standard diagnostic test for IOTB [2] . Tuberculous optic neuropathy, a spectrum which encompasses neuroretinitis, papilledema, papillitis, optic neuritis, retrobulbar neuritis and optic nerve tubercles, may result from direct infection by the Mycobacteria or an associated hypersensitivity reaction [2] . Prompt diagnosis and management of the disease-an interdisciplinary approach by the Ophthalmologist and the Infectious Disease Specialist (IDS)-is recommended [2] . The treatment guideline recommended by the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Thoracic Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, is the use of the anti-TB quadruple therapy (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for two months followed by a four to seven-month continuation phase typically consisting of rifampin and isoniazid [3] . The importance of the adjunctive use of low dose oral steroids for the reduction of inflammation in select cases of IOTB is documented, however, a significant beneficial effect on the final visual acuity has not been proven [2] .The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global phenomenon that has greatly shaped the first half of the year 2020, with projected long-lasting effects across all sectorsnotably the health sector [4] . While many emergency care services in 'hard-hit' locations have been overwhelmed by the number of patients plagued by the virus, many non-COVID-19-related medical services have been scaled back or shut down altogether [5] . The under-utilization of important medical services by patients with non-COVID-19-related urgent and emergent health needs is constituting an important problem for health care systems [6] . Patients delay presentation at hospitals despite life threatening symptoms and healthcare workers are having to deal with a 'tradeoff between the patients' needs for procedures and the need to protect the caregivers from infection [7] . To aid healthcare systems with balancing the need to provide essential services, while minimizing risk to the caregivers, the CDC provided guidelines for delivery of non-COVID-19 health care during the pandemic [8]. One of the core components of this transformation of healthcare service delivery is the increased utilization of telemedicine for patient care. While the healthcare systems in developed countries may have been better poised to implement telemedicine at a larger scale, due to the prior widespread utilization of Electronic Medical Records (EMR), this advantage is not universal.The COVID-19 pandemic amplified many preexisting deficiencies of the healthcare delivery system in Nigeria, notably, the infrastructure important for the establishment of effective telemedical services. Most healthcare providers in the country utilize paper medical records and lack electronic patient referral systems [9] ; referrals and consultation requests largely rely on the patients being the couriers of the request letters [10] and there is sparse, publicly available information of the contact details for healthcare providers. The combined effects of the reduced accessibility to clinical/laboratory services, insufficient infrastructure for effective telehealth service delivery and the difficulty in facilitating interpractice medical consultations have negatively impacted health care delivery to, and the eventual outcomes of, patients with non-COVID-19-related health problems. Herein, the author reports a case of tuberculous neuroretinitis in Nigeria whose care, and outcome, was impacted by the ongoing pandemic.A 21-year-old female presented with a one-month history of severe left eye pain, associated with headaches and a 2-week history of gradual reduction of vision. Her history was positive for unexplained weight loss of 2 years´ duration, remitting and relapsing suppurative cervical masses, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting after meals. She had no history of low grade fevers, night sweats, rashes, exposure to persons with chronic cough or exposure to cats. She is a chronic severe peptic ulcer disease patient on medication. The patient recently, abruptly, relocated from the northern part of Nigeria, at the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, two months before presentation. She had previously sought medical care on account of the weight loss and neck masses. All investigations carried out were nonrevealing, by her account. She did not possess copies of these results, a medical report or the contact information for her previous physician. She delayed presentation to an eye-care provider, at the onset of her ophthalmic symptoms, due to the temporary closure of most private eye hospitals during the first phase of lockdown. She did not present at any public eye-care emergency hospitals in order to avoid contact with crowds of people, as a preventive measure against contracting the COVID-19 virus.On general physical examination, the patient was chronically ill looking and she had multiple, visibly enlarged cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes bilaterally (each ~ 5 x 3cm). The left enlarged supraclavicular lymph node was ulcerative, with purulent discharge. Significant eye examination findings were best corrected visual acuity of 6/9 in the right eye and no perception of light (NPL) in the left eye. Extraocular motility was full in both eyes, however there was left eye pain with movement. The left pupil was dilated and unreactive to light. There was no sign of anterior segment or vitreous inflammation. Fundus examination showed remarkable optic disc and macular swelling, with a 'macular fan' hard exudates (lipid deposition). The right eye examination was normal. Multiple tests were ordered, including complete blood count and blood film, Flourescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-ABS), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), Lyme serology, TB-quantiferon goldassay and Retroviral screening tests. Fundus photography and orbital B-scan tests were scheduled to be carried out peripherally as ocular investigations at our facility had been suspended. However, a quick baseline fundus photograph of the left optic nerve head was taken in the clinic, using the iPhone XR mobile phone and 20D Volk ® lens (Figure 1 ). Empirical oral ciprofloxacin was commenced pending the return of the test results. A two-day follow-up appointment, for the review of the test results, was scheduled. Patient returned to the clinic after two weeks. Laboratory services had been disrupted by the pandemic lockdown and she chose not to return without the investigation results. Her TB-quantiferon gold assay result was positive while other test results were non-revealing. The ocular investigations had not been carried out. Ocular examination remained status quo.At this visit, patient revealed that prior to the pandemic-lockdown; plans for a clinical trial of Anti-Tuberculosis-Therapy (ATT) had been instituted by her previous physician. These plans were disrupted by the onset of the lockdown and her subsequent unplanned relocation. The patient was urgently referred to an IDS, through her new primary care physician, with recommendations for prompt initiation of ATT. Oral steroid therapy was deferred till after the start of ATT. Clearance for the initiation of steroid therapy was requested from the IDS. Her history of severe chronic severe peptic ulcer disease was noted as a relative contraindication to the therapy. Ocular investigations were rescheduled and a one-week follow up clinic appointment was scheduled. She presented for a third clinic visit after 4weeks. Quadruple therapy of ATT (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) had been instituted for four weeks. Patient declined to come in sooner, in her continued bid to reduce her risk for COVID-19 infection. She had also defaulted from the follow up appointment with the IDS. Her clinical appearance was much improved at this visit-appetite was restored, post-meal vomiting resolved, weight gain ~ 2.5kg and suppurative lymph nodes had healed. Visual acuity in the left eye was Hands-Motion with sluggish pupillary constriction to light observed. There was complete resolution of the optic nerve and retina swelling, with waxy disc pallor, residual hard exudates at the macula, macular hyperpigmentation and thinning.Efforts to obtain the contact information for the IDS, for an interdisciplinary consult, proved abortive. A follow-up letter was sent, repeating the request for clearance for oral steroid therapy. The option of periocular steroid administration was discussed with the patient. A follow up clinic appointment of 1 week was scheduled. Patient returned 1 week later, as scheduled (5 weeks on ATT). Vision had deteriorated back to NPL. Fundal optical coherence tomography (OCT) testing was carried out at this visit. The findings in the left eye were severe thinning of the outer and inner retinal layers with loss of the foveal contour ( Figure  2,Figure 3 ). Patient was still yet to present for a follow-up appointment with the IDS, due to the reasons stated earlier. A third letter was written, to the IDS, with an update about her condition and a request for an interdisciplinary phone consult. Independent efforts made by our clinic to obtain the name and contact information of the IDS have been yet unsuccessful. Weekly follow up consultations via video-conferencing have been set up. Patient was encouraged to keep her appointment with the IDS.Tuberculous optic neuropathy is a relatively rare manifestation of extra-pulmonary TB, an important sign in areas of endemicity [1] . Tuberculous neuroretinitis is even less common. In the multinational study by Davis et al of 62 eyes, tuberculous neuroretinitis accounted for about 14.5% of cases of tuberculous optic neuropathy [2] . Similar to the case above, presentation is usually unilateral. Visual recovery from tuberculous neuroretinitis is good when diagnosis is prompt and proper management instituted, with only 10% of cases with vision < 6/60 after 12 months of follow up [2] . Although our patient has only been on ATT for 5 weeks, the NPL vision, as well as the fundal OCT findings, may be poor prognosis indicators. The care of our patient has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple ways. Delayed patient presentation and unavailable clinical/laboratory services were important causes of the late diagnosis and management, as documented in other reports [6, 7] . However, notable in this case is the reported disruption of the clinical trial of ATT, five weeks before the onset of her ocular symptoms. This therapeutic trial may have prevented the development of the neuroretinitis in its entirety. The interruption of ongoing clinical care was only worsened by the gap in the continuity of care. The announcement of the nationwide lockdown in Nigeria, 48 hours before its onset, precipitated the patient´s abrupt relocation to Lagos, without a referral letter or medical report. Patients can be poor medical historians, sometimes omitting relevant clinical information. Channels for direct communication between healthcare providers are important, particularly during a pandemic, where patients may be unexpectedly separated from their established care providers.The establishment of telemedicine service is perhaps the most imperative, pressing need, by any healthcare delivery system at this time. For this patient, some of the appointments, by all the care providers, could have been carried out virtually, protecting the parties involved. While telemedicine is not well suited for performing a detailed physical or intraocular examination, useful information may be obtained from these consultations. The virtual consultations may have, furthermore, improved the patient´s compliance with requested in-clinic appointments, enhancing her care and maybe outcome. Finally, while the CDC has provided working guidelines for healthcare providers, centered on the use of telemedicine to reduce patient visits to the hospital, these may not alleviate the pandemic-induced-fear of presenting at healthcare facilities, by ""high-risk"" groups, when these visits are imperative. Our patient´s reluctance to visit the clinic was precautionary-due to her chronic ill health status. She is at a higher risk for adverse outcome, if infected by the COVID-19 virus. While our clinic has strictly adhered to the national guidelines for patient care during the pandemic, mobile healthcare delivery services may be necessary for the care of higher risk patients.This case report highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of a patient with tuberculous neuroretinitis, an unrelated condition which usually has a good outcome. The institution of EMR and electronic referral systems, telehealth services, as well as the provision of mobile healthcare delivery services, will be important, now more than ever, for ensuring accessibility to, and the continuity of, healthcare service delivery in these uncertain times. These important adjustments may help mitigate some of the collateral damages of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare as a whole.

Coronaviruses are positively stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory, enteric, and central nervous system diseases. The recent novel COVID-19 virus is considered a betacoronavirus alongside severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). More also, additional sequence alignment revealed a 96.1% comparison to the sequence of the main protease between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV [4, 5] . The crystal structure of the COVID-19 main protease in complex with a peptidomimetic inhibitor (PDB code 6LU7) is presented in (Figure 1 ). Viruses like the COVID-19 mutate rapidly rendering it difficult to design an appropriate treatment. Previous studies demonstrated that the main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, and considered to be an attractive target for drug development [4, 6] . Drugs that target conservative protease are usually capable of preventing the replication and proliferation of the virus while reducing the risk of mutation mediated drug-resistance [2, 4] .Recent positive data highlights the application of a cocktail of antivirals, including two antiretroviral components lopinavir and ritonavir, by doctors in Thailand who were able to cure a COVID-19 patient using this treatment. These two antiretroviral components are protease inhibitors designed to block HIV viral replication and holds that these drugs could do the same for COVID-19 [7, 8] .Furthermore, a similar study conducted by Beck and co-workers (2019) highlighted the application of a Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) model to identify possible existing compounds to treat COVID-19. They predicted antiretroviral medication for HIV as the best chemical compounds to treat COVID-19, i.e.: atazanavir, efavirenz, ritonavir, and dolutegraviran [9] . Shaha and coworkers also identified a range of ARVs, including efavirenz see Figure 2 as a potential treatment for COVID-19 [10] . Confirming ARVs as a potential therapy, Yan Li and his team at the Sichuan University and Army Medical University in China (2020) identified, via a large chemical screening, four molecular drugs with high-affinity to a coronavirus protein. Of these, two were ARVs, i.e. bictegravir and nelfinavir. The other two were Prulifloxacin, a chemotherapeutic antibiotic, and Tegobuvi, an antiviral drug used in the treatment of Hepatitis C infection [4] . Contini (2020) also used virtual screening and identified four ARVs to treat COVID-19, i.e. indinavir, lopinavir, and atazanavir and cobicistat [2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] . Furthermore, three types of in silico DTI prediction methods are used, i.e. molecular docking, similarity-based, and deep learning-based [11, 17] . The selection of the efavirenz scaffold was based on the following factors: firstly, ARVs have been utilized as an antiviral regime for patients infected with the coronavirus and secondly, in silico DTI predictions identified antiretroviral (ARV), efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) as one of the most potent chemical compounds with the inhibitory potency with Kd of 199.17 nM against the COVID-19 main protease [9] .In this study, virtual screening, also called in silico screening, was chosen to provide a rapid and inexpensive method for the discovery of FDA approved active compounds exhibiting a scaffold similar to efavirenz, which binds to the active pocket of COVID-19 main protease. Virtual screening and molecular docking results revealed promising potential hit compounds for COVID-19 main protease inhibition. Density functional theory (DFT) was used further to calculate the orbital energy value and the energy gap.The active compounds similar to efavirenz were retrieved from the zinc database [18] . Protocol constraints such as biogenic data, FDA approval, anodyne, and sell data were set to filter out the compounds. A total of 232 molecules were retrieved and prepared for docking by subjecting to energy minimization using the Open Babel module in PyRx program.The crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease (PDB: 6lu7) and the native ligand was downloaded from RCSB with a resolution of 2. 16 Å [19] . Discovery Studio Visualizer software was used to prepare the receptor for docking. The native ligand and water molecules were deleted from the crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease. Molecular docking was performed with AutoDock 4.2 module implemented in PyRx 0.8 using the empirical free energy force field and Lamarckian genetic algorithm conformational search with the default parameters [20] . The grid on the ligand-binding site of the protein was centered at the binding site of X ¼ -20, Y ¼ 13, Z ¼ 47, and the grid dimensions were 40 Â 30 Â 62 Å 3 . For further analysis, 43 compounds with a lowest binding affinity (<-7.0 kcal/mol) were selected. Protein-ligands interaction was analyzed using Discovery Studio Visualizer software.Selected compounds from the molecular docking analysis were evaluated for their drug-like behavior through analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters required for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). QikProp module and Lipinski's rule integrated into virtual screening workflow (filtering option) of Schr€ odinger software was employed for calculations. We discarded 20 compounds, which were predicted to violate Lipinski's rule of five and, also fall out of optimum range for partition coefficient (QPlogPo/w), critical for estimation of absorption within the body; cell permeability (QPPCaco), a key factor governing drug metabolism and its access to biological membranes; QPPMDCK and percentage human oral absorption. Hence, 27 compounds were observed to have physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters within the acceptable range.Density functional theory (DFT) is a computational quantum mechanical modeling method used to examine the electronic structure and also to investigate the interactions involved between the receptors and the ligands. The electronic and structural properties of the five best hit compounds were calculated using the Becke3-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) method with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set aided by Gaussian 09. The calculated parameters used in this study include the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies, electron affinity, and electrophilicity index. The molecular electrostatic potential surfaces (MEPs) were obtained from the population analysis calculations and visualized using Gauss View. These parameters play an influential role in explaining the magnitude of ligands interaction in the binding pocket of COVID-19 main protease.To validate the stability of the hit compound, we have performed molecular dynamics simulation using NAMD full setup through the M.Wmolecular weight; log S wat -aqueous solubility (-6.5-0.5); log K HSA -logarithm of predicted binding constant to human serum albumin (-1.5-1.5); QPlogPwwater/gas partition (4.0-45.0); QPlogPC16 -hexadecane/gas partition (4.0-18); log BB -logarithm of predicted blood/brain barrier partition coefficient (-3.0-1.2); Caco-2 -cell membrane permeability (<25 poor >500 good); HBA -number of hydrogen bond acceptors (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) ; HBD number of hydrogen bond donors (0-6); QP polrzpredicted polarizability (13-70); log HERG the predicted IC 50 value for the blockage of HERG K þ channels (concern below -5); QPPMDCKpredicted MDCK cell permeability in nm/sec (<25 poor >500 great); log K p -predicted skin permeability and 95% of drugs: (-8 to -1);, log K HSA -logarithm of predicted binding constant to human serum albumin (-1.5-1.5), Human Oral Absorption -1-low, 2-medium, 3-high. MDWeb interface. The simulation process includes cleaning of the protein structure; fixing of side chains; addition of hydrogen atoms; neutralization, the addition of a solvent box and heating solvent to 300 K; reducing the restraints to just the protein backbone and minimization and equilibration of the system to finally achieve the structure prepared by simulation. To achieve a dry trajectory for the simulated protein, water molecules and ions were removed from the system.To validate our docking protocol, we redocked native ligand and the selected 27 compounds, into the binding pocket of COVID-19 main protease using AutoDock 4.2 module in PyRx tool with default parameters. Moreover, the binding affinity of the native ligand was selected as a benchmark. Five of these compounds exhibited superior binding affinity as well as good interaction compared to efavirenz and the native ligand (-6.5 and -7.4 kcal/mol respectively), thus selected for visual analysis. Refer to Table 1 for full data.The five selected compounds include simvastatin and lovastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor; oxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam; podophyllotoxin, which is an antimitotic; and Gefitinib an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] . The identification of the key contributing residues in the binding pocket of the C19MP was performed using the Discovery Studio Visualizer.The docked results showed that inhibitors swing between the space of hydrophobic residues; Met165, His41, Met49, Cys145, His165 and Leu27 which gave more conformational freedom, on the one hand; residues Glu166, His163, Thr26, Phe140, Thr190, His164 and Gln189, Gln143 showed hydrogen bond interaction with the ligands. Also, proteinligands interaction showed that the presence of naphthalene, quinazoline, isoxazole, benzyl, and tetrahydropyran rings played an important role. The details of the structures with the best docking scores are provided in Figures 3 and 4 . Figure 6B ). The phenyl group attached to the isoxazole ring interacts hydrophobically with Pro168 also contributes to the stabilization of the complex. Other residues like Ala19, Gln192, Agr188, Gln189, His164, 163, Gly143, Ser144, and Leu141 make close contact with the ligand without interactions ( Figure 6A) .Moreover, His41 and Cys145 interacted with methyl group substituent, which was accompanied by one conventional H-bonding between the carboxyl oxygen atom and Cys145 (b.d M.Wmolecular weight; log S wat -aqueous solubility (-6.5-0.5); log K HSA -logarithm of predicted binding constant to human serum albumin (-1.5-1.5); QPlogPwwater/gas partition (4.0-45.0); QPlogPC16 -hexadecane/gas partition (4.0-18); log BB -logarithm of predicted blood/brain barrier partition coefficient (-3.0-1.2); Caco-2 -cell membrane permeability (<25 poor >500 good); HBA -number of hydrogen bond acceptors (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) ; HBD number of hydrogen bond donors (0-6); QP polrzpredicted polarizability (13-70); log HERG the predicted IC 50 value for the blockage of HERG K þ channels (concern below -5); QPPMDCKpredicted MDCK cell permeability in nm/sec (<25 poor >500 great); log K p -predicted skin permeability and 95% of drugs: (-8-1); log K HSA -logarithm of predicted binding constant to human serum albumin (-1.5-1.5), Human Oral Absorption -1-low, 2-medium, 3-high. and the meta-OCH 3 substituent on the phenyl ring; this was accompanied by one hydrophobic interaction. These interesting interactions potentially deepen the binding strength of podophyllotoxin to the C19MP receptor and seem to be critical (Figure 8) .A binding affinity score of À7.8 kcal/mol was obtained for the docking of simvastatin in the binding site of C19MP (Figure 9 ) refer to supporting information, which also indicates strong interactions between the ligand and the receptor. The carbonyl oxygen group and the O atom in the tetrahydropyran ring interact with His163 and Glu166 via H-bond (b.d ¼ 2.21, 2.67 Å; b.a ¼ 115.6, 125.1 o , respectively). The naphthalene group extends into the hydrophobic pocket potentiating the ligandreceptor interaction (His 41 and Met165); the ring stacks vertically with the imidazole ring of His41 forming a π-π T-shaped interaction.Additional stability to this complex is afforded by the formation of a hydrogen bond interaction between the carbonyl oxygen atom of dimethylbutanoate and residue Cys145.The presence of a dimethyl substituent also assists with strong binding inside the active site of C19MP by forming hydrophobic interactions with residues His41, Cys145, and Met49, respectively. Physicochemical and ADMET descriptors of the five best dock compounds are shown in Table 2 .Furthermore, to validate the docked results of the hit compounds, we performed MD simulations on the COVID-19 main protease and redocked all the five compounds. The re-docked results revealed an increase in the binding affinity of simvastatin and lovastatin (8.2 and 7.9 kcal/mol), respectively. Surprisingly, there was a decrease in the binding affinity of podophyllotoxin (7.7 kcal/mol), and the binding affinity of oxacillin and gefitinib (7.7 kcal/mol) remained constant. Interestingly, the ligands were bound inside the active site of a similar pose and also formed interaction with more residues, mainly through H-bonding Figure 10 .Frontier molecular orbitals of five-hit compounds specify a crucial role of charge-transfer interactions with the binding site of COVID-19 main protease. The higher HOMO value denotes a molecule with a good electron donor, whereas a lower value implies a weak electron acceptor. Furthermore, a smaller energy gap between the LUMO and HOMO energies has a considerable influence on the intermolecular charge transfer and bioactivity of molecules. Thus, a wide energy gap observed in the hit molecules negatively affect the electron to move from the HOMO to the LUMO, which subsequently led to a weak affinity of the inhibitor for COVID-19 main protease. The E gap value decreases according to the following: oxacillin (0.1021eV) > podophyllotoxin (0.0145eV) > gefitinib (0.0351eV) > simvastatin (0.0230eV) > lovastatin (0.0145eV). Hence, the reactivity order increases according to: oxacillin (0.1021eV) > podophyllotoxin (0.0410eV) > gefitinib (0.0351eV) > simvastatin (0.0230eV) > lovastatin (0.0145eV) where the most reactive is clearly lovastatin (0.0145eV). The order of reactivity increases conforms with the decreases in energy gap values. The chemical potential (μ) indicate negative values for all the compounds, which implies good stability, and the formation of a stable complex with the receptor. Also, lovastatin and simvastatin have the least hardness values (η), among the hit molecules and which correlated with the trend of molecular docking (Table 3 ). The graphic results from DFT calculations are presented in Figure 11 . The red and green parts represent the cloud density of frontier orbital at HOMO or LUMO states. Finally, by comparing the values of molecular orbital energies (eV), global reactivity descriptors, and binding affinities value of five-hit compounds, simvastatin, and lovastatin may be considered as potential COVID-19 main protease inhibitors.The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface provides details about charge distribution and also predicts reactive sites for electrophilic and nucleophilic attack in a compound. Meanwhile, the MEP surface of simvastatin and lovastatin were evaluated using the DFT/b3lyp method as shown in Figure 11 most negative regions are shown by red, most positive regions in blue, and zero potential regions are visualized in green. MEP mapped surface of simvastatin range from À0.0678 a.u (deepest red) to 0.0678 a.u (deepest blue) and lovastatin range from À0.0672 a.u (deepest red) to 0.0672 a.u (deepest blue) Figure 12 .In this research paper, virtual screening was successfully used to identify five new FDA approved candidate molecules similar to the efavirenz scaffold, and their binding affinity was superior to the native ligand in the active pocket of the COVID-19 main protease, i.e.; podophyllotoxin, oxacillin, lovastatin, simvastatin, and gefitinib. The redocked results after MD simulation revealed an increase in the binding affinity of simvastatin and lovastatin (8.2 and 7.9 kcal/mol), respectively. Notably, there was a decrease in the binding affinity of podophyllotoxin (7.7 kcal/mol), and the binding affinity of oxacillin and gefitinib (7.7 kcal/mol) remained constant. The docking results showed that H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions might play important roles in contributing to the molecular interactions between the active compounds and the COVID-19 main protease. The DFT calculations and molecular docking showed that lovastatin and simvastatin may be considered as potential hits as anti-coronavirus agents and can be selected for further studies like modification of the scaffold, characterization, and in vitro evaluation. The predicted physiochemical and ADMET parameters were within the acceptable optimal requirements for drug development.Maryam Amra Jordaan: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.Oluwakemi Ebenezer: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.Nkululeko Damoyi, Michael Shapi: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

19a6ff0d5041fd12d0e815bf4282adf05d42b666,Very severe COVID-19 in the critically ill in Tunisia Very severe COVID-19 in the critically ill in Tunisia,"male. The most common comorbidities were; diabetes mellitus, 6(60%), obesity 2(20%), chronic kidney disease 2(20%) and hypertension 1(10%). Mean SAPS II, 23 .2±1.8. The mean arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio at admission was 136.2±79.7. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation was used in 4(40%) patients and 7(70%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Tidal volume and PEEP were set respectively within the median [IQR] of, 5.7 [5.6-6.3 ]ml/Kg and 10.7 [6.5-11.7 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel corona virus first detected in Wuhan, China on December 2019 is the pathogen causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] . It is a worldwide public health emergency. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as pandemic on March 11, 2020 [2] . The first confirmed case in Tunisia was reported on March 3, 2020 [3] . The detection of this case has led to the implementation of high-level preventive strategies, already planned since February 2020, including physical distancing measures by Tunisian government. The COVID-19 may cause severe viral pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring critical care. Information about Tunisian critically ill patients with COVID-19 is scarce. To the best of the authors´ knowledge, this is the first report of the clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Tunisia. The aim of the present study  was to describe the demographic characteristics,  clinical presentation, imaging findings, management strategies and challenges, and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Study design and participants: it is a retrospective study carried out in a 9-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU) of Farhat Hached teaching hospital (Sousse, Tunisia) between March 11, 2020 and May 7, 2020. All consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. A confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined by an RT-PCR positive result testing of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab or endotracheal aspirate sampling in intubated patients. There were no noninclusion criteria.Data collection: data were collected by reviewing the medical records. The following patients´ demographic and clinical characteristics were collected: age, gender, past medical history, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) [4] , the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPSII) [5] , timeline between the illness onset to ICU admission, clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, exposure history, laboratory and radiologic results, management strategies (i.e., antiviral therapy, antibiotics, vasopressor, corticosteroid therapy, kidney replacement therapy, ventilatory support, respiratory indices of mechanical ventilation including the ratio of Partial Pressure of Arterial Oxygen and Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (PaO2/FIO2 ratio), Tidal volumes/ Predicted Body Weight (PBW), plateau pressure (Pplat) and Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)), delirium assessed by the Tunisian version of the confusion assessment method (CAM-ICU) [6] and outcomes including length of stay and mortality.Definitions: COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the criteria published by the WHO and confirmed by RT-PCR assay of specimens obtained by nasopharyngeal swab or endotracheal aspirate [7] . SAPSII Score is a severity score and mortality estimation tool and made of 12 physiological variables and 3 disease-related variables. The worst physiological variables are collected within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. CCI is a weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease to estimate the risk of death from comorbid conditions. It is used as a measure of comorbidity burden. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition [8]. Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) [6] is the most widely used tool for delirium assessment in ICUs. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale [9] : It is a scale used to evaluate the level of alertness or agitation of patients under sedatives.Statistical analysis: statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify the normality of distribution of continuous variables. Descriptive statistics were computed for all study. Categorical data were presented as numbers (%) and continuous ones as mean ± standard deviation or as median (interquartile range 25-75), as appropriate.Demographic and clinical characteristics: during the study period, 10 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were enrolled, out of 37 patients admitted in the same period for a suspected COVID-19 clinical presentation. Patients´ demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The mean age was 51.8±6.3years. Eight (80%) were male. Mean SAPS II was 23.2±1.8. The mean CCI was 2.8±0.4. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (60%), obesity (20%), chronic kidney disease (20%) and hypertension (10%). The most common initial symptoms were fever, shortness of breath and cough. All the patients were admitted in the ICU for hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. Seven (70%) patients were referred from infectious diseases ward.Laboratory and radiologic findings: the first test for COVID-19 was positive in 9 patients out of 10. Only one patient had a negative first test and positive repeat test. Laboratory and radiological findings are summarized in Table 1 . Lymphocytopenia occurred in 8(80%) patients. A chest radiograph was done for 7 patients. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was done for five (50%) patients. The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacities in 4(80%) patients and patchy consolidations in one patient (20%).Ventilatory management: Figure 1 describes patients´ ventilatory support during their ICU stay. While the four initial patients were rapidly even immediately intubated, the five secondarily admitted were managed by different non-invasive devices including non-rebreathing mask (NRM), High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) and Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). This shift in the management was motivated by the worse outcome of the initial invasively managed patients. Figure 2 illustrates gradual improvement of PaO 2 /FiO 2 in case 5 under HFNC doubled by NRM to reduce aerosolization, albeit poor initial PaO 2 /FiO 2 . This improvement was significantly increased after a session of prone positioning (6-hour long session) at day 9, while this patient was presenting diffuse alveolar consolidation at his second CT scan performed at ICU admission. Another patient (case 8) managed non-invasively was rather unresponsive to a myriad of ventilatory procedure as NRM, HFNC and NIV. The invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was mandatory at day 10.As shown in Table 2 , seven (70%) patients required IMV with six of them needing prone positioning (18hour long sessions). For patients with IMV, ventilatory settings were based on ARDS management strategies. The mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 at admission day was 136.2±79.7. Surprisingly, all severe patients immediately intubated upon arrival, suffered severe but well-tolerated hypoxemia. Daily means PaO 2 /FiO 2 were less than 300 and frequently less than 150, consistent with moderate-to-severe ARDS (Figure 3 ). Figure 3 shows daily dynamical changes in respiratory indices of mechanical ventilation parameters. Tidal volume/ Predicted Body Weight set by the attending physicians ranged between 4.5 and 8ml/kgPBW with a certain variation between and intra-patients. PEEP was set between 0 and 18cm H 2 O. Plateau pressure was often monitored below 30cm H 2 O, as recommended by protective ventilation. As a result of these settings, Tidal volume and PEEP were set respectively within the median [ Pharmacological treatment: six patients received sedatives agents and neuromuscular blockade. Seven (70%) received vasoactive drugs. Two patients received renal replacement therapy, one for an acute renal failure consecutive to acute tubular necrosis (case 10) and one for a chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis (case 7). Treatment options of patients are presented in Table 2 . Nine patients received hydroxychloroquine among them 5 patients also received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir or oseltamivir). Antibiotic were used in all patients: 5 patients received cefotaxime and ofloxacin and the others received azithromycin. Only one patient received ruxolitinib. Systemic cortocosteroids was used only in one patient for asthma exacerbation. Curative anticoagulation was introduced in 8 patients. No patient received intravenous immunoglobulin. None of the severe patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the present study. Based on sudden-onset severe hypoxemia, clinical signs, radiological and echocardiographic findings, empirical thrombolysis was done for three hemodynamically unstable patients highly suggesting pulmonary embolism.Neurological impairment: sustained polyuria, important and well-tolerated fever without evidence of infection and large blood pressure variation suggesting vegetative disorders were noticed in four patients. During the ICU stay, 7 patients out of 10 (those having a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale greater than or equal to ""-3"") were assessed for delirium. Five patients out of 7 developed respectively hyperactive (n=2), hypoactive (n=2) and mixed delirium (n=1).ICU course and mortality: the mean ICU length of stay was 11.2±5.8 days. Of the 10 patients, 7(70%) had died and 3 had been discharged from the ICU. Causes of death were sudden refractory hypoxemia (4/6, 50%), septic shock secondary to a probable ventilator associated pneumonia (case 3) and refractory hypovolemic shock with acute kidney injury and tubular necrosis (case 10). One patient, admitted with a gasping respiration, died within the first hour albeit immediate appropriate management (case 6). Biphasic evolution was noticed in some patients (cases 1, 2 and 3). Sudden refractory hypoxemia occurred often after a significant stabilization period. In the first patient this happened within the weaning process after achieving a P/F near 300 for 7 days.This study describes 10 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The main findings of the present retrospective study were: i) Most patients were older male with chronic underlying conditions. ii) All patients were admitted to the ICU because of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and most of them needed endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Three patients were completely managed with noninvasive mechanical ventilation. iii) The mortality rate was at 70%. The present study had two limitations. First, it was a retrospective study conducted in a single center. Second, the small number of patients, only patients admitted in ICU were included. Thus, future studies with larger sample sizes and prospective study design are needed to better describe the profile and the outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, to the best of authors´ knowledge, this is the first report of critically ill patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 in Tunisia. As it was in previous reports [1, 2, 10, 11] , COVID-19 affected older male patients with comorbidities. Similar to previous investigations [1, 12, 13] , patients with underlying medical conditions most commonly diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney disease were at higher risk for severe illnesses. The patients in the present study had similar symptoms to those described in reports from china, Italy and United States [1, 2, 14] . Fever, shortness of breath and cough were present in almost all patients. In line with previous reports [2] , ARDS and refractory hypoxemia were the main reasons for ICU admission. Similar to other previous reports [1, 14] , lymphocytopenia was common.In the present study, 30% of patients were completely managed with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, whereas 70% required endotracheal intubation. The use of IMV in the present study was similar to the report by Arentz et al. (Washington states) [15] . However, this rate was lower compared with the data reported by Grasselli et al. [2] in an Italian ICU but higher than other reports from Wuhan, China in which the need for endotracheal tube varied from 15% to 47% [10, 14, 16, 17] . This discrepancy in the rates of ventilatory support may be explained by different severity of hypoxemia (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and differences in thresholds for ICU admission between studies. Altered gas exchanges was detected in most patients. The mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 in this study was 136.2±79.7. Thus, ventilatory settings were based on ARDS management strategies including low tidal volumes and PEEP titration. The uniformity of hypoxemia in enrolled patients contrasted with a spectrum of different respiratory mechanics attested by patients reported respiratory pressures and responsiveness to prone position. This variability was described by Gattinoni [18] , who proposed different phenotypes of respiratory distress in COVID-19 illness according to radiological findings and respiratory mechanics and suggested different ventilatory management strategies for each phenotype. It is important to notice that the variability in visco-elastic respiratory system properties between patients, was also detected in a same patient during his ICU course.Regarding pharmacological treatment, different associations of antimicrobial agents were administered.Four patients received Lopinavir/Ritonavir; one patient received Oseltamivir and the later patient received Ruxolitinib. Those drugs were used empirically without proof of their efficacy [1] . Nine patients out of ten received hydroxychloroquine in the present study. Expert from China [19] and from Italy [20] recommended the use of chloroquine or hydroxylchloroquine in COVID-19 patients, given a potential role in clinical success and outcomes improvement [19, 21] . However, more evidencebased data is still required. The heterogeneity in the therapeutic strategy could be explained by daily emerging data on COVID-19 pathophysiology and therapeutic options and by the lack of consensus [22] . In fact, the first therapeutic strategies were extrapolated from existing clinical data derived from other viruses including SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and non-coronaviruses (e.g., Ebola virus disease). All patients in the present study initially received antibiotics. It has been suggested that like seasonal influenza, COVID-19 infection may be associated with bacterial coinfection. Only one patient received glucocorticoids for asthma exacerbation. There are conflicting positions regarding corticoids in patients with COVID-19 [1, 23] . Further studies are needed to determine the benefit or not of systemic glucocorticoids in those patients.Curative anticoagulation was introduced for eight patients in the present study. In fact, some authors [10, 24, 25] reported high D-dimers concentrations and an increased coagulation activity in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and that it is associated with fatal outcome. The biphasic evolution of some patients can be explained by an excessive inflammatory response with cytokine storm causing extensive lung damage and occurring within the first week in invasively ventilated patients in this study (cases 1, 2 and 3) [17, 26] . Delirium was observed in 5 out of 7 COVID-19 patients screened by the Tunisian version of the CAM-ICU, while the previous reported incidence in non COVID-19 period, was around 36% [6] . The important increase of delirium rate may be explained by supplemental factors related to the specificity of the SARS-CoV2 itself. A potential direct action [27] , or an indirect one via inflammatory mediators on central nervous system is possible [28] . The important consequent social changes, in addition to typical deliriogenic factors omnipresent in the ICU such as sedatives, prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility may have played a role. In fact, measures of social distancing may be a contributory risk factor for delirium in older adults, who have less or no family visitation and limited mental and spiritual support from caregivers [29] . It is important to notice also that elderly patients, who are at greatest risk to develop severe COVID-19 forms, are also those who usually develop delirium in ICU.The mortality rate in the current study was at 70%. It is in line with previous reports in which the mortality rate varied between 16% and 78% [10, 16, 17, 26] . The main cause of death was refractory hypoxemia. Albeit, ARDS itself could explain severe hypoxemia, pulmonary embolism was also discussed but never confirmed in this study because of the high severity of the presentation impeding transport to perform CT Angiography of the chest. Previous studies have reported a high incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 illness, reaching 30% [30] [31] [32] .The present study is very peculiar by the very severe presentation of the initial patients that exhibited an ARDS like presentation associated with a neurological impairment but surprisingly without acute renal failure. The non-invasive early management achieved better prognosis.

23793d78577763728c982151cf1f99dc3f2d1d00,,"The novel coronavirus (CoV) was initially identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 among a group of patients that presented with an unidentified form of viral pneumonia with common history of visiting a seafood market. 1, 2 Later the disease was named Coronavirus Disease-2019 . 3 Since then, the virus has spread all over the world causing an unprecedented number of hospitalizations and fatalities in many countries. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic as a global public health emergency. 4 COVID-19 is caused by a virus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a member of β-CoVs. The CoV family is a class of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. 5 The CoVs are categorized into four subfamilies: α, β, γ, and δ-CoVs. Human CoV infections are caused by α and β-CoVs. 6 COVID-19 can cause five different outcomes: asymptomatic infection; mild to moderate cases that often resolve within 2 weeks; severe cases; critical cases; and death. 3 Data from the first 41 COVID-19 patients show that the initial manifestations of the disease included fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), myalgia (44%), sputum production (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and diarrhea (3%). Among these, 29% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 12% had acute cardiac injury, 7% had acute kidney injury, and 7% had shock. 7 There is no definitive therapy against SARS-CoV-2 yet. Although positive treatment outcomes have been reported with antiviral therapy on selected patients, supportive care and oxygen supplementation remain as the mainstay of the management of COVID-19. 8, 9 The search for vaccines and therapeutic agents against the virus is underway in many parts of the world. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Preventive measures have been forwarded by WHO as major ways of mitigating the outbreak. 15 Ethiopia reported its first case of COVID-19 on March 13, 2020. 16 Since then, gradual increment in the number of cases has been reported by the ministry of health. In countries like Ethiopia, where low surveillance and laboratory capacity, scarcity of healthcare human resources, and inadequate financial capacity are defining features of the healthcare system, the outbreak of a cureless viral infection with no vaccine will have a devastating impact. 17 Due to this, limiting the rate and the extent of COVID-19 outbreak is the best strategy to minimize public health and socioeconomic impact of the pandemic in the country, and healthcare professionals play the central role. 18 As members of the healthcare workforce, pharmacists bear essential responsibility in overcoming pandemics. In the case of COVID-19, pharmacists' role includes creating public awareness about the disease; manufacturing, distribution, and supply of essential preventive items such as hand sanitizers and personal protective equipment; and participating in research activities aimed at finding vaccines and drugs against the virus. [19] [20] [21] Thus, pharmacists need to have adequate knowledge about COVID-19 in order to successfully exercise their roles in the fight against the disease. To facilitate an urgent response to potential COVID-19 outbreak in Ethiopia, it is important to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practice of healthcare workers who engage in the response against the outbreak. This study was launched to assess COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude and practice among hospital and community pharmacists in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.In this cross-sectional survey, a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to pharmacists working in hospitals and community pharmacies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data were collected during the first 2 weeks since the first COVID-19 case was identified in Ethiopia (from March 16, 2020 to March 30, 2020).Because there was no complete data available on the number of hospital and community pharmacists working in the city, a sampling frame could not be produced, and hence, subjects were selected by convenience sampling. Hospital pharmacists were enrolled by visiting all (12) public hospitals in the city. All hospital pharmacists who gave consent for participation were included in the study. Privately owned hospitals were not included in the study because, while some have hospital pharmacies as part of the hospital, others have pharmacies that work with community pharmacy licenses and function as both hospital and community pharmacies. Pharmacists from some privately owned hospitals were used to conduct a pilot test on the data collection tool, as these institutions were not included in the main study. To select community pharmacists, we used Google Maps to track community pharmacies in the city. Out of 176 community pharmacies identified in this way, 134 gave us permission to collect data on their premises. All pharmacy professionals who worked at these premises, and gave consent to participate were included in the study. As a result, 350 individuals from hospital and community pharmacies were enrolled in the study.The data collection instrument was prepared by the investigators. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude and practice sections. The instrument was checked for face validity by independent experts in the field. In addition, a pilot test of 43 samples was used to analyze the internal consistency of the questions in each section of the questionnaire. Sets of questions with Cronbach alpha of 0.6 or more were included in the final version of the questionnaire. Data were collected by physically delivering the questionnaire to the study participants. After checking for completeness, data collected were entered into IBM SPSS Statistics ® Version 25 and subsequently analyzed. Frequency and percentage were used to characterize knowledge, attitude and practice related to COVID-19. In addition, participants' knowledge was characterized as adequate if all of the knowledge questions were correctly answered; and inadequate if one or more knowledge questions were incorrectly answered. Binary logistic analysis was used to identify the potential association between dependent and independent variables, setting p-value <0.05 as an indicator of significance. Attitude was assessed using 5-point Likert-type questions. The percentage of positive response (PPR) and average attitude score were calculated. T-test and one way ANOVA were used to compare differences in attitude among different groups of respondents. The practice related to COVID-19 was assessed by calculating the frequency and percentage of responses to each practice-related question.A letter of ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of the School of Pharmacy, Addis Ababa University [Ref.No. ERB/SOP/211/04/2020]. Guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki were met. Written informed consent was provided by all study participants before data collection. Moreover, personal identifiers such as names and addresses of study subjects were not included in the data collected and confidentiality of data was ensured.Out of 350 questionnaires that were distributed, 295 were fully completed and returned, producing a response rate of 84.3%. The majority of respondents (58.6%) were aged between 19 and 30 years with a mean age of 32.2 ± 8.3 years. About half (51.5%) of the respondents were male, nearly two-thirds (66.4%) worked in community pharmacies and more than half (54.2%) had a working experience not more than 5 years (Table 1) .All the participants stated that they had heard about COVID-19. Mainstream media and internet/social media were identified as sources of information by most of the respondents ( Figure 1 ).Almost all of the participants were aware of the causative agent, the clinical manifestations and the ways of transmission of COVID-19. Most participants (92.2%) identified elderly individuals as one of the high-risk groups for severe complications and death from COVID-19 while 89.5% identified supportive therapy and life support as recommended management options to date ( Table 2) . More than half (53.2%) of the study participants were found to have adequate knowledge about COVID-19.After categorizing knowledge based on knowledge score as adequate (correct answers for all of the knowledge questions) or inadequate (at least one incorrect answer), binary logistic analysis was employed to identify the predictors of the extent of knowledge among respondents. As a result, professional level and service year of participants were found to be predictors of the extent of (Table 3) .Among the participants, 89.8% had a positive attitude towards the importance of following WHO recommendations in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 while 81.0% agreed that they or members of their family could acquire COVID-19 at some time in the future. Regarding healthcare institutions, only 9.8% had confidence in the capacity of the healthcare facilities in the country to properly handle potential COVID-19 outbreak. The overall percentage of positive response to the attitude questions was 54.1% (Table 4) . Inadequate protective measures were taken to protect the staff from COVID-19 in the institutions of 70.2% of participants, and the major reason associated with this was resource scarcity. Moreover, 69.5% of participants stated that their institution did not provide adequate service related to COVID-19, primarily due to the limited supply of equipment or pharmaceuticals. Among the WHO recommended prevention measures, hand washing was exercised by 97.3% of the study participants (Table 5 ).Ethiopia is one of the thirteen countries considered a top priority by WHO with respect to the need for epidemic response preparedness against COVID-19. 22 Pharmacists working in hospital and community pharmacies, as members of the healthcare workforce, are integral parts of response against COVID-19 pandemic. [19] [20] [21] This study was initiated to assess COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude and practice among hospital and community pharmacists in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.In the present study, all the study participants had already heard about COVID-19. The main sources of information identified were mainstream media (48.8%) and internet/ social media (44.4%). Similarly, government websites, news media, and social media were identified as the main sources of COVID-19-related information among healthcare workers on studies conducted elsewhere. 23, 24 These findings show the importance of the internet and traditional mass media in the transfer of information related to novel coronavirus. However, it is advisable to select information sources carefully to avoid unverified and misleading information.Almost all of our study participants knew that COVID-19 is caused by a virus and it primarily attacks the respiratory system. We also found a high level of knowledge about the way of transmission, risk factors, and management of COVID-19. Fairly lower percentages of correct responses to knowledge questions were recorded in other studies conducted on healthcare workers. 23, 25 The difference could be due to differences in study population, methodology, and time of data collections. As new information about COVID-19 comes out daily, a few weeks' interval between studies can result in a significant difference in knowledge among healthcare workers. Despite a high percentage of correct answers for each knowledge question in our study, only a few more than half of the study participants had adequate knowledge. This implies that the other nearly half were misinformed about one or more aspects of the disease. It is recommended that pharmacists avoid misinformation about COVID-19 because the public relies on information from pharmacists and other healthcare workers to protect themselves from the disease.Predictors of knowledge about COVID-19 among our study subjects were identified. Accordingly, pharmacists were 2.7 times more likely to have adequate knowledge than pharmacy technicians. Pharmacists hold higher educational and professional status than pharmacy technicians, which may be the reason behind their likelihood to possess adequate knowledge as compared to pharmacy technicians. Similarly, respondents with 6 to 15 years of service were found to be 2.1 times more likely to have adequate knowledge as compared to those who served for 5 years or less. Those with less than 5 years of working experience may not be as effective in choosing the right source of information about COVID-19 as their senior colleagues, hence affecting their knowledge about the disease.Regarding attitudes of respondents, a high level of positive response was documented on WHO recommendations, perceiving the risk of acquiring COVID-19, and the impact of proactive measures on controlling of the pandemic. On the other hand, negative responses were recorded on the adequacy of national preparedness and the capacity of the healthcare system for the fight against COVID-19. A comparable rate of risk perception was reported among nurses in Iran. 24 Acknowledging the risk of acquiring COVID-19 is essential as it drives individuals to follow safety recommendations. The overall positive attitude rate in this study was 54.1%, which is lower (2), from animal to human (2), feeding from the same plate (1); c Others -smokers (4), healthcare workers (2), malnourished (1).Integrated Pharmacy Research and Practice 2020:9submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovePress than that of a study by Bhagavathula et al. 23 The relatively low attitude level in our study can be attributed to the high level of negative response regarding the country's preparedness and capacity to contain potential COVID-19 outbreak.In this study, the majority of the institutions (community and hospital pharmacies) did not undertake adequate protective measures to protect their employees from COVID-19. They also failed to provide sufficient service related to COVID-19 to the public. The main reason associated with inadequate institutional practice was the scarcity of resources and supplies. Since community pharmacies and hospital pharmacies are integral parts of the fight against COVID-19, problems associated with resources should be resolved quickly to help them provide COVID-19-related services with full capacity. At an individual level, however, a high level of self-protective practice was documented among the study subjects. Despite providing valuable information on COVID-19 from the viewpoint of the pharmacy sector, this study has some limitations. The use of a non-probability sampling method may limit the generalizability of the findings of the study. The study tool was prepared by the investigators based on information available on COVID-19 before 15 March 2020 while the global knowledge and practice related to the disease have been changing continually afterward. Therefore, the findings of the study should be interpreted taking these facts into account.The study findings confirmed that there is a high level of knowledge on each specific aspect of COVID-19 among the study participants. However, only about half of the participants had adequate knowledge about the disease. The pharmacists showed a predominantly positive attitude towards the importance of WHO recommendations, and predominantly negative attitude towards the country's capacity to deal with the pandemic. The practice related to COVID-19 was inadequate at institutional level. Nevertheless, most of the pharmacists individually exercised self-protective measures against COVID-19. All stakeholders should work on ensuring the adequate supply of materials and services that aid in controlling the pandemic.The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.

f5fa67bd9222dfd75cdbbc32768237eb4f5d1193,Life Under Lockdown: Illustrating Tradeoffs in South Africa's Response to COVID-19,"As COVID-19 began its global spread, it still appeared that some world regions might be spared --in particular, sub-Saharan Africa (Otu et al., 2020) . In short order, however, it became clear that such optimism was not merited. The virus quickly took a firm footing on the continent and as of August 7, 2020 the number of confirmed cases exceeded one million 1 --likely a significant underestimate given limited testing capacity.The virus's impact has varied considerably across the continent, reflecting countries' varying degrees of global integration and capacity to respond . One country that stands out in both regards is South Africa. As seen in Figure 1 , the virus has spread faster in South Africa than in any of the continent's other large economies.[ Figure 1 here] At the same time, South Africa has been recognized globally for its swift and efficient response (Kavanagh & Singh, 2020) . In this research note, we illustrate how the South African government's response affected the lives of ordinary people, focusing on the initial outbreak and subsequent lockdown.First, we look at the impact of the government's strict lockdown orders on population mobility, which may be understood as a proxy for compliance. We leverage anonymized mobile phone data from Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which chart trends over time, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, transit stations, and workplaces. We look at changes in mobility by province to highlight variation in the willingness and ability of different subsets of the population to comply with lockdown orders.We then analyze how changes in population mobility relate to the spread of disease, and conduct statistical regression analysis to show that mobility reductions are significantly and negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates two weeks later. While this suggests the lockdown measures have been effective in achieving their goals, we also reflect on how the government's response and corresponding mobility reductions interact with existing inequalities, keeping in mind the country's status as the world's most unequal nation. 2 This research note contributes to a rapidly expanding literature on COVID-19's impact in the Global South, and in particular to studies that demonstrate and explain variation within countries (Okoi & Bwawa, 2020; Wenham & Smith, 2020; Brauer et al., 2020) . To our knowledge, ours is the first subnational analysis of population mobility in response to for South Africa. 3 We also contribute an important perspective to the emerging literature on the efficacy of shelter-in-place orders, which to date has been dominated by studies of the United States. 4 Finally, by discussing the tradeoffs inherent to stringent containment measures, we tell a story that resonates across the African continent and in other parts of the world where efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 may have as many or more negative consequences as the disease itself (Coetzee & Kagee, 2020) .This research note proceeds as follows. Section 2 details South Africa's efforts to contain COVID-19, and compares the country's response to others on the continent. Section 3 then presents our analysis of mobility trends and their relation to the growth rate of new infections. Section 4 describes the nature of inequality in South Africa in order to situate our results in context. Section 5 concludes.The first case of COVID-19 in South Africa was confirmed on March 5th, 2020; subsequent cases were confirmed in the days that followed among citizens who had traveled to Italy on a ski trip. While the initial cases suggested the disease might be limited to the country's affluent, cosmopolitan population, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced broad measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 on March 15th. 5 As the timeline depicted in Table 1 shows, the response accelerated quickly from there.[ Table 1 here.]Formal regulations were published on March 18th, promoting social distancing at one person per square meter of floor space (RSA Government, 2020a). The regulations also closed schools, called for isolation of sick people, quarantining of asymptomatic people, limited gatherings to 100 people, and to 50 people at the premises where alcohol is sold and consumed.These regulations were amended on March 25th, ushering in a strict lockdown phase (RSA Government, 2020b) . Beginning March 27th, all businesses were to remain closed, except those involved in the production and provision of essential goods and services. 6 Every person was to be confined to a place of residence unless performing essential services, obtaining essential goods or services, collecting social grants, emergency care or chronic medication attention. All places of work were to be closed except those providing essential services.Movements between provinces, metropolitan areas and districts were prohibited, including commuter transport services, except when rendering essential services.The lockdown was extended on April 16th to the end of the month (RSA Government, 2020c) to allow the government further time to prepare for management of the disease (Karim, 2020) . Revised regulations prohibited evictions from rental properties, permitted opening of refineries, and allowed mining to operate at reduced capacity. These were seen as laying the groundwork for re-opening the economy (RSA Government, 2020d). At the end of April, the lockdown was relaxed to allow transition into Alert Level 4 beginning May 1st, 2020 (RSA Government, 2020e). 7 The country transitioned to Alert Level 3 on June 1st (RSA Government, 2020g), which provided for movements of school children across provinces and limited religious gathering to 50 people.Compared to many of its neighbors on the continent, South Africa's response has been swift and extensive, as shown in Figure 2 . As of April 1st, 2020, South Africa scored an 88 out of 100 on the ""Stringency Index,"" as coded by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker . Only 10 of 54 other countries on the continent were coded as having more stringent responses as of that date.[ Figure 2 here.]As we show in the next section, the country's residents acted accordingly to reduce spread of the disease by dramatically reducing their mobility.This section examines how South African citizens responded to the government's strict containment measures, drawing on Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. These reports are based on aggregated, anonymized data from users of Google Maps, and show how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline. 8, 9 We examine four categories:1. Workplaces: Mobility trends for places of work.Mobility trends for places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters.3. Transit stations: Mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations.Mobility trends for places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies. Figure 3 shows that South Africa 10 consistently ""outperforms"" its peers in terms of reduced mobility relative to the stringency of government response with the exception of grocery and pharmacy visits reflecting the exemption of such businesses from the lockdown order.[ Figure 3 here.]The national average reduction in mobility masks considerable variation within the country. Figure 4 illustrates mobility trends by province 11 in terms of retail and recreation from February 14-May 15, 2020. 12 Although the provinces exhibit differences, in each case we can observe a substantial dip corresponding to the beginning of the strict lockdown period. Table 2 depicts the overall average percent change in mobility reductions during the most stringent lockdown period (27 March-30 April 2020) by provinces for the different categories.[ Table 2 here.]Western Cape registers the largest average decrease in mobility for all categories. On the other side, Limpopo registers the smallest decline in retail/recreation; Mpumalanga the smallest declines in grocery/pharmacy and transit station visits; and Northern Cape the smallest declines in workplace visits and smallest increase in residential mobility.We also calculate the average mobility reduction for the three most highly correlated categories: retail/recreation, workplace mobility, and transit stations (see correlation matrix in Appendix Table A4 ). This is depicted graphically in Figure 5 .[ Figure 5 here.]In order to account for variation in mobility trends across provinces, we consider a number of economic and demographic factors. We also consider each province's caseload (number of confirmed cases) at the beginning of the lockdown period. These features are summarized in Table 3 .[ Table 3 here.]We use qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to identify the features shared by the provinces experiencing the greatest mobility reductions. 13 Our analysis suggests that the main factors associated with substantial mobility reductions are the number of confirmed cases prior to the lockdown period and the relative size of the provincial economy. The provinces containing South African's metropolitan hubs --Gauteng (containing Johannesburg) and Western Cape (containing Cape Town) also tended to experience larger mobility reductions. This may reflect the challenge of reducing mobility in rural areas among populations that are more likely to be food insecure (Tibesigwa and Visser, 2016) . Emerging research on the determinants of compliance with social distancing and other measures suggests that concerns about income losses play an important role in determining compliance (Wright et al., 2020; Bodas and Peleg, 2020) .In contrast to the United States, where partisanship has been shown to be a key determinant of mobility reductions and other efforts to contain the spread of disease (Grossman et al., 2020; Adolph et al., 2020) , party politics do not seem to feature prominently when it comes to explaining variation in mobility in South Africa. Both Gauteng (controlled by the ruling African National Congress party) and Western Cape (the only province held by the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance) exhibit similar trends when it comes to mobility reductions. That said, such unity appears to be waning. For example, the Democratic Alliance filed a legal challenge against some coronavirus lockdown rules in mid-May (Democratic Alliance, 2020). The Economic Freedom Fighters (the second largest opposition party) subsequently issued a statement calling for prolonged stringent lockdown (Economic Freedom Fighters, 2020).South Africa's strict lockdown policies --and corresponding reductions in mobility by the country's citizens --were put in place with the aim of reducing the spread of COVID-19. This leads us to ask: how effective have they been? Before we attempt to answer this question, we first present the trajectory of disease by province in Figure 6 up until May 24th, 2020. Although the first cases were confirmed in KwaZulu-Natal, the figure indicates how the disease has taken hold primarily in Western Cape. 14 [ Figure 6 here.]In order to determine how the spread of disease has changed as a consequence of the mobility reductions discussed above, we estimate a series of regression models with average weekly exponential growth in confirmed cases as the dependent variable. 15 The independent variables are average weekly mobility reductions for each of the three main categories discussed above (workplace, retail/recreation, and transit stations) for the preceding two weeks. 16 All models include province fixed effects and standard errors clustered by province. We also include a time trend to account for any other factors changing over time within each province. The results, depicted in Table 4 , suggest that people's mobility reductions have indeed helped to play an important role in reducing the rate of new infections. However, as we discuss in the next section, the benefits and costs of lockdown are unlikely to be distributed equally.[ Table 4 here.]As noted above, South Africa bears the unflattering distinction of the world's most unequal nation in terms of income inequality. Furthermore, the nature of inequality in South Africa extends beyond economic well-being (Leibbrandt et al., 2012; Tibesigwa and Visser, 2016) . We 3. Inequality in the social domain: Whereas access to basic education is high and fairly even across the country, access to health care is characterized by greater inequality. More than 80% of Black Africans use public health facilities and fewer than 20% use private health facilities. There are considerable differences in access to private medical care across provinces, with Limpopo reporting private coverage at less than 10%, whereas Gauteng and Western Cape reported rates of 25.0% and 24.8% in 2017, respectively. 4. Gender inequality: Women were less likely to participate in the formal labor market as compared to men and also experienced higher unemployment (29.6%) compared to men (25.7%) in 2017. Gender inequality is also observable in food security (Tibesigwa and Visser, 2016) . This multidimensional view of inequality is important to keep in mind when it comes to identifying tradeoffs associated with the country's response to COVID-19.The dramatic reductions in population mobility documented above have come at a cost for many households, particularly those who are no longer able to work. Income from the labor market has been the main source of household income in South Africa, accounting for over 70% of overall income (Statistics South Africa, 2019). Fears of losing such income can reduce compliance with measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, especially in low income areas (Wright et al. 2020; Coetzee and Kagee, 2020) .A web-based survey 18 conducted between April 29th -May 6th 2020 (Statistics South Africa, 2020b) paints a picture of the pandemic's impact on employment, income, and hunger, highlighting the potential for deepening inequality. While 60.2% of the respondents were employed on a permanent basis during the national lockdown, just under 2.0% lost their jobs and 5.2% had to close their businesses. Further, while 89.5% of those who were employed before the national lockdown remained employed during this period, 8.1% lost their jobs or had to close their businesses, 1.4% became unemployed and 0.5% were out of the labor force. For those who stayed employed during the lockdown, 21.3% indicated reduced income. Given the voluntary, web-based nature of the survey, these and other estimates are likely significant underestimates. 19The survey also showed that while a majority (75.4%) of respondents who had businesses before national lockdown were white, among black Africans and the coloured population, the share among those who had to close businesses were larger than their share of business ownership (19.9% vs. 14.6% and 6.4% vs. 4.6% respectively).While social grants and remittances have played a crucial role in reducing income inequality over the years in South Africa, the survey shows other coping strategies. For example, 74.9% of respondents reduced their spending to compensate for the loss of income, while about half of respondents had to access their savings to close the income gap. Some respondents (36.8%) relied on extended family members, friends and/or their communities for support, while 14.6% relied on claims from the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Disaggregated analysis of these claimsis not yet possible but would shed further light on the extent to which lockdown has furthered pre-existing inequalities.As noted above, the more rural provinces and black Africans on average have tended to lag further behind in access to basic services (Statistics South Africa, 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have further deepened these inequalities. The survey shows that the majority of those able to work from home are in suburban areas (88%). In contrast, just 5.4% of township residents reported being able to work from home, followed by just 3.9% of those residing on farms and 0.9% of respondents in rural areas.The survey also revealed considerable food insecurity and income losses. Since the start of lockdown, the proportion of respondents who reported experiencing hunger increased from 4.3% to 7.0%. The percentage of respondents who reported no income increased from 5.2% to 15.4% by the sixth week of lockdown. Again, these figures are likely significant underestimates.Notably, the government of South Africa has provided a number of relief measures, including the release of disaster relief funds, emergency procurement, wage support through the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and funding to small businesses. On April 21, 2020, the President announced a massive social relief and economic support package of R500 billion ($30,50 billion), amounting to around 10% of GDP (RSA Government, 2020h) . This was complemented by The South African Reserve Bank easing monetary policy with reduced interest rates (SARB, 2020) and subsequent loan of about $4.5 billion from IMF (RSA Government, 2020i). These resources have been deployed to prepare health infrastructure, provide food and income support, and provide financial relief to businesses and individuals. The effectiveness and efficiency of such efforts are still yet to be determined.This research note paints a picture of life under lockdown in South Africa, the world's most unequal nation. We present evidence of swift and effective action by the government -mirrored in substantial reductions in mobility among the population. People were particularly willing and able to act in the provinces hit hardest by the pandemic in its initial stages (Gauteng and Western Cape). At the same time, compliance with lockdown orders presents a greater challenge among rural populations and others with more precarious livelihoods. By reflecting on South Africa's inequality profile and results of a recent survey conducted during lockdown, we demonstrate how South Africa's response may deepen preexisting divides. This cautionary tale is relevant beyond the country's borders, as much of the continent --and the world --contemplates similar tradeoffs. Along with measures to contain the spread of disease, governments and other development focused organizations should seriously consider how to offset the costs faced by already marginalized populations.Data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Roser et al.

These reports present data on the relative volume of directions requests per country/region, subregion or city compared to a baseline volume on January 13th, 2020. Higher proportions indicate smaller mobility reductions.In addition to being available at the country and province level, these reports are available for the cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town, allowing us to compare trends in these cities to the greater provinces. Note that these reports are available for both driving and walking for the two cities and South Africa as a whole; and for driving only at the greater province level. Figure A1 depicts city/province comparisons for driving trends over the same period considered in the manuscript (February 14-May 15, 2020; see Figure 4 ).We see that the city-level trends appear to mirror the province-level trends. In order to confirm this and relate to the analysis presented in the paper, we also calculate average mobility reductions for the most stringent lockdown period (27 March-30 April 2020). These are depicted in Table A2 below. As with our analysis of the Google Mobility Reports, Western Cape and Gauteng exhibit the largest mobility reduction (fewer directions requests compared to baseline, suggesting people are moving around less), and Limpopo and Mpumalanga province the smallest (a higher proportion of directions requests in comparison to the baseline, indicating less of a change in mobility).We also see that the city-level mobility changes mirror the province level for Cape Town/Western Cape and Johannesburg/Gauteng, confirming the results suggested by the figures above. It is notable that in Cape Town, driving requests and walking requests are on par with each other whereas in Johannesburg the lockdown appeared to have a greater impact on people's driving habits compared to walking. This may be due to the fact that Cape Town and Western Cape are mostly tourist areas and thus when the lockdown instructions and impact of the disease set in, both driving and walking habits were similarly affected. On the other hand, the driving and walking populations of Johannesburg and Gauteng tend to be distinct. Most of the drivers are wealthier, while the walkers tend to be poorer. When the lockdown instructions set in, it was easier to enforce compliance with driving (using the existing traffic enforcement framework), while it was more difficult to enforce walking restrictions (due to the lack of a coherent enforcement framework and insufficient resources).All figures in this section depict mobility trends from February 14-May 16, 2020, using data from Google Mobility Reports In order to conduct crisp qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) we begin by creating sets -dichotomizing the variables of interest to designate membership within a given set. The sets are defined as follows:• M = large average mobility decrease (defined alternatively as provinces in the top quintile of the distribution and provinces in the top two quintiles) • I = 100 or more confirmed infections as at March 26, 2020 (start of lockdown) • D = densely populated provinces, i.e. those with an average of 100 people or more per km sq. • G = Provinces whose contribution to national GDP is greater than 10% • P = Provinces with a multidimensional poverty rate greater than 10% • A = Provinces with a proportion of agricultural households exceeding 25%We have reproduced a crisp set version of the relevant data in Table A2 as a data matrix. We see that for either definition of M, the set also contains members of I and G --that is, provinces with at least 100 confirmed cases pre-lockdown and those that contribute significantly to national GDP. The dependent variable is the average weekly reduction in mobility to workplaces, retail and recreation, and transit stations. All models include province fixed effects and robust standard errors clustered by province. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01 Figure A5 .

66a5ba1517e1da04bb34d4c8965b3e402fe594a9,Perspective Piece Fumigation of Schools for COVID-19 Prevention in Nigeria: The Need for a Rethink,"Abstract. The government of Nigeria ordered closure of schools to slow the spread of COVID-19 when the pandemic hit the country. About 5 months into the outbreak, secondary schools have been reopened to allow students to write their terminal examinations. Many state governments and school owners are fumigating their schools as a way of disinfecting the school environment and ensuring safe resumption of academic activities. We discuss the undue attention given to fumigation in this instance and stress the importance of addressing more beneficial and sustainable strategies to prevent COVID-19 in Nigerian schools.COVID-19 has continued its unrelenting onslaught on the human race. However, man is fighting back and learning to live with the disease. As a result, many nations are easing lockdown and other restrictive measures enforced to limit movement in addition to implementing and promoting the observance of precautionary measures to slow the spread of the disease. 1,2 As part of their prevention strategies or in preparation for reopening, governments and organizations in many countries are taking the initiative or are being pressured to invest scarce resources into fumigation of public places as a means of disinfecting and making such environments ""safe"" against COVID-19. 3, 4 Nigeria ordered secondary schools to reopen on August 4, 2020 after closure for about 5 months. The reopening was to start with students in classes overdue for their terminal examinations. 5 The Nigeria CDC, in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Education, developed guidelines for schools to ensure safety of students and staff while carrying out academic activities. 6 The guidelines stipulate a number of essential activities, based on the key strategies of physical distancing, hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, use of face masks, screening, isolation, and notification for further action. Although some state governments are supporting their schools to implement these strategies, others are paying lip service and not doing enough to prepare their schools for the safe resumption of academic activities. What seems to be an obsession of state governments and private school owners across the country in all geopolitical zones is fumigation. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Although the national guidelines recommend fumigation as one of the measures to be taken for environmental safety and hygiene, 6 fumigation seems to have become the cynosure, and it is dwarfing every other recommended measure to fight the disease. But of what value is spraying of classrooms and school premises in the prevention and control of COVID-19?Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, occurs primarily by direct contact with infected persons through their respiratory secretions or respiratory droplets, which may be expelled when infected persons cough, sneeze, talk, or sing. 12, 13 Respiratory droplets that are expelled in this process include the virus and can reach the mouth, nose, or eyes of a susceptible person, and result in infection. The second most important route is fomite transmission, which occurs when hands that touch contaminated surfaces and objects come in contact with the mouth, nose, or eyes. 14 The virus has been shown to remain viable for hours to days on some fomites and surfaces. 15, 16 The likelihood of environmental contamination is high in healthcare settings where COVID-19 cases are managed, but because there is a possibility of surface contamination outside health facilities, the WHO advises using measures used in treatment centers in other places where large numbers of people gather, including religious houses, markets, and schools. 17, 18 Recommended measures for environmental cleaning and disinfection emphasize wiping potentially contaminated surfaces with cloth soaked in disinfectant solution after cleaning. Cleaning is an essential precursor of disinfection, as it removes or reduces the load of infectious agent, dirt, and other organic matter that may attenuate the potency of the disinfectant. 17 Fumigation involves spraying disinfectant on surfaces to be decontaminated. The WHO strongly advises against fumigation or direct spraying with disinfectants of humans, as deleterious effects far outweigh benefits. 17, 19 Even in healthcare settings, where fumigation or other ""no-touch"" methods may be used for terminal disinfection, these are recommended only as supplements and not as a replacement for manual cleaning procedures. 20 SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in places where people are active. What purpose is served by fumigating empty school premises that have had no human activities for months? Fumigation in this instance may kill or drive away harmful insects and other dangerous organisms, but there is no scientific evidence to show it to be useful for disinfecting against SARS-CoV-2.In the face of dwindling financial resources due to the severe economic disruption caused by the pandemic, priority needs to be given to the most beneficial and cost-effective measures to fight the disease. Money earmarked for fumigation should be redirected to ensure implementation of evidence-based strategies recommended for schools. Many schools in Nigeria, particularly public schools, are overcrowded, 21 and makeshift structures are needed to create additional classrooms to enable physical distancing. Government also needs substantial investment to ensure effective hand hygiene in schools. A recent survey found that only 36% of schools in Nigeria have access to basic water services, 16% to basic water and sanitation services, and 7% to combined basic water, sanitation, and hygiene services. 22 It is imperative to provide handwashing stations with running water, soap, single-use hand towels, and hand sanitizers at strategic points in schools. More cleaners may need to be employed and additional equipment and items purchased to ensure adequate cleaning of surfaces. Quality fabric masks will need to be provided for staff and students while in school. The schools will need support to make special transport arrangements to ensure students and staff can commute to school safely. Educational materials conveying key messages about COVID-19 prevention should be distributed to be liberally posted to reinforce precautions against the disease. For schools that lack sick bays, this is the time to establish them to ensure prompt attention for any sick student or staff member. In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to revamp Nigeria's weak school health programs.There are many pressing needs to address to prevent COVID-19 transmission in schools in Nigeria. Fumigation is likely to give a false sense of invulnerability and detract from other more important safety measures. Resources devoted to it should be redeployed to proven, sustainable, and costeffective strategies that will prevent school outbreaks and help establish a health culture that will outlive COVID-19.",Nigeria,abstract,2020-08-25,08
765fc6467262adbb2504ba9cfe675f8404101a13,Population risk factors for COVID-19 deaths in Nigeria at sub-national level Population risk factors for COVID-19 deaths in Nigeria at sub-national level,"Prior to the emergence of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the world had witnessed the outbreak of two other β-coronaviruses; SARS-CoV-1 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2003 [1] and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2012 [2] . Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans with symptoms ranging from mild to severe diseases [3] . In December 2019 a new coronavirus outbreak was reported in China [4] . The new virus, named as SARS-CoV-2, spread rapidly from country to country causing unprecedented impact on health, economy, and quality of life of communities. Surprisingly, economically rich countries such as Italy, the US and UK, in spite of their wellestablished healthcare systems, experienced the highest burden of infection and deaths. Numerous factors, including, delayed public health responses, limited testing, inadequate contact tracing and quarantine measures, as well population demographics and disease comorbidities are believed to have contributed to the high burden in these countries [5, 6] .The African continent reported its first case on 14 th February 2020 in Egypt [7] . Nigeria recorded her first COVID-19 case on 27 th February, becoming the second country in Africa with the disease [7] . The index case was a 44-year old Italian citizen who flew into Lagos International Airport from Milan on 25 th February. Indeed, Nigeria´s first dozen cases of COVID-19 were all linked to travel history from endemic countries. Nigeria´s response included suspension of flights, supervised self-isolation for returnees, continuous contact tracing and restrictions on interstate travels. Other measures included nationwide closure of all tertiary, secondary and primary schools, prohibition of religious and other high-density gatherings and social distancing [8] . As of June 30, 2020, Nigeria recorded 25,694 COVID-19 cases, 590 deaths and 9,746 recoveries. However, the distribution and burden of morality from COVID-19 varied significantly from region to region and indeed from State to State. The aim of this study was to analyze at the State and regional levels, the population risk factors that could explain these variations in COVID-19 burden in Nigeria.Data sources: data for prevalence and case fatality (CFR) of COVID-19 was collected for all 6 geopolitical regions and all 37 States in Nigeria from the beginning of the outbreak until 30 th June 2020. COVID-19 data was obtained from the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) [9] . Prevalence and CFR of COVID-19 cases were analyzed in the context of different clinical and socio-demographic risk factors. Data on State´s total population, unemployment, literacy, GDP per capita and cases of TB was obtained from the Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics (NNBS) [10] . We calculated the socio-demographic parameters, namely, population density, elderly population (65 years and above), and case mortality rates (CMR), from the raw data obtained from the NCDC and NNBS. BCG vaccination coverage (the oldest available data from 2000 was used, as the risk of COVID-19 mortality is highest in older cohorts), and HIV prevalence were obtained from the Local Burden of Disease (LBD) dataset from Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle [11] . State-wise data on smoking prevalence was obtained from Unicef-Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) [12] .Statistical analysis: statistical data analysis was conducted using Jamovi version 1.1.7. Bivariate analysis included correlation analysis of risk factors with CMR in the 37 States. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the risk factors in 7 higher burden States versus all other States. Mean differences in these two groups were compared using post hoc Tukey´s adjusted p values. Lastly, multivariate analysis was carried out using generalized linear model (GAMLj module) based on Poisson distribution with the log link function for CMR (the dependent variable). Loglikelihood ratio tests were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each covariate while R-squared was maximized for overall model error reduction. No States were excluded. Missing data were minimal for COVID-19 metrics.Descriptive analyses: we analyzed the data for all 6 geopolitical zones and all 37 States of Nigeria including the federal capital territory (FCT) (Annex 1). The total number of laboratory-confirmed cases increased rapidly from 139 persons in March 2020, to 1,932 in April, escalating to 10,162 cases by May 2020 and 25,694 by the end of June. COVID-19 mortality rates rose from an average of 0.05 deaths per State in March 2020 to 1.56 deaths in April, going up to 7.76 deaths in May 2020 and 16.0 in June. Case fatality rates per 100 confirmed cases (by 30 th June 2020) ranged from less than one to a maximum of 13.6 in Yobe State. The greatest burden of deaths were seen in South-South, North-West and South-West geopolitical zones, reporting 117, 120 and 185 lives lost, respectively. These regions also had the highest number of confirmed cases at 3769, 3163 and 13178, respectively ( Figure  1 ). From the 37 States, Lagos (located in South-West zone) had the largest number of confirmed cases and deaths (10,510 and 128, respectively, by 30 th June 2020) (Figure 1 ). Comparison of the 7 the States with the highest COVID-19 confirmed cases, namely Lagos, Abuja FCT, Oyo, Kano, Edo, Rivers, and Delta with all other States revealed that the high burden States had significantly higher number of total deaths. This remained significant when mortality was calculated by per million population, CMR (Table 1) .Bivariate correlations: higher CMR per million population correlated with GDP per capita (r = 0.53), and to a lesser extent with population density (r = 0.38) and TB prevalence (r = 0.36), but not with smoking, literacy or unemployment (r < 0.15) ( Figure 2 ). As bivariate correlations can be spurious due to hidden confounding variables, a multivariate analysis was carried out.Multivariate analysis: multivariate modelling was used to analyze the relative contribution of predictor variables for CMR in Nigerian States. Variation of CMR across the 37 States was predicted by 3 covariates (p < 0.05 for all variables; adjusted R 2 , 0.56). These variables were prevalence of HIV (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.81, 95% CI, 0.68-0.95), GDP per capita (OR 1.0) and BCG vaccination (OR 0.98, CI 0.97-1.0). HIV prevalence had a protective effect, whilst GDP and BCG vaccination were also statistically significant but their protective effect was small (Figure 3 ). Modelling for CFR as the outcome variable did not uncover any variable that was a statistically significant predictor.The current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide, but at a varying degree. Different countries have taken different policy decisions based on their specific capabilities and needs in responding to the pandemic. These actions have clearly had different impact on the rate of infection and death associated with COVID-19. Since the death toll from this pandemic continues to grow, there is an urgent need to identify risk factors that predispose to severe disease outcomes. In lowincome countries with nascent healthcare systems and limited resources, knowing who is at increased risk of severe disease is even more compelling [7, 13, 14] . In this study, we have analyzed the population risk factors of COVID-19 in Nigeria at the subnational State level.Previous studies have suggested that BCG vaccination may have a protective role in COVID-19 disease severity [15] [16] [17] . Although BCG was developed to protect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, it has been reported to induce cross-protective trained immunity against a number of viral and bacterial pathogens [18] [19] [20] . In this study, we found that low BCG vaccine coverage correlated with higher COVID-19 mortality. This was further supported by the observation that high TB prevalence correlated with higher COVID-19 mortality. However, these associations were weak. For BCG vaccination, we used data from the year 2000. Since most of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been reported in the age group 21-50 years [9] , using data for BCG vaccination coverage from 1970 to 2000 would have provided a more valid analysis and perhaps a stronger correlation. Unfortunately, State level data prior to 2000 was not available. Despite no direct evidence from randomized case-controlled studies, epidemiological analysis from several countries indicate that the COVID-19 prevalence, progression and mortality are negatively correlated with BCG coverage [15, 21, 22] . Higher deaths were observed in countries that have stopped BCG vaccination [15] . However, a number of pertinent questions regarding the potential protective role of BCG for COVID-19 severity remain unknown. For example, is the BCG protective effect age and gender dependent? What is the protective duration of BCG vaccination? Is the protective effect dependent on the strain of BCG vaccine?Another interesting observation from this study was the negative correlation between HIV prevalence and COVID-19 mortality. Although it was expected, and with good reason, that HIV patients may succumb to more severe COVID-19 infection and mortality, our data does not appear to support this. Indeed, a few recent reports also indicate that HIV patients are at no greater risk of severe COVID-19 compared to the general population [18] [19] [20] 23] . Why people with HIV do not develop more severe COVID-19 remains puzzling. One suggestion is that some of the antiretroviral drugs used for the treatment of HIV could have protective effect against SARS-CoV-2. However, this remains controversial and unproven. Another possibility is that people with HIV are more cautious about social distancing, and hence are less likely to get infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the first place.A number of studies have reported that old age is a risk factor for COVID-19 severity [24] [25] [26] . Surprisingly, our analysis did not show this correlation. The age group most affected by COVID-19 in Nigeria, as of June 30 th 2020, were 21-50 years with a peak infection among 31-40 years [9] . This is in contrast to reports from China where 87% of confirmed cases were aged between 30 and 79 years old [27] with a median age of 48 to 58 years [28] . A similar pattern was observed in Italy [29] and the US [27] . One possible explanation for the difference could be due to the specific demographics of Nigeria. Those aged 65 and above constituted only 2% of the population as compared to 22.5% in Italy, for example. As for gender, men were most affected with COVID-19, consistent with reports from other countries [24] [25] [26] 30] . One speculation is that men smoke more than women in Nigeria. Smoking is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of COVID-19 [27] probably because it affects the lungs rendering it more susceptible to the infection. However, in our multivariate analysis, smoking prevalence did not correlate with COVID-19 deaths, at least in Nigerian State level analysis. We have found that factors like literacy, unemployment or smoking were not predictive of either incidence or fatality of COVID-19. It possible that in Nigeria, other risk factors may have had a more significant impact on COVID-19 incidence and fatality. These may include observing recommended COVID-19 precautionary measures such as social distancing, regular handwashing with soap and water, avoiding SARS-CoV-2 infected or suspected person and use of face masks where necessary [8, 31] . It is also possible that poorer States with low literacy and high unemployment did fewer tests and had fewer foreign visitors with COVID-19.It is apparent that SARS-CoV-2 infects both rich and literate individuals and countries globally. Nonetheless from our analyses, States' GDP per capita and population density appeared to be moderate risk factors for COVID-19 CMR per million population whereas BCG coverage and HIV prevalence appeared to afford some protection. This study serves as a scaffold for understanding population risk factors for COVID-19 deaths in Nigeria. Policymakers and healthcare professionals can benefit from evidence-based recommendations to guide their decisions in the evolving pandemic. first draft and critically reviewing the paper, giving approval for the final version to be published.

620a16c1471c166ab0997ce50b686f451ac6cd41,Estimating the total size of coronavirus epidemic in Algeria via different approaches,"It has become very urgent whether it was for the population or for the authorities to know the outcome of the actual pandemic . There remains only the pace of its evolution and the estimated total number of infectious cases that can be taken into account. A mathematical tool dedicated to epidemiology, helps public health practitioners in predicting the number of cases and deaths in the short-term, in order to plan resources and to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies [1] .An epidemiological model is very useful but is always approximate because it does not depend only on the disease but it also depends on the behavior of the population, the size of the population and the different interventions made by the influential authorities.In order to model the spread of the coronavirus epidemic, a typical method was followed as schematically represented in figure 1 . This diagram is based on the fact that modelling infectious diseases and their spread in the population and the mathematical modelling of any biological system has the same principle [2] .From this diagram (figure1), the importance of fitting the actual data, estimation of parameters and simulation/analysis of the mathematical chosen model can be seen.Therefore, studying the spread of coronavirus in Algeria, this work goes from a basic approach that consists on fitting the data and doing extrapolations after we follow up with a predictive study according to the logistic -regression model and finally, we end with the SIR (susceptible-infectedrecovered) model. Thus, the continuation of this paper will be as follows: Section 2 introduces the methods. Section 3 presents the different results with discussion and Section 4 gives conclusions.The ideal technique for predicting the output of a phenomenon is to create an equation from the data acquired. Hence, the importance of the curve fitting (linear and nonlinear), compartmental models, and other methods, that can give a sense to the real data.The curve fitting captures the trend in the data by assigning a single function across the entire range [3] . This fitting can be linear with an equation that illustrates a straight line, its equation is f(x) = ax+b. With: a and b been the fitting parameters.The fitting can be non-linear used for the non-linear data, such as polynomial and Gaussian with a power model.As an example the polynomial fitting with a general order j, its equation is: f(x)=a 0 +a 1 x +a 2 x 2 +a 3 x 3 +…..a j x j . It can be seen that the linear fitting is just a polynomial fitting with order 1. The mean problem of this type of fitting is the possibility of having either an under-fitting (low degree of fitting) or an over-fitting (more than necessary we added noises to the data) [4] .Most epidemics grow approximately exponentially during the initial phase of an epidemic. The logistic model is a model that adds a term of saturation to the initial exponential growth [5] . This model is named model of population growth and it's characterized in general by the following formula, called logistic formula [6] :In which:  y(t) is the number of cases at any given time t  C is the limiting value, the maximum capacity for y (the final epidemic size, named also carrying capacity).  b is the growth rate.The maximum growth rate is at: t = ln(a) /b and y(t) = C / 2.This time is considered the peak time.In general, if we compare this model with the curve fitting, we can observe that the logistic model is just a specific function of fitting (specific equation).In this model, we have three classes (compartments) changing with time (t): susceptible individuals (S), infected individuals (I) and removed/recovered individuals (R). The total population size N is the sum of the sizes of these three classes [7] :We also have: s(t) = S(t)/N, the susceptible fraction of the population, i(t) = I(t)/N, the infected fraction of the population, and r(t) = R(t)/N, the recovered fraction of the population.The global model which is a compartmental model can be expressed as a system of differential equations, as follows [8] :Where β is the rate of infection and μ is the rate of recovery.This system is a system of ordinary differential equations that has analytical and numeric solutions.The results of the curve fitting are shown in figures 2 & 3. This work is performed on data given by [9] . For the first analysis of this model and considering the shape of the epidemic which resembles a bell, the third degree of fitting (most likely for a controlled epidemic) and the fourth degree (which most resembles a hardly controlled epidemic) seem the most acceptable but only statistical calculations (of errors) can prove this. Another remark is that the cubic regression gives us an extinction of the epidemic in Algeria after 72 days (and there are no cases listed negative).By applying data given by [9] the model is based on a tutorial by David Arnold [10] and implemented by Varuna De Silva [11] , we get: Let's recall that until 25 th April 2020 (i.e. after two months after the apparition of the coronavirus in Algeria), the situation was as expressed in figure 5.Algeria (data until 25 Apr, 2020).This result is acceptable compared to other techniques because it uses real data without prediction.In order to do a strong comparison between the methods cited above and the SIR model, we used the results of applied SIR model given by [14] and inspired from the open-source codes from Milan Batista [15] and using the daily updated COVID-19 data from Our World in Data [16] .The results of the applied SIR model are as follows: It can be seen from figure 7 that the turning date (peak time) in Algeria is 10th April. This result confirms that from the logistics model, the estimated extinction time of the epidemic in Algeria from this study is around 8th June 2020.The results can be confirmed with the study done by the ETH Zürich & EPFL, the University of Geneva exposed in figure 8 [17]. Note that the principle of this study is not based on the SIR model. There is another study carried out on the propagation of Covid-19 in Algeria by applying the SIR model whose parameters were calculated based on the maximum likelihood estimation. This study done by [18] is very interesting because it deals with the same period as our work (25th February 2020 to April 24, 2020). Using their settings of the optimal SIR model which are: N (population size)= 3127, β (contact rate)= 0.18 and γ (removed rate)= 0.033; we get the following curve (figure 9) : From figure 9, it can be seen that the peak time corresponds to 50 th day (14th Aril) which gives the same result as the curve fitting (see section 3-1).After a satisfactory evolution of the Covid-19 epidemic in Algeria in the period subject to this research, the containment measures enacted in Algeria were alleviated by a decision of the authorities taken on 24th April 2020. There was a bad reaction from the population and the situation had changed completely. At the time of completing this work (15th May), the extinction time of the epidemic has been extended and the infection curve has been shifted ( figure 10) .An estimation of the time peak and total size of the coronavirus epidemic in Algeria is expected in this paper. The extent of the study period runs from 25th February 2020, to 24th April 2020. Our work has shown through several approaches (SIR model, curve fitting and statistical growth model) that the peak of this period was 10th April for some methods and 14th April for others. Although these two dates are very close, the date of 10th April is the most credible because it is given by the growth model based only on the real data without prediction.The study of the spread of Covid-19 is still difficult and must have a margin of safety because it is considered as a ""wicked problem"" [19] , given its uncertain nature depending on the social life of individuals as well as communities.",Algeria,abstract,2020-08-01,08
5bdcdad4f2cc5850e50baa88bec1f6f2018f17b1,The media and health education: Did Nigerian media provide sufficient warning messages on coronavirus disease?,"Health education is very important for the general public to internalize appropriate health information that will serve as guides to their health behaviour. This is because people are likely to exhibit health behaviour based on available information to them. The point to make here is that health behaviour of people is largely dependent on information available to them. He et al. [1] after their study using a Chinese population concluded that health information and health behaviour are key to public health education. Within the context of public health, information possession is vital because poor knowledge about public health issues could have corresponding negative implications on health behaviour. Conner [2] corroborates that information is one of the fundamental cognitive determinants that influences health behaviour. Limaye et al. [3] also acknowledged the important role of information in health education.The media as the fourth estate of the realm occupy a cardinal role in health education. Many decades ago, Flora et al. [4] had outlined the four roles that the media can play in health intervention to include: first is what they called media as educator, the second is media as supporter, the third is media as programme promoter, and the fourth is media as supplement. The four elements look different but can typically be implemented in combination or individually. For example, media as an educator entails that the media have to educate the masses about public health issues. The objective of educating the public about public health issues is to ensure that they are mentally armed with information that will serve as a checklist regarding their behaviour. Kim and Noriega [5] note that the media are critical players in health education. The researchers add that one of the strategies through which the media can achieve this is through a combination of education and entertainment. Okim-Alobi and Okpara [6] hold the view that media provide a formidable platform through which health information can be made available to the general public. In their view, the media are critical players in educating the general public about health issues.The fundamental way through which the media can educate the general public on public health issues is through coverage. This can take place through strategies like frequently reporting public health issues, recommending appropriate health behaviour and suggesting policies that will assist in combating the public health issues reported.Educating the general public about health issues is like preparing them for war. Therefore, where possible, this has to be done ahead of time, not when the health issue become a pandemic. This is important so that it will prepare them to take proactive steps. What this means is that where possible, it is better for the media to educate the general public about health pandemics well ahead of time before there is a confirmed case within their locality. Within the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), local media did not need to wait until there is a confirm case of the virus in their country before educating the general public but its symptoms, prevention and recommend action for the government to take. Unfortunately, previous studies [7, 8] that have examined media coverage did not take this aspect into account. Therefore, in this study, the broad objective was to determine how the media in Nigeria provide warning messages concerning COVID-19 when it was first reported in China. This objective was pursued by comparing media stories about the pandemic when it was first reported in China and when it eventually spread into the country. The specific objectives were as follows: Health education and the surveillance role of the mass mediaTo educate the general public about health issues, the media need to first monitor the environment and identify potential life-threatening health issues and provide adequate information that will enlighten the masses on the issues. Sharma and Gupta [9] say that health education is an essential aspect of public health and health promotion. They add that the goal of health education is to have positive influence on health behaviour of people through information and instruction. That is to say that media coverage is an essential strategy of health education. This is because, through media coverage, the general public will be informed and instructed on issues related to public health issues. The means also that the surveillance role of the mass media is essential in the study of media coverage of health issues. The surveillance role of the mass media requires that they monitor the society and provide information to members of the society on pending dangers. This function is an expression of the 'watchdog role' of the media. This is because when a dog watches over an area, it makes efforts to let people know each time there is a perceived danger. The dog barks and this typically attracts the attention of the public with a corresponding possibility for eliciting actions to avert the danger. Therefore, the surveillance role of the mass media means that they constantly scan the society, evaluate events and highlight areas that pose potential danger to the general wellness of the society. In this sense, the media have a duty to make sure that people are adequately warned of dangers. Donohue et al. [10] must have been referring to the surveillance function of the V. C. Gever and G. Ezeah mass media when they submitted that knowledge is an essential condiment that people need to take informed decisions. This assertion makes a strong case for media workers to constantly monitor the society and provide relevant and sufficient information to members of the general public.The idea behind the surveillance function of the mass media is attributed to Lasswell [11] . In the views of Lasswell, the mass media typically plays three roles to the society. These are as follows: the surveillance of the environment, the correlation of the different components of society in responding to the environment and the passing societal heritage from generation to generation. When this assertion is explained within the perspective of COVID-19, it can be said that the mass media in Nigeria have a responsibility to examine the spread of COVID-19 and coordinate both government and the citizenry on how best to respond to the global health crisis. Based on the surveillance perspective, when the virus broke out in China and was fast spreading to other countries, Nigerian media needed to draw the attention of both the government and Nigerian people on the need to act proactively. For the government, the emphasis could have been on taking policy decisions that will avoid the spread of the virus into the country while also making adequate provision to contain it in case of an outbreak. For the citizenry, the focal point could have been educating them about the virus in areas like symptoms while also encouraging them to imbibe preventive health behaviour.Media performance of its surveillance role has been examined in literature. Gever and Coleman [12] did a study to determine how the media perform their surveillance function within the context of conflict. Their results showed that the conflict between farmers and herdsmen only appear in the media when it is happening. As soon as the conflict reduces, no media reports are made available, no warning sign and news about the conflict disappears in the media. Udeze and Chukwuma [13] carried out a study with the objective to determine public perception of how the broadcast media in Nigeria have fulfilled their surveillance role within the context of security. Their results showed that the public perceive media performance as below expectations. Generally, the media are very important stakeholders in every society. They need to keep vigil of the society, analyse them and draw the attention of the public and the government on the implications of the issues reported. In the process, the media can recommend preventive measures. The overall aim is to make the society a better place.As canvassed by the agenda setting theory, the media are primary factors that shape the society. In the process of performing their functions as ascribed to them in relevant laws (in Nigeria, it is contained in section 22 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria), the media play a role in influencing health behaviour and shaping government policies and programmes in the health sector. The media of communication such as newspaper, magazine, radio, TV and Internetbased media are important agents of any society. It is also in consideration of the important role of the media that they are regarded as the fourth estate of the realm, after the executive, judiciary and legislature. The three important issues in health communication are as follows: health behaviour, health policies and health programmes. Maryon-Davis [14] highlighted three areas that the media of communication can be useful for health promotion to include public information, social marketing and media advocacy. According to the researcher, through public information, the media educate the general public on health issues. With the use of social marketing tactics, the mass media of communication engage with the general public and trigger them to accept and apply certain health behaviour in their daily interactions. Finally, Maryon-Davis adds that with the application of media advocacy strategy, the mass media of communication can raise awareness on health policies with a view to improving the wellness of the general public. It is noteworthy that the three strategies are typically used in combination when using the media for health promotion [15] .Health behaviour is any action that a person engages in that has an implication on his or her health. This explanation is broad because health behaviour has two perspectives. The first angle is health behaviour that is beneficial to a person's health (Conner 2002) . This behaviour can be regarded as positive health behaviour. Such behaviour within the context of COVID-19 may include regular hand washing, social distancing, avoiding touching one's face with unwashed hands, staying at home, among others. On the other hand, there are health behaviours that are dangerous to a person's health. Such behaviour makes a person vulnerable to diseases and ailments. Examples of such behaviour, within the context of the current study, include going to crowded places, shaking hands indiscriminately, among others.Media coverage of health issues is also likely to elicit changes in policies and programmes of government or the introduction of new ones. The government of every country is usually at the forefront of improving the health sector through budgetary provision and other interventions that will make the health sector viable. Over the years, media coverage of health issues and how such coverage impact on behaviour has been examined.Ankomah et al. [16] examined the impact of radio programmes on the utilization of anti-malaria commodities and reported that people who are exposed to radio messages on the benefits of utilizing antimalaria commodities are likely to modify their health behaviour based on the media content than those not exposed.Gupta and Sinha [7] did a study to ascertain how the media report health issues and found that both electronic and print media gave less attention to health matters when compared with other issues like crime, politics and entertainment. Onyeizu and Binta [8] in their study found that even though health issues were well reported in the media, they appeared mostly as straight news story with less prominence given to health issues among the media examined. Galiani et al. [17] examined how media contents on hand washing influence health behaviour. Their result showed that there was no significant link between media messages and hand washing among the sample studied. Bowen [18] did a study to ascertain the link between media messages and the utilization of treated bed net in Cameroon and reported that a significant association exists between both variables. The point to make here is that the mass media of communication are essential in health promotion, health behaviour and policy advocacy. Studies examined above paid less attention in looking at the role of time as moderators of media coverage of health issues in general and infectious diseases in general.COVID-19 was first reported in the city of Wuhan in China in December of 2019. As at that time, it was largely regarded as a Chinese problem that was also going to end in China. According to Wu et al. [19] in an article which was published by Journal of the Chinese Medical Association, COVID-19 was first reported in late December in Wuhan and quickly spread to other places in China and eventually, other parts of the world. In Nigeria, COVID-19 was first confirmed on 27 February 2020. This was after the virus was reported in many other parts of the world like United States, Italy, Russia, among others. This means that Nigeria had ample time to prepare for the outbreak.There have been many global confirmed cases of COVID-19 with several fatalities. The World Health Organization [20] says there is a total of 5 267 419 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as at 25 May 2020. It adds that a total of 341 155 have died of the virus. The situation, when compared with 1 month ago from May 25, is frightening. This is because as at 25 April 2020, there were only 2 710 948 confirmed cases globally and 187 844 deaths. These figures represent multiple increases in the number of cases. WHO also reported that in Nigeria, there were a total of 7839 confirmed cases and 226 deaths as at 25 May 2020. This figure represented an exponential increase because as at 25 April 2020, Nigeria had only 1095 confirmed cases with only 32 deaths, but a month later, these increased more than four times. V. C. Gever and G. Ezeah COVID-19 has proven that the global health system is still vulnerable and that the world is not as advanced in science as the 21st century has made us to believe. COVID-19 has rather shown that the interconnectedness of global economy has made the world vulnerable such that what happens in one country can have a significant impact on the entire world. COVID-19 has impacted significantly on almost every part of the world. It has grounded economic activities, schools are shut down, places of worship have been deserted, international flights have been very limited, if not completely stopped. There is a near total lockdown as people are encouraged to stay at home. Governments of countries have placed restrictions on movement both locally and internationally. Peoples' sources of livelihood have been threatened. The world has many lessons to learn from COVID-19 both now and when it will finally be contained.We made use of agenda setting theory to articulate this study. The theory originated from a 1922 book written by Walter Lippmann [21] with the title Public Opinion. Lippmann in the opening of the book had painted a picture of a 1914 scenario in which a few Englishmen, Frenchmen and Germans lived in an Island with no cable access, but got to know of a British mail steamer that usually circulated once in every 60 days. However, it happened that in the month of September, the mail steamer was yet to visit, but the islanders were still discussing the latest newspaper which its content was about the forth coming trial of Madame Caillaux for the shooting of Gaston Calmette. Lippmann narrated further that the people conglomerated with high expectations on a day in mid-September to know from the captain what the judgment had been. They realized that for over 6 weeks, those of them who were English and those of them who were French had been fighting on behalf of the sanctity of treaties against those of them who were Germans. Lippmann then asserted that for six consecutive weeks, they had behaved as though they were friends, when they were not. By this explanation, Lippmann had painted a picture of the power of the media in setting agenda for the public. The inhabitants of the island did not act as enemies because of their ignorance of what was happening. Although Lippmann did not specifically mention agenda setting power of the media, he provided a sketch in this regard. Lippmann had attributed the images in the minds of the public to media contents [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Also, Cohen [27, p. 13] avers that 'the media may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about'. Soroka [28] posits that Cohen's assertion remains the clearest and most frequently cited annunciation of the public agenda-setting hypothesis. A clear postulation of the agenda setting theory was done by McCombs and Shaw after a 1972 study of 100 undecided voters in Chapel Hill to determine the correlation between voters' agenda and media agenda. The result showed a significant correlation between media content and issue agenda. McCombs and Shaw thus conclude:In choosing and displaying news, editors, newsroom staff, and broadcasters play an important part in shaping political reality. Readers learn not only about a given issue, but also how much importance to attach to that issue from the amount of information in a news story and its position.Gever [26] tested the agenda setting theory through a sample of 400 respondents and reported that the media are effective in setting agenda for the general public. Within the context of this study, the media, it can be argued, have the ability to set agenda for the general public when COVID-19 was first reported in China. They could have done this by educating the public to adopt the appropriate health behaviour that will help them survive the health challenge should it spread to Nigeria. Also, the media could have drawn the attention of the government on the pending danger by letting them know why it was needed to take preventive measures. Therefore, we made use of the agenda setting The media and health education theory to ascertain how the Nigerian media exercise its agenda setting ability in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.We carried out this study with the utilization of content analysis. We regarded content analysis useful for the study because in this study, we aimed to examine media contents on COVID-19. We also considered content analysis useful for this study because we wanted to determine if the content of media related to COVID-19 changed from when it was first reported in China and when it spread to Nigeria.We sampled newspapers, TV stations and radio stations for the study. We wanted to make sure that we had a representation of different types of media so that our sample will be rich enough to enable us draw conclusion. Therefore, we sampled two newspapers namely Nation and Daily Sun (both privately owned) and two TV stations namely Nigerian Television Authority (government owned) and Channels Television (privately owned). We also sampled two radio stations namely Dream Fm (privately owned) and Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (government owned). It should be noted that there are no national daily newspapers in Nigeria that are owned by the government. That is why there was no government newspaper in the sample selected. We combined both stratify and simple random sampling to select the media houses studied. Therefore, two attributes were used to guide our stratification. They are ownership and media genre. The ownership structures considered were private and government ownership. The media genres considered were newspapers, TV and radio. After the stratification, we randomly sampled the media houses, making sure that all the strata were dully represented. This means that our sample of the media examined was rich in terms of the representation of media with different features. To sample the stories that were examined in the study, the researcher made use of the motif sampling approach. Gever (2018) defines motif sampling strategy as the use of key words to retrieve data from the websites of media outfits. Therefore, we made use of motif approach to retrieve data about COVID-19 from all the media houses selected. We made use of key words like 'coronavirus', 'new confirmed cases of COVID-19', 'Outbreak of COVID-19' among others. After the search results were generated, the researchers screened the stories and sampled only those that were related to COVID-19.To achieve the objectives of this study, the researchers measured the following:Under this category, we were interested in knowing the number of stories on COVID-19 that appeared in the media within the time examined. Therefore, we counted the number of story occurrences.We wanted to know if the format that the media used to report stories on COVID-19 changed over time when there was a confirmed case of the virus in Nigeria and no case was confirmed in the country. Therefore, we made use of story format like straight news which were stories about COVID-19 that report issues about the pandemic with no in-depth analysis. The second category was feature. This was the opposite of straight news. It offered detailed information about issues on COVID-19. In the third V. C. Gever and G. Ezeah place, we look at opinion stories. These are stories that revealed the opinion of people (e.g. experts) about the issue or the views of media houses. In the final place, we looked at public service announcement. These were announcements made by the media houses as part of their social responsibility.Our attention here was to assess if media stories on COVID-19 made recommendations on the preventive health behaviour that people should engage in or not. Therefore, we examined as follows:Recommendation contents. These are contents that suggested recommendations on health behaviour regarding how to avoid contracting COVID-19.No recommendations contents. These are contents that did not suggest recommendations on the health behaviour to adopt so as to prevent COVID-19.In this category, our attention was to determine if media stories made recommendations to the government on how to contain the virus or not. Therefore, the researcher examined the following:Suggestion to government contents. These are contents that made suggestions to the government on how to contain COVID-19.No suggestions made. These are contents that did not make any suggestion to the government on how to contain COVID-19.We made use of the article as the unit of analysis for our study. Therefore, articles that were reported in the media selected, served as our unit of analysis. We made use of the code sheet as the instrument for data collection. We also took a step to make sure that inter-coder reliability was within acceptable rate. We achieved this by allowing random selection of two coders to code 20% of our stories. Subsequently, we made use of Krippendorff's Alpha (KALPHA) to evaluate the inter-coder reliability with the application of SPSS 22 version.After the analysis, we arrived at inter-coder reliability of 0.91 for story frequency, 0.79 for story type, 0.79 for health behaviour recommendation, while 0.78 was realized for suggested government intervention. We utilized a combination of descriptive statistics and inferential statistics in our analysis. Therefore, we deploy simple percentages among descriptive statistics and chi-square among inferential statistics. We made use of tables to present our results.We examined the stories on COVID-19 from the six media selected for the study. Our results yielded a total of 537 stories on the subject matter. We examined these stories taking into account the objectives of the study and the result is presented in Table I The objective of Table I is to find out the frequency of media coverage of COVID-19 before it was confirmed in Nigeria and when it was confirmed in the country. The result of the study showed that the media did not provide sufficient stories on COVID-19 until when there was a confirmed case in Nigeria. The result of the chi-square analysis showed a significant link between Nigeria's COVID-19 status and the frequency of coverage, The media and health education v 2 ¼ 34.302 (5), P < 0.05. The degree of the relationship was determined with the use of coefficient contingency (C) and this yielded C ¼ 0.244, interpreted as 24.4%.In Table II , we wanted to know if a difference exists in the story type in media coverage of COVID-19 when it first broke out in China and when there was a confirmed case in Nigeria. Our result showed that before there was a confirmed case in Nigeria, the story type was largely straight news with little varieties in story type. However, when there was a confirmed case in Nigeria, the media used different story types like straight news, feature stories, opinion stories and public announcement to report the health issue. We found an association between Nigeria's COVID-19 status and the story type used (v 2 ¼ 93.014 (3), P < 0.05). The degree of the association was explored with coefficient contingency (C) and this yielded C ¼ 0.372 interpreted as 37.2%.In Table III , we wanted to determine if media stories on COVID-19 made suggestions on the appropriate health behaviour for the general public. We found that before the outbreak of the virus in Nigeria, only 33% of media stories made recommendations on health behaviour to be adopted by the masses. However, after the outbreak, this increased more than twice (72%) the figure. The result of the chi-square analysis showed v 2 ¼49.084 (1), P < 0.05, an indication that the results were significantly related to the status of the outbreak in Nigeria. Hence, there was a significant association; we took the next step by examining the degree of the association. We achieved this with the use of coefficient of contingency (C). Our result showed C ¼ 0.308, interpreted as 30.8%.In Table IV , the researchers sought to ascertain if media reports made recommendations on policies and programmes that government should implement so as to contain the outbreak of the virus. The result of the study showed that only 28.6% of the stories made recommendations to government on policies and programmes before the outbreak of the virus in Nigeria. There was a marginal increase to 37.4% when the virus was confirmed in Nigeria. We further cross-tabulated status of the outbreak in Nigeria with policy recommendations. The result showed v 2 ¼ 2.213 (1), P > 0.05 at 0.05 level of significance. Therefore, we concluded that the status of the outbreak in Nigeria was not significantly linked to policy recommendations.In this study, we investigated the assumption that COVID-19 status of Nigeria is significantly associated with how the local media perform their surveillance role of highlighting the dangers of the virus to the general public and the government of Nigeria. The composition of our sample took into consideration characteristics of media such as ownership (private and public) and genre (print and electronic). Therefore, we examined six media made up of two newspapers, two TV stations and two radio stations. We tested the surveillance role of the mass media with specific attention to frequency of coverage, story type, recommended health behaviour and recommended policies and programmes for the government. We classified our analysis into two broad time frames. That is, when Nigeria had no confirmed case and when Nigeria had a confirmed case.We found that there were generally few stories about the virus prior to when Nigeria had a V. C. Gever and G. Ezeah confirmed case (Table I) . This is despite the fact that the virus was ravaging other countries of the world. Our second key finding was that before Nigeria had a confirmed case, stories about the virus were largely in straight news format. However, this changed when Nigeria had a confirmed case as the media examined made use of different story formats like features, opinion and public service announcement. This was in addition to straight news (Table II) . A similar situation was noticed regarding recommendation on appropriate health behaviour. When Nigeria had no confirmed case, the few stories about the health issue paid less attention to life-saving health behaviour that the masses should adopt. This sharply changed when there was a confirmed case in the country (Table III) . However, media stories on recommendation of policies and programmes did not follow a similar trend. This is because even though there were few stories about the virus that recommended policies and programmes to the government, it appeared this did not significantly change even after Nigeria had a confirmed case. This implies that Nigeria media generally failed to suggest policies and programmes to the government regarding the containment of COVID-19. Our results have extended previous studies [7, 8] on media coverage of health issues by including the role of time in such coverage. With this addition, we hope that health reporters, health communication experts and policy makers in the health sector will be better guided in their understanding of the role of media in health promotion and education. Within [24, 26, 29] , our result showed that media agenda setting on health issues can be improved on through the provision of early health warning messages.Based on the findings of this study, we conclude that the media in Nigeria did not provide sufficient warning messages about COVID-19 when the virus was yet to spread to Nigeria. It is also our conclusion that even after the virus was confirmed in the country, the media did not provide sufficient information aimed at propelling health policies and programmes vis-a-vis COVID-19. This conclusion suggests that improvement is needed in media provision of warning health messages as well as policy-related contents.Drawing from the results of this study and the conclusion derived, the researchers make four suggestions for further studies. First, we focused more in looking at the role of COVID-19 status on media coverage; further studies should pay close attention to how the individual media genres report the virus. In the second place, it is recommended that further studies should examine the influence of media messages on health behaviour related to COVID-19 as well as on environmental practice. Additionally, considering the significant impact COVID-19 is having on the society, it is recommended that further researchers should examine how political news has changed in times of the health pandemic.

885eec0b2efb97b53d1db961dfbe06f39a6f4b89,Journal Pre-proof Adherence to social distancing and wearing of masks within public transportation during the COVID 19 pandemic Adherence to social distancing and wearing of masks within public transportation during the COVID 19 pandemic Corresponding author: Surname; Dzisi Given names,"from the 30 th of March 2020 to the 20 th of April 2020. The government would within this time, restrict travel within and between cities, including the two biggest cities, Accra and Kumasi, which have populations of 2.5 million and 3 million each (Ghana Statistical Services, 2019) .The ministry of health would as well, focus on reducing the number of imported cases, initially by quarantining all travelers entering the country within weeks of the first confirmed cases, and gradually, adopting an intensive community and cluster-based contact tracing regime. Contact tracing was done using community surveillance and phone calls to people who had come in contact with known COVID-19 patients. The goal in contact tracing was the detection and isolation of new cases, to prevent the spread of infection. A contact was determined to be a person who interacted with a laboratory confirmed COVID 19 patient through any of the following ways: living together in the same household with the Covid-19 patient, travelling together with the Covid 19 patient in any kind of conveyance, working together with, or being in close proximity with a confirmed case without requisite PPE (World Health Organization, 2020a).The process of contact tracing would result in the testing of some 86,000 people during the lockdown in April, and allowed the country to be first on the continent in the number of COVID-19 tests per million people. At the time the lockdown was lifted, the country was sixth in infections on the continent with 2,169 cases 229 recoveries and 18 deaths, numbers which could have been significantly higher without these interventions. Figure 1 shows the increasing number of cases in Ghana in comparison to Algeria, Australia, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, South Korea and Tunisia, over a 5-month period. According to Javid, Weekes, & Matheson (2020) maximal viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 occurs early in the course of the illness. Patients may therefore be contagious before they develop symptoms or realize they are infected. Transmission of COVID-19 by individuals who do not show symptoms of the virus have been documented, and mathematical models suggest that between forty and eighty percent of initial transmission was due to transmission from presymptomatic and asymptomatic people. Available data supports the notion that the virus can spread during normal breathing, and that individuals that are seemingly well can still shed high titres of the virus for onward transmission. Kraemer et al. (2020) using real-time mobility data from Wuhan, highlighted the role of transportation in transmission of the virus across China. They identified that early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China could be explained based on the patterns of human mobility. After the implementation of lockdowns, this correlation dropped and the growth rates in infection became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan. Liu & Zhang (2020) also highlight the role of face masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19. They used an analysis of a typical case of cluster outbreak as a result of public transportation exposure in China. One individual traveling from Chongqing, China, transmitted the COVID-19 virus to five other people in the same vehicle when he did not wear a face mask, and transmitted it to no one on a second vehicle (on the second half of the same journey) after he wore a face mask. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted an epidemiological investigation and close contact tracing to screen and treat all passengers that had come in contact with the suspected case. The 14-day medical observation showed that all passengers that had come in contact with the infected individual after he wore a face mask, did not have COVID-19, while 5 of the 39 passengers that had come in contact with the individual on the first bus, had contracted the disease. Howard et al. (2020) argue that, wearing a face mask reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets as witnessed in both laboratory and clinical contexts. They state that the use of face masks could be most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high among larger populations. The decreased transmissibility could substantially reduce the death toll and possibly, the economic impact from COVID-19.It is argued that, although standardized masks such as the N95 (American standard) or FFP2 (its equivalent in Europe) are most effective in reducing risk of contracting COVID-19, these standardized masks can be expected to become scarce in the course of a global pandemic such as COVID-19 (Howard et al., 2020) . According to Greenhalgh et al., (2020) however, even cloth masks, in the absence of these standardized masks, may be only marginally (15%) less effective in blocking emitted particles. They state that cloth masks are fivefold more effective than not wearing one, while offering a good measure of protection to the user.Republic of Ghana, instituted the local production of some 3.6 million face masks, at a rate of one hundred and fifty thousand a week, to ensure the availability of the personal protective equipment for ordinary citizens beyond the lockdown.To this end, the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) was authorized to evaluate the quality of face masks that were being locally produced, to ensure they met basic standards for use. The Ministry of Health also made known to the public, standards for manufacturing face masks as personal protective equipment (PPE). They encouraged the use of java or wax cloths sewn in a triplelayered fashion, stringed with side loops as hooks to the ear, Calico inlaid with fabric stiffener with side loops as hooks to the ear, and as well, homemade masks with strings to be tied behind the neck or head (Zurek, 2020) .Prices of these locally made face masks ranged between GHC1 (US$ 0.17) to GHC7 ($1.2) on average, while the price of surgical masks, shot to about GHC100 (US$17.48) per box from their previous GHC9 (US$1.57) before the pandemic. N95 masks that typically sold for GHC 10 ($1.75) also sold for roughly GHC 25 ($4.37) per mask. This surge in prices was attributed to the overwhelming demand for masks, particularly by foreign nationals who bought them for onward delivery to their families overseas (Alamisi, 2020) [prior to Ghana's first case].Donations of essential items such as local wash sinks, face masks and hand sanitizers were made to some transport operators in selected parts of the country by government and other private entities. However, the vast majority of transport operators and users were expected to acquire their own face masks and hand sanitizers during the period.In an assessment of individual preparedness for the COVID-19 outbreak in Ghana, 68% of Ghanaians thought they were at high risk of contracting COVID-19, 63% thought they were knowledgeable about the disease and its spread, 90% increased the frequency and consistency with which they washed their hands, and 73% used hand sanitizers regularly. The use of face masks also registered 33% use regularly, 43% occasional use, and 24% non-use within the first week of the outbreak (Serwaa, et al. 2020 ). suggest that although some individuals may opt to wear face masks to protect themselves, a stronger public health rationale is to advocate for mass masking as a way of protecting others within one's community. They considered this particularly of importance because of the possible asymptomatic transmission of the virus. They argue that, mass masking is underpinned by the 'prevention paradox', that essentially brings moderate benefits to individuals, but has significant benefits for larger populations. The wearing of masks in their perspective, is as important a measure as mitigation (through handwashing), and physical distancing.In Ghana, paratransit services ('trotros') are the primary mode of transport for intercity travel among the majority of commuters because of how relatively affordable they are (Hotor, 2016) . The service which is solely run by the informal sector (Hart, 2013) seats between 15 and 21 passengers, depending on the size of the bus and number of seats fabricated for a bus by local J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f metalsmiths (Tetteh et. al 2017) . The buses are however, often overcrowded, presenting a possible health hazard for the spread of infectious diseases (Goscé & Johansson, 2018) such as Covid-19. Other forms of public transportation such as station-based and chartered taxi cabs, motorcycle taxis (Tuffour, 2014) , tricycle services ('Pragya'), on-demand ride-hailing (Acheampong et al., 2020; Dzisi, et.al., 2020) and bus rapid transit services (Vermeiren et al., 2015) exist in most Ghanaian cities. Trotros are however most popular, because they have cheap fares, and large vehicle fleets that ply most roads across the country. In Kumasi, there are an estimated 10,000 of these vehicles (KOICA, 2016).As a result of their informal natures, operators of trotro and some taxi cab services are unionized under the Ghana Private Road Transport Union (G.P.R.T.U), a member of the Trade Union Congress. This allows these commercial drivers to have their interests represented with the government, and allows government as well regulate their services through directives, especially in times where public transport management requires collaborative effort between government and the operators. The ministry of transport's directives for intercity travel during COVID-19, were issued on the 18 th of March 2020, and included; (i) the placement of locally devised wash sinks called ""veronica buckets"" at all bus stations, (ii) an insistence on the washing of hands by passengers at bus stations before boarding vehicles, (iii) the regular washing of buses, (iv) a reduction in the number of occupants per vehicle, and a need for physical distancing in vehicles (v) opening of windows to allow aeration within vehicles and (v) the collection of passenger cellphone numbers to enhance contact tracing in case there was the need for it.The transport union and road transport coordinating council subsequently put out a directive on the 29 th of March 2020 stating;  ""Every passenger carrying-vehicle including taxis that typically seat between 1-3 people on a row should seat no more than two passengers on a row.  All Passenger Carrying-vehicles that seat 1-4 people on a row should seat no more than three passengers on a row  All Passenger carrying vehicles that seat 1-5 people on a row should seat no more than three passengers on a row."" (Ansah, 2020) .The health ministry would as well issue guidelines, six (6) days after the partial lockdown was lifted, stating; ""The following groups or persons are required to at all times wear masks; Food vendors and sellers at markets, commercial vehicle drivers and attendants, commuters on public transport, persons in public and commercial centers…"".The ministry's website also provided an illustration of the appropriate way to use the face mask, showing that users were not supposed to loosen it around their neck but to have it fully cover their nose, mouth, and chin and be snug on the side of the face. The guidelines would be in effect at the time of this study, although there were no penalties for not meeting directives at the time. The Ministry of information hosted regular press briefings during the period to update citizens on the country's situation using various media (radio, television, social media and print media) (Addo-Lartey et al., 2020).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table 1 shows a summary of the various guidelines that were established for particularly public transport operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the directives on physical distancing and face masks as criteria, the authors carried out a roadside observer survey of user and operator compliance to the COVID-19 guidelines for public transport, as a measure of the risk levels involved in public transport use during the period.Roadside observer surveys, which are a technique that involves the use of trained observers to categorize road user behavior, was determined as an appropriate data collection method because it allowed a fair assessment of operator and commuter compliance in real time, without violating the WHO Ethical guidelines for research during public health emergencies (World Health Organization, 2020b). The methodology of roadside observations was as well consistent with Beutel et al., (2017) who used the approach in determining driver compliance in wearing seatbelts in Namibia.Roadside observations in this study were carried out by two trained observers, each collecting data on one of the separate categories of compliance i.e. in-vehicle physical distancing and invehicle use of face masks. Observations of vehicles were tallied under compliant or noncompliant based on the established transportation guidelines. Compliance to the physical distancing guideline was determined to be a situation where the maximum number of commuters on a row was in conformance with the GPRTU and Ministry of Transport directives. Noncompliance as well was determined as a situation where there was some observed violation of this guideline.According to the Ministry of health as well, no one should have been using public transport without face masks. However, an adjusted maximum of 2 people per bus without face masks was determined by the researchers in this study, to account for extreme economic hardships (Danquah & Schotte, 2020; Dzansi, 2020) that could have inhibited a person from possibly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f owning a mask. Even though compliance to the policy was an individual responsibility, buses were categorized as compliant or non-compliant based on the number of commuters with face masks, on board a vehicle (Table 3) . Measuring compliance this way allowed for the aggregation of commuter compliance per bus. The survey was carried out at Tech Junction, a major bus stop on the Accra Kumasi road where passengers alight and/or get on board vehicles towards the central business district. The activities at the stop allowed for vehicles to travel at slow speeds (<20km/h) or grind to a halt. These stoppings, and as well, the fact that most vehicles had their windows open, allowed for adequate observations of in-vehicle situations. Data collected from the observations were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Table 2 shows the days and times the roadside observations were carried out and the number of observations per category. The differences in volumes could be attributed to the higher number of commuters that traveled in the morning towards the central business district, in comparison to the slightly lower traffic volumes recorded for buses in the same direction in the evening. Table 3 shows how compliance and non-compliance for both the policy on face masks and physical distancing were categorized in this study. Larger buses such as Benz Sprinters and Ford transit buses which typically seat four or five commuters on a row were considered compliant where there was a maximum of three commuters and non-compliant where there were more than three people on any row of the vehicle. A sub-category for non-compliance in the use of face masks was as well created after the first day, and termed 'disregard for the policy', to estimate the number of vehicles that had fewer than three people wearing the face masks. Where a maximum of 2 people were seated on a row for smaller buses, or where a maximum of 3 people were seated on a row for larger busesWhere more than 2 people were seated on any row of a smaller bus, or where more than 3 people were seated on any row for larger buses J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8Prior to the field survey, an initial analysis of COVID-19 case counts and mobility trends was done using Google Mobility data and resources from Ourworldindata.com (an open access resource for tracking . The plots were aimed at evaluating possible correlations between the rise in case counts and a change in mobility trends. Figure 2 , shows the comparison between case counts, and mobility trends at specifically transit stops. The plot suggests initial evidence of a possible correlation between the rise in cases and an increase in mobility after the lockdown. Similar correlations exist for retail, recreational areas and workplaces, confirming earlier studies (Gilbert et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020) .Source: authors rendering based on Google mobility trends and data from OurWorldindata.orgThe results of the cross-sectional roadside observation of vehicles travelling through Tech Junction as well suggests that on average, compliance with the guidelines for wearing face masks was 12.6%, and compliance for physical distancing within vehicles was 98.0%. 21.3% of vehicles also registered complete disregard for the policy on wearing face masks, where fewer than three people wore a mask in the vehicle. On average, four commuters per vehicle did not wear face masks, even under the current ministry of health guidelines. A majority of vehicles however, were adherent to the social distancing policy, although adherence was not to suggest a particularly enhanced sense of hygiene in operations.In terms of a total disregard for the policy on face masks, 37 vehicles (12.4%) of vehicles on Tuesday, 43 (30.7 %) of vehicles on Wednesday, and 48 (27.6%) of vehicles on Thursday, had fewer than 3 people wearing a face mask and were considered in total disregard for the policy. Table 4 shows the compliance and non-compliance levels for each of the days. Figure 3 and Figure 4 as well present graphical representations of compliance with the policy on the wearing of masks, and the compliance with guidelines on in-vehicle physical distancing respectively. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fA chi-square test of independence was additionally performed to examine the relation between period of day and the compliance to the use of face masks. The relation between these variables was significant, X 2 (1, N = 859) = 8.296., p = .003973. Higher degrees of compliance in the use of face masks were more likely to be observed in the mornings as compared to evenings. The chi-square statistic with Yates correction was also 7.6919 with a p-value of .005547 significant at p < .01.Another peculiar observation was that, although the guidelines stated commercial vehicle drivers and their attendants were to use face masks, more drivers could be observed using face masks as compared to mates. The job of the ""mate"", which involves the calling out of the trotro's route to attract commuters, could perhaps have been difficult to do with a mask on, since the gear could end up muffling the sound they make in calling commuters. This however presents a concern in the management of COVID-19, since an attendant in their interactions with passengers, could unwittingly become an agent for the transmission of COVID-19, should they contract it themselves.With the increasing body of evidence suggesting the wearing of face masks as an effective approach in curbing the spread of COVID-19 (Howard et al., 2020) , particularly in public transport vehicles (Liu & Zhang, 2020) , there is a need to ensure better compliance with this policy among users and operators, to potentially reduce the likelihood of increased infections in the country.Since cloth masks have been determined to be only marginally ineffective in protecting people from COVID-19, government must direct more of the resources allocated for the country's J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 response towards the production and distribution of masks among citizens. Police must as well be given the mandate to enforce the use of masks through fines to ensure there is compliance with the measure. Additional directives should be established for public transport, that discourage operators from allowing commuters without masks on board, and fines must be applied to individual commuters spotted without masks. This policy on mass masking is important since attest the 96% compliance in the use of face masks in Hong Kong played a contributory role in reducing the rates of COVID-19 infections in the country, as compared to other countries such as Spain, Italy, Germany, France and the US, which had comparable population densities, health care systems and social distancing measures. The current 12.6% compliance with the use of face masks in Ghana suggests the existence of a gap in the implementation of this key preventative measure in reducing the spread of COVID-19.Despite these findings, it is also important to mention some of the limitations of this survey. The first limitation was the fact that it used a cross sectional approach, and could therefore not capture compliance of commuters throughout their journey. Secondly, the choice of a singular location meant that compliance levels in other parts of the city may not be accounted for particularly if attitudes towards the directives were varied in different parts of the city. Finally, the duration of the study was short, and therefore, suggestions made are based on the solutions that have been found to be effective in other places.In conclusion, the policy on physical distancing within vehicles is adhered to, however, the policy on the use of face masks in vehicles requires stricter enforcement. The interventions (lockdowns, physical distancing and wearing of masks) during COVID-19 are designed to reduce the rate of hospitalizations that occur, particularly of critically ill patients, to allow the healthcare systems of countries cope with the disease. For a country such as Ghana that has a doctor to patient ratio of 1:84,813 (Henkens, 2020 ) and a current bed capacity of about 700 beds for COVID-19 (Annoh, 2020) , significant rises in the number of cases can pose a challenge to the management of the disease.The policy for physical distancing requires transport operators to reduce the number of passengers per vehicle by about 30% for most trotros, which has negative financial implications for these operators. The policy which was met initially by apprehension because of these economic loses, however registered a strong degree of compliance (98%) probably as a result of government provided buffers such as a reduction in the price of fuel, the subsidizing of electricity and water bills for all citizens, and agreements between government and the operators union.Regarding the use of face masks within public transport vehicles however, there was complete compliance (fewer than 3 people without face masks) about 12.6% of the time, with mostly partial-compliance observed majority of the time. Complete disregard for the policy on face-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f masks (fewer than 3 people wearing a mask in a vehicle) also occurred about 21.3% of the time. On average, 4 people per vehicle were not wearing the face masks. These results suggest the existence of a significant gap in the implementation of the policy on face masks and the need for much more effective implementation of the policy.It is recommended based on these findings and others Greenhalgh et al., 2020; Howard et al., 2020) that the government directs a significant portion of its COVID-19 resources towards the production and distribution of affordable/reusable face masks for citizens. Government should as well bear the cost of providing free face masks to poorer communities (Tsifodze, 2020) who may be exceptionally vulnerable and perhaps unable to afford them at this time. Further, there should be additional directives given to discourage operators from allowing commuters without masks on board, and as well, the use of fines and policing to enforce these policies. Finally, government should continue to use media platforms to continually sensitize citizens on the benefits of using face masks, to encourage their voluntary use. Together, the implementation of these strategies can reduce the risk levels and possible transmission of COVID-19 on public transport during the period, and help the country contain the spread of the disease.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Ghana,abstract,2020-08-03,08
a3562127e86eb9d40b7791d5f1ce8a8200b31553,Essential Healthcare Services in the Face of COVID-19 Prevention: Experiences from a Referral Hospital in Ethiopia,"In January 2020, a novel virus, the SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the causative agent for a cluster of pneumonia cases initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. 1 SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease now named COVID-19, has subsequently spread throughout the globe. By May 12, 2020, the virus infected more than 4.2 million people and claimed more than 280,000 lives. 2 Health systems in the world are facing a rapidly increasing demand generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Africa is still in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Ebola outbreak is a good example of how outbreaks may disrupt programs such as tuberculosis, HIV, and maternal and child health care, increasing mortality from preventable and treatable conditions. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on health systems, the WHO prepared a guideline on how to continue essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The guideline recommends continuation of essential services like vaccination, chronic disease follow-up, and maternal and child health care, taking into consideration the local context and extent of the outbreak. In areas with a relatively limited number of COVID-19 cases, the health system may have the capacity to maintain routine service delivery in addition to managing COVID-19 cases. 9 Ethiopia reported the first COVID-19 case on March 13, 2020. As of May 11, 2020, 250 cases were reported. Like other countries, Ethiopia started to practice different prevention strategies after confirming the first case. These include partial and selective total lockdown, stopping mass praying, avoiding mass gatherings, and closing schools. Different task forces were established at the national and local levels. The Federal Ministry of Health planned to continue essential services during COVID-19 prevention and management. The Ethiopian essential health service package includes reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child, and adolescent health services; major communicable diseases; noncommunicable diseases; surgical care; and emergency and critical care. 10 The Amhara regional state zones passed different preventive decisions, like stopping public transport and different physical distancing rules. Hospitals across the region stopped elective surgeries and stopped receiving nonemergency and self-referred patients. The hospitals restricted the number of patient attendants and spaced appointments of chronic illnesses. Dessie Referral Hospital, one of the facilities in the region serving more than 8 million people of the catchment area (East Amhara, part of Tigray, and Afar region), applied these measures starting from March 23, 2020. The transport restriction was lifted on April 16, 2020.As of May 12, there was no confirmed case of COVID-19 in the hospital, and a single case was reported from a neighboring Afar region on April 23, 2020. The prevention of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission has been attributed to early and rigorous preventive measures. However, its effect on essential health care remains uninvestigated and not well known. Therefore, this study assessed the effect of prevention measures on essential healthcare services at Dessie Referral Hospital. A better understanding of the effect of preventive measures on the healthcare system will help to design ways of sustaining essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.The study was performed in Dessie Referral Hospital. The hospital is located in Dessie town, South Wollo zone of northeast Ethiopia, 401 km from Addis Ababa. It has different departments such as emergency, ophthalmology, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, child health, medical care, neonatal care, laboratory, psychiatry, pharmacy, and HIV care, and other clinics. The hospital is staffed with more than 800 healthcare and administrative workers. Annually, more than 300,000 patients are seen in the hospital.Ten days after the first case notification on March 23, 2020, Dessie Referral Hospital applied different preventive measures. These measures include reducing the number of patient attendants to one, exempting vulnerable hospital staff from activities, and stopping service for nonemergency and selfreferred patients. In addition, public transport was stopped until April 16, 2020. Isolation and treatment centers were established. Training on COVID-19 prevention and treatment was given for more than 100 hospital staff.We collected data on the number of patients attending different essential healthcare services from the registers in the different services. These include maternal and child health (delivery, gynecology emergencies, neonatal, and pediatric emergencies), medical and surgical chronic illness follow-up, oncology, HIV/AIDS clinic, tuberculosis diagnosis, and medical and surgical emergencies. For each service, the weekly aggregate data were collected from February 24, 2020 to April 19, 2020, and the number of visits was compared before and after the implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures.In all outpatient departments, the number of cases decreased during the implementation of preventive measures. The number of surgical and medical emergency visits decreased by more than 50%. The number of mothers delivering at the hospital remained relatively stable. However, the familyplanning visits decreased by more than 95%. The number of pregnant women coming for antenatal care decreased by more than 50%. Likewise, the neonatal admission and other childhood emergency visits decreased by more than 70%. The units of blood at the hospital blood bank remained relatively stable. However, blood was not used for elective surgeries, and the number of emergency cases decreased. The number of samples sent for diagnosis of tuberculosis by GeneXpert decreased by more than 70% compared with the previous month peak (Table 1) .In all components of the essential health services, the number of cases declined. In addition to the preventive measures, the public fear toward the disease may have contributed to the decreased flow. This may directly or indirectly increase mortality and morbidities from treatable and preventable conditions.The number of patients coming for medical and surgical chronic illness follow-up decreased, and the decline was more pronounced in the surgical outpatient department. This may leave patients without timely evaluation and treatment, predisposing them for different medical and surgical complications. For example, malignancies may further grow and spread; patients with toxic goiter may develop different cardiac and central nervous system complications. In addition, chronic medical illness patients will run out of medications, epilepsy patients may experience seizures, diabetic patients may develop diabetic ketoacidosis, and cardiac and hypertensive patients may develop ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular accidents. As to HIV/AIDS patients, appointments were spaced for all patients including new and those with treatment failure, which makes monitoring of adherence and side effects difficult.The number of visits at the emergency service decreased substantially, particularly for urgent surgery. This may lead to delayed presentation and severe complications.Almost all components of maternal and child health services suffered from a low case flow. The exception was the delivery service, which was relatively stable. This may be because of the strong programs and advocacies against home delivery. The family-planning service was nearly closed, serving less than five patients per week. This may increase the risk of unplanned pregnancies and related complications. The gynecology emergency care includes care for abortion. Preventive measures may have resulted in more patients seeking help from traditional healers, potentially leading to acute and chronic complications of abortion. Both neonatal and other childhood emergency visits have also decreased. Because Dessie Referral Hospital is the only referral hospital in the eastern Amhara region to deliver this service, there is a serious risk that the health of neonates and children needing this service is compromised. The number of tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis also decreased substantially, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis.This study has a number of important limitations. First, it was conducted in a single hospital. However, our findings are likely to reflect the status in the entire region, as all hospitals were applying similar preventive actions. Second, we were not able to collect information on the reasons behind the decrease in patient flow, and whether patients attended other healthcare facilities. This needs further studies with a larger number of health facilities.The case flow of almost all essential healthcare services declined during COVID-19 preventive measures. Preventive procedures should be implemented considering the continuity of essential healthcare delivery. Public restrictions should be selective; emergency cases should still find a way to access hospitals. Early decentralization of chronic illness care to the primary healthcare level should be envisioned.

At the end of June 2020, more than 10 million infected cases had been reported in 188 regions and territories since the first declaration of December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei region, China [1] . The number of identified cases has been increasing rapidly over the world, so different researches and projects faced new recent challenges to forecast the peak of the epidemic to help the governments make decisions for limiting the spreading of the malady. In Egypt, the number of reported cases has increased daily after the first case was declared on 14 February 2020. In June 2020, exceed 60 thousand infections and about three thousand deaths cases had been reported and daily reports were published by the Health and Population Ministry since the starting date of virus till now. The most important statistics of the current situation to combat the emerging coronavirus in Egypt according to ministry reports compared to the world; First, Egypt ranked 77 th the dying toll of the whole number of individuals infected with the virus. The ratio is equivalent to (4.346%) after Lithuania (4.29%) and Guatemala (4.27%). Egypt is preceded by Curacao, America (4.348%). Second, with respect to the recovery rate, the ranking is 184 th and the ratio is equivalent to (27%), followed by Eretria (26.1%). Third, with respect to the terms of total injuries per million people, the ranking is 103 th (682 cases/million), compared to all countries and regions worldwide. Finally, the ranking is 23 th with respect to the number of individuals infected with the virus among 215 regions and countries around the globe [2] .When the Coronavirus emerged in Wuhan city, Egypt began its preventive procedures against this fatal virus as one of the most attractive tourism countries worldwide. Immediately, isolation departments in hospitals of fever were delegated with dealing with such cases. Health and Population Ministry played an important role in raising awareness and monitoring the global epidemiological situation around the clock. Where the new virus was described and clarified to the people at all private clinics and hospitals. The ministry informed all the citizens' country wide to immediately report cases and then refers them to the nearest chest or fever hospital. The ports of Alexandria, Red Sea, Damietta, and Port Said declared the emergency to face the Coronavirus in conjunction with the departments of quarantine in each port. In order to keep people and visitors safe from the danger of this virus, the quarantine officials were present to inspect and examine all arrivals during the ports' reception for boats and ships, particularly those from the countries where the disease was appeared and spread. An operating control room was established in coordination to the quarantine departments to continue checking the arrivals. When a person is suspected to have contacted a patient with coronavirus, he or she will be immediately isolated.About the successful experiences that took place these days, the Egyptian Health Minister announced the success of an injection experiment for critical cases by plasma from recover patients, increasing the recovery rate of discharge in the hospital increased too. The challenge now is how to estimate the peak of a pandemic keeping in mind all the efforts that has been made in all directions.The major challenges associated with COVID-19 is delivering several works to overcome the epidemic and take the necessary precautions needed to educate people and support government efforts that have been made to stabilize the country. The challenge now for researchers all over the world is how to estimate the peak of a virus keeping in mind all the efforts in all directions. In this section, we will review some related works in this direction. The authors in [3] use an Epidemic Calculator that uses (SEIR compartmental model) with Health of Egyptian Ministry of and population released regular reports (14 February 2020 to 11 May 2020). For the highest estimated case, mortally rate (7.7 percent), the number of hospitalized people predicted to peak in mid-June, with a total of 20,126 hospitalized cases of 20,126 individuals and total expected deaths 12,303. The author recommends reinforcement of the Egyptian preventive and control measures to get better the case fatality rate (CFR) and the numeral of cases to the least possible as we reach the peak. It is most important that appropriate quarantine measures retained before the end of June 2020.Machine learning and statistical modeling approaches were used to predict and estimate the ending stage of COVID-19 in Kuwait (especially with time-different infection rates and individual contact numbers) [4] . Results indicate that the estimated number of reproductions in Kuwait is 2.2, with data up to 19 April 2020 and before the repatriation plan. The results indicate that a high contact rate among the population denotes that the epidemic peak value will not reach and the country needs more strict intervention measures. Moreover, the prediction of the peak date and simulation of the variations that could be happening by the social behaviours of Egyptians during Ramadan (the holy month) [5] . Mainly, the peak will depend on the behaviours of people towards social distancing and hygiene measures. The strategies of lockdown in Egypt have a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak, providing more time to help the global health sector to encompass the situation. The Egyptian government should monitor the reported cases daily along with the performance of citizens in the coming month to identify the proper strategies to flatten the curve as much as possible.Numerical approaches and logistic model are used in [6] for COVID-19 analysis. Researchers suggest three recognized numerical methods (Euler's method, Runge-Kutta method of order two (RK2) and of order four (RK4)) for solving such equations about the Global health care and suggest important notes. Numerical results may use to guess the number susceptible to infection, recovered, and quarantined individuals in the future to support the foreign efforts to develop their intervention services and further prevention.In [7] , processing sustainable development was studied using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Therefore, using one of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, the community data handling system (GMDH) type of neural network used binary classification modelling. The proposed model was developed as a case study in China's Hubei province. Some important parameters, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, parsed as the input data set, and picked the number of confirmed cases as the output data set for 30 days.The proposed model of binary classification provides greater capacity for accuracy in predicting the reported cases. Furthermore, regression analysis and the pattern of reported cases relative to the variations of the daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature) have been performed. The results showed that relative humidity and the maximum daily temperature had the greatest impact on the actual cases. The relative humidity in the confirmed case study was 77.9% on average, positively affected, and the average daily temperature was 15.4 o C on average, affected negatively the real cases.In [8] compares the COVID-19 data from India against several countries as well as key states in the US with a main outbreak, and it is found that the first reproduction number R0 for India is in the expected range of 1.4-3.9. Meanwhile, the ring of growth of infections in India is very close to that in Washington and California. Exponential and classical models of susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) depend on current data used to render frequent short-ring and long-term predictions. From the SIR model, it is estimated that India will enter stability by the end of May 2020 with the final size of epidemic near to 13,000. Though, if India enters the group transmission point, the approximation will be invalid. The effect of social distancing is also measured by analyzing data from various geographical locations, once again with the presumption of no group transmission.Researchers and communities are provided new AI and huge data applications to get better the COVID-19 epidemic situation, and also further studies in stopping COVID-19 outbreak to control the virus situation [9] . The paper presented a survey on the state-of the-art solutions in the action against the COVID-19 pandemic. In previous studies, researchers depended on various proposed methods and analysed the results based on some of the parameters and models.The main contributions of our study are as follows: 1-Using machine learning and the best regression analysis model to predict the rate of spread of COVID-19 for a month in Egypt. 2-Presenting mathematical models to predict the spread of COVID-19 in Egypt estimate the epidemic size and predict an ending phase of the epidemic.A. Study Area Study Area Study Area Study Area Egypt is an African country found in the Eastern Mediterranean vicinity in line with the classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) and categorized as a lower-middle-profits country with respect to a World Bank category. The total inhabitance of Egypt is almost 100 million individuals and almost 8% of them are exceeding 60 years old. About 1.7% of the entire inhabitance lives under the national poorness line. Systems of health in Egypt, like African countries, have low resources to confront the pandemic. Egypt features a physician density of 0.79 physicians/1000 individuals and a single bed capacity of 1.6 beds/1000 individuals. The demographic structure of Egypt highlights a particular nature that varies from other European and Asian countries where the middle age of the Egyptians is 24.6 years (the middle age for Chinese is 38.4 years). As they were 4.23% of Egyptian individuals have almost 65 years. The infected countries' experiences (in Europe and Asia) appeared that elderly individuals over 60 years and individuals who have weakening maladies are most defenceless to genuine grades of COVID-19. In this manner, the Egyptian young may act as a defensive line to constrain the spread of the widespread around the world.Data sources Data sources Data sources Daily, prevalence data of COVID-19 is reported by the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population [10] and www.ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data. Figure (1) presents the COVID-19 confirmed, and mortal cases distribution in Egypt for the period from 15 February to 15 June 2020. It is easy to observe the spread is exponential growth, which needs to be controlled. Its future epidemiological progression is still ambiguous as it spreads randomly.Regression Models Regression Models Regression Models Regression model analysis is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms [11] . A variety of regression models is available including linear and non-linear forms, namely Multiple Linear Regression. Some of these models follow the parametric or the non-parametric approaches for statistical inference. The regression analysis technique is a kind of modeling technique used in epidemiologic research to estimate relationships among sets of variables. ''The regression analysis techniques are a set of ML methods that allow us to forecast continuous results variable (Y) based on one or multiple predictor variables (X). It assumes a linear relationship among the results and the predictor variables''. Numbers of regression analysis technique s have been applied to forecast the accumulated confirmed COVID-19 within (15 days), the final size of epidemic cases, and the final time of epidemic in Egypt. In this proposed, we consider the following models:It is used to epidemic model cases in which starts growth slowly and then accelerates speedily without bound, or where decrease begins speedily and then the speed reduce to get closer until reach to zero. The equation that describes this model is:(1) A polynomial term turns a linear regression model into a curve but it still qualifies as a linear model. The polynomial models quadratic, third-degree, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, and sixth-degree were used in those situations. The n th order polynomial model in one variable is given by the equation:(2) Where (n=2,….,6) represents the degree of the models. The coefficients ɑ 1 , ɑ 2 … ɑ n are called the parameters of regression analysis.The logit model or (logistic model) is a technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics. The logit model is a regression model that is widely used in epidemiology mathematical models to estimate the growth rate of the epidemic [12] . The model assumes an exponential growth at the beginning of the epidemic, followed by a steady increase and finally ending with a declining growth rate. The logit model is presented by equation (3) Where and t = 0 , assuming A, k > C 0 .Hence, if C is an accumulated number of cases, C r defined as the rate of infection cases, K is the final epidemic size, t is the time, is the growth rate reaches its maximum when . To fit the maximum number of confirmed cases (peak number of cases) of the infected population C Peak and coefficient, t Peak and are defined by the formulas.If C 1 , C 2 … C f represent the number of cases at times t 1 , t 2 ,…, t final , then the final size predictions of the epidemic based on these data are K 1 , K 2 ,…, K f , the predicted final epidemic size is presented by the equation (8) by iterated Shanks transformation [15] .The logit model presented in equation (4) contains three coefficients: K, C r , and A which should be determined by regression analysis because of the nonlinearity of the model.The Correlation coefficient means the force of a linear relationship between two variables. According to Karl Pearson, the coefficient of correlation is a measure or degree of the linear relationship between two random variables X and Y. The values range between -1.0 and 1.0.The correlation coefficient is denoted by ""r"". To find r is calculated the Pearson product-correlation with the formula as: (9) Here, when calculating the correlation coefficient γ between the date and number of real cases in Egypt. There are some predictions that are given as: o r = -1, there is an inverse relationship between input and output variables (means if the input variable increases the output variable decrease and vice versa).• Residuals.Residuals are the measure of the quality of fit straight lines of the suggested models. It is the difference between the observed values of the response variable (Y) and the value of the proposed model. The following formula is used to calculate the residuals:• Adjusted-R 2In this suggested study, we have calculated both simple and adjusted R 2 to know which the extra terms n and d terms get pitter the predictive power of proposed methods. Adjusted R 2 for polynomial regression is defined as the following formula:Where n is the number of observations in training datasets and d is the degree of polynomials in regression models. SS residual represents the sum of the squared residuals from the regression and SS total represents the sum of the squared difference from the mean of the dependent variables.In this proposed study, we have taken a real dataset for the COVID-19 after the outbreak of the epidemic in Egypt. The first case of the COVID 2019 epidemic was found in Egypt on 15 February 2020 after that, things escalated in March, several cases were reported all over the country at the end of March caused of loss of human lives. Although the Prime Minister issued in the 4 th quarter of March a package of prudential decisions, there was a closure of all shops and establishments that provide entertainment or recreation, as well as the suspension of studies because of the number of students in schools and universities, is approximately 25 million. However, the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt is growing in exponential form from 15 February 2020 to 15 June 2020.The discussed machine learning approaches output the possible number of cases for the next 15 days across the world. In this study, illustrates the predicted trend of the COVID-19 using different regression approaches were utilized to fit the confirmed cumulative cases in Egypt from the start of the outbreak on 15 February 2020 until 15 June 2020 and predict short term forecast to help the government for prevention measures in Egypt. We have been utilized seven regression analysis models namely exponential, quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, sixth degree, exponential polynomial, and logit respectively for the COVID-19 dataset. Machine learning approaches are implemented using the python library.First of all, the correlation coefficient calculate between the date and number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 spread up of Egypt from 15th February to 15th June 2020 to test the correlation between them. The correlation coefficient is γ = 0.8435, which is very close to 1, indicating that there is a strong statistical correlation between the two variables, date and the number of confirmed cases spread of COVID 2019. The regression models' approach for epidemic analysis are trained and after that tested on real data using the date and the number of confirmed cases as the label for the corresponding day presented in the above table 1. Egypt datasets were separated into training datasets from 15-February-2020 to 31-May-2020 and testing dataset from 1-June to 15-June 2020.In this regard, we have used exponential, quadratic, third-degree, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, and sixth-degree polynomial regression models. In these proposed regression models, we have used independent variable and dependent variable . From training dataset was calculated the coefficient for the equation (1&2) for all regression models as shown in table 2 and represent them in the equations below as the following:We show below in figure (2a) the results of actual cases of the proposed fitted regression analysis-based models namely: exponential, quadratic, third-degree, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, sixth-degree polynomial, and logit growth for the training datasets of the COVID-19 in Egypt from (12-Feb to 31-May). As shown in figure (2b) a comparison of the actual results and predicted results of the proposed models: exponential, quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, sixth degree polynomial and, logit growth for the testing dataset of the COVID-19 from (1-Jun to 15-Jun). We observed from the figures that the result of the proposed fourth-degree, fifth-degree, and sixth-degree polynomial methods are very close to actual results. Fig. 2 (b) Comparison of the real case and the predicted models: exponential, quadratic, third degree, fourth-degree, results of the proposed models: exponential, quadratic, third-Fifth-degree and sixth-degree polynomial degree, fourth-degree, fifth-degree and, sixth-degree polynomial on the testing dataset of Egypt COVID-19. In regression analysis, residuals play an important role in the COVID-19 outbreak data analysis in Egypt. All the residuals for the proposed methods exponential, quadratic, third-degree, fourth-degree, fifth-degree and, sixth-degree polynomials are calculated and plotted as in Figure 3 . We observed that the exponential, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, and sixth-degree polynomial regression models give strong patterns. Finally, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show that the better-fitted results and residuals were the exponential, fourth-degree, fifth-degree and, sixth-degree polynomial, respectively. Therefore, the proposed models: exponential, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, sixthdegree gave excellent results to predict the next 15 days. The fourth-degree regression model has given excellent result to predict the next one month as shown in figure (4) , so it is very useful for future prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt for one month so, the government will take a good decision.We utilized the logit growth regression approach to fit the confirmed cumulative cases in Egypt from the start of the outbreak on 15 February 2020 until 15 June 2020 and represent on the training dataset and compared the prediction with the testing data as shown in figure (5) .From the below figure (6), we show that the estimated final of the epidemic t final was probably on 8 Sep 2020. The Shanks a transformation equation was used for the predicted of the final epidemic size K. It appears that the prediction of the logit model reaches to the final size almost at 1.6676E 05 cases. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table ( 3) represents the coefficients A, K, and C r of equation (4) and the phases of the epidemic time that were estimated by all regression analysis models. Notes: coronavirus affected by phases as shown in figure (6) 1-The first phase: start case infection and slow growth of the epidemic.3-Third phase: steady-state and slow growth (peak) 4-Fourth phase: start decrease.The simulation was carried out the parameters estimated namely: start phase of the epidemic, the peak date of epidemic, the start of ending phase of the epidemic and the root mean square error. Table 4 the calculated results of the Sum of Square regression (SSR), residual square (R 2 ) and, adjusted-(R 2 ) for all proposed models, which highlights the best fitting of the suggested models.A forecast of COVID-19 spread in Egypt was carried out using various statistics and machine learning modeling approaches. The forecast was based on the data from 15 February 2020 until 15 June 2020. These models also predicted the outbreak of the COVID-19 in Egypt for the next 15 days, one month, the final size of the infected cases, and the final time of the epidemic. Here, we have found out that the best of the proposed models namely exponential, fourth-degree, the fifth-degree, and sixth-degree polynomial are strong residual and prediction for the next 15 days and also the fourth-degree model has given an excellent prediction for one month. These models are very useful for the Egyptian government for managing the COVID-19 outbreak for the next months. The study aimed to investigate and assess the effectiveness of preventive measures of the government of Egypt to control the spread of COVID-19. In this study, by applying the logit growth regression model to the daily reported cases of COVID-19, we have estimated that the peak epidemic in 22-June 2020 could possibly reach the final time in 8-September 2020. Of course, this type of peak forecasting would contain the essential uncertainty due to the possibility of some big changes in the social and natural (climate) situations. Moreover, our result suggests that the epidemic of COVID-19 in Egypt would not end so quickly. ",Egypt,abstract,2020-08-25,08

In the same vein, another deterministic model was designed to analyze the 16 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea [31, 63] . The impact of the timing of 17 control measures associated with a reduction of the transmission rate and diagnostic de- 18 lays on the outbreak size and duration was also assessed [67] . Simulation of the model 19 reveals that the lack of personal hygiene and targeted control measures were the reasons 20 of the outbreak spread quickly. However, it was reported that strengthening personal 21 hygiene ability of susceptible and quickly isolating or monitoring close contacts are ef-22 fective measures to control the disease [63] . Furthermore, partial correlation analysis 23 shows that the infectivity and proportion of the asymptomatic infected cases have much 24 influence on the disease spread [1] . 25 26 Since its emergence in December 2019, numerous models have been designed and used 27 to determine effective ways to combat the pandemic [5, 18, 19, 27, 28, 37, 42, 66 ]. In The distinguishing aspect of the current work is the emphasis on the COVID-19 dy-population for compliance, and to implement existing non-pharmaceutical control mea- 23 sures, while strengthening the recovery strategy of the economy and providing support 24 to those who suffer the most during the lockdown. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. The model is formulated 3 in Section 2. Section 3 is devoted to ""materials and results"", including estimation of 4 the parameters and some analytical results (such as the asymptotic stability of the The total human population at time t, denoted by N (t), is divided into six mutuallyexclusive compartments, namely susceptible S(t), exposed E(t), asymptomatic infectious A(t), symptomatic infectious I(t), isolated/hospitalized J(t), and recovered individuals R(t). Thus,This sub-division of the total population is consistent with South Africa's guidelines for 11 isolation from COVID-19 exposure and infection, which states that: 'Though isolation 12 is reserved for persons who are already sick and/or have tested positive for COVID-19 13 infections, it may in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, include [53]:• Isolation at a personal home known as self-isolation. This is the preferred option, 15 subject to the person meeting the self-isolation criteria. 16 • Isolation in a health facility or at a designated isolation facility. People who cannot 17 self-isolate at home should be considered for admission to such a facility.' 18 As far as the compartments of human populations are concerned, we use an extension 19 of the standard SEIR model [26] , modified by the incorporation of the A and J classes 20 to account for asymptomatic transmission and isolation/hospitalization. However, re-21 search works [10, 17, 52, 63] , specifically the recent study in [10] The population of susceptible individuals is decreased following infection with COVID-7 19, which can be acquired at the rate (force of infection)in which the first term expresses direct transmission, while the second term accounts for 9 the indirect (environmental contamination-based) transmission. Here, the parameter 10 β(t) is the time-dependent effective contact rate (contact, per person per unit time,capable of leading to COVID-19 infection). Due to the introduction of social-distancing 12 policy (e.g., lockdown or stay-at-home), it is reasonable to assume that the contact rate 13 will be a decreasing function of time. Unlike the exponential decay function used in 14 [18], we consider the following slow-decaying continuous function β(t):where τ 0 is the time for the onset of the community lockdown. The parameter ω > 0 is 16 a measure of the compliance of the population with the interventions, mostly the social- 17 distancing, and also the wearing in public of face-masks that has been introduced as of 18 1 May 2020 in South Africa. The larger ω is, the faster the contact rate β(t) decays to 19 β 1 , which represents the desired contact rate for COVID-19 to be controlled. individuals to the asymptomatic-infectious (at the rate rσ) and symptomatic-infectious 1 (at the rate (1 − r)σ) classes, where 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 is the proportion of exposed individuals The population of asymptomatic infectious individuals is increased by the progression 5 of infected individuals from the exposed class (at the rate rσ). It decreases by isolation 6 at the rate γ 1 ), and by recovery (at the rate τ 1 ). This givesThe population of symptomatic infectious individuals (with clinical symptoms of COVID-8 19) in I class increases, following the development of clinical symptoms by individuals 9 in the exposed class, at the rate (1 − r)σ. This population decreases by isolation (at the 10 rate γ 2 ), recovery (at the rate τ 2 ), and COVID-19 induced mortality (at the rate δ 1 ).Hence,The population of individuals that are isolated or hospitalized (J(t)) is generated by the 13 isolation of infectious individuals in the asymptomatic class (at the rate γ 1 ) and those with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 (at the rate γ 2 ). It is decreased by recovery (at 1 the rate τ 3 ) and disease-induced death (at the rate δ 2 ). Hence,The recovered population is generated by the recovery of individuals in A, I and J 3 classes at the rates τ 1 , τ 2 and τ 3 , respectively. This gives:Infectious individuals in the A, I and J classes contaminate the environment with 5 COVID-19 at the rates ξ 1 , ξ 2 and ξ 3 , respectively. The virus is cleared from the con-6 taminated environment at the rate υ. Hence,In summary, the COVID-19 transmission model is given by the following system of 8 nonlinear differential equations (the flow diagram of the model is depicted in Figure 2 , 9 and the associated parameters and state variables are described in Table 2 ):Like in the case of many other models for COVID-19 [18, 42] , the model (2) assumes 11 homogeneous mixing, and recovery induced permanent natural immunity against future 12 infections.The system is solved subject to the following (generalized) nonnegative initial conditions 16 17 Adding the first six equations of the model (2) gives: Effective contact rate before the community lockdown. β 1Targeted effective contact rate for disease control. ωMeasure of social-distancing effectiveness.Isolation rates of asymptomatic (symptomatic) infectious individuals.Modification parameters for reduction in infectiousness of asymptomatic (isolated) individuals in comparison to symptomatic infectious individuals. η 3The per capita rate of people who interact with the environment daily. τ 0Starting day of community lockdown.Recovery rates of asymptomatic (symptomatic) (isolated) infectious individuals. rσ ((1 − r)σ) Progression rate of exposed individuals to asymptomatic (symptomatic) infectious classes.Disease-induced death rates for symptomatic (isolated) infectious individuals.Contamination rates of environment by asymptomatic (symptomatic) (isolated) infectious individuals. To the question 'will COVID-19 ever disappear?' several sources suggest that the sce- Care Units (ICUs) when the worse case scenario comes. We will fit the model using 26 South African data and predict the evolution of the epidemic. To this end, we start the 27 next subsection by estimating the epidemiological parameters of the model (2) relevant 28 to COVID-19 data for South Africa obtained from [9] . lowed by a nationwide lockdown from 26 March 2020. We, therefore, take the time of By fitting the model (using mortality data), we take the effective contact rate β = β 0 1 before the lockdown to be 0.492 per day. The desired minimum contact rate β to which 2 the contact rate should decay is fitted to be β = β 1 = 0.166 per day (so as to achieve 3 the target of bringing the control reproduction number to a value below unity). Since 4 the incubation period for COVID-19 ranges from 5-6 days [42] , with about 70% of ex-5 posed individuals becoming infected, we assume the rate at which exposed individuals 6 become asymptomatically infectious to be rσ = 0.6 per day, so that the rate at which 7 exposed individuals becomes symptomatic is (1 − r)σ = 0.4 per day. It should be noted 8 that determining the portion associated with the spread of COVID-19 by asymptomatic 9 individuals is a challenge, as highlighted in [1, 24] . It is assumed that there is a short for COVID-19 to range from 6-14 days, so we set the rates at which asymptomatic, 15 symptomatic infectious and isolated individuals recover from COVID-19 (τ 1 , τ 2 and τ 3 ) 16 to be τ 1 = 1/6, τ 2 = 1/10 and τ 3 = 1/14 per day, respectively. 17 18 While some studies assumed the modification parameters (η 1 and η 2 ) for the relative Contaminated environment is reported to be a substantial route for the transmission of 27 SARS-CoV-2. This is the essence of the campaign to disinfect surfaces, buttons, hands, 28 knobs and other places touched often, apart from scientific reports such as [10, 17, 52] .In fact, in South Africa, a number of hospitals have been closed and the scaling down The cumulative number of disease-induced deaths denoted by D = D(t) will be estimated from the following differential equation that results from recording death contributions in the model (2):We now fit the model (2) using data obtained from [9] for South Africa for the period of 2 three months (21 March to 29 June 2020). Given the inability to realistically measure 3 the size of the asymptomatically-infectious pool, which makes most of COVID-19 case 4 data suspect, we chose to fit the model with the mortality data (which is more reliable). 5 The estimated, assumed and fitted parameters are tabulated in Table 3 (see Table 5 for 6 some sensitivity analysis). Figure 3 shows a reasonably good fit for total actual deaths implemented. With K 1 = γ 1 + τ 1 , K 2 = γ 2 + τ 2 + δ 1 and K 3 = τ 3 + δ 2 , the vector F, of The Jacobian matrices F of F and V of V are computed at the point E with respect to Simple computations show that R c can be rewritten as the sum of two main contribu-8 tions (viz. humans and environment) as follows:where,It should be mentioned that we do not make the substitution S(0)/N (0) = 1 in order 11 to link the control reproduction number R c to the effective reproduction number intro-12 duced in Remark 2 below. The effective reproduction numbers for some countries with COVID-19 cases are given 1 on Table 4 as of 13 March 2020. (2), the continuum of disease-free equilibria is both a stable set and 15 a global attractor. 16 Theorem 4 If R c < 1, then the continuum of disease-free equilibria of the model (2) 17 is globally asymptotically stable in the positively-invariant and absorbing compact set Ω 18 defined in (5).Proof. It was proved that the system (2) is a dynamical system in the biologically feasible region Ω which contains the set [DFE]. Define on Ω the candidate Lyapunov function:where the positive constants a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , a 3 will be determined shortly. Then the direc-20 tional derivativeL (where a dot represents derivative with respect to t) of L in the 21 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f direction of the vector-function defined by the right-hand side of the system (2), (i.e. 1 the derivative along the trajectories), is given bySince S/N ≤ 1 and S ≤ N 0 in Ω, some lengthy computations lead the following estimate 4 ofL:The constants a 0 > 0, a 1 > 0, a 2 > 0, a 3 > 0 and a 4 > 0 are then chosen to be the unique solution of the following algebraic system:This simplifies the above estimate ofL intȯwhere the control reproduction number is given in (7). where S ∞ is the unknown final size of the epidemic to be determined. 14 where β = β 0 or β 1 , x 0 = x(0) and the inverse matrix V −1 was used in the com-15 putation of R c . 16 To simplify the final size relation (13), it is usual to set some of the initial conditions 17 to be equal to zero [2, 42] . For the analysis in the next section, Theorem 5 will be used as follows. The number 21 α := 1 − S ∞ S 0 , called the ""attack rate or ratio"" of the epidemic, is a measure of its sever-22 ity, apart from the number S ∞ of susceptible individuals who escaped the epidemic [4].The larger the attack rate is, the more severe the epidemic is, in terms of the cumulative Table 3 .

Table 3 with various values of the compliance parameter ω.study strongly suggests that absolute caution should be exercised before terminating the 1 current strict social-distancing protocols or lowering the COVID-19 alerts, so as to avoid Table 3 . The effect of isolation of individuals infected with COVID-19 is monitored by simulating 2 the model (2) using parameter values given in Table 3 Table 3 .as shown on Figure 9 (B). Furthermore, the computed attack rate (α) for β = β 0 is found Table 3 . These results confirm that the infection is more severe for high contact rate β. Notice 6 that, for the case when β = β 0 , the total number of COVID-19 cases at the end of the 7 pandemic is obtained to be S 0 − S ∞ = 50, 500, 000, which is more than three times the 8 number obtained for β = β 1 (15,000,000) (see Figure 9 ). Thus, our predictions in terms Table 3 . The parameters with significant negative and 1 positive PRCC values are seen from Table 5 .

[2] [3] [4] [5] Globally, as of April 30, 2020, there have been 3,090,445 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 217,769 related deaths giving a case mortality rate of 7.0%. 6 The pandemic took less than 100 days to exceed one million confirmed cases by April 2, 2020. 7 The disease was first diagnosed in Nigeria on 27 February 2020. As of April 30, 2020, diagnostic tests had been conducted on 15,759 samples with 1932 confirmed cases. Three hundred and nineteen patients had made a full recovery and 35 had died, in test positivity, recovery, and case fatality rates of 12.3%, 16.3% and 1.8%, respectively, throughout the country. 8 Globally governments have attempted to curtail the pandemic and curb its spread; with national lockdown, social distancing, regular handwashing, stay at home and self-isolation policies. 9 These policies were captured in the WHO 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, an objective of which is ""to stop further transmission of 2019-nCoV within China and to other countries, and to mitigate the impact of the outbreak in affected countries."" 10 As the world comes to terms with this pandemic we begin to wonder if there anything that could be done better to minimize morbidity and mortality associated with the next pandemic. Currently with more than three million cases and 200,000 deaths, there is a need to review and identify what strategies and activities could be started, continued or stopped, or continued more effectively and efficiently to minimize the impact of the next pandemic. This paper will discuss the strategies that were applied in Nigeria and those that should be applied in the future. 11 Meetings were held daily by the EOC and meetings were held in individual states to curtail the outbreak. Hospitals were assessed and activated as isolation and treatment centers, laboratories were equipped to test for the virus using PCR technology and staff were trained to manage cases, test patients, track contacts, and document findings.Despite all these measures, at present, the number of cases continues to rise. This has led us to review our current practice to identify what can be put in place to prevent similar epidemics in the coming years. In addition, we present some immediate strategies that could reduce COVID-19 infection.Early in any outbreak, there is need to conduct a quick and immediate assessment of resources and current activities. This assessment should appraise available resources, and all relevant public health activities and outputs. and what lessons can we learn from elsewhere? These questions will also analyze the strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the control system and processes. This will provide background information for the next phase of programing.Beyond a National Incident Management Team (NIMT), there is a need to concurrently establish Regional or State Incident Management Teams (R/SIMT). Each team will include the Regional/State Epidemiologist, highly experienced Laboratory Manager, Communication Officer, Chief Medical Officer of a reference facility or tertiary hospital in the region/state, and a Finance Officer/manager. At the national level, a National IMT will comprise a Director, Presidential Task Force; Director General, National Centre for Disease Control; Director, Emergency and Preparedness; Project Manager/Consultant; Communication Officer and Research Lead. These incident managers must be quickly constituted, mobilized and operationalized proactively to ensure immediate roll out of protocols, guidelines and standard operating procedures like those developed in Nigeria by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). 11Capacity development of all members of the IMT is critical to ensure the quality of services provided, safety of the frontline workers and health of patients. All IMTs should be trained on developed guidelines, protocols, standards of practice, and algorithms. All training should be virtual to minimize physical contact and traveling. This training should be facilitated by highly qualified persons from international organizations where available and relevant university departments in the country, region or state. In-person training should be reduced to the barest minimum. 12 Oleribe et al Dovepress submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of General Medicine 2020:13To control an outbreak, screening and testing must be available. Where the resources are available, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) empowered Laboratories should be established in each region/state. These can be established in partnership with the governments of the regions/states and corporate organizations. Regions/States with the capacity should establish one laboratory per county/Senatorial District. Eventually, the development of antigen-antibody testing can minimize the use of (PCR) techniques which are usually expensive and require a high level of technical skill. As quickly as possible, states should move from facility-based PCR to community-based antigen-antibody testing using rapid test kits. Each outbreak should be an opportunity to develop the capacity of local partners to create new testing centers and build the capacity of healthcare workers to screen and test.To support the testing and diagnosis facilities, Sample Collection Centers (SCC) should be established in all communities across the nation. Simple test strips should be introduced as quickly as possible for screening purposes, and positive samples referred for confirmation at the nearest specialist center.Funds are needed to manage outbreaks particularly to protect the vulnerable communities. 13 Budgetary allocations from the national government can jumpstart the process. However, both the IMTs and control organizations should be fast in seeking and obtaining funds from non-government sources. Donors can reprogram funds towards the management of the outbreak. Regions, states, corporate organizations and individuals can fund the establishment of laboratories, procurement of test kits, training of healthcare workers, engagement of volunteers and even establishment of isolation and quarantine centers.Beyond screening and stand-alone testing sites, outbreaks like COVID-19 should have integrated management systems. This will involve the establishment of integrated Diagnosis, Isolation and Treatment (DIT) centers in all Regions/States where none exist. The goal would be to have a DIT center within a 10-km radius. This can be started with one per region/ state. Self-isolation should be discouraged, and exposed people should be asked to be isolated in government-designated DIT locations. New DITs could be located in community halls, open spaces, stadia, hotels, etc. This strategy is designed to take the outbreak (like COVID-19) out of the hospitals. Taking the outbreak out of the hospitals will allow the secondary and tertiary hospitals to manage the conventional illnesses and diseases common in each locality. Each DIT can have from 50 to 200 beds to accommodate isolation cases. DIT centers will decentralize testing, isolate and manage cases, as well as relieve the burden on hospital facilities across the nations of the world.To overcome a global outbreak, healthcare workers should be mobilized and utilized strategically to achieve the agenda of expanding testing, preventing infection, and forming effective partnerships in the community. This requires mobilization of volunteer healthcare workers and other support-staff from relevant organizations. Doctors, nurses, pharmacies, laboratory scientists, community health workers, and support staff should be mobilized to volunteer as frontline workers to manage the DIT centers in each location. More volunteers will be placed where they are needed most. Volunteers should be managed and supervised by the relevant IMTs and trained virtually. Trained volunteers and healthcare workers should be empowered and supported to train others, scale up and scale out services. They will also help to screen at community level, track contacts of confirmed cases and participate in facility readiness assessment. Finally, they should be engaged in community education and information management.Information management is critical to outbreak management and control. Using relevant technological applications and platforms, up to date information on an outbreak locally and nationally can be monitored. Also, through surveys such as the BroadReach Vantage 14 , an assessment can be made of the impact of the intervention, community knowledge base, and attitude and practice of people.Confirmed cases can be used to conduct trials to understand causality analysis, what is effective, and experiment with different antiviral/antibiotics/antiparasitic combinations to identify what works best among the population. It should be possible to collect data about complications, length of stay in hospital, antigen and antibody conversion rates and factors that influence them; and investigate factors associated with various degrees of infection and manifestations. Publications will promote global information sharing and allow nations just beginning to experience the outbreak to know what works to help curb the spread of the virus.The various strategies cannot stand alone but can be executed concurrently based on the identified and agreed timelines. There should be daily virtual meetings by the IMT to assess progress and make mid-course corrections; weekly virtual meetings to generate new ideas and review weeklong activities while finalizing the next week project; weekly publications of activities, finances, and lessons learned; and weekly M&E questionnaire completion and analysis.Active use of everyday data gathered during the process of the outbreak investigation, the clinical presentation and epidemiology of the disease can be readily characterized including the use of data science, projections/modelling and data visualization.The Nigerian government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by various measures affecting the population and the creation of necessary national teams to provide structure and leadership. These teams interfaced with the country to discuss the plan for treatment and control of the pandemic in Nigeria. In the recovery from COVID-19 medical authorities need to integrate their responses in a coordinated and streamlined way to prevent silo or vertical reactions to crises. Lateral and coordinated thinking is required. The lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic need to be implemented in policy documents to ensure readiness to prevent future, similar world crises. We need to build the relevant structures and partnerships to ensure we fight locally and win globally.",Nigeria,abstract,2020-08-04,08
e0b33b8ef88f34473040a7d2f6601fb5f3eaffc1,Testing the nexus between stock market returns and inflation in Nigeria: Does the effect of COVID-19 pandemic matter?,"Given the palpable fear generated by the threat of COVID-19 pandemic and the bearish sentiments of stock investors, this study represents one of the first efforts towards testing the effect of COVID-19 on the stock market returns-inflation relationship. Specifically, the study investigates the stock market returns-inflation nexus by controlling for the effect of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria from February 27, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Using the estimation procedures based on the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity type models (GARCH (1,1), the GJR-GARCH), and the accounting innovation tests, our results show that increases volatility and distorts the positive relationship between inflation and stock market returns, which tends to negate the Fisher's hypothesis. In addition, the results reveal that the negative effects of COVID-19 on the market returns and its disruption to the stock market returns-inflation relationship may not die away rapidly considering that the duration of the pandemic is unknown. Further, these findings are validated by the innovation accounting tests. Therefore, the study presents to policymakers the consequences of COVID-19 and the urgent need to strengthen the market through collaborative efforts.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) code named COVID-19, which started in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China around December 2019 has become a global pandemic, expanding rapidly across the planet with infection cases and confirmed death rates nearing five million and four hundred thousand respectively as at May18, 2020 (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020). Apart from the palpable fear that the COVID-19 pandemic has created around the world, it has disrupted global economic activities in a manner that has never been seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Over a third of the global population is currently under some forms of lockdown, border closures, and extensive flight cancellations creating extreme disruptions to business and tourism (Ayittey, Ayittey, Chiwero, Kamasah, & Dzuvor, 2020) . The economic consequences of the novel coronavirus include interruptions to global supply and demand chains and corresponding local food shortages, depressed asset prices, and extreme uncertainty for both multinational and local businesses (Yousef, 2020) .Of particular importance regarding the economic impact of COVID 19 is the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on stock market volatility in the presence of bubble prices (inflation). This is because, as the uncertainties triggered by the pandemic continues, the effectiveness of policy measures coupled with negative investors sentiments and rising prices are likely to affect long-term investment decisions.Regarding inflationary pressures, however, the Fisher (1930) hypothesis otherwise known as the ""Fisher effect"" states that the expected nominal stock market returns should be equal to expected inflation plus the real rate of return. In effect, the hypothesis elucidates that equity stocks represent claims against real assets of a business; and as such, may serve as a hedge against inflation (Sokpo, Iorember, & Usar, 2018) . If this assertion holds, then investors could sell their financial assets in exchange for real assets when the expected rise in inflation is pronounced. In such a situation, Ioannides, Katrakilidis, and Lake (2005) posits that nominal stock prices should fully reflect expected inflation and the relationship between these two variables should be positively correlated ex-ante. In the view of Lawal (2016) , the argument of stock market returns serving as a hedge against inflation may also mean that investors are fully compensated for the rise in the general price level through corresponding increases in nominal stock market returns and thus, the real returns remain unchanged.However, it was not too long that divergent opinions emerged challenging the Fisher hypothesis. In the 1970s, investors found that the Fisher theory faltered in the short and intermediate terms, as stock market returns were negatively related to inflation (Sharpe, 2002) . Also, empirical studies by Bodie (1976) , Nelson (1976) , Fama and Schwert (1997) , and Modigliani and Cohn (1979) all adduced empirical evidence to show an inverse relationship between stock market returns and inflation. In 1981, Fama came up with a counter-theory known as the Proxy Hypothesis. The Proxy hypothesis commonly known as the generalized Fama proxy hypothesis argued that the assertion of a positive relationship between stock market returns and inflation was spurious, suggesting that stock market returns do not hedge against inflation.The literature on the nexus between stock market returns and inflation is well documented. Most recently, Alqaralleh (2020) in a study on the nexus between stock market returns and inflation for the G7 countries; revisited evidence based on nonlinear ARDL, established that expansionary period increase stock market returns more than contractionary period, thereby supporting the Fisher effect.Also supporting the Fisher hypothesis, Kwofie and Ansah (2018) examined the effect of inflation on stock market returns in Ghana and found a positive long-run relationship between inflation and stock market returns. Other studies that support the Fisher effect include Li, Balcilar, Gupta, and Chang (2016) Arising from the above and given the palpable fear generated by the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, this study represents one of the first efforts towards testing the effect of COVID-19 on the stock market returns-inflation relationship. That is, to determine whether stock market returns hedge against inflation or not in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic? Specifically, the study aims to revisit the stock market returns-inflation relationship, controlling for the effect of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria using the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity type models (Standard GARCH and GJR-GARCH), and the Accounting Innovation tests.The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 focuses on data generation and method of the analysis. Section 3 discusses the empirical results and Section 4 concludes the study with policy recommendations. where SMR denotes stock market returns, ASI denotes all shares index, t denotes time period.Financial time series such as the stock market returns have three features that make modeling and analysis with it different from other normal time series. These include; volatility clustering, leptokurtic distribution, and leverage effect. For example, during a financial shock or crisis such as the one triggered by COVID-19, the leverage effect (or the asymmetric quality of financial time series data) is accentuated, thereby making it impossible to model volatility by normal means, rather, time-varying volatility models such as the ARCH or GARCH type models are used (Rastogi, 2014; Yousef, 2020) . The approach of incorporating the time-varying nature of volatility using the ARCH process was first suggested by Engle (1982) . Further, the GARCH type models (GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, and TGARCH) were developed by Bollerslev (1986) Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993) , Franses and Dick (1996) and Franses and Dick (2000) to overcome some of the limitations of ARCH models, such as overfitting and breach of the non-negativity constraint. To this effect, the GARCH family of models has become the standard method for modeling volatility in financial time series. This study, therefore, employs the standard GARCH-GARCH (1,1) and the GJR-GARCH model. The GARCH(1,1) model is asymmetric model, often used as the starting point for a volatility analysis. The GJR-GARCH on the other hand is an asymmetric model, believed to have the best fit among the competing family of the GARCH models. It has higher precision and forecasting power compared to the vanilla GARCH and others as well. It also measures the leverage or asymmetric effect which is a stylized fact of stock market returns. The general specification of the GJR-GARCH model with inflation and COVID-19 in the variance equation is as follows:where δis the asymmetry or leverage effect parameter, and when δ > 0, and significant; there is asymmetry or leverage effect, and negative shocks (bad news) will increase the volatility of the stock market returns more than good news. But if δ= 0, the model collapses to GARCH (1,1) indicating that there is no leverage effect. The coefficients γ 1, λ 1 and represent the ARCH (recent news) and GARCH (old news) effects respectively. In addition, a higher value of λ 1 the GARCH coefficient implies that it will take a long time for shocks to conditional variance to dissipate or die off, suggesting that volatility is persistent. Also, if the sum of the ARCH and GARCH effects (γ 1 + λ 1 )is close to 1, or relatively high, then a 'shock' at time t will persist, which indicates a condition known as ""long memory"" or persistent of the conditional variance.Furthermore, we apply the accounting innovation tests described in and Usman, Alola, and Sarkodie (2020) is no multicollinearity in the model. Figure 1 shows the time plot of the variables over the period of the study. Precursory to the application of the GARCH type models, we checked for unit root properties of the variables and establish that all the variables (SMR, INF, are stationary at both I(0) and I(1) processes. Similarly, we tested for the presence or otherwise of heteroskedasticity in the stock market returns series using the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) or ARCH effect as a pre-requisite for using the volatility modeling approach. The result of the ARCH-LM test as evidence in Table 2 indicates that the stock market returns series is highly volatile since the null hypothesis of no ARCH effect is rejected at 5% level of significance. This finding, therefore, permits the application of the GARCH family of models which include the standard GARCH (GARCH 1,1) and the GJR-GARCH models for the purpose of this study. The results are presented in Table 3 . As expected, the results indicate that both the ARCH effect and the GARCH effect representing recent and past news respectively are statistically significant at a 5% level.This implies that both recent and past news have a significant impact on stock market returns volatility. In addition, the sum of the ARCHunity which suggests that the current shocks to the market returns triggered by COVID-19 may not die off speedily but rather persist for a while considering that the duration of the pandemic is unknown.That is to say that, the stock market volatility may continue even after the scourge of the dreaded coronavirus as the bearish sentiments are expected to last a little longer.Further, the results in Table 3 Note: *** and ** indicate 1 and 5% level of significance. Note: *** denotes significance 1% while standard errors are presented in parentheses. Balcilar, Roubaud, Usman, and Wohar (2020) . Based on the estimated results, the study finds positive and negative effects among the variables with evidence of statistical significance. The results of the impulse response functions (IRFs) display in Figure 3 reveal the responses of SMR to own innovation shock, INF shock, and COVID-19 shock using a 95% confidence interval. These responses are estimated based on the period of 10 days, which are robust enough to assess the full effects of INF and COVID-19 on the Nigeria SMR. The results show that SMR responds positively to an increase in its own innovation shock and the response is statistically significant up to the second horizon; after which it becomes insignificant. The study further observes that the response converges to its equilibrium value after the seven horizons. More so, the response of SMR to INF shock is negative and insignificant. The response becomes ineffective and neutral after five horizons. Finally, the study finds that SMR responds to COVID-19 shock negatively over the study period. This response is ineffective during periods of first and second horizons; after which it becomes effective. The negative impact of COVID 19 on the SMR justifies the fact that it is difficult to predict with certainty the magnitude of its impact on the Nigerian economy as market analyst expects the pandemic to last longer as already established in both the GARCH (1,1) and GJR-GARCH results.Further, the estimated results of the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) are displayed in Table 6 . It shows that the contribution of SMR to own shock is 90.88%. This is followed by the contributions from COVID-19 of 7.27%, and INF of 1.85% to the SMR forecast error variance decomposition. For INF, we find that the contribution to own shock is the largest with 92.32%, followed by F I G U R E 3 Impulse response function to inflation and COVID-19 shocks ",Nigeria,abstract,2020-08-13,08
362dd652d30be2406ccdc4ecfcf7cbeca54ed1ca,Journal Pre-proof The current situation of COVID-19 in Sudan The current situation of COVID-19 in Sudan,"The novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have originated from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, Central China, in December 2019 [1] . The SARS-CoV-2 dramatically expand worldwide; on 11 March 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) was declared the outbreak of (SARS-CoV-2) as pandemic [2] . The pandemic COVID-19 has become a significant global public health concern. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 has spread faster compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV due to its high binding affinity to human receptors [3] . The rapid spread of COVID-19 cases would significantly increase the burden on the country's healthcare system by raising the number of people who are seriously ill with SARS-CoV-2 and who need medical treatment [4] .The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to severe breathing difficulties, and multi-organ failure [5] . As reported by the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC), a broad range of symptoms have been observed in COVID-19 patients, ranging from minor symptoms to serious illness. Symptoms may occur 2-14 days after exposure to the virus, including fever or chills, cough, difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea [6] . The SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted via respiratory droplets following cough or sneezing of an infected individual, between people within less than one meter from each other, and potentially through the touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, such as telephones or doorknobs [7] . No effective antiviral therapy or vaccine has been developed to be potent against COVID-19 until now. For patients diagnosed with COVID-19, it has recommended that appropriate symptomatic treatment and respiratory support be extended [8, 9] . Therefore, prevention is the only way to control the outbreak of COVID-19, the best prevention strategies for the community are to minimize the incidence of exposure to the virus, including the following: use of face masks, regular handwashing with soap or hand sanitizer disinfection containing at least 60 percent alcohol, avoiding contact with infected people and maintaining the appropriate distance J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f as far as possible [10] . Moreover, protection or reduction of the transmission of COVID-19 may also be achieved through the identification, isolation, and follow-up of infected patients. In addition to environmental disinfection and the use of personal protective equipment for medical staff [11] .COVID-19 continues to expand globally, according to world health organization (WHO) report, up to 3 July 2020, there are 10,710,005 cases and 517, 877 deaths in 188 countries and territories. In Africa, as the virus was first reported in mid-February 2020, to date, more than 329,796 cases have been confirmed, with 6486 deaths [12] . The pandemic is speeding up -it took 98 days to reach 100 000 cases and only 19 days to progress 200 000 cases. Ten African countries have recently shown a massive increase in the number of infected patients, making up for almost 80% of all cases in Africa. Over 70% of deaths occur in just five countries: Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, and Sudan [12] .Sudan is the second-largest country in Africa, with a total population of 43,849,260 [13], located in the northeastern part of Africa, neighbored by countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases, like Egypt, and Gulf Arab countries. Before the announcement of the first case of COVID-19, the Sudan federal ministry of health (FMoH) has strengthened the measures on entry points, on 13 April, the government announced a partial lock-down, but due to weak application of these preventive measures, and the open borders of Sudan with neighboring countries, these measures were not effective, a large number of people refused and escaped quarantine [14] . Up to date, Sudan witness Community transmission of CVID-19, with daily reported new cases. In this review, we highlighted the current situation of COVID-19, hospital facilities, and quarantine centers, and the expected scenario in Sudan.The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in Sudan since 13 March 2020, and up to 3 July 2020, there are 9894 confirmed cases, and 616 deaths, with 6.6% case fatality rate. The highest confirmed cases appeared in the Khartoum State [15] . The case fatality rate was 6.23% in Sudan; in some states (like Khartoum) is low (3.8%), while in other states like Central Darfur and North Darfur was very high (66%, and 30% respectively), this variation may be due to differences in hospital and diagnosis facilities between the capital (Khartoum) and the remote Darfur states or could be due that the actual number of community cases in Darfur states is higher than detected [16] . A much higher number of unrecognized cases are extremely probable due to a restricted number of tests, public reluctance to report, and, perhaps worse, denial of attitudes.New community-based cases of COVID-19 are daily reported, creating a massive impact on public health and socio-economic disasters affecting the daily lives of many people [17] . In the recent weeks as shown in figure 3 the cases number from week 22 to week 27 are dropping, this might be due to a problem of testing facilities (as shown in the figure 4, the number of tested samples was very low during last three weeks) or due to the partial success of the current lockdown strategy, the reopening date is set at the second week of July 2020, but with new innovative cases reported on a rapid increase, it is probable to be lengthened much farther, or set with new preventive strategies. The Sudan transition government and fragmented health system [14] .According to the World Bank collection Sudan hospital beds capacity per 1,000 people was at 0.8 in 2013 [14, 19] , up to 3 June, 2020, Sudan established 36 isolation center (IC) in all states of Sudan with beds capacity around 985 beds and 198 ICU beds [15] , for the total population of Sudan this capacity is very low by international standards [20] . The government of Sudan equipped quarantines in all Sudanese states; theses quarantines received 2374 individuals and discharged 2189 of them up to 3 July 2020 [15] .Testing is one of the most important parts in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, through which we can identify infected people, treat, and isolate them at the appropriate time, testing is the key to controlling the virus, more testing easy control the spread of the virus [21] . The of these diagnostic centers is 800 samples per day. However, overall capacity remains low. In addition to this low testing capacity, there are several other problems that limit its work, including sample collection and transportation [22] . According to the WHO recommendation, a positive rate of around 3 -12% is the general benchmark of adequate testing [23, 24] . Up to 3, July 2020, Sudan conducted only 17945 tests for 18262 suspected cases, 55% of them were positive ( Table 2 ) [15] . When comparing the percentage of positivity in Sudan with other countries such as Korea (1%) Australia (1%), Mexico (20%), and Bolivia (50%), we find that Sudan is among the highest countries with a positive rate [24] . This high positivity rate (55%)indicates that Sudan is not testing widely enough samples to find all cases, and the actual number of circulating cases in the community is so far higher than the confirmed numbers. This point is supported by the recent report of a high number of asymptomatic cases that have been discovered in peoples returned from Sudan, from 450 Thai people had returned recently from Sudan, 21 of them had COVID-19 while being asymptomatic [25] . So far, the spread of the virus and its impact on Sudan is less compared to other countries, and this possibly could be attributed to the partial success of implemented preventive measures by the government or might be due to lack of testing facilities.There is a high case fatality rate in some states (Like North and central Darfur states), this could be due to lack of hospital, or the actual number of cases is more than reported due to lack of testing facilities.Despite a coronavirus lock-down, on 30, June 2020 more than one million Sudanese protestors gathered in the capital of Sudan (Khartoum) and other Sudanese cities without distancing or protective measures ( Figure 5) [18]. Countries that witnessed a protest reported more cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the USA, the number of COVID-19 cases increases by 3.39 cases per day, per 100,000, after the protests of George Floyd's death [26] . Due to massive protests and scheduled reopening of lock-down, we expect an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Sudan. The number of COVID-19 cases is currently decreasing in Sudan, but if the number of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cases is massively increased, the situation could worsen and goes out of control due to lack and shortage of the equipped medical facilities and well trained medical personnel. Therefore, the government must scaling up testing capacity, maintain the social distancing, and necessary precautions to limit the spread of infection after reopening and restoring normal life [27] .Ethics approval and consent to participate Not Applicable.Not Applicable.Data are available on request",Sudan,abstract,2020-08-18,08
f1a2c2183a4aec5e18b9842d5db5de6be2a3827f,Snake venom-derived bradykinin-potentiating peptides: A promising therapy for COVID-19?,"the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) allowing the virus to enter cells and cause the infection (Walls et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2/ ACE2 interaction rapidly induces ACE2 downregulation (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Silhol, Sarlon, Deharo, & Vaïsse, 2020) . ACE2 is a zinccontaining metalloenzyme expressed predominantly at the membrane surface of vascular endothelia cells, type II pneumocytes and various epithelia cells (Sodhi et al., 2018) . ACE2 expression correlates with sites of infection including lung and intestine (Hamming et al., 2004) , consistent with COVID-19-related main respiratory and intestinal manifestations (Xu, Zhou, & Xu, 2020) .Almost all studies interpreted the COVID-19-attributed ACE2 downregulation and the subsequent inflammation as related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysfunction (Gurwitz, 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020) . Rare studies suggested COVID-19-associated kinin-kallikrein system (KKS) dysregulation as potential trigger for the observed inflammation mediated by the innate immune response (van de Veerdonk et al., 2020) . The role of ACE2 is crucial since its altered activity affects both RAS and KKS (Gralinski et al., 2018; Kuba et al., 2005; Sampaio et al., 2007; Santos et al., 2003; Sodhi et al., 2018; Yang, Yin, Li, Zimmerman, & Schultz, 2011) . Here we aimed to review the involvement of both systems in COVID-19 pathogenesis and discuss the potential usefulness of the snake-derived bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs), able to interact with both systems, as optimal anti-COVID-19 therapy.The RAS regulates blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance and electrolyte balance. Briefly, the renal juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin when the renal blood flow decreases. Plasma renin converts angiotensinogen released by the liver to angiotensin I that subsequently convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II by ACE present at the vascular endothelial cell surface ( Figure 1 ). Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulates aldosterone production from the adrenal cortex. ACE1 degrades angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which acts through the angiotensin I-receptor (AT1R; Kuba et al., 2005) . Angiotensin II/AT1R stimulates the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway to exert its vasoconstriction and hypertensive activity (Recinos et al., 2007) . Additionally, angiotensin II/ATI-R activates the nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces immune cell infiltration and increases the production of C-reactive protein and proinflammatory cytokines such as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukins (IL)-1, -6, and interferon (IFN)-y in target tissues (Han, Liu, Liu, & Li, 2010; Lee et al., 2014) . Angiotensin II/AT1Rrelated stimulation of ROS generation results in nitric oxide (NO) breakdown leading to endothelial dysfunction (Griendling, Lassègue, Murphy, & Wayne Alexander, 1994) . Angiotensin II activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade leading to phospholipase A2 (PlA2) activation (Kaschina & Unger, 2003) . This activations enhance the secretion of arachidonic acid which mediates various signaling (generated by cytosolic PLA2) and inflammatory processes (generated by secretory PLA2; Baynes & Dominiczak, 2005) . Arachidonic acid is metabolized to eicosanoids as prostaglandins, prostacyclin (by the action of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2), and leukotrienes and thromboxanes (by the action of prostaglandin G/H synthase-1 and 2), which regulate the immunopathological processes of inflammatory responses (Harizi, Corcuff, & Gualde, 2008) .Angiotensin II/AT1R causes vasoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, inflammation and fibrosis . Angiotensin II enhances arterial vascular thrombosis in arterioles by modulating plasminogen activation mediated by enhanced plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) expression (Senchenkova, Russell, Almeida-Paula, Harding, & Granger, 2010) and thromboxane production (Smith & Song, 2002) .ACE2 degrades angiotensin II to generate angiotensin (1-7) which subsequently acts through the mas oncogene product (MAS) receptor to counteract angiotensin II/AT1R effects and stimulate NOS (Sampaio et al., 2007) . Angiotensin 1-7 stimulates AT2R which has vasodilatatory, antiproliferative, antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects (Calò, Rigato, & Bertoldi, 2019; Chappell & Al Zayadneh, 2017; Katovich, Grobe, & Raizada, 2008; Rodrigues Prestes, Rocha, Miranda, Teixeira, & Simoes-e-Silva, 2017) . Angiotensin 1-7 can be inactivated by ACE to inactive angiotensin 1-5 (Santos, Ferreira, & Simões e Silva, 2008) . Noteworthy, angiotensin (1-7) can be directly synthesized from angiotensin I by neprilysin (Chappell, 2016) , thimet oligopeptidase (Wilson, Nautiyal, Gwathmey, Rose, & Chappell, 2016) , prolylendopeptidase and metalloendopeptidase (Deddish et al., 1998) . ACE has two homologous N-and C-domains, present at the Nterminal half (N-ACE) or the C-terminal half (C-ACE) of the singlechain protein, respectively. Angiotensin (1-7) is both ACE substrate and inhibitor. It is degraded mainly by N-ACE and more slowly by C-ACE and inhibits C-ACE, which mainly hydrolyzes bradykinin and angiotensin 1 (Deddish et al., 1998) .Collectively, ACE metabolizes angiotensin I to angiotensin II (which induces vasoconstriction, ROS production, immune cell infilteration, inflammatory response, vascular permeability, thrombosis and fibrosis), while ACE2 metabolizes angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7) (which counteracts angiotensin II and presents vasodilatatory, antiproliferative, antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects).KKS is a poorly understood hormonal system consisting of blood proteins including bradykinin and kallidin and implicated in inflammation, blood pressure control, coagulation and pain ( Figure 1 ). Kininogens are processed by two types of serine-proteases called kallikreins and released as part of innate inflammation. Plasma kallikrein processes high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) to bradykinin and tissue kallikrein processes kinins from low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWK) to Lys-bradykinin. Both bradykinin and Lys-bradykinin interact with the bradykinin receptor-B2 (B2R) on the endothelial cells. B2R agonists are considered as potent vasodilators and organoprotective peptides (Heitsch, 2002) . B2R inhibits adenylate cyclase, stimulates phospholipase C that subsequently increases intracellular free calcium and provokes endothelium-dependent vasodilation by inducing local NO production (Fernandes et al., 2001) . B2R stimulation also results in prostacyclin production and increase in endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; Ancion, Tridetti, Nguyen Trung, Oury, & Lancellotti, 2019). Endothelial NO production triggered by bradykinin plays an organoprotective role by limiting leukocyte adhesion/migration, platelet adhesion/aggregation and smooth muscle contraction/ proliferation (Hällgren, Samuelsson, Laurent, & Modig, 1989) . Deficient NO bioavailability resulting from reduced NO production by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and increased NO breakdown by ROS are associated with endothelial dysfunction (Tomasian, 2000) .Additionally, NO possesses an antiapoptotic activity (Baudin, Berard, Carrier, Legrand, & Drouet, 1997) .Bradykinin is considered to be a potent stimulator of tPA secretion, thus affecting fibrinolysis and thrombolysis (Brown, Nadeau, & Vaughan, 1997) . t-PA/PAI-1 balance controls thrombi formation and degradation (Bentley et al., 2010) . Increases in PAI-1 and decreases in t-PA are associated with thrombi formation (Wiman et al., 2000) . Bradykinin has antithrombotic effects by increasing t-PA by an independent direct pathway based on NO production (Rahman et al., 2014) .tions, is upregulated in proinflammatory conditions (Heitsch, 2002) .B1R and B2R have different functions (Wu, Lin, Bernloehr, Hildebrandt, & Doods, 2012) . B1R stimulation induced by cytosolic calcium ion contributes to the inflammatory responses (Gurusamy et al., 2016) . B1R stimulation has detrimental effects by enhancing the proinflammatory response and causing vasoconstriction that contributes to organ injury including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; Murugesan et al., 2016; Qadri & Bader, 2018) . Moreover, B1R stimulation results in prolonged inducible NO synthase (iNOS) activation which is responsible for prolonged high NO output and deleterious organ effect, whereas B2R stimulation results in eNOS activation which is responsible for short burst of NO and protective organ effects (Erdös, Tan, & Skidgel, 2010; Kuhr, Lowry, Zhang, Brovkovych, & Skidgel, 2010) . Kinin-B1R overexpression induces hypertensive response to Des-Arg9-bradykinin and susceptibility to inflammation (Ni et al., 2003) .Kinin degradation is controlled by ACE1 that inactivates bradykinin and ACE2 that inactivates Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin to decrease their effects on B2R and B1R, respectively (Sodhi et al., 2018) . ACE1 inhibition, which results in increased bradykinin effects on B2R, has been associated with systemic angioedema (Jurado-Palomo & Caballero, 2017). ACE2 inhibition, which increases the effects of Lys des-Arg9-bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin on B1R, leads to proinflammatory effects associated with pulmonary edema and acute lung injury Sodhi et al., 2018) .Collectively, kallikreins processes kininogens to bradykinins.Bradykinins act through endothelial B2R (inducing vasodilation and organoprotective effects) and are further processed to des-F I G U R E 1 The physiology and functional relationships between the renin angiotensin and KKSs bradykinins which act on B1R which is upregulated in inflammatory conditions (inducing vasoconstriction and inflammatory response).Studies showed that angiotensin 1-7 and bradykinin actions are strongly interrelated. Angiotensin (1-7) potentiates bradykinininduced vasodilation on B2R by inhibiting ACE and releasing NO (Fernandes et al., 2001; Greco, Master Jr, F, Baber, & Kadowitz, 2006; Li, Chappell, Ferrario, & Brosnihan, 1997) . Other studies reported that bradykinin/NO cascade mediates AT2R stimulation (Gohlke, Pees, & Unger, 1998; Siragy & Carey, 1996) . There is a heterodimerization and strong functional interaction between MAS and AT2R suggesting that they depend on each other (Leonhardt et al., 2017) . Bradykinin/ NO system mediates counteraction between AT1R and AT2R (Searles & Harrison, 1999) . Experimental studies correlated B2Rattributed organoprotective role and AT1R-attributed counteracting effects (Taddei & Bortolotto, 2016) . B2R is considered as a physiological antagonist of angiotensin II-related effects on AT1R (Alhenc-Gelas et al., 2011) . This indicates that the functional activities of angiotensin 1-7 (on MAS receptor and AT1R) and bradykinin (on B2R) depend on each other. Also, angiotensin (1-7) can indirectly potentiate B2R by binding to the active site of ACE, thus blocking bradykinin degradation (Deddish et al., 1998) . Finally, the action of ATIR and B1R are functionally interrelated. ATIR can synergize BIR-related effects by ROS induction in the endothelial cells (Ceravolo et al., 2014) . The functions and relations between RAS and KKS are shown in Figure 1 .ACE2 inhibition affects both RAS and KKS as it decrease degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 and decreases degradation of Lys des-Arg9-bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin, leading to increase in functionally interrelated angiotensin II (through effects on ATIR) as well as Lys des-Arg9-bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin (through effects on B1R). ACE2 inhibition limits the functions of the functionally interrelated angiotensin 1-7 (through effects on MAS receptor and AT2R) and bradykinin (through effects on B2R). The effects of SARS-COV-2 on both RAS and KKS are shown in Figure 2 .It is important to consider the role of cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine endopeptidase that strongly enhances KKS involvement in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Cathepsin L mediates SARS-COV-2 cell entry through the transmembrane protease serine-2 (TMPRSS2; Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Consistently, cathepsin L was found to be needed for viral cell entry with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS; Huang et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) . Cathepsin L generates kinins from LMWK and HMWK at the infection site (Desmazes, Gauthier, & Lalmanach, 2001) , thus acting as a kininogenase independently of kallikreins, which are unable to generate kinins under inflammatory conditions to restore kinin levels (Desmazes, Galineau, Gauthier, Brömme, & Lalmanach, 2003) . Interestingly, cathepsin L exhibits hypotensive effects with increase in bradykinin release from kininogen in vivo, due to its kininogenase activity (Puzer et al., 2005) . SARS-COV-2-related effects on cathepsin L activity may modulate kinin and especially bradykinin levels, which may be at least partly responsible for some clinical aspects, supporting KKS role in COVID-19 pathogenesis (Johnson et al., 2009 ). This is supported by previous studies reporting an increase in the risk of ARDS with increase in angiotensin II and decrease in angiotensin 1-7 . Also, enhancing the effects of angiotensin 1-7 has been reported as likely to provide protection from ARDS induced by coronaviruses .Moreover, suppressed eNOS and NO deficiency are associated in COVID-19 patients with endothelial dysfunction leading to thrombotic events and organ dysfunctions (Green, 2020; Varga et al., 2020) , thus supporting the hypotheses of deleterious suppressed B2R stimulation (which stimulate eNOS) and depressed NO synthesis.All ACE2 inhibition effects were observed in COVID-19 patients who exhibit increased risk of vasoconstriction (Ruocco, Feola, & Palazzuoli, 2020) , proinflammatory cytokine profile (Jamilloux et al., 2020) , acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein , pulmonary fibrosis (Spagnolo et al., 2020) , coagulopathy with elevated plasma D-dimer, pulmonary thrombosis and venous thromboembolic events (Frater, Zini, D'Onofrio, & Rogers, 2020; Thachil, 2020) , disseminated intravascular coagulation (Lillicrap, 2020) and ARDS (Gattinoni, Chiumello, & Rossi, 2020; Jamilloux et al., 2020) .Many drugs have been used and thousands of clinical trials started to investigate the benefits of anti-COVID-19 therapies (Esposito, Noviello, & Pagliano, 2020) . Of these, drugs theoretically effective in modulating the RAS and KKS are currently being trialed to alleviate the consequences of ACE2 downregulation. Some drugs target ACE2 activity, while most target consequential effects of ACE2 inhibition mainly regarding the RAS. Surprisingly, none considered the strong functional relationships between RAS and KKS and the influence of ACE2 inhibition on both systems. Some studies recommended targeting ACE2 itself to competitively antagonize SARS-COV-2 binding (e.g., using soluble receptorbinding domains or antibodies). ACE2 blockers may be useful during the initial phase of infection or as prophylaxis to inhibit SARS-COV-2 entry (Kruse, 2020) . Meanwhile, ACE2 blockage may exacerbate COVID-19 severity by exaggerating the consequences of ACE2 inhibition; accordingly, even its usage as prophylaxis may lead to ACE2 inhibition manifestations. Interestingly, one pilot study recommended restoring ACE2 downregulation by using recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2, GSK2586881) aiming at decreasing angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin 1-7, but no improvement in physiological or clinical parameters was observed (Peng et al., 2013) .Other studies recommended angiotensin receptor blockers to block angiotensin II overactivation effects (Gurwitz, 2020; Silhol et al., 2020) , neglecting the effects of ACE2 inhibition on the KKS.Although classical ACE inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 (Zisman, 2005) , some studies recommended ACE inhibitor use to decrease angiotensin II overexpression. These studies depended on observations of clinical improvements in COVID-19 patients on antihypertensive ACE inhibitors evident by the lower prevalence of severe presentations, reduced hospitalization risk, lower viral load and plasma IL-6 and increased CD3 and CD8 T-cell counts (Khera et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2020) . A meta-analysis suggested that ACE inhibitors may reduce mortality (Ghosal, Mukherjee, Sinha, & Gangopadhyay, 2020) , consistent with the association with reduced mortality in septic patients (Hsu et al., 2020) . By contrast, other studies discouraged its use as possibly facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entrance into the cell (Gurwitz, 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020) and leading to bradykinin escape (Ruocco et al., 2020) .Although ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with decreased Th1/Th2 cytokine ratios and inflammatory cytokine production, no inhibition of ACE2 was observed (Gage et al., 2004) (Das, 2020) . Current laboratory data obtained in COVID-19 cases (increased eicosanoids) contradict the hypothetical basis for this therapy. Interestingly, antagonistic maneuvers directed against some consequences of angiotensin II overexpression have been recommended. Of these, corticosteroids have been evaluated as a potent treatment to inhibit cytokine production by NF-κB-mediated transcription factor inhibition (Qin et al., 2020; Russell, Millar, & Baillie, 2020) . Anticoagulants such as heparin have been suggested to reduce mortality (Thachil, 2020) .Although these studies did not cover all SARS-COV-2-induced pathological effects, they may be beneficial against specific consequences such as thrombosis and thromboembolic events, thus ameliorating COVID-19 severity.Inhaled NO with its potential vasodilatory and bronchodilatory properties is also currently being investigated aiming to decrease pulmonary hypertension, improve arterial oxygenation and reduce spread and density of lung infiltrates in COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2004) . Interestingly, NO has been shown able to inactivate viral replication in vitro by modifying proteins and nucleic acids (Croen, 1993) with many viruses (Klingström et al., 2006; Saura et al., 1999) including SARS coronavirus (Åkerström, Gunalan, Keng, Tan, & Mirazimi, 2009 ). Theoretically, this therapy is appealing as deficient NO bioavailability is associated with endothelial dysfunction (Tomasian, 2000) . Deficient NO bioavailability may result from reduced NO production by eNOS which occurs from decreased B2R and AT2R stimulation and/or ROS-related increased NO breakdownThe pathophysiological effects of SARS-COV-2 on both the renin angiotensin and KKSs which increases with ATIR and B1R stimulation (Taddei, Ghiadoni, Virdis, Versari, & Salvetti, 2003) .Teicoplanin and glycopeptides have also been proposed to treat COVID-19 patients by targeting cathepsin L in the late endosomes and thus blocking the virus replication cycle .Targeting cathepsin L may be useful as a prophylactic strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and/or limit the subsequent COVID-19 severity before host defense impairment as observed with influenza A (Xu, Greenland, Gotts, Matthay, & Caughey, 2016) . However, this targeting strategy may also aggravate COVID-19 severity as cathepsin L plays a crucial pathogenic role by modulating bradykinin levels.Interestingly, a new potential therapeutic approach to combat COVID-19 by using Rho kinase inhibitors such as fasudil has been suggested (Abedi, Rezaee, & Karimi, 2020) , as it showed a protective effect from lung injury through its ability to counteract the proinflammatory and immune responses of Rho kinase that mediates lung injury. Rho kinase inhibitors also shown to have antifibrotic effects and ability to upregulate ACE2 (Abedi, Hayes, Reiter, & Karimi, 2020; Zhang, Penninger, Li, Zhong, & Slutsky, 2020) . This is consistent with other studies that showed that Rho pathway is activated by angiotensin II/AT1R Suzuki et al., 2009) .Snake venoms contain a mixture of amino acids, proteins, peptides, nucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates and metallic elements coupled to proteins (Calvete, Juárez, & Sanz, 2007; Georgieva, Arni, & Betzel, 2008) . Although these components may be lethal, they constitute a rich biological resource of significant therapeutic value including promising antiviral drugs (Kang et al., 2011; Meenakshisundaram, Sweni, & Thirumalaikolundusubramanian, 2009; Pennington, Czerwinski, & Norton, 2018; Rivero et al., 2011) . Several studies reported that snake venom components have antiviral activity against measles, Sendai, dengue, yellow fever and human immunodeficiency viruses (Borkow & Ovadia, 1999; Meenakshisundaram et al., 2009; Muller et al., 2012) . Snake venom properties may constitute promising therapeutic options against defense mechanisms developed by viruses (Meenakshisundaram et al., 2009) .Interestingly, the venom-derived peptides present properties adequate to counteract COVID-19 consequences in the light of SARS-CoV-2-related pathophysiological mechanisms. BPPs, isolated from Bothrops jararaca venom (Ferreira, Greene, Alabaster, Bakhle, & Vane, 1970) , launched the discovery of bradykinin in the bitten patients (e Silva, Beraldo, & Rosenfeld, 1949) , allowing understanding of the physiological roles of the KKS (Linz, Wiemer, Gohlke, Unger, & Schölkens, 1995) . Peptide fraction analysis of Bothrops jararaca venoms contains various BPPs (9a, 10b, 10c, 11a, 11d, 11e, 12b, 12c, 13a, 13b, 14a) , short proline-rich peptides with remarkable functional differences (Camargo, Ianzer, Guerreiro, & Serrano, 2012; Morais et al., 2011) . The first BBP to be sequenced was Pyr-Lys-Trp-Ala-Pro-OH (Munawar et al., 2016) .BPP-10c (Glu-Asn-Trp-Pro-His-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) strongly decreases angiotensin II by inhibiting ACE, increasing bradykininrelated effects on B2R, increasing NO-attributed antioxidant, antiinflammatory and neuroprotective effects and exhibiting direct neural antihypertensive effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that BPP-10c may be an excellent anti-COVID-19 treatment due to its ability to counteract most of the deleterious effects of SARS-COV-2 on both RAS and KKS.BPPs increase bradykinin-induced hypotension and decrease angiotensin I-related vasopressor effects by inhibiting ACE (Camargo et al., 2012; Lopes et al., 2014) . They represent the first natural bradykinin agonists and ACE inhibitors (Camargo et al., 2012) . BPPs augment bradykinin-related effects by interacting directly on bradykinin receptors rather than inhibiting bradykinin degradation by ACE1 inhibition (Chi et al., 1985) . BPP-10c strongly potentiates bradykinin-related effects on B2R and is additionally a strong selective ACE C-domain inhibitor (400-fold more selective than for the N-domain; Camargo et al., 2012; Cotton et al., 2002) . Angiotensin I is predominantly hydrolyzed by the Cdomain, whereas bradykinin is hydrolyzed by both active domains (Junot et al., 2001) . Hence, a purely C-domain selective inhibitor would be more beneficial as it mainly decreases angiotensin II by inhibiting its synthesis from angiotensin I by the C-domain. BPPs only decrease bradykinin degradation while preventing its accumulation by preserving ACE N-domain activity (Messerli & Nussberger, 2000) . This property renders BPPs superior to classical ACE inhibitors that have the risk of developing bradykininmediated angioedema. Besides its ability to inhibit ACE and directly activate bradykinin-B2R, BPP-10c exerts its antihypertensive effect by increasing free intracellular calcium in neuronal cells and releasing specific neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (Lameu et al., 2010; Querobino, Ribeiro, & Alberto-Silva, 2018) .Additionally, BPP-10c is reported to enhance argininosuccinate synthetase (AsS) activity leading to sustained increase in NO production (Camargo et al., 2012; Morais et al., 2011 Morais et al., , 2013 . BPP-10c binding to AsS enhances adenosine triphosphate and citrulline (Guerreiro et al., 2009) leading to NO release from endothelial cells and vasodilatation (Morais et al., 2013) . AsS enhances argininosuccinate synthesis via conjugation of aspartate with citrulline. Argininosuccinate is cleaved by argininosuccinate lyase resulting in fumarate and Larginine formation (Haines, Pendleton, & Eichler, 2011) . This amino acid participates in the synthesis of neuroprotective molecules including agmatine and various polyamines such as spermine, spermidine and putrescine (Blantz, Satriano, Gabbai, & Kelly, 2000; Querobino et al., 2018) . Polyamines could prevent alterations in mitochondrial membrane permeability, regulating calcium concentrations and NOS activity (Jamwal & Kumar, 2016) . Agmatine is reported to exhibit antiinflammatory properties by inhibiting NF-κB leading to iNOS suppression (Ahn et al., 2012) , inhibiting TNF-α (Hong, Kim, Lee, & Seong, 2009 ) and inducing neuroprotective and antioxidant actions (Freitas et al., 2016) . L-arginine can also be metabolized to NO (Maes, Galecki, Chang, & Berk, 2011) . The importance of the argininecitrulline cycle for endothelial NO production was supported by a report of two infants with a deficiency of argininosuccinate lyase, who were shown to be hypertensive (Fakler, Kaftan, & Nelin, 1995) .BPP-10c reduces ROS production (Querobino et al., 2018; Zhou, Ai, Chen, & Li, 2019) , increases NO synthesis (de Oliveira et al., 2010) , reduces NF-κΒ expression and reduces iNOS expression (Querobino et al., 2018) . BPP-10c has been reported to be safe and without cytotoxic effects (Querobino et al., 2018) . It caused sustained reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive but not normotensive rats (Guerreiro et al., 2009) . Other studies recommended its consideration as a potential therapeutic agent for various diseases related to NO deficiency (Morais et al., 2011) .SARS-COV-2 downregulates ACE2 and affects cathepsin L that significantly contributes to COVID-19 pathophysiology by increasing the proinflammatory and organodestructive effects of angiotensin II andLys-bradykinins and decreasing the antiinflammatory and organoprotective effects of angiotensin 1-7, NO and bradykinin.Most investigations on anti-COVID-19 therapies did not consider the effects on both RAS and KKS. Snake venom-derived BPP-10c exhibits remarkable organoprotective effects targeting both systems and thus providing great value as a natural treatment option to alleviate COVID-19 manifestations. Further trials are now required to evaluate any clinical benefits.The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.Ahmed S.

Following the phase 4 lockdown; the country entered phase 2 lockdown with relaxed restrictions. This resulted in accelerated transmission, as prevention behaviour slackened (4) . In response, on 23 July, the government increased lockdown restrictions; including introduction of a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Further mitigation strategies include strides to increase testing capacity, training health workers on COVID-19 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 patient care, and increase in the number of quarantine and isolation centers through authorization of some private facilities (4).Testing is an important strategy to contain or slow the progression of the pandemic in society (5) . The early detection of SARS-CoV-2 in infected people is important for limiting the transmission through isolation of cases, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts (1).Currently in Zimbabwe, testing is supposed to be done on suspect cases as per World Health Organization (WHO) case definition, contacts of confirmed cases and also patients identified through respiratory disease surveillance (4). However, testing has been prioritized for people with risk of developing severe disease, symptomatic health workers and the first symptomatic individuals in a new area or new cluster where no cases have been reported previously (4) .There is an urgent need to scale-up COVID-19 testing to meet current capacity and to ensure equal and equitable testing availability to all who want and/or need it.Fear of stigma and discrimination and labeling is deterring many from seeking testing (6, 7) . This is coupled with a fear of the unknown and hesitance of coping with isolation, should one test positive (8) . In the context of this novel virus, the content of COVID-19 information education communication (IEC) material is also rapidly evolving as clinical symptoms of the disease and the various mitigatory and containment measures are updated. IEC on benefits of testing (9) and associated counseling is minimal.Precise analysis of COVID-19 in Africa, as a continent, continues to be hindered by limited testing and reporting of cases. The wide variance in testing capacity, commitment to testing, and reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths means countries that are undertaking the most tests or reporting the highest number of cases may not necessarily match those countries most A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 impacted or at risk from the pandemic (10). In Zimbabwe, the testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved over time. Trained medical laboratory scientists and technicians perform COVID-19 testing in Zimbabwe. Training on testing is provided by Ministry of Health and Child Care supported by various organisations such as the WHO, and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), among others. The country follows the WHO guidelines on testing (11) . Initially confirmatory PCR testing was done at National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa (4) . Over time, laboratory support for PCR tests was extended to five public laboratories in the country, that had existing platforms for HIV testing, and to date multiple other districts, provincial and private laboratories have been authorized to test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Provinces are showing marked differences in the COVID-19 testing levels, and although there is a high density of testing sites in the current COVID-19 hotspots like Harare an Bulawayo, the testing capacity of these provinces in relation to their population density is rather low (Figure 2 ), whereas Matabeleland North and South had the largest testing capacity in relation to their population density.Testing has been done in the form of rapid antibody testing and PCR testing. Rapid antibody testing has been used as a screening test at the borders and workplaces whereas PCR has been used as a diagnostic test for all symptomatic people, hospitalized patients, people who are positive with rapid antibody testing. As of 18 August 2020, a total of 84,741 PCR tests have been done (3) . The testing sites have employed various molecular platforms with the district and provincial laboratories mostly relying on GeneXpert (Cepheid) analysers. Table 1 presents the distribution of PCR platforms and assays with an account of the throughput assuming an 8-hour work shift. Combined, the laboratories have a capacity of 9,658 PCR tests daily. As at 18 August 2020, the country is conducting an average of 1,200 diagnostic PCR tests per day (3) . This available data for Zimbabwe shows inadequate testing levels that do not meet current capacity. The WHO issued a warning of a ""silent epidemic"" to African A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7 governments, calling for testing to be prioritized, and delivered on a much greater scale than it is at the moment (12) . The next section discusses barriers to widespread COVID-19 testing in Zimbabwe focusing on procurement, health system funding, health workforce and standards at quarantine facilities. March with a peak at the end of April. This trend, has in part been due to persistent challenges with procurement and supply chain of COVID-19 test kits (13) . A shortage of reagents and consumables among them Gene Xpert cartridges, nasopharyngeal swabs, Viral Load Transport medium (VTM) and other reagents for PCR has hampered COVID-19 testing in Zimbabwe. This has severely impacted on the testing capacity leading to high turn-around of results thereby impacting service delivery. The global demand for the kits and reagents has seen manufacturing countries prioritize their homelands (14, 15 ). According to Médecins Sans Frontiers research, diagnostics company Cepheid is charging four times more than it should for its COVID-19 tests (16) . Cepheid has set the price for each test at $19.80 in 145 developing countries, including Zimbabwe, when the tests could be sold at a profit for $5 each (16) . Given the majority of testing sites in Zimbabwe rely on the Cepheid platform for COVID-19 testing (4), the cost per kit may also deter widespread testing for private facilities that purchase their own test kits. Further, it is worth noting that the closure of borders and grounding of most cargo ships and flights also had adverse impact on importing the kits to Zimbabwe. Corruption in procurement of COVID-19 reagents has also emerged, resulting in A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 8 some tenders being cancelled and thereby delaying the procurement process (17) . This also brings into disrepute the credibility of the government in handling donor funds, thus derailing or even stopping some donations which may have been earmarked for the country.Another important major barrier to widespread COVID-19 testing in Zimbabwe has been the chronically underfunded health system. The testing has relied on donors from Jack Ma, The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and other partners (18) who have made substantial contribution to the effort to boost the COVID-19 testing in Zimbabwe. In the early phases of the pandemic, sample transportation was a major challenge (7), and consequently , MoHCC, in collaboration with its partners, have put in place a transport system that leverages on existing HIV program to ferry samples to the laboratories. However, in a country with severe shortages of fuel, the challenge of sample transport persists in some areas.Zimbabwe has also experienced a ""brain drain"" as more skilled medical laboratory scientists have continued to evade district and provincial hospitals, in favor of better working conditions in neighboring and overseas countries (19) . According to the Health Services Board, 64% of medical laboratory scientist positions in public laboratories were vacant as of December 2019 (20). This implies that even most laboratories may not meet their daily capacity because there aren't enough people there to prepare and process the samples.Further, this also negatively impacts the quality of testing in the public laboratories which A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 have been left to be manned by less skilled cadres. The government-employed nurses and doctors have been on strike due to low remuneration coupled with salaries that are continuously eroded by hyperinflation.A new threat has emerged with a surge in number of health workers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of 28 July, 323 health workers had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus (21) . Subsequent isolation of the confirmed cases and quarantine of their colleagues who have been in close contact has reduced the number of health workers available to serve patients (22) .The health workers have also reported lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) which is essential in discharging their duties especially during this COVID-19 crisis (7, 23) . The strike, low morale and quarantine of the infected health workers are causing increased fatigue among the few health workers thereby compromising the quality of service.The country initially experienced a significant number of imported cases from neighboring South Africa through both designated and undesignated ports of entry (3). The undesignated port of entry has presented a major challenge as the people using these ports of entry are not documented and tested before they interact with other people in the society (24) . Even for those individuals who followed the right procedures for entry into the country, cases of individuals escaping from the quarantine centers have been reported (25). There is a growing body of evidence that call for quarantine centers to scale up provision of proper counselling, support and treatment to the returnees (8, 26) . When people are well-informed and knowledgeable about the merits of the whole process, they are more likely to comply. A joint A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 team comprised of MoHCC, the International Organization for Migration and WHO assessed the suitability and appropriateness of 37 quarantine facilities across the country during the period 17 -21 May 2020. The assessment revealed a lack of guidance of how the facilities should be operating (27) . In some facilities, roles and responsibilities were not clearly defined (27) . The occupants were not practicing maximum safety measures to avoid or limit transmission within the facilities (27) . There was no guidance on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) issues at the facilities and PPEs were in short supply (27) . There is an urgent need to train quarantine staff on COVID-19, safety and maintenance of hygiene, regular screening and testing of quarantine staff, develop and distribute standard operating procedures (SOPs) and guidelines for IPC at the quarantine facility, procure and provide adequate supplies required for infection prevention and control (28) . Currently, COVID-19 diagnostic testing is mandatory at day 8 of quarantine (28) . There is need to consider COVID-19 testing upon arrival at the quarantine site. Recently, local cases have also been on the increase and beginning July the number have surpassed imported cases (3). This is an illustration that the pandemic has moved into a profile, which is localized, and therefore this has an implication on testing targets and patterns. Further, this trend underscores the need to continuously engage the community (29, 30) to adhere to various containment and mitigation strategies in place to reduce infections.A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11As the outbreak accelerates in the country, the call to ramp up COVID-19 testing to meet the current capacity to better control the pandemic cannot be over-emphasized. To rapidly improve testing capacity, there is need for provision of adequate resources (31) coupled with motivated health workers. Political will plays an important role in ensuring that testing capacity is increased, as decisions will be made at the highest level and implemented cascading downwards. In this regard, domestic rechanneling of resources from other line ministries, to health, will be crucial as external aid support is likely to diminish.Since the inception of the pandemic, the government has recruited additional health workers and introduced a COVID-19 allowance. While the government has made efforts to reshuffle staff around clinics to focus on the facilities with the most COVID-19 related workload, there is need for development of programs for periodic debriefing and burn-out prevention for frontline workers. Frontline health workers who are testers, also need psychosocial support, especially if they are witnessing increased positive rates of testing, or if they are witnessing highly distressed patients at the time of testing (32). Dealing with anxiety of frontline health workers is just as important as dealing with client anxieties. The government may also consider stepping up efforts to re-engage skilled health workers, who have moved to other sectors of work, to ease the strain on the core health care complement. Zimbabwe is a recipient of important financial support for the HIV pandemic, these resources can be leveraged in the COVID-19 response. The United States government (USG)'s substantial HIV-related investments in Zimbabwe have also focused on laboratory infrastructure (33, 34) . The USG has employed a two-pronged approach, namely provide support to national laboratory capacity focused on HIV Viral load testing, QA/QC programs through its laboratory focused implementation partners. Secondly, its HIV surveillance There is need to urgently address issues of graft that have been reported in procurement process (37) . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Civil society organizations (CSOs)can play an important role in demanding enhanced transparency and good governance in Zimbabwe by contributing to increased public debate on issues surrounding the formulation and implementation of COVID-19 financial resources. CSOs and development partners need to adopt creative means to track, monitor and shadow report on disparities and anomalies which emerge in resource and commodity utilization, on a frequent basis. The Zimbabwean COVID-19 response could benefit from CSOs cooperation with national and international human rights agencies (38) and donors, to guide the effective tracking and shadow reporting.CSOs can also be engaged to support testing efforts in motivating and mobilizing communities to take up COVID-19 testing.There is need for sustainable scale-up to ensure community literacy is increased, and mobilize acceptance of testing (9) . IEC dissemination, preferably in vernacular languages, should be availed via radio, TV and digital social media platforms. In the context of quarantine of returnees, wide access to COVID-19 IEC dissemination is fundamental to A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 14 remove stigma against returnees that has potential to cause an underground divide with a likelihood of ultimately countering prevention efforts. Further, there is need for training for health workers to ensure proper pre-and post-test counseling is offered; to both persons being tested and their family to alleviate anxiety and deter self-stigma or external stigma and discrimination (39) .We recommend Zimbabwe to embrace pooled testing (40) for cohesive groups such as health care workers. This approach is particularly useful in these groups where a single positive typically requires quarantine of the entire group. Pooled testing has also been shown to be useful among asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, an important source of transmission (40) .Zimbabwe's limited testing capacity has been mainly due to inadequate investment by its government, over the years, to the health system. The government must increase its own financial investment in the response to COVID-19 and not be solely dependent on international donors. The recent surge in COVID-19 cases is an urgent public health concern and requires coordinated efforts to ramp up testing to meet capacity already in existence incountry. There is need for substantial decentralization of testing from the current provincial level to district level. Zimbabwe needs to invest in better salaries and working conditions for its frontline health workers and decisively deal with graft within its structures. ",Zimbabwe,abstract,2020-08-31,08
da9a11b7970bb34d51c6a2096e55ae28f56982f3,Oral and maxillofacial surgical services amid COVID-19 pandemic: perspective from Tanzania,"To the Editor,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 [1] . As of 5 May 2020, about 212 countries around the world had reported the presence of the disease [2] . In Tanzania, the first case was confirmed on 16 March 2020 [3] . COVID-19 affects individuals from all walks of life regardless of their social-economic status, and thus patients with various conditions affecting the oral and maxillofacial region are not exceptional. Due to the presence of a vast array of anatomical structures, the complex oral and maxillofacial region is affected by varied conditions ranging from developmental defects, infections, injuries, and pathologies [4] . The management of most of these conditions eventually requires a surgical approach, which must be carried out by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon (OMS).The SARS-CoV-2 can be passed on directly from person to person through respiratory droplets, contact, fomites [5] , and possibly saliva [6, 7] . Considering this, it is beyond doubt that the OMS is among the healthcare workers who are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the area of work and the type of procedures done on daily basis [1] . The high-risk OMS face is attributed to the short distance between patients' oral cavity and upper airway to the surgeons' mouth/nose, and long duration of exposure or contact with the patient during surgical procedures. Further, the situation is compounded by constant contact with the patient's secretions (saliva, mucus, blood, etc.) during different phases of diagnosis and disease management process [1] . This is worsened by the fact that they risk managing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers who have the potential to transmit the disease considering that the incubation period of the virus is long and unpredictable (0-27 days, mean 6.4 days) [8] .In Tanzania, the current population is estimated to be 56 million [9], yet there are less than 30 practicing OMS in the whole country. Of these, about half, are at the Muhimbili National Hospital, located in the city of Dar es Salaam, which has a well-established oral and maxillofacial unit. This receives patients with different oral and maxillofacial conditions from all over the country. Normally, the surgical procedures that are performed in our center range from surgical extractions to excision of rather large tumors and management of trauma cases. These are carried out under local anesthesia, conscious sedation, and general anesthesia. On average about 70 patients are treated in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery per day. Taking all this into consideration, and the fact that asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers have the potential to transmit the disease [8] , the more patients the OMS comes into contact, the higher are the chances of contacting COVID-19.There are several guidelines in managing patients during this pandemic era. Some institutions have laid out guidelines/recommendations on the management of patients with oral and maxillofacial conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic [8, 10, 11] . Some of these are easily applicable in our setting while others may not be possible. The basic infection control practice such as hand hygiene practices, barrier techniques, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (face shield/goggles and surgical masks), disinfection of surfaces, and sterilization of equipment is very applicable and is routinely practiced in our setting.In most developed nations, it has been proposed to postpone/scheduled elective procedures during this pandemic to protect the community, patients, and staff, while providing emergency care only [8, 12] . This, however, may not be very realistic in most developing countries including Tanzania, where patients seek treatment at late stages with advanced disease conditions. Our patients seek oral and maxillofacial care at an early stage only when they have unbearable pain or sustained traumatic injuries to the orofacial region. Cost implications are among the main causes of delay in reporting to a health facility in addition to the existing strong belief in traditional medicine among a considerable proportion of the population [13] . As such, the majority of the patients who are seen daily require emergency care like extraction of grossly carious teeth, incision and drainage of fascial space abscesses, and biopsies of advanced-stage malignant lesions.Encouraging patients to seek online and telephonic consultations and fill in questionnaires before treatment may not be feasible in our setting. Though, the proposal that the patient's body temperature should be measured using a non-contact infrared thermometer before treatment is possible. The reliability of body temperature, however, at times comes into question, since in cases where the patient presents with malignant disease (e.g., lymphoma) or fascial space infection, the body temperature may also rise. A thorough but quick history is taken from the patient concerning his/her condition and additional questions like travel history to COVID-19-affected locations, the presence of symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, cough, and loss of smell/taste are also inquired.In this institution, we have prioritized the surgical interventions to managing maxillofacial trauma, fascial space infections (e.g., Ludwig's angina), malignant lesions (e.g., sarcomas and carcinomas), and any other condition in which delay could be detrimental to the patient's life. For the cases of maxillofacial trauma, where applicable, closed reduction methods (e.g., maxillomandibular fixation) are preferred to open reduction and internal fixation. In a few selected cases with predictable favorable outcomes, some onco-surgical procedures are sometimes carried out under local anesthesia or conscious sedation. Performing SARS-CoV-2 tests to all patients admitted in oral and maxillofacial surgical wards on a routine basis as suggested by some authors [11] is not practical in our situation. Literature shows that conventional chest radiographs have the potential of giving a clue of the presence of COVID-19 [14] . Therefore, routine investigation such as a chest X-ray which is done in all cases in our setting may be relied upon as a preliminary indicator.As the COVID-19 situation progresses, one may argue that closing oral and maxillofacial practices during the pandemic could reduce the chances of practicing OMS getting infected. However, in so doing it will increase the suffering of patients who require urgent oral and maxillofacial surgery care. These patients will in turn be directed to the emergency departments where the medical team is already overwhelmed with patients suffering from different conditions including COVID-19. It is our sole duty as OMS in Tanzania to protect both the patients and the medical team from any sort of infection and at the same time keep the healthcare system running efficiently.In our center, in order to minimize the chances of contacting COVID-19, we have set local guidelines that should be followed. Patients are required to wash their hands with soap and running water and have their body temperature checked before entering the center. Inside the center, they are required to constantly wear a face mask and maintain a social distance of at least 6 feet apart. To all personnel involved in patient care, special sessions are organized for raising their awareness on COVID-19. The medical staff should take a thorough history from the patient and minimize the time spent with each patient without compromising standard treatment protocols. The decision of whether a given case is emergency or elective is made by a panel of not less than shield, surgical masks, and aprons) whenever they attend patients. The face shields and goggles are disinfected while the mask and aprons are changed and disposed of appropriately after attending every patient. For all aerosol-generating procedures, powerful suction is used to remove blood and secretions from the site of operation. In the clinics, the operatories are disinfected every after attending patients, and the instruments are sterilized immediately after the procedures. Congestion of patients in the wards is minimized by shortening duration of hospital stay and, except when necessary, posttreatment follow-ups are scheduled with a long span of time.In conclusion, it is plausible to continue with oral and maxillofacial services while maintaining strict preventing conditions against transmission of COVID-19. The creation of locally tailored standard guidelines for managing patients with the oral and maxillofacial conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic should be emphasized.

af98f7f9021b218e66167538c6868ed415d567f4,Bayesian inference of COVID-19 spreading rates in South Africa,"The first reported case of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in South Africa was announced on 5 March 2020, following the initial manifestation of the virus in Wuhan China in December 2019 [1] [2] [3] . Due to its further spread and the severity of its associated clinical outcomes, the disease was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020 [1, 2] . In South Africa, by 26 April 2020, 4546 people had been confirmed to have been infected by the coronavirus with 87 fatalities [4] .Numerous states have attempted to minimise the growth in number of COVID-19 infections [1, 5, 6] . These attempts are largely based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at separating the infectious population from the susceptible population [1] .These initiatives aim to strategically reduce the increase in infections to a level where their healthcare systems stand a chance of minimising the number of fatalities [1] . Some of the critical indicators for policymaker response planning include projections of the infected population, estimates of health care service demand and whether current containment measures are effective [1] . As the pandemic develops in a rapid and varied manner in most countries, calibration of epidemiological models based on available data can prove to be [7] . This difficulty is further escalated by the high number of asymptomatic cases and the limited testing capacity [1, 2] .A fundamental issue when calibrating localised models is inferring parameters of compartmental models such as susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and the susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) that are widely used in infectious disease projections. In the view of public health policymakers, a critical aspect of projecting infections is the inference of parameters that align with the underlying trajectories in their jurisdictions. The spreading rate is a parameter of particular interest which is subject to changes due to voluntary social distancing measures and government-imposed contact bans.The uncertainty in utilising these models is compounded by the limited data in the initial phases and the rapidly changing dynamics due to rapid public policy changes.To address these complexities, we utilise the Bayesian Framework for the inference of epidemiological model parameters in South Africa. The Bayesian framework allows for both incorporation of prior knowledge and principled embedding of uncertainty in parameter estimation.In this work we combine Bayesian inference with the compartmental SEIR and SIR models to infer time varying spreading rates that allow for quantification of the impact of government interventions in South Africa.Compartmental models are a class of models that is widely used in epidemiology to model transitions between various stages of disease [1, 8, 9] . We now introduce the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) and the related Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartmental models that have been dominant in COVID-19 modelling literature [1, 5, 6, 10] .The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model. The SEIR is an established epidemiological model for the projection of infectious diseases. The SEIR models the transition of individuals between four stages of a condition, namely:• being susceptible to the condition,• being infected and in incubation • having the condition and being infectious to others and • having recovered and built immunity for the disease.The SEIR can be interpreted as a four-state Markov chain which is illustrated diagrammatically in Fig 1. The SEIR relies on solving the system of ordinary differential equations below representing the analytic trajectory of the infectious disease [1] .Where S is the susceptible population, I is the infected population, R is the recovered population and N is the total population where N = S + E + I + R. λ is the transmission rate, σ is the rate at which individuals in incubation become infectious, and μ is the recovery rate. 1/σ and 1/μ therefore, become the incubation period and contagious period respectively. We also consider the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model which is a subclass of the SEIR model that assumes direct transition from the susceptible compartment to the infected (and infectious) compartment. The SIR is represented by three coupled ordinary differential equations rather than the four in the SEIR. Fig 2 depicts the three states of the SIR model.The basic reproductive number R 0 . The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) represents the mean number of additional infections created by one infectious individual in a susceptible population. According to the latest available literature, without accounting for any social distancing policies the R 0 for COVID-19 is between 2 and 3.5 [2, 6, 10, 11] . R 0 can be expressed in terms of λ and μ as:Extensions to the SEIR and SIR models. We use an extended version of the SEIR and SIR models of [6] that incorporates some of the observed phenomena relating to COVID-19. First we include a delay D in becoming infected (I new ) and being reported in the confirmed case statistics, such that the confirmed reported cases CR t at some time t are in the form [6] :We further assume that the spreading rate λ is time-varying rather than constant with change points that are affected by government interventions and voluntary social distancing measures. We follow the framework of [6] to perform Bayesian inference for model parameters on the South African COVID-19 data. The Bayesian framework allows for the posterior inference of parameters which updates prior beliefs based on a data-driven likelihood. The posterior inference is governed by Bayes theorem as follows:Where P(W|D, M) is the posterior distribution of a vector of model parameters (W) given the model(M) and observed data(D), P(D|W, M) is the data likelihood and P(D) is the evidence.The likelihood. The Likelihood indicates the probability of observing the reported case data given the assumed model. In our study, we adopt the Student-T distribution as the Likelihood as suggested by [6] . Similar to a Gaussian likelihood, the Student-T likelihood allows for parameter updates that minimise discrepancies between the predicted and observed reported cases.Priors. Parameter prior distributions encode some prior subject matter knowledge into parameter estimation. In the case of epidemiological model parameters, priors incorporate literature based expected values of parameters such as recovery rate(μ), spreading rate(λ), change points based on policy interventions etc.The prior settings for the model parameters are listed in Table 1 . We follow [6] by selecting LogNormal distributions for λ and σ such that the initial mean basic reproductive number is 3.2 which is consistent with literature [2, 5, 6, 10, 12] . We set a LogNormal prior for the σ such that the mean incubation period is five days. We use the history of government interventions to set priors on change points in the spreading rate. The priors on change-points include 19/ 03/2020 when a travel ban and school closures were announced, and 28/03/2020 when a national lockdown was enforced. We keep the priors for the Lognormal distributions of the spreading rates after the change points weakly-informative by setting the same mean as λ 0 and higher variances across all change points. This has the effect of placing greater weight on the data driven likelihood. Similar to [6] we adopt weakly-informative Half-Cauchy priors for the initial conditions for the infected and exposed populations.Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Given that the closed-form inference of the posterior distributions on the parameters listed in Table 1 is infeasible, we make use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior. Monte Carlo methods approximate solutions [6, 10] . In this work, we explore inference using Metropolis-Hastings (MH), Slice Sampling and No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).Metropolis Hastings (MH). MH is one of the simplest algorithms for generating a Markov Chain which converges to the correct stationary distribution. The MH generates proposed samples using a proposal distribution. A new parameter state W t � is accepted or rejected probabilistically based on the posterior likelihood ratio:A common proposal distribution is a symmetric random walk obtained by adding Gaussian noise to a previously accepted parameter state. Random walk behaviour of such a proposal typically results in low sample acceptance rates. While sample acceptance is guaranteed with slice sampling, a large slice window can lead to computationally inefficient sampling while a small window can lead to poor mixing.Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Metropolis-Hastings (MH) and slice sampling tend to exhibit excessive random walk behaviour-where the next state of the Markov Chain is randomly proposed from a proposal distribution [13] [14] [15] . This results in low proposal acceptance rates and small effective sample sizes.HMC proposed by [16] reduces random walk behaviour by adding auxiliary momentum variables to the parameter space [15] . HMC creates a vector field around the current state using gradient information, which assigns the current state a trajectory towards a high probability next state [15] . The dynamical system formed by the model parameters W and the auxiliary momentum variables p is represented by the Hamiltonian H(W, p) written as follows [15, 16] :Where M(W) is the negative log-likelihood of the posterior distribution in Eq 7, also referred to as the potential energy. K(p) is the kinetic energy defined by the kernel of a Gaussian with a covariance matrix M [17] :The trajectory vector field is defined by considering the parameter space as a physical system that follows Hamiltonian Dynamics [15] . The dynamical equations governing the trajectory of the chain are then defined by Hamiltonian equations at a fictitious time t as follows [16] :In practical terms, the dynamical trajectory is discretised using the leapfrog integrator. In the leapfrog integrator to reach the next point in the path, we take half a step in the momentum direction, followed by a full step in the direction of the model parameters-then ending with another half step in the momentum direction.Due to the discretising errors arising from leapfrog integration a Metropolis acceptance step is then performed in order to accept or reject the new sample proposed by the trajectory [15, 18] . In the Metropolis step the parameters proposed by the HMC trajectory w � are accepted with the probability [16] :Pðw � jD; a; b; HÞ PðwjD; a; b; HÞAlgorithm 1 shows the pseudo-code for the HMC where � is a discretisation stepsize. The leapfrog steps are repeated until the maximum trajectory length L is reached. The HMC algorithm has multiple parameters that require tuning for efficient sampling, such as the step size and the trajectory length. In terms of trajectory length, a trajectory length that is too short leads to random walk behaviour similar to MH. While a trajectory length that is too long results in a trajectory that inefficiently traces back.The stepsize is also a critical parameter for sampling, small stepsizes are computationally inefficient leading to correlated samples and poor mixing while large stepsizes compound discretisation errors leading to low acceptance rates. Tuning these parameters requires multiple time consuming trial runs.NUTS automates the tuning of the leapfrog stepsize and trajectory length. In NUTS the stepsize is tuned during an initial burn-in phase by targeting particular levels of sample acceptance. The trajectory length is tuned by iteratively adding steps until either the chain starts to trace back (U-turn) or the Hamiltonian explodes (becomes infinite). We use the samplers described above to calibrate the SEIR and SIR models on daily new cases and cumulative cases data for South Africa up to and including 20 April 2020 provided by Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering(CSSE) [3] .SIR and SEIR model parameter inference was performed using confirmed cases data up to and including 20 April 2020 and MCMC samplers described in the methodology section. Each of the samplers are run such that 5000 samples are drawn with 1000 burn-in and tuning steps. We use leave-one-out(LOO) cross-validation error of [19] to evaluate the goodness of fit of each model. Table 2 shows the LOO validation errors of the various models. It can be seen that the SIR model with two change points as the best model fit with the lowest mean LOO of 448.00. The SEIR model with two change points showed a mean LOO of 459.94. We note that [6] similarly finds that the SIR model displayed superior goodness of fit to the SEIR on German data. We now further present detailed results of the SIR and SEIR models with inference using NUTS, the trace plots from these models indicating stationarity in the sampling chains are provided in S2 and S5 Figs. The trace plots for the SIR and SEIR models using MH are provided in S3 and S6 Figs, while similar trace plots for slice sampling are provided in S4 and S7 Figs. The trace plots largely indicate that the NUTS sampler displays greater agreement between parallel chains thus lower rhat values. Time-varying spread rates allow for inference of the impact of various state and societal interventions on the spreading rate. Fig 5 shows the fit and projections based on SIR models with zero, one and two change points. As can be seen from the plot the two change point model best captures the trajectory in the development of new cases relative to the zero and one change point models. The superior goodness of fit of the two change point model is also illustrated in Table 2 . The fit and projections showing similar behaviour on the SEIR model with various change points are shown in Fig 6. The mean reporting delay time in days was found to be 6.848 (CI [5.178, 8.165 ]), literature suggests this delay includes both the incubation period and the test reporting lags. The posterior distribution incubation period from the SEIR model in Fig 7 yields The inference of parameters is dependent on the underlying testing processes that generate the confirmed case data. The effect of the mass screening and testing campaign was to change the underlying confirmed case data generating process by widening the criteria of those eligible for testing. While initial testing focused on individuals that either had exposure to known cases or travelled to known COVID-19 affected countries, mass screening and testing further introduced detection of community level transmissions which may contain undocumented contact and exposure to COVID-19 positive individuals.We have performed Bayesian parameter inference of the SIR and SEIR models using MCMC and publicly available data as at 20 April 2020. The resulting parameter estimates fall in-line with the existing literature in-terms of mean baseline R 0 (before government action), mean incubation time and mean infectious period [2, 5, 6, 10] .We find that initial government action that mainly included a travel ban, school closures and stay-home orders resulted in a mean decline of 80% in the spreading rate. Further government action through mass screening and testing campaigns resulted in a second trajectory change point. This latter change point is mainly driven by the widening of the population eligible for testing, from travellers (and their known contacts) to include the generalised community who would have probably not afforded private lab testing which dominated the initial data. This resulted in an increase of R 0 to 1.304. The effect of mass screening and testing can also be seen in Fig 9 indicating a mean increase in daily tests preformed from 1639 to 4374.The second change point illustrates the possible existence of multiple pandemics, as suggested by [20] . Thus testing after 28 March is more indicative of community-level transmissions that were possibly not as well documented in-terms of contact tracing and isolation relative to the initial imported infection driven pandemic. This is also supported by the documented increase in public laboratory testing (relative to private) past this change point, suggesting health care access might also play a role in the detection of community-level infections [21] .We have utilised a Bayesian inference framework to infer time-varying spreading rates of COVID-19 in South Africa. The time-varying spreading rates allow us to estimate the effects of government actions on the dynamics of the pandemic.The results indicate a decrease in the mean spreading rate of 60%, which mainly coincides with the containment of imported infections, school closures and stay at home orders.The results also indicate the emergence of community-level infections which are increasingly being highlighted by the mass screening and testing campaign. The development of the community level transmissions (R 0 � 1.3041 (CI[0.887, 1.7748])) of the pandemic at the time of publication appears to be slower than that of the initial traveller based pandemic (R 0 � 3.278 (CI[2.715, 3.73])).A future improvement to this work could include extensions to regional and provincial studies as current data suggests varied spreading rates both regionally and provincially. As more government interventions come to play priors on more change points might also be necessary. ",South Africa,abstract,2020-08-05,08
1b0341eb5e50d4e2bbc944db949feef146fc2b8d,"Evaluation of knowledge, impacts and government intervention strategies during the COVID -19 pandemic in Nigeria Title Evaluation of knowledge, impacts and government intervention strategies during the COVID -19 pandemic in Nigeria Corresponding author","Part A: Socio-demographic information of respondents.The data was conducted among 387 respondents, from March 27th -April 7th, 2020. The participants were residents in different parts of Nigeria however, the majority of respondents (250) were from Lagos which is the epicenter of COVID-19 in Nigeria, 33 respondents were residents in Ogun state and 13 respondents were residents in the Federal Capital Territory. The remaining 91 respondents were from 23 states in the middle belt, northern, southwest, and southeastern parts of Nigeria (Table 1) . All the respondents have heard about the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown in Table 2 , 85 % of the responders know about the mode of transmission, symptoms, and preventive measure of the disease; 55 % of the respondents are aware of the causative agent of COVID-19. Many of the respondents (74 %) heard about COVID-19, through the mass media and over a month ago (as at the time of the survey). The perceived sadness and fear for COVID-19 were high among the respondents as 70 % stated that they are afraid of hearing the news about the virus. A significant number of participants (92 %) acknowledged that their communities are aware of COVID-19 through mass media and faith-based organizations. Most participants (94 %) indicated that social distancing can help prevent the spread of the virus. Table 2 Where N = total number of respondents and f = frequency (% Part C: Respiratory and personal hygiene Data in Table 3 shows there is a perceived capability to avoid COVID-19 among the subjects. Substantial proportions (52%) of respondents reported that they do cover their mouth with a tissue or handkerchief/elbow when sneezing or coughing as always recommended, 33 % of respondents indicated most of the time,13% indicated occasionally and 2% do not cover their mouth. There is a similar attitude of the respondents toward the use of alcohol-based hand rub or soap hand-wash when washing their hands, as 67% wash their hands with soap. Only 30% of the respondents do not wear any of the personal protective equipment (PPE) as shown in the Table. About 70% either wear PPE always, most of the time according to risk assessment or occasionally. Four percent of the participants reported having had close contact (within 1 meter) with a suspected or confirmed victim of COVID-19 while 88% of them believed they had not as shown in Table 3 . Three-quarters of the respondents reported that they sanitize/wash their hands after using an automated teller machine (ATM/POS); while those that sanitize/wash their hands after touching Nigerian currency were 59%. Majority of the respondents (over 90%) acknowledged that staying at home will help reduce the spread of COVID -19. Little above half of the respondents choose social distancing, movement restriction and use of face mask as precautionary measures they take against COVID-19 infection as shown in Table 3 . About 68% of the respondents pointed out that their personal or family's lifestyle is affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 while one-quarter said that it does not affect them as shown in Table 4 . Similar responses were also recorded on the effect of precautionary measures on their ability to do their job as well as financial losses. A substantial number of the participants expressed emotional distress, as evidenced by worry (65%), anxiety (42%), panic (35%), depression (16 %), while 3% are happy with the COVID-19 pandemic. During the stay at home order, 78% of the respondents indicated that they make use of the phone, two-third were spending time with their families, about half of the respondents were engaged in book reading, listening to music, while nearly three-quarter were sleeping, praying and resting. Thirty percent of respondents were engaged in exercises as shown in Table 4 . The confirmation of cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria and the public perception of the disease and concerns about Nigeria's level of preparedness are already fueling fear and panic in the country. The Nigeria government had reinforced its level of preparedness through public sensitization, the establishment of in-country COVID-19 diagnostic laboratories and isolation facilities, enforcement of lockdown order, and provision of palliatives to citizens. However, the survey, as shown in Table 5 indicated that the government's intervention in managing and curbing the spread of COVID-19 was insufficient as 59% of respondents believed that government intervention was insufficient. Meanwhile, about 3/4th of the participants reported that the provision of personal protective equipment (PPEs) was insufficient, while 11% answered that there was no provision of PPEs. Moreover, it shows that only 18% believed that the government had provided adequate PPEs for her health workers in combating COVID-19, 37% of respondents disagreed while 44% were not sure. As shown in Table 5 , over 30% of the respondents either agreed or disagreed that the information provided by the health authorities to the public was accurate, while 27% of respondents remained indifferent. Similar opinions were recorded for the action taken by the health authority in each state of residence of the participants. Table 5 shows that equal proportions (about one fourth) of the participants disagree, agree, or indifferent that they have had the chance to express their personal views and concerns to the authorities if they wanted to. To alleviate the burden caused by the lockdown effect of COVID-19 on the citizens, over 70% of the participants felt that relief materials and support provided by the government to her citizens were inadequate. In contrast, 10% agreed on the adequacy of materials and support provided by the government as shown in Table 5 . It was observed as shown in Table 6 that the knowledge of the outbreak of COVID-19 was influenced by the age (p < 0.05), gender (p < 0.05), level of education (p < 0.05), marital status (p < 0.05) and employment status (p < 0.05).. Both age (p = 0.03) and level of education (p < 0.05) influenced the respiratory and personal hygiene of the respondents while only age significantly (p = 0.02) influenced the perception of the respondents towards the government intervention strategies. None of the sociodemographic variables significantly (p > 0.05) influenced the perception of the respondents on the impact of the outbreak and lockdown. The data showed that 99.7% of the respondents were aware of the outbreak irrespective of age, gender, level of education, marital and employment status and the participants were all affected although at different levels. This was a cross-sectional data carried out in Nigeria and a Snowball sampling technique was used. Using the Google form, an online questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was distributed through electronic means, and this was easily shared on social media including WhatsApp [1] which is a smartphone/desktop enabled social media platform with over one billion global users [2] . The participants who were the first point of contact were encouraged to disseminate the link of the survey to other contacts, this enabled the survey to reach as many respondents as possible. Data collected through the Google form commenced from March 27 to April 7, 2020, during the lockdown period in Nigeria. Participation in the data was voluntary and participants could withdraw at any time. On receiving and clicking the link, participants were auto directed to the synopsis that explained the purpose of the data, and only the participants that consented were included in the data. Participants were directed to complete the demographic details then a set of several questions followed which the participants were to answer. No personal or private data was collected and similarly, the data collection procedure followed the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki on human subjects [3] . It was an online data therefore participants with access to the internet could participate. All participants resident in any of the states in Nigeria, 16 years and above, were eligible. The authors were able to collect data from across various states of Nigeria. The socio-demographic variables included age, gender, employment status, education, marital status, and state of residence. The questionnaire (Part A -E) consisted of the following sections: socio-demographic information as described by Odeyemi et al. [4] , awareness of COVID-19, respiratory and personal hygiene undertaken by participants, impacts on health, emotion, finances, and the effectiveness of government intervention. Questions on the awareness of COVID-19 that were asked included symptoms of the disease, source (s) of information about the outbreak, time of awareness, and social distancing. Eight questions on respiratory and personal hygiene such as the covering of the mouth with a tissue or handkerchief/elbow when sneezing or coughing, the use of soap or alcohol to sanitize the hands, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing, washing or sanitizing hands after handling / withdrawing cash, and effect of the lockdown. The researchers also examined the impact of the outbreak on the participants' personal or family lifestyle, job, income, and emotions. Similarly, the survey asked the participants if they spent time with family and or did the following: reading books, listening to music, exercising, sleeping/resting, using phone, praying, and working remotely. The last part evaluated the perception of the participants regarding the government's intervention strategies in curbing the spread of the virus, adequate provision of PPE to the health workers and citizens [5] , timely dissemination of COVID-19 related information to the public and provision of relief materials. The above questions were then designed and grouped into six parts (A-E) using Google form. Google form was used because it enabled the questionnaire to be sent electronically while the responses are collected in real-time and automatically available in Google spreadsheets. More so, due to the lockdown, the questionnaire could not be distributed physically. Therefore, there was no facility to check the validity of the information provided by the respondents thereby making it impossible to track biases. Nevertheless, this is not without agreement with previous findings on the impacts of outbreak of virus/disease on public's emotion and behaviour [6] [7] The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics to describe the socio-demographic information [8] , while analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to describe the effect of the independent variables on awareness, myths, impacts and government intervention using statistical package for social sciences -IBM SPSS v 25 [6, 8] .",Nigeria,abstract,2020-08-17,08

As a learning from the current experience, we recommend; a multisectoral engagement, better planning, a decentralized food distribution, and formulation of clear food distribution guidelines to guide the future responses. Use of mobile cash transfers to reach out to the food insecure households can support local economies and lower the cost on middlemen and interrelated corruption.Following the country lockdown presidential directive as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, a relief food distribution campaign was issued on the 25 th -March -2020 [1] . Uganda's Coronavirus Response Team at the forefront specified on the following measures; that food was to be distributed primarily to the urban poor who are affected by the nationwide lockdown; as a matter of urgency, priority was given to the urban groups in the central region (Capital -Kampala and neighbouring Wakiso district); the beneficiaries being small business operators who earn hand to mouth, the elderly, sickly, and lactating mothers; rations to include 6kg of maize flour per person, 3kg of beans per person, and salt (it was slated that lactating mothers and the sick were to receive 2kgs of powdered milk and 2kgs of sugar). Other districts of Uganda were scheduled to be reached depending on the resources mobilised during the response campaign. As a measure to cab the spread of the virus, security forces were given the responsibility to undertake the household-based food distribution exercise. It was designated to be house to house, door to door, as a measure to avoid crowding and to maintain social distancing [1] .Many Ugandans have criticized the design of the food relief strategy with predicted ambiguities [2, 3] . At more than three months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the government food support strategy seems to have a slow bearing.Primarily, the food relief program projection of 1.5 million as the number of people who will need food support was an underestimation. Majority of vulnerable households have not benefited from the food donation exercise, including many urban poor and rural dwellers scattered in different regions of Uganda. The unpredicted end to the lockdown, continued restrictions and muddle continue to suppress the relief food program and the livelihood of the low socio-economic class. The government has continued to mobilize relief donations from stakeholders and urged individuals to make food donations to those at risk within the neighbourhood. Also, the supply of high-quality food staffs especially posho and beans is being compromised as a result of aflatoxin, soil, sandy particles and other physical impurities in food because of poor crop methods in the gardens and post-harvest handling at drying, sorting, storage, processing and packaging [4] . The lack of clear guidelines on quality and the process of contribution seems to play against the pooling of resources and distribution of donations. The result has been unceasing arrests, restrictions and threats to charge whoever is found distributing relief food in the community. Similarly, stories reported on the local media have revealed that quality of care for people living with HIV and expectant mothers has been negatively impacted by the lockdown-in terms of adherence to treatment. Poor access to food still plaques majority of Ugandans living especially in the rural and unevenly distributed by region [5] . Uganda is ranked among the low-income food-deficit countries, and the most affected region being Karamoja, Bukedi and Busoga region. Putting into consideration the contributors to food insecurity (lack of choice, anxiety of running out of food, forced changes in preferred eating habits) due to economic constraints [6] and the disruption in routine as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the population at risk turns out to be scattered countrywide.To better tackle the food relief response exercise, below is what we recommend; (i) Office of the prime minister alone is not enough-in such nationwide food relief response. Now that Uganda has a well-established decentralised system right from the district level to the village setting. It is therefore important to consider using the already established systems to undertake nationwide food distribution campaigns. This can be further strengthened by the use of an already grounded system such as local council representatives and Village Health Teams (VHTs) during the food distribution planning process. Currently, the local council office bears an updated record of the welfare status of its community members at a village level, and the VHTs have the responsibility of mobilization of village members for community health activities. In that way, they are conversant of the settings where they operate and belong especially in slums and rural communities. Consultation of the above systems henceforth during the design and implementation of relief food programs during similar epidemics is very key. This will ease identification and making right estimations of households that are at a higher risk of becoming food insecure and the engagement of stakeholders. It will also allow the security forces to remain with their role of provision of security during such emergencies [7] (ii) involvement of the line ministries (Finance, agriculture, health, research institutions) through a multisectoral approach will enable effective planning of food distribution, price restrictions of food items and inspection at a national level (iii) proper planning ought to utilise the COVID-19 disease spread model to estimate the speed and pattern, both geographically and overtime to design appropriate food distribution plans (iv) It is important to plan as a country and rejuvenate the regional stock centers for food in silos countrywide to avoid depending on donations during a nationwide emergency (v) During a food relief response to a countrywide emergency such as this, clear standard operating procedures and measures should be communicated to guide the entire process. One of the avenues would be the use of mobile cash transfers to the food insecure urban and local residents during pandemics such as COVID-19. This is a tool that can be fast, support local economies but also reduces the cost on middlemen and related corruption.Uganda's food insecurity remains classified as serious. Food relief consideration in a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic ought to be planned well to cater for all pockets of stress due to hunger among underprivileged households scattered countrywide.",Uganda,abstract,2020-08-10,08

To control the spread of the epidemic, countries around 31 the world have adopted a series of effective measures, such as city lockdowns, home 32 quarantine and production suspension [3, 4] . These measures have achieved 33 conspicuous results. However, these measures inevitably bring inconvenience to 34 residents' lives, which changes their lifestyles and further affects their health. 35 Sleep is an essential part of our daily life and a significant predictor of residents' In our study, self-reported economic status was surveyed using a question,""What do you think of your current financial situation?"" with four response options, 94 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ""very bad"", ""bad"", ""fair"", and ""good"".

The WHO African region has the lowest incidence rate with many countries reporting fewer than 1500 confirmed cases. The United Republic of Tanzania confirmed its first case on 16 March 2020 and to the date of this paper has reported 509 cases of COVID-19. The government has issued standard operating procedures for the screening, triaging, and isolation of suspected COVID-19 patients. We report the case of a woman with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who was admitted to Muhumbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, with 3 the sole presenting symptom of severe headache. She was not suspected to have COVID-19 until she developed respiratory symptoms on the fifth day of admission.The patient is a 76-year-old female resident of a densely-populated area of Dar es Salaam. Her past medical history includes hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her only complaint on presentation to the emergency department was severe generalized headache with pain extending to the neck for two days. She denied fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, confusion, or seizure. On exam, she was afebrile, fully alert, and neurologically intact. Cranial nerve and motor exam were normal. She had no signs of meningeal irritation.She was admitted to the female general neurology ward. Brain CT could not be obtained because the scanner was under repair and consequently lumbar puncture was deferred. Brain MRI with contrast and MRA were requested and nimodipine was prescribed because of concern of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The MRI and MRA were completed on the fourth day of admission and did not show evidence for cerebral aneurysm, stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, or meningitis ( Figure 1 ).On the fifth day of admission, the patient developed dry cough, shortness of breath, reduced appetite, and nausea with occasional vomiting. She was afebrile. Pulse oximetry showed an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air and chest X-ray revealed patchy bilateral lower lobe infiltrates ( Figure 2 ). The patient was transferred to the COVID-19 ward and placed on nasal cannula oxygen support. She was treated with intravenous amoxacllin/clavulanic acid, montelukast, salbutamol inhaler, and pantoprazole. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was obtained on the seventh day of admission and tested positive with SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (rRT)-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Additional blood tests were ordered. Abnormal results included the following: C-reactive protein 124 mg/L, ESR 115 mm/hr, LDH 825 U/L, ferritin 538 ng/ml, hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, and sodium 131 mmol/L. Normal results included the following: absolute lymphocyte count 2.12 x 10 9 /L, platelet count 163 x 10 9 /L, creatinine 79.5 µmol/L, and negative HIV 1/2 serology.On the ninth day of admission, she was transferred to a designated COVID-19 ward at another hospital in Dar es Salaam. She was treated with azithromycin 500 mg daily for six days and is receiving enoxaparin 60 mg twice daily. Her headache resolved completely in one week and she has not developed any other neurological symptoms. Her respiratory status is improving, and she no longer requires supplemental oxygen.In a meta-analysis of 38 retrospective studies involving 3,062 COVID-19 patients in China, headache was recorded at a frequency of 15.4% 2 . In an observational study of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients treated in Europe, defined as not requiring intensive care, headache was reported by 70.3% of participants using a standardized questionnaire 3 . However, the severity of headache and the timing of headache symptoms in relation to respiratory symptoms were not described in these reports. Our patient presented with symptoms of severe generalized headache without respiratory symptoms or fever and was not suspected to have COVID-19 until 5 she developed dry cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia on the fifth day of admission.Except for holocephalic headache, she did not have clinical symptoms or signs of increased intracranial pressure. Since lumbar puncture was not done, we cannot exclude the possibility of meningitis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, brain MRI did not show leptomeningeal Patients admitted with acute severe headache without identified intracranial pathology should be screened daily for at least one week for other COVID-19 symptoms and considered for early isolation and testing with SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR to prevent exposure of other patients and hospital staff.The authors report no relevant disclosures.

131dbcca5405d7c55533aeb8838bbcdb4a606e66,Insights into The Codon Usage Bias of 13 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Isolates from Different Geo-locations,"Baltimore classified viruses into six classes by the means of their genomes. One class is shared between RNA and DNA viruses, while three of them are occupied solely by RNA viruses reflecting their great diversity and different replicative mechanisms (Baltimore, 1971) . Over the past few decades, many human infectious diseases including ebola virus disease (EVD), avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted from the interspecies transmission of zoonotic RNA viruses (Epstein et al., 2005; Leroy et al., 2005;  ≥ 1.6 indicates overrepresented or putative preferred codons (Duret and Mouchiroud, 1999; Liu et al., 2010; Mandal et al., 2020; Sharp and Li, 1987) .(2)(1)The effective number of codons (ENc) determines the degree of preference for the unbalanced use of codons, regardless of the gene length and numbers of amino acids. ENc values range from 20, indicating extreme codon usage bias as only one synonymous codon is used for the corresponding amino acid, to 61, indicating no bias but the use of all possible synonymous codons equally. Therefore, the ENc value correlates negatively with the codon usage bias. Also, it is generally accepted that genes have significant codon usage bias when the ENc value is ≤ 35 (Comeron and Aguadé, 1998) , (Wright, 1990) . ENc was calculatedNeutrality plot is used to estimate the effect of mutation pressure and natural selection on codon usage bias. In this study, the GC contents at the first, second and third codon positions (GC1, GC2, GC3, respectively) of the 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates were analyzed. Then, GC12representing the average GC content at the first and second codon positions of each isolate was obtained. Both GC12 and GC3 values were used for neutrality plot analysis. If the correlation between GC12 and GC3 is statistically significant and the slope of the regression line is close to 1, mutation pressure is assumed to be the main force structuring codon usage bias. Conversely, natural selection would have higher odds leading to a narrow distribution of GC content and a lack of correlation between GC12 and GC3 (Jia and Xue, 2009; Song et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2015) .The GRAVY value is calculated by dividing the sum of hydropathy values of all amino acids in a sequence by the number of residues (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) . GRAVY values range between -2.0 and +2.0, with positive values indicating protein hydrophobicity, while negative values indicate protein hydrophilicity.The AROMO value reflects the recurrence of aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine in a given amino acid sequence.The Parity Rule 2 (PR2) bias was calculated based on the values of A/U-bias 'A3 / (A3 + U3)' and G/C-bias 'G3 / (G3 + C3)', they were plotted as the ordinate and abscissa, respectively. The centre of the plot is the place where both coordinates are 0.5, as well as, A = U and G = C according to Chargaff's rule (PR2) (Rapoport and Trifonov, 2013) .Codon adaptation index (CAI) uses a reference set of highly expressed genes (e.g. ribosomal genes), this measure is an indicator of gene expression levels and natural selection; it ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating stronger bias with respect to the reference set, therefore this method is an indicator of selection for a bias toward translational efficiency (Ran and Higgs, 2012; Sharp and Li, 1987) . Codon adaptation index (CAI) was calculated by the equation given by (Lee, 2018; Ran and Higgs, 2012) :where L is the count of codons in the gene and w c(k) is the relative adaptiveness value for the k-th codon in the gene.Twelve genes with the highest level of expression in the lung tissues for human were collected from the human protein atlas project database (https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/lung). Then, CAI values for the 13 isolates were calculated based on those 12 genes as a reference set.The tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI) is a measure of tRNA usage by a CDS considering the fact that the tRNA gene copy number of some genomes has a high positive correlation with tRNA abundance within a cell, as well as, codon usage preferences (dos Reis et al., 2004) . Recently, a novel approach was developed that estimates species-specific tAI wobble weights by optimizing the correlation between a measure of codon usage bias and tAI, without the need to utilize the gene expression measurements of the test organism (based on the CUB) (Renana and Tamir, 2014) . The frequencies of tRNAs of Homo sapiens was obtained from the GtRNAdb (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/) (Chan and Lowe, 2009).The relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI) is a comparative measure that is used to determine the codon deoptimization trends by comparing the similarity in codon usage between a given coding sequence and a reference genome (Mueller et al., 2006) . If the tested coding sequence of a virus has a similar codon usage pattern to the human genome, the RCDI value would be closer to or equal 1, which may indicate a high translation rate, as well as, a better adaptation to the host. RCDI values greater than 1 indicates a deviation from the normal human codon usage bias (deoptimized viral genome). In this study, the synonymous codon usage patterns for Homo sapiens were used as a reference and obtained from the CUD.Non-synonymous codons and termination codons were excluded from the analysis. The RCDI was calculated using the following equation (Mueller et al., 2006) :Where C i F a is the observed relative frequency of codon i to other synonymous codons for the same amino acid in the tested CDS; C i F h is the normal relative frequency of codon i for a specific amino acid in the reference genome sequence; N Ci is the number of incidences of codon i in the CDS; and N is the total number of codons in the CDS.A dendrogram was constructed using 13 complete genomic sequences of 13 SARS-CoV-2isolates obtained from different geo-locations (Countries). Evolutionary relationships were inferred by using maximum-likelihood statistical method with general time-reversible (GTR) model implemented in MEGA-X software (v10.1) (Tamura et al., 2011) . The bootstrap method with 1000 replicates was used to test the reliability of the phylogenetic tree. For each isolate, the following data are given: Species and country of origin.Spearman's rank correlation and linear regression analyses were performed using R isolates. The RCDI was calculated using a python script (available upon request). tAI was calculated using stAIcalc (Sabi et al., 2017) . The cluster analysis (Heat map) was performed using CIMminer (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cimminer/) based on the RSCU values obtained from the tested isolates. Multiple sequence alignments for the whole genome of the 13 SARS-CoV-2 was done with MAFFT software (v7.450) and the phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA-X software (v10.1).The analysis of nucleotide content of the coding sequences (CDSs) in all tested SARS-CoV-2isolates showed A and U nucleotides richness, in comparison to G and C nucleotides, as well as, AU bias in all codon positions (Supplementary file 2, and Figure 1 ). The average usage (%) of U was the highest (33.24 ± 4.75%) among the four nucleotides; A (28.91 ± 3.74%)showed the highest usage after U, followed by C (19.50 ± 2.88%), while G showed the lowest usage (18.32 ± 2.22%). A similar trend of nucleotides content at the third positions of synonymous codons was observed (U3% > A3% > C3% > G3%); where U3% (40.07 ± 4.51%) and A3% (27.68 ± 3.83%) were higher than C3% (18.37 ± 3.92%) and G3% (13.86 ± 2.47%). The mean AU and GC values were 62.16 ± 4.78% and 37.83 ± 4.78%, and the mean AU3% and GC3% values were 67.79 ± 5.01% and 32.20 ± 5.014%, respectively.Synonymous Dinucleotide Usage (SDU) was employed to reveal underrepresented and overrepresented dinucleotides in the second and third codon positions (frame 2). The average SDU values for each dinucleotide in all examined isolates were reported by a bar plot ( Figure   2 ). Seven dinucleotides exhibited overrepresentation (SDU > 1), in descending order (CpU, UpU, ApA, GpU, CpA, UpA, and ApU). All these dinucleotides are A/U-ended (A-ended: 3, U-ended: 4) reflecting the A/U-bias of SARS-CoV-2 genomes at the third codon positions.On the other hand, nine dinucleotides showed underrepresentation (SDU < 1), in ascending order (CpC, GpG, ApG, CpG, UpG, GpC, UpC, ApC, and GpA). Eight out of the nine underrepresented dinucleotides were G/C-ended (G-ended: 4, C-ended: 4).In According to the cluster analysis, the following isolates showed similar synonymous codon usage patterns: (i) India and Spain, (ii) China, Pakistan, Vietnam, Nepal, and Taiwan, (iii)Australia, Sweden, Brazil, and Italy. Meanwhile, both, South Korea and USA isolates grouped themselves from the remaining ones reflecting their unique synonymous codon usage patterns. Interestingly, cluster analysis results were comparable with the phylogenetic analysis suggesting that patterns of synonymous codon usage were able to reflect the evolutionary relationships between tested isolates ( Figure S1 ).In theory, ENc correlates negatively with CUB. To better understand the relations between SARS-CoV-2 genes composition and codon usage bias, an ENc-GC3 plot was drawn. If the codon usage pattern is only affected by GC3 resulting from mutation pressure, the data points should be just on or near the expected curve drawn by equation (5) and shown in (Figure 4 ). In the figure, though some points fell onto the expected curve, the majority were far from the curve. The results indicated that codon usage bias tended to be stronger when GC contents were lower, and vice versa. Therefore, U will be preferred over A and likewise C will be preferred over G, in other words, pyrimidines are preferred over purines in SARS-CoV-2.ENc-GC3 plot and parity analyses reflected the main factors influencing the codon usage bias of SARS-CoV-2, but they did not estimate precisely which of mutation pressure or natural selection was more important. Then a neutrality plot was constructed based on the average GC3 and GC12 contents of SARS-CoV-2 genes ( Figure 6 ). The plot revealed a narrow distribution range (0.262-0.39) of GC3 contents, while GC12 contents were relatively wide (0.274-0.518). The correlation between GC1 and GC2 was strong (r = 0.76, P =.016), meanwhile, neither GC1 nor GC2 showed significant correlation with GC3 (r = 0.14, P =.69), reflecting that codon usage is affected by mutation pressure to a very limited degree. In addition, the slope of the regression line revealed that mutation pressure only accounted for 18.4% of SARS-CoV-2 codon usage, while natural selection together with some other factors accounted for the remaining 81.6%.To determine the degree of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 codon usage to Homo sapiens, the CAI values for the complete coding region and individual genes of each isolate was calculated using the most expressed genes in human lung tissues (the reservoir of viral host cells) as a reference set. The average CAI value for the complete coding region was 0.54 ± 0.0003 (Supplementary file 4) . In addition, the CAI values of different genes ranged from 0.48 to 0.62 (Figure 7 , and Supplementary file 2). The N, ORF7a, and S genes had the highest average CAI values (0.62 ± 0.0008, 0.58 ± 0.0000, 0.56 ± 0.0002, respectively) among other genes, while the E gene had the lowest CAI value (0.48 ± 0.001).The relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI) was measured by comparing the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 to Homo sapiens. In order to assess the influence of translational selection on SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias, The nucleotide compositions in the genes of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed and correlated with the RSCU patterns. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is found to be rich in AU as compared to GC overall content, as well as, in all codon positions. In addition, all overrepresented codons were A/U-ended, whereas overwhelming majorities of underrepresented codons were G/Cended.During the course of evolution, many vertebrate RNA viruses tended to exhibit reduced frequencies of CpG-containing codons, such observation can be explained by a host specific selection pressure acting against CpG dinucleotides driven by their innate immune response (Belalov and Lukashev, 2013) . In this study, CpG dinucleotide was among the most four underrepresented dinucleotides in frame 2 (second and third codon positions) of SARS-CoV-genes (ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8), indicating that mutation pressure may be a factor in the formation of SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias, but other independent factors such as natural selection strongly affected the codon usage bias pattern reflecting their importance over the mutation pressure. Then, a PR2 bias plot was generated to confirm that the pattern of codon usage is not only affected by mutation pressure. The results showed a clear bias in the third codon position of four-codon amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 genes. This observation also indicated that natural selection pressure might play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias, and mutation pressure would be a minor factor. In order to accurately estimate the effect of mutation pressure and natural selection on the CUB, a neutrality plot was drawn. When the CUB is only affected by mutation pressure, the quantitative relation between GC3 and GC12should be nearly equal, and the slope would be 1. In this study, GC1 and GC2 showed no significant correlation with GC3 and the slope of regression line revealed that mutation pressure only accounted for 18.4% of SARS-CoV-2 codon usage, while natural selection together with some other factors accounted for the remaining 81.6%. Accordingly, natural selection played a very important or even a dominant role in the formation of SARS-CoV-2 codon usage. Furthermore, to determine whether codon choices were influenced by hydropathicity, a correlation analysis was performed between ENc, GRAVY, and AROMO (Table 1) . The results showed no correlation between codon usage and aromaticity; however, a significant positive correlation was found between codon usage and hydrophobicity of SARS-CoV-2 coding sequences reflecting its effect on CUB. The link between hydropathy and codon usage may be caused by the fact that the expressed sequences are hydrophilic just because they accomplish their function in the aqueous media of the cell (Zhong et al., 2007) .Furthermore, a correlation analysis was performed between the average tAI and ENc values of SARS-CoV-2 genes. The analysis revealed a positive significant correlation (r = 0.66, P =.04) (Table 1) , which implies that translational selection significantly influenced the pattern of codon usage in SARS-CoV-2. These results combined confirm the dominance of natural selection over mutation pressure in shaping the CUB of SARS-CoV-2.In order to determine to what extent SARS-CoV-2 is adapted to Homo sapiens, two adaptation indices were used (CAI and RCDI). The codon adaptation index (CAI) is an indicator of gene expression, and is normally used to design nucleotide sequences suitable for maximal protein production (Gustafsson et al., 2012) . The higher the CAI value the higher the gene expression, and vice versa. The 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates used in the analysis showed an overall average CAI value of 0.54 ± 0.0003 for the complete coding region, which is comparatively slightly lower than the CAI values of viruses from other studies in relation to Homo sapiens, indicating moderate SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to Homo sapiens (Butt et al., 2016; Khandia et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2018) . However, at the individual genes level, different CAI values have been observed. The highest CAI value was recorded for the N gene encoding for the nucleocapsid protein (0.62 ± 0.0008) which plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly (Nelson et al., 2005) . ORF7a encoding for the 7a accessory protein recorded the second highest CAI value of 0.58 ± 0.0000, which may play a role in viral assembly or budding events unique to SARS-CoV (Chang et al., 2014) . Interestingly, only a small amounts of the envelope protein encoded by the E gene is sufficient to trigger the formation of virus-like particles (Nelson et al., 2005) , which may explain its lowest CAI In summary, the findings of this study revealed that the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 is slightly biased similar to most studied RNA viruses, and the influence of natural selection is more profound than that of mutation pressure in shaping the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. Other factors including compositional constraints and hydrophobicity also affected SARS-CoV-2 CUB. Overall, the 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates used in the analysis showed almost identical patterns of codon usage reflecting the small evolutionary changes between them. The findings of this study may help in understanding the underlying factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, adaptation, and fitness toward Homo sapiens.Wu, Y., Zhao, D., Tao (iv). the frequency of each nucleotide at the third codon position (A3%, U3%, G3%, C3%) ",Egypt,first author,2020-08-07,08

c38e880323170dac28e61407669319d23b5f2962,COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy and Thrombotic Complications,"Since December 2019, cases of pneumonia linked to a new coronavirus have been reported in China. 1 This coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, causes a disease called COVID-19 (COrona-VirusDisease of 2019). It is an emerging infectious disease of viral zoonosis type. In a context that has become epidemic within a few weeks, every health care professional has an essential role to play. On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by its high contagiousness and its unusual potential lethality. Human-to-human transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, especially when people cough or sneeze, or via manual contact with a contaminated surface, as the virus can survive for several days on inert surfaces. 3 The incubation period is between 2 and 14 days, with an average of 5 days. Asymptomatic patients are contaminating, and transmission of the virus is most important in the few days preceding symptoms and during the first days of illness. 4, 5 The diagnosis of COVID-19 disease is based on the performance of RT-PCR on a deep nasal swab. The negative predictive value depends on whether or not there are clinical signs and the penetration rate of the infection in the studied population.When combined with a chest CT scan (without injection), the sensitivity increases to 97%. Radiological images or RT-PRC alone have a sensitivity of 88% and 59-85%, respectively. 6 A significant proportion of infected people have no symptoms but can transmit the disease. The most frequent clinical signs of COVID-19 are those of acute pulmonary infection, ranging from paucisymptomatic forms or those suggestive of mild pneumonia to very severe forms with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), even multi-visceral failure and death. Forms with digestive symptoms (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) or initially non-febrile may be at the forefront. Other reported symptoms include headache, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. Sudden anosmia without nasal obstruction and dysgeusia are described from day 6-7, as well as frostbite or pseudo-frostbite. In the elderly, deceptive neurological forms are described (concentration disorders, confusion . . . ). 2, [4] [5] [7] [8] [9] Overall, in the symptomatic forms, 80% of patients present mild to moderate signs, 15% will have a more severe form, and 5% will develop severe forms with ARDS and the need for mechanical ventilation. We can schematically identify 3 evolutionary phases: an initial phase (paucisymptomatic), an intermediate phase (pneumonia), and a final hyperinflammatory phase (respiratory failure, vasoplegia, shock). If the initial phase is due to viral replication, progression to the following stages is associated with an uncontrolled immunological and inflammatory response (""cytokine storm""). 10 The chronology of clinical worsening is not always stereotyped, with worsening of pneumonia, if occur, between day 7 and day 12 of progression but maybe earlier and extremely abrupt. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Mortality in the intensive care unit is estimated at 30-60%. 12 A report of 72.314 cases from the Chinese CDC revealed several risk factors associated with the worsening of the disease and mortality, including age over 70 years, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and chronic respiratory or renal failure. 13 In Italy, among 355 deaths, the risk factors predictive of death included older age, a high SOFA score(Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), and the presence of comorbidities. 14 On admission, many patients with pneumonia have polynucleosis and deep lymphopenia, reported in 84% of cases. C reactive protein (CRP) levels increase in proportion to the severity of the disease. 4,5 Some biological abnormalities are associated with a poorer prognosis, notably the depth of lymphopenia and a major increase in markers of inflammation (CRP, ferritin . . . ). Other abnormalities are observed in severe forms such as increased transaminase, LDH, troponin, and acute renal failure. Several data show that coagulopathy is also central to the process of degradation of the clinical condition of patients. [4] [5] [13] [14] [15] Hemostasis Disorders During COVID-19During the Chinese epidemic, a ""coagulopathy"" was initially described in the first severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this data has also been reported by European teams. 5, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The first described abnormalities are marked rise in D-Dimer (DD) and rather moderate thrombocytopenia, correlated with a higher risk of admission to intensive care and a higher death rate. 5 Other hemostasis abnormalities are reported, less consistently or even contradictory, and their prognostic implications are more controversial, such as increased APTT and decreased PT/INR. Data published by Tang et al. from a cohort of 183 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized revealed a mortality rate of 11.5%. The increase in DD was found in more than 71% of the patients who died from ARDS. 17 Those patients showed evidence of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as defined by the validated International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) by the DIC score. 21 However, the most common coagulopathy pattern observed in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is characterized by elevations in fibrinogen and DD levels and should not be misinterpreted as DIC. Unlike the pattern seen in classic DIC from other sepsis or trauma, prolongation of the aPTT and/or PT is minimal, and thrombocytopenia is mild in COVID-19 patients.The implication of this coagulopathy in the deterioration process of COVID-19 patients is confirmed by another Chinese study that analyzed clinical and biological data from a cohort of 201 patients with pneumonia. Patients who died (22%) from ARDS had a significant increase in DD compared to patients with ARDS who survived (890 vs. 5270 ng/mL; p ¼ 0.001). 18 The study by Zhou et al. compared 54 patients who died and 137 survivors; hospital mortality was associated in multivariate analysis with advanced age, SOFA score >5 and DD rate over 1000 ng/mL (p ¼ 0.003). For a DD rate exceeding 1000 ng/mL the OR of death was 18.4 (p ¼ 0.003). 16 An analysis in Ireland noted a significant increase in DD in ICU patients (1003 vs. 804 ng/mL; p ¼ 0.018). 19 A recent pooled analysis, including 6 original studies among hospitalized patients with moderate to critical COVID-19 (n ¼ 1355), indicates that DD levels are significantly associated with the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. 22 Table 1 resumes data on the correlation between the rate of DD and the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients for COVID-19.It is interesting to note that the importance of coagulopathy in the deterioration process of COVID-19 patients had already been documented in studies conducted on severe pulmonary forms with the 2 famous Coronaviruses previously described, 25 Among several biomarkers tested in these patients, coagulation abnormalities were not similar to those observed in SARS-CoV-2. Prolongation of APTT and significant thrombocytopenia were dominating the picture, and increased DD were reported but without being strongly correlated with poor prognosis. 26 Alterations in hemostasis and the resulting procoagulant nature during the COVID-19 are associated with a significant increase in thrombotic complications, which are currently better documented in the literature.These thrombotic events have been little or no reported in the Chinese literature, possibly because of the importance of race and ethnicity. Indeed, epidemiological studies previously noted that the thromboembolic risk is 3 to 4 times lower in the Chinese population compared to the Caucasian population. 27 The first descriptions report clinical findings in the field; with thrombotic complications becoming more frequent, the more severe the disease was. These descriptions varied from classic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) to unusual thrombosis of central lines or arterial catheters, very early thromboses of extra-renal hemodialysis filters, and ECMO cannulas. Conversely, very few hemorrhagic complications have been reported.Among the Chinese studies, the first reports a DVT rate of 25% of the 81 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in ICU. It should be noted that screening for DVT by ultrasound (US) of the lower limbs was carried out without, however, being systematic. These patients had a significantly higher rate of DD than patients without VTE (5200 + 300 vs. 800 + 1200 ng/mL, p < 0.001). 28 A very recent publication reports a much higher figure in 2 other hospitals in Wuhan; 85.4% of the 48 patients hospitalized in the ICU, screened by venous lower legs US, had DVT. 29 The first European publications come from the Netherlands. Klok et al. reported a cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications of 31%, after a 7-day follow-up, in 184 patients with a severe form of COVID-19 in ICU. PE was the most common complication (n ¼ 25, 81%). The presence of coagulopathy with PT prolongation >3 s and/or APTT >5.1 s was strongly associated with thrombotic events with an estimated HR of 4.1 (95% CI 1.9-9.1). 30 Data from a second Dutch team included follow-up of 198 COVID-19 patients, 37% of whom were ICU patients. The overall incidence of VTE was 17%, of which 11% were symptomatic. Screening for DVT by US was performed in about 1/3 of the patients during their hospital stay. Pulmonary CT scan was performed only in patients with worsening hypoxia or markedly elevated DD. The cumulative VTE incidence at day 7 and day 14 was 15% and 34%. It was higher in ICU, reaching 48% of patients at day 14. In this study, after adjusting for age, sex, and ICU stays, VTE was associated with a 3-fold risk of death (HR: 2.9; 95% CI, 1.02-8.0). 31 In France, Helms et al. reported on a prospective cohort of 150 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU for ARDS, an overall incidence of VTE disease of 18%, mostly PEs. Compared to a historical cohort of matched patients hospitalized for ARDS not related to COVID-19, the risk of PE was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort (OR: 6.2; 11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.01). 32 A second prospective study of 107 consecutive cases of ICU COVID-19 patients found a cumulative incidence of PE of 20.6%. The authors also noted 2 to 3 times more PE cases compared to a matched population, hospitalized in ICU in 2019 for severe non-COVID-19 pneumonia, or related to H1N1 infection. 33 From a radiological point of view, 3 studies analyzing pulmonary CT angiography performed in COVID-19 patients with respiratory difficulties noted an incidence of PE in 20%, 23%, and 30% of studied scans, respectively. [34] [35] [36] Patients with PE were most often hospitalized in the ICU (74% of cases), on mechanical ventilation (65% of cases), and male (91% of cases). 34 The authors, therefore, recommend changing practices at patient's admission, favoring examination by pulmonary CT angiography, rather than chest CT, in cases of severe respiratory symptoms.It is important to note that nearly 1/3 of patients were still hospitalized at the time of the publication of these studies, and it can be expected that the real incidence of VTE is underestimated. As an illustration, the updated study by Klok et al. notes a cumulative incidence of VTE with adjustment for deaths of 49%, including 65 cases of PE at 14-day followup, 37 compared to 31% at 7-day follow-up. 30 To summarize, given the heterogeneity of the studies and the variations of patient selection across studies and in addition to that a high risk for selection bias, it is difficult to determine a precise rate of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Overall, in observational reports, VTE is reported in 15 to 20% of patients and 30-35% in ICU. When using a systematic screen with leg ultrasound, the rate can be higher than 50% in ICU. Table 2 reported the main published data on VTE's incidence during COVID-19, the detection methods, and the associated antithrombotic treatments.Thus, the frequency of VTE in COVID-19 patients appears to be much higher than in other severe respiratory infections. In a meta-analysis of 7 studies, including 1.783 patients with ARDS from causes other than COVID-19, the incidence of VTE was 12.7%. 44 Also, several autopsy data highlighted the vascular dimension of the disease. The first studies found, in the 16 n ¼ 137 600 (300-1000) n ¼ 54 5200 (1500-21.000)** Tang N, et al. 17 n ¼ 162 610 (350-1290) n ¼ 21 2120 (770-5270)* Tang N, et al. 65 n ¼ 315 1470 (500-944) n ¼ 134 4700 (1420-21.000)* Wu C, et al. 18 n ¼ 117 520 (330-930) n ¼ 184 1160 (460-537)*** Feng Y, et al. 23 n ¼ 352 510 (320-1080) n ¼ 70 1110 (510-4000) ** Chen T, et al. 15 n ¼ 161 600 (300-1300) n ¼ 113 4600 (1300-21.000)* Middetrop et al. 31 n The conventional diagnostic approach with an assessment of the clinical probability of PE or VTE may not be efficient in this context. Consideration must be given to the occurrence of hypoxemia disproportionate to the pulmonary parenchymal involvement, unexplained acute right ventricular dysfunction, or abrupt, significant elevation of DD. Pulmonary angiography scanning may be challenging to perform, particularly in unstable and/or ventilated patients in the prone position in the ARDS context. One study found a sensitivity of 85.0% and specificity of 88.5% for diagnosing VTE in patients with DD levels >1500 ng/mL. 28 However the small sample size of this study, a sudden or rapid elevation of DD despite anticoagulation, reflecting increased thrombin generation, and fibrinolysis, may suggest the occurrence of a thrombotic event. Venous US of legs, as well as cardiac ultrasound, can also be valuable in such a context. Routine US screening for the detection of asymptomatic DVT is not routinely performed in critically ill patients. It can carry an increased risk of personnel exposure and resource utilization during the COVID-19. Some authors reported a discrepancy and disproportion between the incidence of DVT and PE in COVID-19 patients.In an Italian study, the authors performed venous US in 388 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the conventional medical unit (non-ICU) and found no cases of DVT 49 ; this is inconsistent with the rates of PE reported mainly in ICU patients. Typically, 70-80% of PEs are associated with DVT in limbs. 50 In the cohort of Klok et al., only 1 out of 25 PE cases had DVT. 38 On thoracic imaging, the location of pulmonary obstructions is almost always segmental or sub-segmental, involving a more or less deep and diffuse pulmonary territory, dominant in the lower part of the right lobe. This does not correspond to the usual picture of PEs secondary to migration of DVT emboli from the veins of the legs, 51 and the same findings were noted in the autopsy series. 48 These discrepancies can be explained by the different time points at which the screening procedure was performed. Alternatively, it is proposed that these pulmonary obstructions rather due to thrombi formed in situ in the lung than to the migration of secondary clots, which is referred to as ""pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy"" or ""COVID-19 associated pulmonary thrombosis."" 19, 49, 52 The mechanisms involved in the formation of thrombosis in COVID- 19 are not yet completely elucidated. It is more of a coagulopathy than a true diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC), as initially described. 17 The coagulation abnormalities are different in patients with ARDS with COVID-19 vs. none COVID-19, with a higher DD rate, a higher fibrinogen level, and mild PT and APTT abnormalities. 32 Changes in other parameters (platelet count, PT, APTT, fibrinogen, antithrombin, and protein C) were relatively modest. 53 Ranucci et al. found the same specific procoagulant profile with a major increase in DD and fibrinogen correlated with an increase in IL-6. 54 Going back to the clinical and biological chronology of the disease course, the rapid worsening of respiratory symptoms is accompanied by an extremely marked increase in proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL6, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-a), commonly referred to as the ""cytokine storm."" 7,16,55,56 The explosive and uncontrolled release of these pro-inflammatory cytokines results in a significant increase in the biological parameters of inflammation (CRP, fibrinogen, ferritinemia, LDH). This acute inflammatory phenomenon can affect coagulation and fibrinolysis in several ways and amplify hypercoagulability. It has been demonstrated that excess IL-6 can induce tissue factor expression and thus initiate coagulation activation and thrombin generation. [55] [56] [57] Otherwise, infection with the SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly induces vascular endothelial dysfunction, thereby increasing the risk of thrombosis. The virus penetrates human target cells mainly by binding Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2, which is highly expressed in alveolar and cardiac cells, but also in the vascular endothelium. 58, 59 This is well demonstrated by the study by Varga et al., who found the presence of viral elements in the endothelial cell and an endothelial inflammation called ""endothelitis."" 60 Theoretically, activation of these endothelial cells can have 2 main consequences. First, there is a well-coordinated innate immune response initially through recruitment and activation of immune cells, overexpression of chemotactic molecules (ICAM), adhesion molecules such as P-selectin, E-selectin, and activation of neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets. In parallel, when the endothelium is dysfunctional and inflammatory, it will express tissue factor, which is the key to the activation of the coagulation cascade. These 2 phenomena are intended to control infection and repair endothelial damage; they can become particularly deleterious if they are excessive and/or uncontrolled by the host. Failure to resolve the cytokine response (unclear mechanism) will cause the maintenance of endothelial activation and the coagulation cascade, thus lead to generalized endothelial dysfunction. The 2 phenomena of inflammation-hemostasis are, therefore, closely interconnected and mutually reinforced. [50] [51] [52] It is thus a coagulopathy associated with severe forms of COVID-19 and significant inflammation, and authors propose the term ""immunothrombosis"" already introduced by Engelmann et al. in 2013. 61, 62 It should be noted that a few cases of COVID-19 patients having developed antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) presented with stroke and obstruction of several cerebral arteries, limb arteries. Other teams report high levels of aPL, found in up to 50% of cases, not correlated with thrombosis occurrence. These are anticardiolipin or anti-beta 2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies (Ab), of IgM, IgA and/or IgG isotype, with low or unreported titers. 63 Lupus anticoagulant is also frequently found. 64 These Ab may often appear in critical clinical states during various infections and could be considered as an epiphenomenon accompanying the endothelial activation and the immunoinflammatory storm. They appear to expose to thrombotic events rarely.The Rationale for Antithrombotic Treatment VTE has emerged as an essential consideration in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and antithrombotic is surely a full-fledged treatment for COVID-19. The benefit of anticoagulant therapy has been reported by Tang et al. in 99 patients who received thromboprophylaxis with LMWH. Despite several significant limitations in this study, the authors concluded that the treatment with LMWH appeared to be associated with lower mortality in patients with a DD rate higher than 6 times the normal range or >3000 ng/mL (32.8% vs. 52.4%, p ¼ 0.017). 65 Anticoagulation benefits are also reported by another New York study involving nearly 3.000 severely hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 28% of whom were receiving thromboprophylaxis. Hospital mortality was significantly lower in patients under ventilation with anticoagulants vs. without anticoagulants (29.1% vs. 62.7%). 66 Finally, in the updated follow-up of the Klok et al. cohort, prophylactic anticoagulation at admission was associated with fewer thrombosis at follow-up (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.091-0.92). 37 Of note, the proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients on standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis dose that developed VTE ranged from 17 to 59% during hospital stay. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] None of the studies allows for comparison between different protocols or different regiments or different drugs. Because current evidence suggests failure of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and in randomized controlled trials the incidence of VTE seems higher than in critically ill non COVID-19 patients, 44,67 many institutions have adopted prophylaxis protocols with so-called ""reinforced doses.""The ""standard"" preventive anticoagulation doses may be insufficient, particularly in patients with high DD levels, high BMI, or intensive care hospitalization. The presence of a significant inflammatory state and hypercoagulability leads to non-specific binding of heparin chains to inflammatory proteins and an acquired antithrombin deficiency, thus reducing its bioavailability. These phenomena could compromise antithrombotic efficacy and make the anticoagulant activity less predictable. 68 It is interesting to note in the study by Ranucci et al. that an increase in the doses of heparin in patients with a procoagulant profile was accompanied by a significant decrease in DD and fibrinogen. 54 Some have advocated using empiric full dose therapeuticdose anticoagulation for the critically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy; however, the scientific evidence in favor of this therapeutic approach is currently limited, based on subgroup analyses of retrospective series and/or monocentric cohorts and is therefore not consensual. This hypothesis is currently being tested in several ongoing studies (NCT04372589, NCT04367831, NCT04345848, NCT04366960).DOACs have demonstrated mixed results with regard to inpatient and postdischarge prophylaxis for VTE. 69, 70 They should be considered with caution in COVID-19 patients. Many of these patients will likely be receiving concomitant therapy (antiviral agents or other investigational treatments) that can significantly interfere with DOAC therapy. 71Based on the data reported in the previous paragraphs, it is essential to consider COVID-19 patients as high-risk or even very high-risk thrombotic patients at the time of hospitalization. 72 The assessment of this risk should be dynamic, and it is recommended to repeat it whenever the patient's clinical status changes. This thrombotic risk assessment should also include biological markers such as DD and fibrinogen levels, the sudden increase of which is an indicator of the imminent worsening of the disease. [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] Then there was an urgent need for practical guidance regarding the prevention of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] In COVID-19 patients without significant comorbidities treated as outpatients, routine preventive anticoagulation is not recommended. The same is true for quarantined individuals in general, in the absence of a significant risk factor for VTE. Patients should avoid sedentary lifestyles, dehydration, and be encouraged to remain active with regular mobilization during isolation. It is always recommended to identify possible candidates for outpatient thromboprophylaxis based on their clinical profile and medical history (overweight, comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors, immobilization, previous DVT, hormone therapy, familial thrombophilia, active cancer, etc.).All hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with LMWH or UFH on admission for severe renal failure, regardless of the reason for hospitalization. 77, 78 For patients with moderate COVID-19, it should be kept in mind that because of the presence of a significant inflammation (which is not included in the various thrombotic risk prediction scores such as the PADOU 79 or IMPROVE 80 scores), the risk of VTE is even higher. In this assessment of risk level, it should also be noted that obesity is a major risk factor in these patients. Indeed, various data support a negative impact of obesity on the prognosis of severe forms of COVID-19. In a retrospective study from France, after multivariate analysis, the OR of ICU admission in the most obese patients was estimated at 7 (BMI >35 kg/m 2 vs. <25 kg/m 2 ; 95% CI, p ¼ 0.02). 81 Patients with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m 2 have a higher risk of PE of 2.7 (95% CI 1.3-5.5; p < 0.006). 36 The standard dose of thromboprophylaxis should be adjusted if the patient is overweight/obese. 82, 83 In severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU or under ventilation, the thrombotic risk is very high, and pharmacological prevention is mandatory. There is currently no consensus on the optimal anticoagulation dosage for these patients. It is clear that in the context of the hypercoagulability observed during severe COVID-19, a standard dose thromboprophylaxis may be considered insufficient given the significant thrombotic over-risk observed. Therefore, most expert groups propose at least thromboprophylaxis at ""increased doses"" adjusted ""for the BMI."" Early diagnosis of coagulopathy identified by a significant and abrupt rise in the rate of DD (and fibrinogen), would also help adapt the management of these patients. Those different thromboprophylaxis protocols are detailed in Table 3 .When UFH is used, monitoring is essential, as it has an unpredictable dose-response and a narrow therapeutic window. Anti-Xa levels best manage it, aPTT should be avoided in this context because it does not reflect the anti-Xa effect. 84 Most VTE events occur in the post-hospital discharge period, with the first 3 weeks being associated with a greater than 5-fold increased risk in fatal PE. 80 Recent data also supports that a modified IMPROVE VTE score using established DD cut-off (>2 times ULN) identifies patients at an almost 3fold higher risk for VTE in whom there is a significant benefit for extended-duration thromboprophylaxis. 85 In the absence of COVID-19-specific data, it is reasonable to consider extendedduration thromboprophylaxis for at least 2 weeks after hospital discharge or after normalizing biological abnormalities in patients at low risk of bleeding.Finally, in patients at high bleeding risk or with active bleeding, contraindicating temporarily pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, intermittent pneumatic compression is recommended in patients in ICU.SARS-Cov-2 infection is likely to predispose to the development of VTE, especially in severe disease. There is a high incidence of thrombotic events in hospitalized patients, which can be estimated at 15-30%, which is even higher when patients are in ICU. There is a clear hypercoagulability in severe forms of COVID-19, and a high level of DD (>1000 ng/mL) is associated with aggravation of pneumonia, progression to ARDS, and is a predictor of thrombotic complications and death. This coagulopathy accompanies and complicates a major inflammatory condition. Careful and dynamic thrombotic risk assessment should be performed in all COVID-19 patients, whether hospitalized or not. This assessment includes classic thrombotic risk factors, but also biological parameters such as DD and CRP. Preventive anticoagulation is always indicated in hospitalized patients. Its intensity depends on the level of risk assessed. The optimal anticoagulation strategies, including adapted prophylaxis, are still on debate. Therapeutic antithrombotic treatment could be considered in the event of admission to the ICU or significant hypercoagulability.Special thanks to Pr. W. Ageno and Pr. P.

3be94e149eeb1b6fabd5a90739ddb8d59c129763,Pooled testing conserves SARS-CoV-2 laboratory resources and improves test turn-around time: experience on the Kenyan Coast [version 1; peer review: 2 approved],"and RT-PCR stages. However, pooled testing came with a slight declineIn Kenya, the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , was confirmed on the 12 th March 2020 1 . Since then the number of confirmed cases has risen steadily, each day, and as of 15th July 2020, a total of 11,252 SARS-CoV-2 positives had been confirmed in the country from 225,495 samples tested, ~5.0% positivity rate overall 2 . Scaling up of testing to enhance early case detection, isolation, treatment and to guide contact tracing has been a cornerstone strategy, worldwide, in managing the COVID-19 pandemic 3 . Between 15 th May and 15 th July 2020, an average 3,046 laboratory tests were performed daily in Kenya (Figure 1 , panel A). Increasing the number of daily tests is a challenge for local laboratory capacity.Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis 4 . The diagnostic process is initiated by viral nucleic acid purification from a suspected patient sample, followed by concurrent target nucleic acid amplification and detection. Soon after 30 th January 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics were recognized as an important bottleneck in the efforts to effectively contain the epidemic 5 . Laboratory testing capacity may be limited by the unavailability of equipment, reagents and qualified staff. As a result, more efficient testing protocols have since been pursued to facilitate the mantra ""test, trace, isolate and treat"". One such protocol is pooled testing 5, 6 .Pooled testing is a diagnostic approach where samples from multiple patients are combined and analyzed in a single test reaction 7 . If the reaction is positive, then individual samples that contributed to that reaction need to be retested singly ( Figure 2 ). Pooled testing was first used during world war II to efficiently identify syphilis infected military recruits 8 . More recently, this strategy has been applied in blood banks to screen blood products for HIV-1, hepatitis B and C viruses 9, 10 . Now, again, this strategy is finding application in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 7,11-15 .Here, we evaluated whether pooled testing is a viable protocol for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in our Kenya setting and potentially other low-to-middle income settings across the globe. We first applied the pooled testing strategy in mid-May 2020 when we were receiving >300 SARS-CoV-2 test requests daily but had access only to the low-throughput manual RNA extraction kits (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kits). On applying pooled testing, we were able to keep up with the increasing volume of SARS-CoV-2 test requests daily and have henceforth maintained this strategy even with the high-throughput RNA extraction platforms due to the associated resource conservation.This study was undertaken at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP) located in Kilifi town, on the Kenyan Coast between 21 st March 2020 and 15 th July 2020. Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Kenya, in March 2020, KEMRI-Kilifi has been supporting the County Health Department Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) in coastal region of Kenya in SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing. Respiratory samples collected by the RRTs for testing are received in 2-3 ml of Universal Transport Media or Virus Transport Media. Data on the aggregated Kenya-wide daily SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests and number of daily positives were compiled from the Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH) website, specifically the periodic COVID-19 situational reports and the daily press releases.The work was reviewed internally at KEMRI and considered part of the efforts to promptly develop efficient laboratory protocols for scaling up public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, individual patient consent was considered unnecessary for these optimisation experiments. The national daily tally of SARS-CoV-2 tests done and number positive is freely available to the public at the MoH website inclusive of those from KEMRI laboratories.For an optimal pooled testing protocol, there are three key considerations 16 : (i) the diagnostic protocol limit of detection (LoD) to ensure adequate sample volume is included in the pools, (ii) the diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity and (iii) the prevalence of the infection to guide the optimal pool size (e.g. if infection prevalence reaches 30%, then pooling in groups of 3 would lead to most pools being positive and the need for individual testing, hence no gain in efficiency). In general, pooled testing is most useful when the prevalence of the infection is low (typically <15%) 17 .To select the optimal pool size we used the web-based shiny application from Christopher Bilder available at https://www. chrisbilder.com/shiny/ under Hierarchical testing. Assuming a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 4% in our query samples (see later in results section on observed test positivity rate, Figure 1 ), test sensitivity of 90%, test specificity of 98% 18 , adoption of a two stage pooling algorithm ( Figure 2 ) and a pre-specified preferred pool size range of 3-10, the algorithm calculated the optimal testing configuration was a pool size of n=6 followed by individual testing of samples in positive pools.Our SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing protocol has been described elsewhere 19 . Briefly, viral RNA purification from the raw samples was extracted using either of three commercial kits from QIAGEN (Manchester, UK); QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Catalogue # 52906), RNeasy ® QIAcube ® HT Kit (Catalogue # 74171) and QIASYMPHONY ® RNA Kit (Catalogue # 931636). The manufacturer's instructions were followed for all the three kits. For the individual samples, viral RNA were extracted from starting volume of 140 µl of raw sample while for the pooled samples viral RNA were extracted from a starting volume of ~280 µl (each sample contributing 47 µl) (Figure 2) . In both cases the purified RNA were collected in 60 µl of elution buffer.RT-PCR was undertaken using primer/probes from the following four protocols, the details of which we described elsewhere 19 ; (i) the Berlin (Charité) 20 (targeting E i.e. envelope gene, N i.e. nucleocapsid gene or RdRp i.e. RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene), (ii) European Virus Archive -GLOBAL (EVA-g) (targeting E or RdRp genes), (iii) Da An Gene Co. detection Kit (targeting N or ORF1ab) and Beijing Genomic Institute (BGI) RT-PCR kit (targeting ORF1ab). For the first two protocols only primer/probe mixes from the original protocol were used, as for the other RT-PCR components we used alternative RT-PCR reagents while the latter two are commercial kits that come with all RT-PCR components pre-mixed ready for RT-PCR running after addition of viral RNA extract from patient sample. Only EVA-g E gene protocol that was used in the experiments we described in the results section is further elaborated here in detail.With the EVA-g assay, 4 µL of the purified RNA (pooled or individual samples) were mixed with 2.5 µl TaqMan TM Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems (ABI) Catalogue # 4444436), 1.75 µl E gene primer/ probe mix and 3.75 µl nuclease free water in a real-time PCR plate well. Three controls i.e. run positive control (PC), negative control (NC) and no template control (NTC), were included in every PCR plate for quality assurance and to aid in results interpretation. After sealing and a short spin, the plate was loaded to an ABI 7500 instrument (Thermofisher, USA). The thermocycling conditions used were; 50°C for 5 minutes, then 95°C for 20 seconds followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 second and 58°C for 45 seconds. The amplification curves for all presumptive positive samples were visually inspected prior recording them as confirmed positives. A cycle threshold (Ct) of <38.0 was considered positive for pools and Ct of <37.0 for the individual samples. Lower Ct values indicate more strongly positive samples with more virus quantities.We assessed the impact of pooled testing on test sensitivity by combining a previously identified positive sample (that had been singly analyzed) with five negative samples. We replicated this 6 times. The positive samples were across a range of realtime RT-PCR Ct values (20.65-36.24) ( All numerical data manipulation was undertaken in STATA version 15.1. Positivity rate was calculated by dividing total positives by total samples tested over a specified period with the 95% confidence interval (CI) assuming a binomial distribution. Dispersion of Ct values were summarized using the median and interquartile range (IQR) values. Graphical presentations were generated in R version 3.5.0 using ggplot2 package version 2_3.2.1We started SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing on the Kenyan coast on the 14 th May 2020 (Figure 1, panel B) . The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among tested samples in the previous one month period (14 th April-13 th May 2020) across Kenya and in our laboratory was ~2.0% (95% CI: 1.8-2.1%) and ~3.3% (95% CI: 2.4-3.8%), respectively. Given the local and national positivity rate among tested samples during this period, and the anticipated increase in the following weeks, we inferred that an n=6 pool size was the optimal at that time point. Note that with similar assumptions of RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity parameters stated in the methods section, for SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates of: 5-7%; 8-15%; and 16-20% a pool size of: n=5, n=4 and n=3 would be recommended, respectively 6 .The pooled testing strategy allowed us to screen 471 samples on the first day (14 th May 2020) of deployment up from 264 the previous day, a 78% increase. Importantly the pooled testing protocol was using QIAamp manual Extraction Mini Kit for viral RNA purification a switch from the high-throughput QIAcube ® HT Kit that we had deployed since 18 th April 2020 (Figure 1, panel B) .The pools that included a strongly positive sample with a Ct value <33.0 also gave a positive result in the pools, while the pools including previously weakly positive samples that had a Ct value above 33.0 gave a negative result in the pools Table 1 were identified the Ct values ranged 16.97 to 37.81 with median 30.43 (IQR: 25.68-32.90). False-positive results during pooled testing may arise as technical artifacts of degraded probe, primer/probe cross-reaction with non-SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some samples or technical cross-contamination/mislabeling during sample processing 24 .Overall, in the above example, to get results for 1500 samples we performed 700 tests (RNA extraction and RT-PCR). We estimated that in our laboratory, it costed ~ 6 United States Dollars (USD) per SARS-CoV-2 test. Thus, by undertaking only 46.7% of the tests to identify the positives, using the pooled testing protocol we spent ~ 4200 USD to test the 1500 samples down from ~9000 USD if all samples are tested singly thus saving ~4800 USD. Although two assays were required, because of the overall reduction in numbers of assays, the turnaround time was faster and fewer staff were required to handle the laboratory tests when using the pooled testing approach.Pooled testing can yield significant savings of test kits resources while effectively identifying infected SARS-CoV-2 individuals in the population rapidly. This protocol is especially relevant in low-to-middle income settings as testing resources are mostly dependent on limited purchased imports or donations. The strategy further increases test specificity (positives are tested twice) limiting false positives 25 . However, due to sample dilution, there is a risk of missing weak positives during the first step of pooled testing. Although overall the sample handling time was reduced, it was difficult to ""fast track"" individual assays that were declared urgent by clinicians or public health officers where the initial pooled test is positive. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, the pool size used by a testing laboratory should be kept under constant review and adjusted if there are changes in the prevalence of the infection in the target population or test accuracy characteristics. We confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.",Kenya,first author,2020-08-06,08

[16] [17] [18] [19] A qualitative study among HCWs in China found that challenges experienced in responding to COVID-19 included exhaustion from prolonged use of protective gear and heavy workloads, and fear of infection and infecting others, while social support and self-management strategies helped HCWs cope with distress. 20 Additionally, a systematic review found that HCWs are experiencing psychological distresses due to COVID-19, with the following pooled estimates for anxiety (26%), depression (25%), distress (35%), stress (40%), insomnia (32%), and PTSD (3% to 16%). 19 None of these studies were in Africa.The two outcome variables-stress and burnout-were measured using validated psychosocial measures. Stress was assessed using the 10-item Cohen perceived stress scale, which captures people's feelings and thoughts in the past month. 42 Questions relate to how nervous or stressed, unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives (appendix 1a). Each question is on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Burnout was assessed using the 14-item Shirom-Melamed Burnout measure (SMBM), which assesses feelings at work in the past month. 43 Questions capture three domains of burnout: physical fatigue, emotional exhaustion, and cognitive weariness, with responses options ranging from 1 (never or almost never) to 7 (always or almost always) (appendix 1b).The key predictor in this analysis is perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19, which was assessed using a 15-item scale developed by our team. The questions capture personal, facility, and psychological preparedness for prevention, diagnoses, management, and education regarding COVID-19. Each question has response options from 0 (not prepared at all) to 3 (very prepared), with options for ""I don't know about this (4), and ""Not applicable to my role"" (5) (appendix 1c).The analytic sample is 414 and 409 for the stress and burnout analysis, respectively, representing respondents who answered all questions on stress and burnout and relevant predictors. We examined the distribution of variables using descriptive statistics and created summative scores for stress, burnout, and preparedness. Factor analysis showed all three scales had good construct validity with all items in each scale loading on one dominant factor with eigen-values greater than three. The scales also had good internal consistency with Cronbach alpha of 0.79 for stress, 0.94 for burnout, and 0.91 for preparedness. Before creating summative scores, items were recoded such that higher scores indicate higher stress, burnout, and preparedness. For the preparedness score, we coded response options to range from 0 to 3 by recoding 4(I don't know about this) to 0(not at all prepared) and 5(not applicable to my role) to 2(prepared). Stress scores range from 0 to 40. Scores of 0-13 are considered low stress, 14-26 moderate stress, and 27-40 high stress. 42 Burnout scores range from 14-98-rescaled to 1-7 by dividing by total number of items for ease of comparison with sub-domains. Scores of ≤ 2.0 are considered no burnout, 2-3.74 moderate burnout, and ≥ 3.75 as high burnout. 44 We used the same cutoffs for burnout domains.The average stress score was 16.3 (SD=5.9) (Table 1b) , with 64% having moderate stress and 4% high stress. Average burnout score was 37.4 (SD=15.5), with 47% having low burnout and 20% high burnout. About 33%, 15%, and 23%, respectively, had high values for physical exhaustion, emotional exhaustion, and cognitive weariness. Average preparedness score was 24 (SD=8.8), with 56.9% somewhat prepared and 27.5% prepared (Table 1) . About 44% perceived management was appreciative or very appreciative of their efforts and 55% perceived communication from management was good or very good. Additionally, 46% were fearful or very fearful of contracting COVID-19 and only 20% were confident or very confident that they would be adequately cared for in their facility if they got infected. About 67% felt their families were supportive or very supportive of their work, and 33% were certain of a place to isolate at home without exposing their family if they were infected. Distribution of other variables shown in Table 1 .In the multivariate analysis (Tables 3a and 3b) , the associations between perceived preparedness with both stress and burnout were still significant. When accounting for only the demographic variables (model 1 of Table 3a ), providers who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had about 3-and 5-points lower stress scores respectively compared to those who did not feel at all prepared. This decreased to about 2 and 3 points, respectively, with the addition of appreciation from management and family support in model 2. In model 3, which includes fear of infection, the coefficients for somewhat prepared and prepared decreased further (β=-1.89, 95%CI:-3.49 to -0.30 and β =-2.66, 95%CI:-4.48 to -0.84) by 17% and 16% from model 2, suggesting fear of infection partially mediates the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress.Accra and Ashanti regions (the COVID-19 epicenters). Females also had about 3 points higher burnout scores than males, and married providers had about 5 points lower burnout scores than unmarried providers. Perceived appreciation from management and family support were associated with about 2 points lower stress scores and about 5 points lower burnout scores, while fear of infection was associated with about 2 points higher stress scores and 4 points higher burnout scores.We found evidence of high stress and burnout and low perceived preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs in Ghana. Low perceived preparedness was associated with increased stress and burnout. Our findings suggest that increased fear of infection partly accounts for the effect of perceived preparedness on stress and burnout-i.e., inadequate preparation leads to fear of infection, which leads to high stress and burnout. This is, however, a small indirect effect (<20%), which is likely because other factors, including fear of poor outcomes for patients, may also be mediating the effect of preparedness on stress and burnout. In contrast, increased appreciation from management and family support decreases stress and burnout.Inadequate preparedness may, therefore, have multiplicative effects through its association with stress and burnout, which may negatively affect HCW job satisfaction, productivity, quality of care, and workforce turnover 14,15 -outcomes that would impede Ghana's progress in containing COVID-19.Efforts are therefore needed to ensure providers feel appreciated for their role in the pandemic response and to provide additional support to HCWs who are female, unmarried, and based at the epicenters of Ghana's epidemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to increase workplace awareness of stress and burnout, self-care, availability of and access to mental health services, and to implement organizational policies and practices that prioritize HCW wellbeing. 53 In some jurisdictions, support programs such as peer-support video conferencing sessions are being offered for peer groups to discuss various issues affecting them. 54 Additionally, categorizing COVID-19 as an occupational disease, like healthcare organizations have demanded, may help improve worker protections and government accountability. 26 Interventions, like mindfulness exercises, changes to institutional culture, and workplace incentives could also improve psychological outcomes among HCWs. Family support is also critical and may help lower stress and burnout. 18Moreover, our study sets the stage for future research to examine these issues in a more representative sample under circumstances that allow for probability sampling. Additionally, as with all self-reported data, social desirability and recall bias are potential limitations. The use of composite scores from validated psychosocial measures, however, helps to address this limitation. Finally, this was a cross-sectional study, thus, associations described are not causal.Despite these limitations, this is the first study to our knowledge assessing perceived preparedness for COVID-19 and psychological well-being among HCWs in Africa and contributes critical findings that can help address emerging issues and challenges in the current pandemic response. It also provides a baseline for future studies in Ghana, Africa, and globally.Reuters. 2020; published online July 9. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirusghana/ghana-health-workers-warn-of-potential-covid-19-calamity-idUSKBN24A2I3?utm_source=Global+Health+NOW+Main+List&utm_campaign=80f34739 d8-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_07_09_03_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8d0d062dbd -80f34739d8-861567 (accessed July 10, 2020).",Ghana,abstract,2020-08-21,08
0acab36e7861cf7a887c31f2f39f7dca86c8ad8d,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Consumers' Access to Essential Medicines in Nigeria,"COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2. 1 It is an ongoing global pandemic first discovered in Wuhan, China, in 2019. 2, 3 The WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and later characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. 4,5 There are more than 11.3 million cases reported in more than 188 countries as of July 2020, with more than 531,000 deaths and 6.11 million recoveries. 6 The emergence of COVID-19 has affected the economy globally by directly affecting production in key countries that are sole manufacturers of raw materials, intermediate products, and consumer goods, thereby creating supply chain and market disruption, and by its financial impact on firms and the financial markets. 7 Essential medicines are those drugs that satisfy the priority healthcare needs of the population. 8 As a result of the surge in the pandemic, which led to the inevitable lockdown of the economy across affected countries, there has been a noticeable decrease in production and exportation of raw materials as well as finished products (drugs) across different countries. These greatly affected the ease of access to these medicines by the consumers who need them either for treating acute ailments or for the management of chronic diseases. Most developing countries are in their early stages of pharmaceutical development; thus, they rely on importation of drugs, raw materials, and equipment from countries outside the region, notably India and China. 9 Nigeria is highly dependent on other countries for its medicinal needs. About 70.0% of the medicines used in Nigeria and most other African countries are imported from China and India. 10 Nigeria as a developing country is faced with the challenge of a weak healthcare system and inefficient drug supply chain management; this has been a major concern in the treatment of diseases and a major hindrance to the attainment of the universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aim to ensure healthy lives and well-being for all. Access to medicine is an important component of good healthcare systems, and with uninterrupted access to medicine, improving the health outcome of the population is likely to be achieved. 11 In Nigeria, the lockdown which was accompanied with the closure of borders and travel ban across states led to a significant drop in the quantity of essential medicines in the health facilities, making it difficult for consumers to get the medicines they need. The COVID-19 pandemic also caused an increase in the prices of medicines, hand sanitizers, face masks, personal protective equipment, and other medical equipment used for providing health care. 12 This study therefore aims to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to essential medicines in Nigeria by end users.Study design and sampling technique. This research was a cross-sectional survey of males and females aged 15 years and older residing in Nigeria at the time of data collection. We used a convenient sampling technique to recruit our study participants, who were required to fill the questionnaire within the 2-month time frame stipulated for the study. 13 The inclusion criteria were being social media users and having access to Internet connection to fill out the questionnaire. We excluded health professionals who had higher chances of assessing medicines by virtue of their being essential workers.Study instrument and administration. Questionnaire for the study was developed in several stages of drafts and reviews, guided by the literature and in consultation with specialists and experts in survey research. Pretest of the drafted questionnaire was undertaken among 15 respondents from the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria to examine face validity, readability, and comprehensibility. The final questionnaire has sections on the demographic and health characteristics of the respondents and a COVID-19 impact assessment. 14 A link to the electronic questionnaire was shared to respondents across the 36 states of Nigeria using social media platforms, specifically WhatsApp and Facebook, because they form a suitable platform for disseminating information in Nigeria. 15 We used the services of our social media networks to help distribute the questionnaires to their own networks so as to get more respondents. Data for the study were collected between May and June 2020. A total of 374 respondents completed and returned informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. 16 Data analysis. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and thereafter loaded into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20 for final analysis. Simple descriptive analysis including frequencies and percentages was computed for demographic characteristics. We operationalized the respondents as those managing acute or chronic illnesses. Because this research was a national study, results were analyzed holistically, and thereafter relevant comparisons were made across the six geopolitical zones. First, the McNemar test was used to determine the differences between the sources of medication ""before and during"" the lockdown. It was also applied to determine the differences between difficulty of accessing essential medicines ""before and during the lockdown."" Sources of medicines were dichotomized as ""orthodox medicines"" (essential medicines from hospitals, pharmacies, and patent medicine shops) and ""alternative therapy"" (essential medicines from herbal sources and no use of medicines) before McNemar's test. Determination of ease of access to essential medicines among the different categories of illnesses (acute and chronic conditions). Difficulty of accessing medicine to worsening of chronic condition, increase in cost of medicine for acute and chronic conditions and across geopolitical zones, and, finally, impact of COVID-19 on the income of respondents was performed using chi-square test of independence and Fisher's exact test, respectively. All statistical analyses were twosided, with statistical significance defined at P < 0.05. Although the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 envisions access to medicines by everyone, in this study, we operationalized minimum impact as 60.0% of the population being able to access medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, percentages less than 60.0% were considered as maximal impact on access to essential medicines, whereas percentages greater than that were considered as minimal impact.Sociodemographic characteristics. This research examined 374 respondents, with a majority (58.0%) of them aged between 16 and 30 years. More males (54.0%) participated in the study; more than two-third (75.5%) had tertiary education. A majority of the participants (34.2%) reside in the southeastern part of Nigeria; however, the North-east had the least respondent, which can arguably be attributed to poor access to the Internet caused by insurgency in the region. Although more were either in public or private employment, only 9.1% were unemployed at the time of this study (Table 1) .Health characteristics. We found out that malaria and hypertension were the most prevalent acute and chronic disease conditions among respondents during the lockdown respectively (Table 2) . McNemar's test was conducted to compare the differences between source of essential medicines before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The proportion of respondents who sourced for orthodox medicines before COVID-19 lockdown (98.4%) was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than that of those who sourced for the same category of medicines during the COVID-19 lockdown (89.0%). However, 11.0% of the respondents sourced for alternative therapy (Tables 3 and 4) .We also found out that the pandemic had impact on the ease of essential medicine access for both acute and chronic conditions. For respondents living with chronic conditions, there was an increase in the proportion of those facing difficulties to essential medicine access, from 10.6% before the lockdown to 35.2% during the lockdown (Table 4 ). Of those who had difficulty assessing essential medicines for chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, 84.0% experienced a worsening of the chronic conditions, which was significant (Table 5) . Overall, those who had acute illnesses during the lockdown had 72.0% essential medicines accessibility, whereas those with chronic conditions had 65.0% accessibility.The COVID-19 pandemic has also been shown to affect the cost of essential medicines for both acute and chronic illnesses, as 75.0% of those with acute illnesses and 74.0% of those with chronic illnesses attested to an increase in the cost of medicines during the pandemic. Altogether, 77.3% of the respondents observed an increase in medicine costs (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) .This is the first study, to our knowledge, that investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to medicines for acute and chronic conditions among consumers in Nigeria. In this research, we operationalized minimum impact as 60.0% of the population being able to access medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings of this research demonstrated a minimum impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian population, whereby 72.0% and 65.0% of respondents managing acute and chronic illnesses, respectively, had access to essential medicines. This can be attributed to the fact that essential workers like healthcare providers did not face restrictions to movement or running their healthcare facilities during the lockdown.An estimated 35.2% of the respondents managing chronic illnesses had difficulties accessing essential medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compared with the only 10.6% who had difficulties accessing essential medicines before the lockdown. This is an issue of great concern considering the interaction between inadvertent nonadherence and health outcomes. We found that 84.0% of our respondents experienced deteriorating chronic health conditions in the light of difficulty in accessing essential medicines. A study demonstrated that comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases could affect the outcome of COVID-19 infection. 17 Arguably, the fear of contracting COVID-19 and the poor outcomes in background comorbidity deterred our respondents from seeking their medicines. We could not, however, ascertain if there were any healthcare provider-related influences on the inability to obtain required medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to consider strategies such as community-based responses to supplement healthcare assess where people cannot get to healthcare facilities during pandemics. This is supported by the significant increased resort to the readily available ""alternative therapy"" during the pandemic as shown in McNemar's test (Table 4 ).Another study reported that a high percentage of healthcare workers agreed to participate in neighborhood response strategies, as this would reduce the influx of people to hospitals and allow already overstretched healthcare providers to focus their attention on more severe cases requiring their expertise. 18 Furthermore, evidence suggests that better coordination of health care in addition to community-based care management approaches will provide suitable alternative to medicine when the healthcare system and, of course, access to health care are thwarted by a pandemic. 19 Our study further underscored the importance of maintaining at least a 30-day supply of prescription and nonprescription medicines to reduce the frequency of health facility visit, especially for those living with chronic illnesses. 20 However, this can compound the strain on incomes already caused by the pandemic. Our study showed that 73.9% of respondents living with chronic illness affirmed that their incomes were negatively affected by the pandemic, with a significant impact on income across the various categories of employment of the respondents. This can be directly linked to the abrupt halt in economic activities due to lockdown and restriction of movement.The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the national and international supply chain systems, including those of essential medicines and pharmaceutical products as a result of border closures, trade restrictions among nations, and transportation problems. 21 Worse still, developing countries such as Nigeria are shrouded with complicated drug distribution chains with a consequent increase in drug cost as it gets to the end user. 22 This problem is further compounded by the existence of a pandemic. Similar trends were observed in our study as 77.3% of the respondents reported an increase in medicine costs. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on drug security would be more significantly felt by developing countries as they rely heavily on imported drug products to meet their medication needs. 23 This highlights the need for policymakers in Nigeria to address challenges to large-scale and sustainable drug manufacturing, using the COVID-19 situation as a learning opportunity. Because of the stay-at-home order imposed on nonessential workers, 73.9% of the study participants with acute and chronic conditions, respectively, confirmed that their sources of income were affected. Interestingly, only 10.0% of the Nigerian population has health insurance coverage. 24 It could be argued that people who make out-of-pocket payments would most profoundly experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on income generation and therefore their purchasing power.Our study identified poor means of transportation (36%), low income and high cost of medicines (31%), fear of exposure to the coronavirus during hospital visits (19%), scarcity of required medicines and closure of some healthcare facilities (14%), fear of referral to COVID-19 isolation centers (12%), and refusal of healthcare workers to attend to patients for fear of contracting the virus themselves (5%) as the major barriers to assessing essential medicines among respondents during the pandemic/lockdown (Figure 1 ).Although this study identified a number of issues of public health significance, it is limited in the ability to control the inclusion and exclusion criteria, given the peculiarity of sampling methods and data collection strategies. In addition, we operationalized minimum impact as at least 60.0% of the population having access to essential medicine. This definition is peculiar to our setting where medicines are obtained from out-of-pocket expenditure in the light of poor price control policy, and this constituted an analytical constraint to the study. The study may have also faced social/response bias, a limitation common to self-administered questionnaire research. Nevertheless, the study underscored the imperative to strengthen supply chain systems and incorporate primary healthcare models in disease outbreak preparedness strategies.Our results highlighted that although the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdown orders had minimal impact on consumers' ability to access essential medicines, however, there were significant challenges and resultant effect associated with this impact. These include difficulties in assessing essential medicines for chronic illnesses with a resultant worsening of chronic conditions, increased medicine costs due to supply chain disruptions, decrease in income generation to make out-of-pocket payments for medicines, and a shift from where medicines were sourced. We, therefore, recommend that for a sustained access to medicines for other illnesses during pandemics, infectious disease outbreak preparedness strategies should incorporate primary healthcare services and other health system modalities to cater for nonpandemic-related conditions.

On 25 th March 2020, 6YB7 released as SARS-CoV-2 main protease with unliganded active site (2019-nCoV, coronavirus disease 2019, DOI: 10 .2210/pdb6YB7/pdb. Although the current medical research proceeds urgently to diagnose active antiviral agents that can inhibit the pandemic spread of the novel viral infection, no targeted/approved therapeutic drug or vaccine has been accredited till now as it is a time-consuming process [1, 10, 31, 41] .Consequently, the swift approach relies on the use of computational programs of combined structureassisted drug design, bioinformatics, and drug screening [10, 42] , in addition to the development of a predictive 3D protein structures of SARS-CoV-2 has become very crucial to identify new inhibitory drugs for SARS-CoV-2 protease [7, 43] . Roboson [7] stated the usage of the Q-UEL computational method to simulate the inhibition efficiency of some drugs on COVID-19. In this work, the author conducting a computational approach, through applying a combination of virtual screening, and molecular docking techniques, to assess the ability of some potential drugs, inhibitory ligands and natural products for the non-covalent inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease [40] through conformational and molecular docking studies. Molecular docking allows quick identification of the amino acid sequences across many coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 [7, 44] . The obtained docking results were hopeful and proposed a potential inhibition against the newly emerged COVID-19 from the presently accessible therapeutics [1] .All the screened drugs, inhibitory ligands, and natural product structures were built up from their smile format in ChemBioDraw 2019 software. All the molecules were energy minimized before molecular docking simulation [31] . The screened compounds comprise three categories divided as follows; 19approved antiviral drugs presently available on the market and have been authorized for use against a variety of viruses. 10 natural inhibitors ligands against COVID-19 were downloaded from PubChem 0Information%20Processing. The full-length gene encoding COVID-19 virus was optimized for Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) expression [10] . Tables 1-3 summarize the structure of the compounds for the three categories respectively. 14 Ribavirin HCV antiviral [37] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide gene was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID:6YB7, chain A) since it is the last approved SARS-CoV-2 main protease during the editing of this manuscript. 6YB7 is the monomer of the main protease with the unliganded active site [40] . The sequence was downloaded as a PDB format. 6YB7 is SARS-CoV-2 main protease with 306 sequence length and 1.25 Å resolution. The protein sequence stated in Table 4 , while the crystal 3D structure of COVID-19 main protease shown in Figure 1 . The model validated by Molecular operating Environment (MOE 2015.1) software after the addition of missed hydrogen atoms to prepare the protonated 3D-structure for the docking study [14] . After validation, the systems were energy-minimized [50] to obtain a fully optimized and stable structure for further docking simulation. Energy minimization carried out using Amber10: EHT forcefield with current forcefield charges applied to all atoms, R-field solvation, cutoff In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 6YB7, chain A) [14] . After model validation, alignment of the protein sequences, and subsequent molecular docking conducted by Molecular operating Environment (MOE2015.1) software to evaluate the antiviral effect of the previously reported drugs, and natural sources against SARS-CoV-2 protease. The binding energies and the inhibition constants are reported in each case [44] . All of the compounds were optimized in their active physiological settings [51] . Before testing the ligands against SARS-CoV-2 protease, the structures of the tested drugs and ligands were ensured to be in the optimized active arrangement. Finally, the ligands selected based on analyzing the predicted binding modes and their scores [10] .Compounds with lower molecular docking scores will have higher binding correspondences with the target 6YB7 protein [1] . The orientation of a ligand is evaluated with a shape-scoring function which approximates the binding energies of the ligand-receptor. The shape-scoring function is an empirical function resembling the van der Waals' attractive energy. After the initial orientation and scoring evaluation, energy minimization is conducted to pinpoint the closest energy minimization points within the receptor-binding sites [47] . The ligand-protein docking was conducted according to the manual of [40] and exhibit excessive H-bonding, π-π interaction and/or hydrophobic interaction with the 6YB7 protease as summarized in Tables 5-7 . These electrostatic interactions imply that these ligands are potent inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 protease [1] , since, the formed complex between the screened ligands and SARS-CoV-2 main protease is highly stable with higher binding energies. The formation of excessive hydrogen bonding with the main protease chain indicates the ability of the ligand to lock the virus-binding receptor [10] . By analyzing the docking results, it's found that Ritonavir antiviral drug, (Tables S1-S3 ). Based on the binding energies and docking scores, Ritonavir antiviral drug considered as the strongest inhibiting agent rather than other screened 39 ligands with a higher binding energy of -8.12 kcal/mol. Furthermore, Ritonavir found to have a strong binding pattern with aromatic moieties, so it is the most potent docked ligands [40] . The docking study exhibited that the screened ligands inhibit coronaviruses and illuminate the road for medical scientists to develop in-vivo and in-vitro compounds against COVID-19. The newly emerged COVID-19 virus is a serious health concern in the 20 th century. Although there is a sequence of medical drugs and natural products demonstrated high binding affinity to various viral proteins, the development of an in-vivo and in-vitro medical inhibitory drug for SARS-CoV-2 is a challenging and time-consuming task. As a result, in silico and bioinformatic routes is a fast way to assess an effective drug against SARS-CoV-2. A rigorous computational docking was pursued to identify the antiviral activity of any drug before medical usage. The present study screened the inhibitory effect of 39 ligands based on molecular docking of 6YB7 protease. The docking results exhibited that the reported ligands exhibit a high binding affinity to the COVID-19 protease and can inhibit its viral infection.Ritonavir antiviral drug binds to SARS-CoV-2 main protease with a score of -8.12, so it is expected that ritonavir is a potent inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The results obtained in this study are based on computer docking simulation, and no in vivo and in vitro anti-viral assessment conducted till now, since the author aims to share these results with medical scientists to face SARS-CoV-2 epidemic urgently.The authors declare that they have no known competing for financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.",Egypt,first author,2020-08-04,08

No reuse allowed without permission.According to several theories, the reservoir of the virus is probably animal. Even if SARS-CoV-2 is very close to a virus detected in a bat, the animal responsible for transmission to humans has not yet been identified with certainty [7] . As a new pandemic, cases have been reported in several other countries in Asia, Europe, America, Australia and Africa [10] .Transmission can occur from animals to humans as well as human-to-human transmission by aerosol and droplets. There is also a possibility of oral fecal transmission, since nucleic acids have been found in fecal and anal samples from confirmed patients [11] .Currently, the best diagnostic tool available is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), unfortunately, it has a high false positive rate, so thin section chest tomography has an important role in diagnosis of this disease [12, 13] . All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Since February 25, 2020, until May 24, all confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Algeria were included in this study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on guidelines from the World Health Organization.This descriptive study was conducted to review key information from the epidemiological bulletins of the Ministry of Population Health and Hospital Reform (MSPRH) and reports from the World Health Organization (WHO).MSPRH and WHO data were used to present descriptive results for categorical variables. In this study, we collected data published from February 25, 2020 to May 24, 2020. We conducted a retrospective study on the epidemiological characteristics of 8306 COVID-19 patients of all ages (3675 female sexes and 4631 male sexes).The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was detected by the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and simple PCR method, carried out by the Pasteur Institute of Algeria (IPA) and its annexes in Constantine, Oran and in other regions of the country (El Oued, TiziOuzou ...). Once the biological and virological results have been obtained, the diagnosis is completed by an X-ray examination (chest scanner) for confirmation in order to decide on the course of action to follow.Data were entered and processed by Excel 2007 software.

This study brought the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 since its appearance in Algeria on February 25, 2020 until May 24, 2020. Since all these confirmed cases whether adults or children were likely to be exposed to family members and / or other people in work, supermarkets, public transport ... reached of COVID-19 that leads us to say that the transmission is clearly person-to-person. Evidence that supported this route of transmission has been reported by other studies [14, 15, 16, and 17] . This mode of transmission has made this disease a very serious pandemic, although it is not as severe as that of other diseases caused by other viruses. COVID-19, not only impacted health systems around the world, but also disrupted daily life and economy in several parts of the world, it also caused great panic, which was intensified by the media and the lack of centralized dissemination of reliable information [18] .As in many countries around the world, the disease appeared in the most populous areas such as Blida and Algiers, and then it spread to all the cities of the country. This has been reported in other studies [18] . Most of the cases affected in this study are male.

cdee98e46870a737c27cfb14785327cbb7e222cb,"Continuous venous hemodialysis integrated to the ECMO circuit in critically ill patient with COVID-19, a case report in Morocco Continuous venous hemodialysis integrated to the ECMO circuit in critically ill patient with COVID-19, a case report in Morocco","The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection that has resulted in a pandemic, infecting more than 10,250,000 humans and claiming the lives of over 400,000 in less than six months [1] . The disease classically results in hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring oxygen supplementation using low and high delivery systems, as well as mechanical ventilation. However, when all these measures fail, options become very limited. One of these potential alternatives is the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO] . Evidence on ECMO in COVID-19 patients remains controversial, as the immunological side effects of ECMO can further compromise the already debilitated immune system fighting COVID-19 [2] . We report a case of a COVID-19-positive patient who was managed with ECMO after no response to mechanical ventilation and prone positioning.A 62-year-old diabetic woman on oral anti-diabetic drugs tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]. The clinical examination on admission to our intensive care unit found a conscious patient [Glasgow Coma Scale at 15/15], feverish at 39°C, blood pressure at 110/70 mmHg, heart rate at 71 bpm, respiratory rate at 23 cpm, saturation at 86 on room air [96% under 10 L oxygen with non-rebreather] and a glycemia at 0.8 g/l; She was put on treatment: hydroxychloroquine, Corticotherapy, enoxaparin [0.4x2/day], 3 rd generation cephalosporin, paracetamol, Vitamine C and zinc sulfate. (Figure 1 ). The evolution was marked by the worsening of the respiratory state on Day 2 of hospitalization, the patient was intubated, ventilated, sedated and curarized under controlled assisted ventilation and protective mode [FiO 2 = 100%, RR = 22, PEEP = 10, Vt = 440ml], put under 1 mg/h of norepinephrine; post-intubation arterial blood gas showed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis with a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the inspired oxygen fraction [P/F ratio] at 95 and a chest X-ray showed multiple alveolar opacities ( Figure 2 ).A Cocci Gram + was isolated in blood culture, hence the administration of antibiotics based on Vancomycin, Amikacin and imipenem. Despite careful management, the patient developed a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] with at arterial blood gas analysis pH = 7.43; PCO 2 = 57mmHg; PO 2 = 72mmHg; HCO 3 -= 36.9mEq/l and at P/F Ratio = 72. At D3 of hospitalization, in front of refractory hypoxemia and the failure of proneventilation, decision was to set up oxygenation by extracorporeal veinovenous membrane ECMO-VV [right femoro-jugular] under cover of heparin [10,000 IU/24h]; the internal jugular vein and the femoral vein were cannulated with heparin-coated cannulas. After one hour, an arterial blood gas reported mixed alkalosis with a P/F ratio of 128. She also received a dose [8 mg/kg] of Tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody, to help control her cytokine storm on day 7, day 3 of ECMO. On Day 10, the patient became icteric with a distended abdomen and presented an oliguria, renal failure [urea = 1.56 g/l, creatinin = 24.2mg/l] and hyperkalemia at 5.4 mEq/l. Renal function continued to worsen, and patient was placed on continuous venous hemodialysis integrated to the ECMO circuit, with an improvement in the P/F ratio in ABG at 180 [vs 76]. On Day 24 of her hospitalization, Day 20 of ECMO, the hemodynamic status has become unstable, the patient was still anuric. She was stabilized with 5mg/h epinephrine. The ABG showed pH=6.86; PCO 2 =31mmHg; PO 2 =162mmHg; HCO 3 -=5.4mEq/l Subsequently, the patient was dialyzed, then she presented hypotension at 50/40 mm Hg and bradycardia at 45 bpm; then she was put on 12 mg/h of norepinephrine and 10 mg/h of epinephrine. A few hours later, the patient developed an asystole and then declared deceased., mainly adopted to partially or completely replace the cardiopulmonary function of patients in order to provide the oxygen needs of the organs and to try to take the time to treat primary diseases [3] . For the treatment of COVID-19, the health organization considers that oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane [ECMO] can act as a rescue treatment measure. Our patient is the first case of COVID-19 treated by ECMO in our department. After receiving active anti-infective treatment and invasive mechanical ventilation, oxygenation remained difficult to maintain. Following a discussion by multidisciplinary staff, the ECMO was successfully installed for almost 20 days before an organic dysfunction caused by severe ischemia and hypoxia. After ECMO treatment, the circulatory function tended to deteriorate with the onset of acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [4] . No definitive conclusion has yet been reached on the timing of the establishment of ECMO. The authors have consulted relevant research on ARDS caused by the influenza virus, among which Steimer et al. [5] consider that early treatment with ECMO can increase the survival rate of patients.For our patient, the entire staff chose ECMO-VV because the patient only had pulmonary insufficiency without any underlying cardiac pathology, the value of the measured cardiac ejection fraction was around 67%. During ECMO management, close coagulation monitoring as well as blood gas analysis and chest x-ray are done regularly to prevent complications such as hemorrhage, thrombus and pneumothorax. Also, cardiac and pulmonary ultrasound can assess the daily lung condition and check the effect of treatment, in order to prepare for the early withdrawal of ECMO. Acute kidney injury [AKI] is a common complication in patients receiving ECMO due to multiple mechanisms, including underlying inflammation, hypoperfusion and exposure to nephrotoxins [6] . Like the majority of these patients who are hemodynamically unstable, the CRRT [continuous renal replacement therapy] method is the modality of choice. Although each type of extracorporeal assistance can be administered independently using separate venous access, many institutions integrate the CRRT device into the ECMO circuit [7] . The search for an efficient and safe method to connect an hemodialysis machine to the ECMO circuit is at the center of the current investigation. In addition, anecdotal evidence indicates that no COVID-19 patient with multiple organ failure survived ECMO [8] .Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains an option for the treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory distress, in patients in certain age groups with minor comorbidities. It is a highly necessary procedure with high technicality and a trained team. ECMO will not replace mechanical ventilation. The combination of ECMO and CRRT seems to be a safe and effective technique that improves water balance and electrolyte disturbances. Prospective studies would be useful to determine the potential of this technique to improve outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients requiring hemodialysis. ",Morocco,first author,2020-08-10,08
dced744d003f47d0748f56ee8f16a6b9f658fc92,,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of the coronavirus, SARS COV-2. [1] [2] [3] Coronaviruses have the potential to cause severe transmissible human disease. 4 Coronaviruses cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases respiratory tracts. 1 The known transmission routes for coronaviruses include sustained human-tohuman transmission via respiratory, by touching a contaminated surface or objects. 5 One of the challenges of COVID-19 outbreaks is that it is difficult to differentiate from other respiratory illnesses. 6 COVID-19 affects all people especially older age, with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease were at a greater risk of developing severe symptoms. 3 Since 31 December 2019 and as of 23 April 2020, globally 2588 068 cases of COVID- 19 have been reported, including 182 808 deaths. In Africa, 25 ,686 COVID-19 cases and 1232 deaths were reported since April 23, 2020. African countries with the highest estimated numbers of COVID-19 cases were South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, and Cameroon. Ethiopia reported 116 COVID-19 cases and 3 deaths with 61 cases in these 14 days as of April 23, 2020. 7 The COVID-19 has effect on the entire world economy including Africa. 8 Examples of this include tourism, air transport, and the oil sector. Based on Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), 43 African countries have reported COVID-19 cases so far. The incidence of both infectious and non-communicable diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma is high in Africa which is most vulnerable to the coronavirus, for whom the virus is often fatal. 9 Ethiopia confirmed the first case of COVID-19 on March 13, 2020. Ethiopia reported a total of 116 COVID_19 cases and 3 deaths with 61 cases in these 14 days as of April 23, 2020. 10 Pandemic and newly emerging infectious diseases strike developing countries including Ethiopia beyond the health system. To prevent and control newly emerging infectious diseases including COVID-19; there was a need for increased awareness, skill, and attitude of a health professional. As COVID-19 was a newly emerging pandemic disease globally, assessment of the health professionals' awareness towards clinical and epidemiological spectrum and factors influencing it was a very important agenda.Many COVID-19 cases fully had recovery. But minority of its cases had been developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and sometimes death. The ratio of case-fatality is currently unknown but is estimated to be within the range of 0.5-4%. 11 The impact of COVID-19 to all human beings is inevitable. For example, the proportions of hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes patient with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7%, respectively. 12 The incidences of hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes were about twofold upper in health care facilities. 13, 14 The COVID-19 virus has many dimensional negative impact on the world. 15, 16 The most common symptoms were fever and cough. 18 Most cases have mild disease and 20% cases progress to severe respiratory diseases, and in some cases death. 6, 19, 20 Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on gene detection via real-time RT-PCR. With the isolation of the causative agent, the development of serological tests and rapid diagnostic tests in addition to virus detection will be required. 21 In addition to the PCR test, X-ray and CTimages can be used as a suggestive diagnostic modality. 18 On the other hand, scientists around the world are actively exploring drugs but efficacy and safety of these candidate drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials. 22 Still, there is no drug treatment or vaccine for this disease except supportive care. 23 Once an individual gets sick with COVID-19, CDC recommends staying home, separate himself from other people, wear a facemask, avoid sharing personal household items and monitor symptoms. [24] [25] [26] In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation are best for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Therefore, isolation and contact tracing decreased transmission by a decrease in the effective reproduction number. 27 The Hospitals were also safeguarded by their staff who care for patients and monitoring them for signs or symptoms of infection. Hence, support is provided to the morale and well-being of the workforce. 28 The experience of Hangzhou on the prevention and control of COVID-19 showed that awareness creation, contact minimization, and travel restriction were the most pertinent measures for its prevention and control. 29 Different countries were following potential policies towards COVID-19 prevention and control with regards to patients, visitors, and health care workers. These were screening all visitors for any respiratory symptoms, restricting health care workers from working if they have any upper respiratory tract symptoms and screening all patients with signs and symptoms. [30] [31] [32] In some countries, work from the home arrangement for some employee was also made due to the COVID-19 related closure. 33 The effect of COVID-19 on developing countries is in all aspects of the globe people. This negative impact COVID-19 is very high in African country including Ethiopia. So, this study was aimed to assess the level of awareness (clinical and epidemiological spectrum) and factors related to it among health care professionals, North Shoa Zone, Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was carried out to identify the level of awareness (clinical and epidemiological spectrum) of COVID-19 and factors affecting it among health professionals at governmental public health hospitals in the North Shoa zone, Ethiopia.The study was conducted in North Shoa Zone, Amhara regional state. This zone is found in the Amhara National Regional State. A study has been conducted from March 7-16/2020. The Zone has located 130 km from Addis Ababa. Regarding the health facilities there are 10 public hospitals from which 9 primary public hospital and one referral hospital, there are 97 health centers, 389 health posts in the Zone.Health professionals who worked in North Shoa zone government hospitals.Health professionals who worked in North Shoa zone government hospitals.All health professionals who were working in the selected hospitals with a professional level of the diploma and above included in this study. Health professionals who were unable to talk, seriously ill, and recruited less than six months of duration were excluded from this study.The sample size was calculated using a single population proportion formula as follows with a 95% confidence level, and marginal of error 5%. n = Z(α/2) 2 p (1 -p)/d 2 where n = minimum sample size; Z(α/2) 2 = 95% Confidence level; P = proportion of awareness of COVID-19 among health professional in which p=50% since there is no previous study; D=5% margin of error. In which n=[(1.96) 2 (0.5)(1-0.5)]/(0.05) 2 =384 adding 10% non-response rate; n=422.A total of 10 hospitals were found in the North Shoa zone, of which 9 are district hospitals, and one is referral hospital. As the two district hospitals started to provide the service recently and a few staff available (Molle and Mida Hospital), not included in the study. The remaining 8 hospitals were included in the study and a proportional to size allocation was used to collect the data ( Figure 1 ).A structured questionnaire prepared in English and then translated to Amharic and back to English to maintain tool consistency. Seven physicians and one BSC nurse were assigned as data collectors and supervised by the principal. The data collection tool was pre-tested in private hospitals with a similar setup to sort out language barriers and contextual differences. Hence, any ambiguity in the questionnaires was corrected for the final data collection.Questionnaires were checked and pre-test in a private hospital on 5% of participants. Principal investigators were checked for consistency and completeness to maintain the quality of data. Also, one-day training on data collection techniques and briefing of the questioners were made by the principal investigators.Data were entered, coded, and cleaned by using EPI-INFO version 3.5.4 software, and then the cleaned data were exported to SPSS version 20 software for analysis. Descriptive analysis (text, percent, mean and median) was used to describe the study population concerning relevant variables. Variable having a p-value less than 0.05 with Bivariable analysis were transferred into the multivariable analysis. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 in the final model were considered as statistically significant. Levels of the association were reported using AOR and a 95% confidence interval.COVID-19 awareness -health professional was considered aware of COVID-19 in its different spectrum if they score the mean value and above from 20 questions.A spectrum of COVID-19 -the spectrum of COVID-19 refers to knowing the epidemiology, risk factor, sign and symptom, diagnostic approach, management, Majority 262 (68.2%) of the participants had a television at home while 159 (41.4%) had a radio. About 85% (324) of the participants had a smartphone and three-fourth (298) of them did have a habit of searching health-related information via the internet. With regard to the institution, only 154 (40.1%) of the health professionals reported that their institution avail television to their department. The majority of the respondents, 233 (60.7%) mentioned that their institution had internet access. Only 118 (30.7%) of the health professionals reported as their institution has a seminar on emerging diseases (Table 2) .The proportion of participants who were aware of COVID-19 in this study was 305 (79.4%). Among the health professionals, who heard of emerging disease, heard about COVID-19, and said COVID-19 affects mainly respiratory system were 299 (77.9%), 372 (96.9%) and 379 (98.7%) respectively. Fever (373 (97.1%)), cough (358 (93.2%)), and shortness of breath (342 (89.1%)) were the most common mentioned sign and symptoms of COVID- 19 and have vaccination, respectively. Direct contact was the most common mode of transmission for COVID-19 mentioned by health professionals (Table 3) .One hundred (26%) of the participants were explained that isolation was one of the early recognized measures of COVID-19 while 53 (13.8%) were health promotion (Figure 2 ).The major reason (94.5%) rose by the respondents for a suspect patient with the coronavirus infection were travel to an epidemic country with fever and travel to China with fever ( Figure 3 ).Vaccination of cases, hand washing and using face mask were among the most common prevention, and control methods mentioned by the health professionals, North Shoa one,2020 (n=384) (Figure 4 ).The association between different independent variables and health professionals' awareness of COVID-19 was assessed using a binary logistic regression model. Accordingly, working health institutions, types of profession, level of the profession, availability of television at home, availability of television in the department of the working institution, and hearing about emerging diseases in the past have a significant association with health professional awareness in crude odds' ratio.To determine the independent effect of variables on health professional awareness, multiple logistic regression analysis was done. Here in multi-variable analysis working health institutions, types of profession, level of the profession, availability of television at home, and hearing of the emerging diseases in the past had a significant association with an awareness of health professionals on COVID-19 at 95% CI (Table 4) .Regarding the working health institution, 103 (26.8%) of Debre Berhan Referral Hospital was aware of COVID-19. About 140 (37%) of nurses were aware of COVID-19.Midwife health professionals were about 7 times more likely to be aware of COVID-19 than that of laboratory (AOR=6.9, 95% CI=1. 6-29.8) . Regarding the level of the profession,63% of the study participants who were aware had degree level of education. Health professionals with a degree level of education were two times more likely to be aware than that of a diploma level (AOR=2.3, 95% CI=1. 4-4.4) . (Table 4 ) More than half of the respondents 216 (56.3%) who had a television at their home were aware of COVID-19. Health professionals who had a television at home were two times more aware of COVID-19 than their counterparts. Similarly, health professionals who had heard about emerging diseases were 2,7 times more likely to be aware of COVID-19 than who did not hear (AOR=2.7, 95% CI=1. . (Table 4 )According to this study, the proportion of participants who were aware of COVID-19 was 305 (79.4%) while according to the WHO recommendations, health professionals were expected to be aware and competent in medical screening and management, including health monitoring. 34 The possible reason for 20% of health professionals not to be aware might be the data were collected before Covid-19 cases reported in Ethiopia.Among the health professionals, heard about COVID-19 and said COVID-19 affects mainly respiratory system was 372 (96.9%) and 379 (98.7%) respectively. This 34 In case of sign and symptom; fever 373 (97.1%), cough 358 (93.2%) and shortness of breath 342 (89.1%) were the most common mentioned sign and symptoms of COVID-19 by the health professionals while studies and guidelines show that COVID-19 cases had a runny nose, sore throat, a cough, and fever. 1, 2, 6, 17 Out of 384 respondents, 291 (75.8%) were responded as COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease.Based on this study, 141 (36.7%) of health professionals explained as COVID-19 is 100% fatal while studies and guidelines show that the outcomes and prognosis of COVID-19 accounts vast most cases had cured. On the other hand, COVID-19 has been rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organs failure, and sometimes death in small cases. The ratio case-fatality is currently unknown but is estimated to be within the range of 0.5-4%. Among the critical ills, mortality was attributed to secondary bacterial infections with multi-drug resistant organisms, sepsis, and septic shock. 11 In this study, 337 (87.8%) of health professionals explained as COVID-19 affects all segments of the population. Similarly, other studies showed that COVID-19 had negative impact on all segments of the population even though there was an epidemiological and clinical difference among age and co-morbid conditions. 35, 36 Nearly 164 (42.7%) of health professionals explained as COVID-19 have a specific treatment while to date, there is no specific treatment for this virus. The efficacy and safety of these candidate drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials. 22 Supportive care, including hospitalization and intensive care unit management, was the only therapeutic option. Furthermore, the possibility that pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 could, like influenza, potentiate fatal bacterial secondary infections need to be urgently investigated. 23 About 40 (10.4%) of health professionals explained as COVID-19 have vaccination while studies and guidelines show as there was no currently approved vaccine. 23 Direct contact is the most common mode of transmission for COVID-19 mentioned by health professionals.In the case of independent factors associated with an awareness were the level of a profession in which about 63% of the study participants who were aware were degree while health professionals with a degree level of education were two times more likely to be aware than that of Diploma (AOR=2.3, 95% CI=1. 4-4.4) . There were no studies on the factors associated with the level of awareness to date to compare these findings.According to this study, more than half of the respondents (216 (56.3%)) who had a television at their homes were aware of COVID-19. Health professionals who had a television at home were two times more aware of COVID-19 than their counterparts. Similarly, health professionals who had heard about emerging diseases were 2.7 times more likely to be aware of COVID-19 than those who did not hear (AOR=2.7, 95% CI=1. .The authors conclude that the level of awareness on COVID-19 by the health professionals was promising (79.4%). The types and level of the profession, availability of television at home, and hearing of the emerging diseases in the past were factors determine the awareness of health professional on COVID-19. Based on results found in this study, the authors recommended health institutions should have a system to address the expected competency of all health professionals during the pandemic like COVID-19. The practice of seminar presentation and selflearning among health professionals at the hospital level should also be strengthened. Furthermore, the authors recommended researches on the awareness, utilization of different health promotion channels among health professionals.The study design was facility-based cross-sectional.

d4e03ca991291cb51dbbfe376b9a60765195bb06,COVID-19 and fortuitous discovery of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: biological findings and therapeutic challenges COVID-19 and fortuitous discovery of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: biological findings and therapeutic challenges,"Since December 2019, at the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan China, SARS-COV-2 has been a one the biggest challenges public health has faced. As of today, over 7.8 million people have been infected and we deplore more than 450,000 deaths.Immunodeficient individuals are considered at high risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19. The association COVID-19 haemopathy is more frequent nowadays and is considered as a real challenge for physicians. The authors report the case of fortuitous discovery of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a COVID-19 patient, emphasizing the difficulties of therapeutic care.A 76-year-old male, with a history of colon cancer treated in 2013 (surgery), admitted in the intensive care unit for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The patient has reported a stay in an endemic country 21 days before the admission. The main symptoms were dry cough, 40°C fever, multiples adenopathies and diarrhea. The patient´s state worsened and complicated by respiratory distress leading to a transfer to intensive care unit. A PCR test was conducted and came back positive. Chest CT scan showed bilateral ground glass opacities with consolidation ( Figure 1 ). During his admission, the patient was conscious, GCS at 15/15, polypneic at 30 cycles/min, SpO2 of 85% at breathing room air with intercostal retraction, stable hemodynamics: BP 140/75mmHg, HR at 90bpm and 39°C fever. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, fixed duration of PR interval, QTc at 475. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Arterial blood gas showed pH at 7.46, PaCO2 at 48mmHg, HCO3-at 26mmol/L, PaO2 at 131mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 257.Lab tests conducted at D1 of admission, revealed elevated WBC at 140020el/mm 3 and lymphocytes 129660el/mm 3 (vs 154000el/mm 3 at D7), low hemoglobin at 8.9g/dL, platelets at 464000el/mm 3 , PT at 64%, fibrinogen at 6.77g/L, CRP at 130mg/L, BNP at 249pcg/L, PCT at 0.017μg/L, LDH at 331UI/L, ferritin at 563μg/L, troponin at 8.2ng/L. Blood smear showed small lymphocytes with rounded nucleus and reduced cytoplasm. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood confirmed the presence of B-cell population; expressing one light chain immunoglobulin. Our therapeutic care was based on four daily noninvasive ventilation (NIV) sessions, hydroxychloroquine (200mg, twice a day), azythromycin (500mg per day), ceftriaxon (2g per day) and moxifloxacin (400mg, twice a day). The patient also received preventive dose of human immunoglobulins (0.5g/kg single dose), anticoagulation, PPI, vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc. The patient´s respiratory status worsened leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. Severe ARDS followed and 10 days after his admission, the patient expired.Ethical approval: informed consent was obtained from the patient´s family for publication of this case.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent leukemia during adulthood. Eighty percent of the patients are asymptomatic at the moment of the diagnosis and 30% will never receive a treatment [1] . CLL is characterized with a clonal proliferation and accumulation of mature B cells, usually CD5 positive, in the bloodstream, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen [2] . The diagnosis of CLL is based on the presence of at least 5000 B-cell lymphocytes/μL in peripheral blood stream for at least three months. Clonality of circulating B cells must be confirmed by flow cytometry. The abnormal cells found at a blood smear test are typically mature small lymphocytes with a cytoplasmic border and dense nucleus deprived of nucleoli with partially aggregated chromatin [2, 3] . Treatment is based on immunochemotherapy ( Table 1) for 90% of the patients with no genetic abnormalities associated with chemo resistance [4, 5] . The use of new therapies cibling different pathways is more frequent nowadays and could become an alternative to chemotherapy in the future. The association SARS-COV-2/CLL is a real challenge for physicians as they both have their own specific therapies.Individuals with a compromised immunity can have longer incubation period of the virus [6] . Our patient had an incubation period of 21 days. SARS-COV-2 induced lymphopenia is correlated with severe forms of the disease in general population [7, 8] . In our case, we have noted a significant increase of lymphocyte population after a week. This increase has been previously reported by a British study [9] , however the mechanisms are still unknown. The main therapeutic challenge in this case is due to the lack of consensus regarding COVID-19 and hemopathies. The treatment should therefore be personalized. The association of intravenous human immunoglobulins is highly recommended in patients presenting repeated infections, in order to boost their immunity [10] . However, the administration of chemotherapy is still controversed, as it can worsen SARS-COV-2 immunodeficiency, lead to cardiotoxicity and aggravate the prognosis. Chemotherapy should be avoided for CLL patients presenting COVID-19 to restrain treatment-related immunodeficiency and prevent drug interactions [10] .Clinical and biological symptoms of COVID-19 can be concealed due to its coexistence with malignant hemopathies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment should be personalized according to the patient´s immune status and comorbidities.

17462438e907e329a39865afdcd042f3c532b282,Multifractal Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus genomes using the wavelet transform,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family causes an illness called COVID-19, which can spread from person to person (Conway, 2020) . It has many symptoms such as fever, headache, and tiredness. It causes respiratory difficulties that can cause death, especially for people which health chronic difficulties such as diabetes, arterial hypertension, heart and pneumonic illness. Until now, there is no proven anti-viral or vaccination for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Fractal character of nucleic acids distribution in DNA sequences has been widely studied by the scientific community; many papers have been published in literature. Arneodo et al (1996) published a paper deals with the study of the Long-Range Correlation (LRC) character of DNA sequences using the 1D continuous wavelet transform method. Zu-Guo et al (2002) introduced a time series model in a statistical point of view and a visual representation in a geometrical point of view to DNA sequence analysis, they have also used fractal dimension, correlation dimension, the Hurst exponent and the dimension spectrum (multifractal analysis) to discuss problems in this field. Cattani (2010) published a paper deals with the digital complex representation of a DNA sequences and the analysis of existing correlations by wavelets. The symbolic DNA sequence is mapped into a nonlinear time series. By studying this time series the existence of fractal shapes and symmetries will be shown. Eight H1N1 DNA sequences from different locations over the world are analyzed. studied the Long-Range Correlations in Genomic DNA and the signature of the Nucleosomal Structure. Audit et al (2004) published a paper deals with wavelet Analysis of DNA bending profiles reveals structural constraints on the evolution of genomic sequences, Voss (1996) published a paper deals with the evolution of Long-Range fractal correlations and 1/f noise in DNA base sequences.In this paper the 1D Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima Lines (WTMM) method is used to demonstrate the monofractal behavior of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences downloaded from the NCBI database and to estimate the so-called Hurst exponent, the goal is to investigate the LRC character in these sequences. We begin by describing the different DNA coding that will be used.Many DNA coding of the nucleic acids formed by four different nucleotide which are the Thymine (T), the Guanine (G), the Cytosine (C), the Adenine (A) have been proposed in literature, here we will use the following six coding (Messaoudi et al, 2012) :1)The Knucleotidic DNA coding: T=2, G=-2, A=1, C=-1.Purine coding A=G=1 , C=T=-13) Pyrimidine C=T=1, A=G=-1.Ameno groupe: A=C=1, G=T=-1.Keto coding G=T=1, A=C=-1.GC coding G=C=1, A=T=-1.The 1D For more details about the 1D WTMM method we invite readers to the paper of Arneodo et al (1996) or Ouadfeul and Aliouane (2011) .One of the most important strengths of the WTMM method is the ability to identify the mono or the multifractal behavior of a given fractal process, the linear shape of the spectrum of exponentsis enough to say that a given fractal process is monofractal ‫ܪ(‬ is the Hurst exponent). For more details about this ability, we invite readers to the papers of Ouadfeul and Aliouane (2011). Audit et al (2004) showed that there has been intense discussion about the existence, the nature and the origin of LRC in DNA sequences in last decades. Besides Fourier and autocorrelation analysis, different techniques including mutual information functions, DNA walk representation, Zipf analysis and entropies were used for statistical analysis of DNA sequences. Actually, there were many objective reasons for this somehow controversial situation. Most of the investigations of LRC in DNA sequences were performed using different techniques that all had their own advantages and limitations. They all consisted in measuring power-law behavior of some characteristic quantity, e.g., the fractal dimension of the DNA walk, the scaling exponent of the correlation function or the power-law exponent of the power spectrum. Therefore, in practice, they all faced the same difficulties, namely finite size effects due to the finiteness of the sequence. Authors of this paper demonstrated the necessity of the wavelet transform microscope to study the LRC character of DNA sequences.Estimated Hurst exponent H of the DNA walks using the wavelet transform method is able to say that a given DNA walk is an anti-correlated random walk (H <1/2: anti-persistent random walk), or positively correlated (H > 1/2: persistent random walk). H = 1/2 corresponds to classical Brownian motion (Audit et al, 2004) .In this part, 21 isolate RNA sequence are analyzed using the 1D WTMM method, these sequences are extracted from 21 GenBank downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, All these RNA sequences are of peoples infected by SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, table 01 shows the code of each GenBank and the origin (Country) of each patient infected by this virus. These RNA profiles are coded using the six coding methods detailed above. Then, the 1D WTMM analysis is applied to these sequences to estimate the so-called Holder exponent for each coded DNA profile. Figure 01 shows the RNA Knucleotidic coding with 512bp as a length, the DNA walk of this sequence is presented in figure 02 , the DNA walk at the position n is defined as the sumFor more details about DNA Walk, we invite readers to the paper of Peng (1992) .To demonstrate the fractal behavior of this DNA walk, we calculate the spectral densityof this sequence and we present the spectral density versus the frequency in the log-log scale (Voss, 1992) .It is clear that log(|ܵሺ݂ሻ| ଶ ሻ has a linear shape (see figure 3) , which demonstrating the scale-law behavior of the spectral density versus the frequency et al, 1996) .The first step is the Continuous Wavelet Transform calculation, the analyzing wavelet is the Complex Morlet, for more details about the CWT calculation, parameters of the analyzing wavelet, and the scaling method, we invite readers to the paper of Ouadfeul and Aliouane (2011) . Table 02 shows the average value of the Hurst exponent for each coding method of the 21 RNA GenBank, we can observe that the Purine (sensitive to A and G concentrations) and the Pyrimidine (sensitive to C and T concentrations) have the smallest Hurst exponent variation compared to Ameno (sensitive to A and C concentrations) and GC coding which have the highest variation of the Hurst exponent.We have performed a 1D wavelet based multifractal analysis of 21 RNA profiles downloaded from the NCBI database using the continuous wavelet transform, the analyzing wavelet is the complex Morlet, the analyzing parameters of the wavelet transform modulus maxima lines ",Algeria,first author,2020-08-16,08
4fde7997d82d22d1b2d746ac99b8753702783301,Journal Pre-proof Psychological status of healthcare workers during the civil war and COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study Psychological status of healthcare workers during the civil war and COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was identified in late 2019 as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. Since then, the infectious disease has spread rapidly, resulting in a worldwide pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization in February 2020 [1, 2] . By June 30, 2020, the World Health Organization had recorded more than ten million cases of COVID-19 and 504,000 deaths [3] .Healthcare workers, particularly those working in departments providing care for patients with COVID-19, are at a high risk of this contagious disease as they are at the frontline of the outbreak [4] , especially in countries with limited resources. Further, they experience stress because of the fear of transmitting the illness to their families and coworkers [5, 6] . In addition, the rapidly increasing number of cases is placing healthcare workers worldwide under enormous pressure [7, 8] .Research has shown that doctors experience higher levels of depression compared to the general population, with a prevalence ranging from 20.9% to 43.2% [9] [10] [11] [12] . Burnout is also higher in this population, with an aggregate prevalence of 51.0% [13] . High levels of depression and anxiety along with personal distress in a stressful environment are associated with mental fatigue, which is related to a low quality of patient care and an elevated level of medical errors [14] [15] [16] .A few researchers have addressed the mental health of healthcare workers. However, there are still controversies surrounding the results regarding depression and anxiety in this population based on specialty, country, and other factors during the COVID-19 outbreak [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .Since 2011, Libya has been in the midst of a civil war with conflicts in large cities, which have resulted in massive casualties and increased psychological stress among general population [23, 24] . As a result, the Libyan healthcare system has been severely affected, a problem that is only being compounded by the COVID-19 outbreak and financial crisis [25] . While the number of mental healthcare institutions and rehabilitation programs in Libyan cities is insufficient, public mental health services are nonexistent. In addition, there is limited availability of trained psychiatrists in Libya [26] . In the civil war situation, there is also an increased risk of violence toward healthcare workers, such as verbal and physical abuse by militias [27] .Until now, there have been no specific efforts toward the formulation of a realistic research plan for psychological intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic [28] . Additionally, there is no central guidance or government plan to intervene and organize operations to provide timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment for healthcare workers at risk of deterioration of psychological status [29, 30] . Therefore, a reliable estimate of the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak against the backdrop of the civil war is essential to guide attempts to prevent, diagnose, and recognize triggers of depression and anxiety.Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and civil war in Libya. Furthermore, we examined several factors, such as violence and abuse among doctors, and their associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms.This was a multi-center, cross-sectional study.From April 18 to 28, 2020, we recruited healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses working in Libyan hospitals, to participate in this survey. The study was conducted in 15 hospitals from nine major cities included Tripoli Central Hospital, Tripoli University Hospital, Elkhadra Hospital, National Heart Institute, Aljalla Maternatey Hospital, Zliten Teaching Hospital, Al-Zawia Teaching Hospital, Abuseta Hospital, Alkhums Hospital, Misurata Medical Center, Sabratha National Cancer Institute, Gheryan Hospital, Benghazi Medical Center, Aljalla Benghazi Hospital, and Sabha Medical Center. A specifically designed questionnaire was distributed to the participants in paper form and electronically through text messages and emails.The questionnaire had seven parts: demographic and socioeconomic data, mental health assessment, risks posed by the civil war, risks associated with COVID-19, assessment of violence, and assessment of depressive and anxiety symptoms.The questionnaire items included the following: demographic data, marital status, years of experience, work shift, drug and smoking history, employment status, educational level, general questions about COVID-19, living status, the stigma associated with caring for patients with COVID-19, effects of the civil war, internal displacement, exposure to COVID-19, history of injury due to violence, and transportrelated issues. Additionally, the participants were asked if their fear of acquiring COVID-19 infection has affected their performance by using a Likert scale (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree). Participants who submitted incomplete questionnaires or had a history of mental illness were excluded from the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f analysis. In addition, those who did not work during the outbreak period (March and April 2020) were excluded from the study.Violence in terms of verbal abuse, physical abuse, and/or threatening behavior was assessed by a questionnaire on violence toward doctors [31] . Several relevant questions were chosen to address the prevalence of violent acts against healthcare workers and whether they were associated with an increased risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms.The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers [32] . The HADS, which has been used in more than 700 studies, has been validated to possess a mean Cronbach's alpha of 0.83 in several languages and settings, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.8 for the instrument to determine the presence of a disorder [33] . The self-reported HADS is a 14-item questionnaire with seven questions for anxiety and depressive symptoms each. According to Zigmond and Snaith, the cutoff score is 8-10 for borderline or doubtful cases of depressive or anxiety symptoms, ≥11 for depressive or anxiety symptoms, and < 7 for normal cases [34] .Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics in terms of frequency, mean, and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe the data. An independent-samples t-test was run to determine if there were differences in working hours per week and number of shifts per month between depressive or anxiety symptoms group (HADS [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and no depressive or anxiety group (HADS < 11). Categorical variables such as having or not depressive or anxiety symptoms (HADS 11-21) were compared with those without depressive or anxiety symptoms (HADS < 11) using the chi-square test.The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Biotechnology Research Center in Libya. All participants provided consent before participating in the study.We obtained responses from 800 participants. Of these, 55 were excluded for missing data. Finally, 745 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The participants had a mean ± SD age of 33.3 ± 7.4 years. Of the 745 participants, 387 (51.9%) were female and 358 (48.1%) were male. Table 1 describes the characteristics of the study population. In addition, 237 (31.8%) participants reported that they had left their homes and, together with their families, experienced internal displacement because of the civil war. In addition, 81 (10.9%) reported having been separated from their families because of the civil war, and 252 (33.8%) reported transportation-related difficulties in reaching the hospital because of civil war-related conflicts.The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among the participants is described in Table 2 according to their grades. A total of 420 (56.3%) participants scored ≥ 11 on the depression scale, which indicates a high likelihood of depressive symptoms. The overall mean ± SD score for the depression scale was 10.9 ± 2.9.Regarding the anxiety scale, 348 (46.7%) participants scored ≥ 11, which indicates a high level of anxiety disorder. The mean ± SD anxiety score was 10.5 ± 3.5. The characteristics associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 . Only age, residency status, department, stigmatization, and living in a conflict zone were significantly associated with depressive symptoms (p < 0.05), and young doctors were found to have more depressive symptoms than older physicians. Those who lived alone were more likely to have depressive symptoms. Further, those who had depressive symptoms were more likely to live alone. In addition, participants working in the medical, surgical, emergency, and intensive care departments had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared to others. However, marital status, years of experience, working hours, smoking, and illicit drug use had no association with depressive symptoms (p > 0.05). Feeling stigmatized because of contact with patients with COVID-19 was statistically associated with a higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.05 for both).Age, department, years of experience, working hours per week, internal displacement, stigmatization, living in a conflict zone, and verbal abuse were statistically associated with anxiety (p < 0.05), while the others were not statistically significantly associated. Regarding internal displacement, 237 (31.8%) doctors had been forced to leave their homes because of conflict and civil war. Internal displacement and internal refugee status were statistically significantly associated with both anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001) and depressive symptoms (p < 0.05). Living in a conflict zone was also statistically associated with depressive symptoms (p < 0.05) and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001).A total of 667 (89.5%) participants stated that the civil war affected their mental status. However, there was no statistical association (p > 0.05) of the civil war with anxiety or depressive symptoms. In addition, 231 (31%) physicians felt stigmatized as they were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Feeling stigmatized was statistically associated with both depressive and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001). Of the participants, 109 (out of 390) reported physical abuse: 35 (8.9%) had been subjected to physical blows, 29 (7.4%) had had objects thrown at them, and 45 (11.5%) had been attacked with weapons such as guns. Of the 390 who reported abuse, 95 (24.4%) felt a slight degree of endangerment to their life, while 51(13.1%) felt a moderate degree and 27 (6.9%) felt severe endangerment to their lives. Among those who had been attacked, 70 (17.9%) participants reported that the reason had not been apparent while 61 (15.6%) reported that the reason was the long waiting time.Of the 390 participants who reported having been abused, 102 (26.2%) did not sustain injuries while 185 (47.4%) experienced a negative emotional impact. In addition, 137 (35.1%) participants felt that the event negatively affected their work quality and family life. While no association was found between abuse and depressive symptoms, verbal abuse was significantly associated with a higher degree of anxiety (p < 0.05). Physical violence was not statistically associated with either anxiety or depressive symptoms.Several studies have suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak can have a negative psychological effect on healthcare workers, such as through psychological pressure associated with fear of infection, age, living condition, separation from family due to civil war, department of work, and years of experience. Accordingly, the main aim of the present study, conducted in Libya, was to evaluate the psychological conditions of healthcare workers during the complex situation arising from the combination of the civil war and COVID-19 outbreak [6, 22, 35, 36] .Of the 745 participants, 420 (56.3%) physicians had depressive symptoms (HADS score ≥ 11) and 236 (31.7%) had borderline depressive symptoms (HADS scores of [8] [9] [10] . A systemic review and meta-analysis reported that according to a pooled analysis of 54 observational studies, the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms was approximately 28.8%, ranging from 20.9% to 43.2% in individual studies depending on the scale used [12] . As our study reports high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, urgent psychological intervention plans are needed to prevent burnout and suicide risk in physicians and decrease the risk of medical errors [37] [38] [39] .While 348 (46.7%) physicians had anxiety (HADS score ≥ 11), 237 (31.8%) had borderline anxiety (HADS score of 8-10). This was higher than the previously reported anxiety rate of 25.6% in a study conducted among physicians in China [40] .Another study using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale revealed that generalized anxiety disorder was present in 35.6% of healthcare workers in China during the COVID-19 outbreak [19] . A study on healthcare workers using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale revealed that 22.6% had mild to moderate anxiety, while only 2.9% had severe anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak [18] . Our study revealed a high level of anxiety compared to previous reports; however, there is no mental health support for physicians at the frontline of both COVID-19 and the civil war, risking J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f their lives for patients. Therefore, these healthcare workers need an efficient mental health support system and intervention plans, such as online meetings or telephonic counseling, which will give them the opportunity to discuss their concerns and enable them to find solutions; additionally, meditation or mental exercise is needed. Also, owing to the civil war and financial crisis, Libyan physicians, especially those who work for the government, need additional support, as indicated by the 47.4% government-employed participants in this study.In addition, living and residency status was significantly associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Therefore, social support is critical, especially during this hardship, as indicated by a previous study [41] .Among the participants, 237 (31.8%) had been internally displaced because of the civil war. This led to many Libyan families exposing their homes and belongings to the risk of theft by militias and gangs and destruction by rockets and bombs, which induced great mental stress. This can explain the significant association between internal displacement and anxiety as well as depressive symptoms.Another major concern was abuse, whether physical or verbal. Around 390 (52.3%) physicians reported that they had encountered at least one episode of abuse by patients or their relatives, while about 45.8% reported three or more episodes of abuse of some type. The huge prevalence of abuse is connected to the power of the militias, and currently, there is no law that can protect healthcare workers from them. Militias have been known to attack healthcare workers if their friends or family members are hospitalized and have a high risk of death, or if they could not be saved because they were not brought to the hospital in time. Often, physicians are the targets of their rage. In a previous study in India, 40.8% of healthcare workers had reported an episode of violence of any type [42] . The prevalence of abuse in the present study is also higher than that in a study of surgical trainees in the US, where approximately 30.3% reported either physical or verbal abuse [43] . Doctors in Libya will benefit from trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy [44] and mindfulness-based therapy [45] .The study revealed that 31% of physicians felt stigmatized by their work with patients with COVID-19. This is an important finding, as there have previously been anecdotal reports about physicians' stigma resulting from their work and risk of contracting COVID-19 [46] [47] [48] . Some of these reports found that physicians were being abandoned by family or friends owing to their risk, which adds to their psychological pressure during this outbreak. In our study, there was a statistically significant association between feeling stigmatized and the risk of both depressive and anxiety symptoms.The serious mental health issues in healthcare workers providing care for high-risk patients during the COVID-19 outbreak is a significant observation. It should be noted that most healthcare workers are employed in isolation units, and isolation combined with low resources and a lack of training may put them at risk of higher stress and psychological effects. In addition, the risks and pressures associated with the civil war in Libya play a pivotal role in increasing psychological pressure in those who work in these dangerous settings. Therefore, psychological intervention and efficient resource utilization are needed to relieve the psychological effects of this global pandemic. Further, it is essential to increase surveillance and improve the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f detection of early cases of depressive and anxiety symptoms to prevent catastrophic events.Our study covered multiple centers and several hospitals from different departments, and therefore, the results can be generalized. This is the first study to provide insight into the prevalence of abuse among physicians in Libya after the civil war. In addition, it revealed the highest prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to recent studies. Our study will provide a reference for governmental interventions to relieve these stressors.This study has some limitations. One of these is the cross-sectional design, which does not allow causal inferences, necessitating longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes to determine other possible risk factors. Additionally, as part of the study was conducted using an online survey, we were not able to calculate the accurate participation rate. Another limitation is the feeling of stigma among the Libyan population about mental illness, which prevents them from disclosing it. In addition, the questions related to COVID-19 were not previously validated as they were designed specifically for our study. Finally, the higher prevalence of abuse and the Libyan civil war may have aggravated the effect of COVID-19 on physicians, thus resulting in higher anxiety and depressive symptoms than those previously reported.In conclusion, our study presents important findings regarding depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and abuse among physicians working during the COVID-19 outbreak and civil war in Libya. It also demonstrates several factors that can be associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Therefore, it is clear that immediate actions and efforts are needed to alleviate these mental health challenges in Libya.The authors declare that they have no competing interests and have no relationship with the industry or organizations.",Libya,abstract,2020-08-16,08
6d2ce64508dec37896eabb7a524079688a085b9f,"Wide Diversity of Coronaviruses in Frugivorous and Insectivorous Bat Species: A Pilot Study in Guinea, West Africa","Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) represent a significant challenge to global health. The frequency of EID outbreaks has dramatically increased over the last decades. Most EIDs have a zoonotic origin; more than 70% of them are caused by pathogens originating from wildlife [1] . The continuing encroachment of human populations into areas initially only occupied by wildlife, such as pristine forest-together with environmental and climatic changes-has led to increasing contacts between humans and animals and as a consequence, exposure to the pathogens they harbor [2] [3] [4] . The ongoing outbreak with the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is a perfect illustration of the potential impact and the global consequences resulting from a single cross-species transmission from an animal virus. The epidemic was first recognized in December 2019 in China and has spread across the entire globe in a few months. By the end of May 2020, more than five million people have been infected; more than 350,000 have died and a lockdown of four billion people across the globe has been enforced to reduce the spread of the virus [5] . It is thus important to be prepared for new EID outbreaks. A major step in understanding the risk for zoonotic infections, is to characterize the diversity of pathogens at the interface between humans and animals. Knowing the animal sources, prevalence, geographic distribution and the genetic diversity or evolutionary history of pathogens in wildlife is critical to evaluate the risk for potential emergence or reemergence of disease.The current COVID-19 outbreak with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the seventh coronavirus (CoV) identified in humans since the 1960s [6, 7] . Whereas the initial known human CoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) usually cause mild symptoms, the more recent HCoVs have higher pathogenicity and impact. SARS-CoV-1 emerged in 2003, infecting 8000 people in more than 30 countries in a few months, with a lethality of 10% [8, 9] . MERS-CoV emerged in 2012, causing more than 2500 cases in 27 countries to date, with a lethality of 35% [10] [11] [12] . The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has an estimated lethality that is lower than SARS-CoV-1, but the virus was able to spread extremely fast worldwide [13] . All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin and evolutionary origin from bats [14] [15] [16] [17] . Some have been directly transmitted from bats to humans, but for others an intermediate host was required, like camels for MERS-CoV or civets for SARS-CoV-1 [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . For SARS-CoV-2, the closest relative is identified in a bat from China and the role of an intermediate species, i.e., pangolins, is not clarified yet [24, 25] .It is now well established that CoVs are widespread in bats with relative high prevalence and important genetic diversity providing thus multiple opportunities for the potential emergence of novel HCoVs in areas where contact between humans and bats are frequent [26] . Nevertheless, despite recent efforts, our knowledge on CoVs in bats is far from complete, because most studies are conducted on a limited number of species and in restricted geographic or ecological environments. Bats represent 20% of all mammals with more than 1400 different species [27] . More studies are thus still needed, especially in areas where the risk for spillover to animals or humans is high, like southeast Asia or West and Central Africa, where numerous bat species are hunted for food or medicine [28] [29] [30] . Moreover, bushmeat hunting is recognized as a major threat for conservation of bats in these areas [31, 32] . In addition, humans can also be indirectly exposed to bat viruses through contacts with bat guano or fruit contaminated by their saliva, urine or feces [32, 33] .Several studies have shown a large diversity of CoVs in bats across Africa, but limited data are currently available on bat CoVs in Sub-Saharan Africa and especially from West Africa, where we have currently only information on bats from Ghana and Nigeria [15, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Nevertheless, new alpha (α-CoVs) and betacoronaviruses (β-CoVs) have been described in Africa, including some closely related to human CoVs such as HCoV-229E, or SARS-CoVs [15, 34, 35] . Recently, the closest relatives in bats to the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV were documented in Neoremicia and Pipistrellus bats from South-Africa and Uganda, respectively, illustrating that African bats could also play a role in outbreaks of CoVs in humans [23, 43] . Here we conducted a pilot study on the presence of CoVs in bats in Guinea, West Africa, a country with a high likelihood for EID outbreaks and where humans are frequently directly or indirectly exposed to bats (A.K. Keita, personal observation).Samples were collected from free-ranging frugivorous and insectivorous bats in Guinea between February 2016 and January 2017 as previously described [44] . We obtained permission to conduct research and to collect samples from the National Ethics Committee for Health Research (CNERS) from Guinea (approval reference 074/CNERS /15, 26 November 2015) . Briefly, bats were captured using mist nets or harp traps in roosting and foraging sites. Bats were then kept in cotton bags and released immediately after sampling. Whole blood was taken by venipuncture of the propatagial or brachial vein and blood drops were directly transferred onto Whatman 903 filter paper (GE-Healthcare, Feasterville-Trevose, PA, USA). Samples were air-dried and preserved individually in plastic bags containing silica desiccant and stored in a hermetic box as dried blood spots (DBS). DBS were stored at −40 • C in the laboratory (2 to 3 weeks after collection) and kept frozen until analysis. Rectal and oral swabs were also collected in 500 µL RNA-later to preserve RNA from degradation and stored in the field at ambient temperature for maximum two weeks and subsequently at −40 • C in the laboratory. For a subset of animals, fresh fecal samples were also collected and stored in RNA-later, i.e., feces dropped when bats were in cotton bags. For each sampled bat, information on capture sites (GPS coordinates, ecological environment), capture method, morphology (body measurements, weight, color), sex, age class (adult, juvenile) and visual species identification were recorded.Total DNA and RNA were extracted from swabs and feces using the NucliSENS EasyMAG platform (BioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). Briefly, 250 µL of sample was incubated with 2 mL of lysis buffer for 15 min and extraction was performed using manufacturer's instructions. Total nucleic acids were resuspended in 60 µL elution buffer.Species identification recorded in the field was molecularly confirmed on a subset of bats using DBS as in our previous study on Ebolaviruses in bats [44] . In addition, the species was also molecularly confirmed for each bat in which a coronavirus was identified. A fragment of approximately 800 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (CytB) region was amplified using previously described primers to identify mammal species including bats, Cytb-L14724 (forward) and Cytb-H15506 (reverse), [45] . However, the forward primer was replaced by a newly designed primer Cytb-L1 5 -ATG ACC AAC ATC CGA AAA TCN CAC-3 or Cytb-L2 5 -ATY TCY TCM TGA TGA AAY TTY GGM T-3 to increase PCR specificity for certain bat species. PCR products were diluted and directly sequenced with BigDye Terminator version 3.1 sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Courtaboeuf, France). Electrophoresis and data collection were processed on an Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences from both strands were reconstituted using SeqMan Pro tool from the package DNAStar v17.0.2 (Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA). Sequences were pasted in the NCBI BLAST web interface (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to identify the most similar bat species. For samples with no or low similarity (<97%) hits with species in Genbank, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using maximum likelihood methods implemented in PhyML with reference sequences in order to obtain genus identification. The new sequences were deposited in the GenBank under accession numbers MT586773-MT586805. First, cDNA was synthesized from denatured RNA (70 • C for 10 min) using a Reverse Transcription System kit with random primers (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), following manufacturer's instructions. PCR screening was done with a broadly reactive nested PCR approach in the highly conserved RdRp region. Our assay targeted a 440 bp fragment using degenerate primers from a modified protocol described by Chu et al. (2011) . In the first round, a 602 bp fragment was targeted following previously described PCR methods for which amplification conditions were slightly adapted [46] . Briefly, cDNA was amplified using the GoTaq Hot Start Master Mix PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as follows: 40 cycles of 92 • C for 30 s, 48 • C for 30 s and 72 • C for 50 s for the first round of PCR. In the second round, a 440 bp product was amplified and cycling conditions were modified for the second round of PCR, using a touch-down technique to reduce nonspecific amplifications (10 cycles of 92 • C for 30 s, 53 • C for 30 s with −0.5 • C/cycle and 72 • C for 30 s, 35 cycles of 92 • C for 30 s, 53 • C for 30 s and 72 • C for 30 s). PCR products were first analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and positive amplicons were sequenced as indicated above and analyzed on the Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer platform. Sequences from both strands were reconstituted using SeqMan Pro tool from the package DNAStar v17.0.2 (Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA). Sequences were pasted in the NCBI BLAST web interface (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to identify similar coronavirus sequences.The PCR assay was first tested on six nasopharyngeal swabs from patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, which are anonymous and untraceable diagnostic leftover samples, kindly provided by the Virology department of Montpellier University Hospital in March 2020. Amplification products and sequences were obtained, demonstrating that the assay is also able to detect the novel SARS-CoV-2 strain (data not shown).The new sequences were aligned with representatives of alpha and beta-coronavirus sequences that have been reported mainly in Africa and elsewhere (Table S1) . A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was obtained by using MAFFT v7 (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). The alignment was manually checked and end-trimmed to match with the newly obtained RdRp sequences and to remove the PCR primers sequences. The final MSA was used for maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis with GTR + F + I + 4Γ as the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution according to BIC and 1000 bootstrap resampling by using IQ-Tree server (http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.aC.at) [47, 48] . Consensus trees were edited with FigTree v1.4.4. The new sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MT586830-MT586867.To explore the impact of age, sex and environment of the collected samples on the detection of coronavirus RNA, we performed Kruskal-Wallis test on bat field data. Significant results were considered for a p-value of <0.05.Samples from a total of 319 wild bats, captured at 14 sites in seven different prefectures in Guinea, were studied ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ). Bats were captured in different ecological settings including the following environments: villages (38.6%), forest sites (30.1%), urban sites (23.2%), plantations (4.1%) and diverse other settings for the remainder (4.1%). Species identification was confirmed by CytB sequence analysis on a total of 171 (53.6%) bats to confirm at least one sample per sampling date, per capture method and per morphologic description at each site. Species identification was then extrapolated for the remaining samples by combining molecular and field data. For certain insectivorous bats (Molossidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae and Nycteridae) identification was Viruses 2020, 12, 855 5 of 17 only possible at the genus level, mostly due to the lack of reference sequences in Genbank. Because discrimination between Epomophorus gambiensis and Micropteropus pusillus was not possible based on CytB sequences only, we used morphologic details on forearm and weight measurements to discriminate the species for 93 bats, as previously documented by others [49] . Details on bat families, genera and species are shown in Table 2 . We collected samples from 274 (85.9%) frugivorous bats (Pteropodidae family) representing at least eight species and 45 (14.1%) insectivorous bats from five families and at least six genera. Overall, 195 (61.1%) bats were female, 121 (37.9%) were male and for three (1.0%) sex classification was not available. The vast majority were adults (300; 94.1%), 11 (3.4%) were juveniles and for eight bats (2.5%), age could not be identified, or information was not recorded. Total 319Sites are indicated with a two-letter code as in Figure We screened a total of 634 samples from 319 bats by RT-PCR for the presence of coronavirus RNA: for 286 (89.7%) bats oral and rectal swabs were tested, 19 (6.6%) bats were tested using oral swabs and fecal samples, for five (1.6%) oral and rectal swabs and feces, for two and seven bats only rectal or oral swabs were tested, respectively. A total of 38 samples from 35 of the 319 tested bats (11%), were positive for the presence of CoVs; five in oral swabs only, 20 in rectal swabs only, seven in feces only, one in both feces and oral swab, two in rectal and oral swabs ( Table 3 ). The rate of positivity varied according to the sample type; the proportion of positive samples was 7.5% (22/293) in rectal swabs, 2.5% (8/317) in oral swabs and 33.3% (8/24) in fresh fecal samples. Among the three bats that were positive in two different samples, two were infected with the same virus in the rectal and oral swab or in feces and oral swab, but for one bat, an α-CoV and a β-CoV were detected in oral and rectal swab, respectively.We confirmed the presence of CoVs in 10/45 (22.2%) insectivorous bats from three species belonging to three families, i.e., Hipposideridae (33.3%, 7/21), Rhinolophidae (40.0%, 2/5) and Nycteridae (33.3%, 1/3). Among the frugivorous bats, 25/274 (9.1%) tested positive and CoVs were detected in five species: 4/9 (44.4%) Eidolon helvum, 12/120 (10.0%) Rousettus aegyptiacus, 3/42 (7.1%) Lissonycteris angolensis, 5/87 (5.7%) Epomophorus gambianus and the single Nanonycteris sp. bat. CoVs were identified in all provinces and in almost all sites where bats were sampled in Guinea (Figure 1 ). Among the positive bats, 72% were sampled close to human habitats, 23% in urban areas and 49% in villages. No significant impact of the age, sex of bats or environment on the presence of CoV was detected, using Kruskal-Wallis test (p-values > 0.05). We identified thus 38 CoV sequences, 15 sequences belonging to the α-CoV genus and 23 to the β-CoV genus, the latter known to harbor five HCoVs, i.e., HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and the recently described SARS-CoV-2 from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Of all, 14 bats were infected with α-CoVs, 20 with β-CoV and one bat (R. aegyptiacus) was co-infected with both, as mentioned above. Among the 15 α-CoVs, six were detected in oral swabs only, one in oral and rectal swabs, one in feces and oral swabs, four in rectal swabs and three in feces only. All 23 β-CoVs were identified in rectal swabs or feces and not in oral swabs.The phylogenetic analysis based on 374 bp nucleotides of the new sequences and reference sequences is shown in Figure 2 . High genetic diversity was observed among the newly identified α and β-CoVs. α-CoVs were detected in 7/45 (15.6%) of insectivorous bats; five Hipposideros sp. and two Rhinolophus spp. (Figure 2A ). All α-CoV strains from Hipposideros bats in Guinea clustered with previously reported CoV sequences from bats from this genus in Zimbabwe, Gabon or Ghana and comprising also the HCoV-229E virus. The new α-CoV strains from Rhinolophus bats fall in a cluster that groups sequences from other Rhinolophus bats captured in Mozambique and Kenya. Among frugivorous bats, 8/274 (2.9%) were infected with α-CoV; seven R. aegyptiacus and one L. angolensis. α-CoVs from R. aegyptiacus formed a separate lineage for which no close relatives (>90% homology) were detected in Genbank. The new α-CoV sequence from a frugivorous L. angolensis clustered with CoV sequences mainly obtained from insectivorous Molossidae bats from Cameroon, Tanzania, Southern Africa and the Western Indian ocean. Micropteropus pusillus or Rousettus sp. from central and Eastern Africa were also observed in this clade. Interestingly, the new β-CoV from the Nanonycteris bat in Guinea fell in the same cluster. The new strains from Lissonycteris angolensis were closely related to a recently reported β-CoV from the same species in Rwanda. Among the new β-CoVs from Rousettus aegyptiacus, two strains formed a separate lineage with no close relatives (>90% homology) in Genbank and the four remaining strains clustered with β-CoVs identified in Rousettus sp. from Cameroon or Kenya. The β-CoVs observed in insectivorous bats belonged to two subgenera. The two β-CoV strains from Hipposideros bats belonged to the SarbeCoVs subgenus, that also harbor the human SARS-CoV strains as well as other closely related CoVs from insectivorous bats, civets and pangolins. Our sequences were highly diverse and fell in a clade grouping a wide diversity of CoVs, all from Hipposideros bats in diverse African countries. Finally, the new β-CoV strain from the Nycteris bat, trapped in a cave, belongs to the MerbeCoV genus which includes the CoVs responsible for the human Middle East respiratory syndrome and closely related CoVs detected in camels and Vespertilionidae bats (Pipistrellus sp. from China, Uganda and Neoromica sp. from South Africa). Our sequence clustered specifically in a distinct clade with other strains from Nycteris bats from Mozambique and Ghana that was basal to the MERS-CoV related viruses.Overall, Rousettus and Hipposideros bats from our study are infected with at least three different CoVs (one α-CoV and two β-CoVs) and L. angolensis bats with α-CoV and β-CoVs. β-CoVs were observed in 18/274 (6.6%) frugivorous bats and 3/45 (4.4%) insectivorous bats. None of the new viruses was closely related to the human β-CoVs ( Figure 2B ). Among β-CoVs, our sequences fell into three subgenera, recently named Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus and Nobecovirus [50] . All the 18 β-CoV sequences detected in fruit bats clustered in the NobeCoV subgenus comprising only CoVs from Pteropodid bats from various places in Asia and Africa (i.e., Kenya, Cameroon, Rwanda, Madagascar, Congo, Tanzania). New β-CoVs strains from E. helvum clustered with previously reported CoV strains form this species observed in bats from Cameroon, Kenya and even Saudi Arabia. However, a β-CoV from a Rousettus bat from Madagascar fell also in this clade. Similarly, the five new β-CoV strains from Epomophorus bats clustered with previously documented strains from this genus from other regions in Africa, but strains from other bat species like Micropteropus pusillus or Rousettus sp. from central and Eastern Africa were also observed in this clade. Interestingly, the new β-CoV from the Nanonycteris bat in Guinea fell in the same cluster. The new strains from Lissonycteris angolensis were closely related to a recently reported β-CoV from the same species in Rwanda. Among the new β-CoVs from Rousettus aegyptiacus, two strains formed a separate lineage with no close relatives (>90% homology) in Genbank and the four remaining strains clustered with β-CoVs identified in Rousettus sp. from Cameroon or Kenya.The β-CoVs observed in insectivorous bats belonged to two subgenera. The two β-CoV strains from Hipposideros bats belonged to the SarbeCoVs subgenus, that also harbor the human SARS-CoV strains as well as other closely related CoVs from insectivorous bats, civets and pangolins. Our sequences were highly diverse and fell in a clade grouping a wide diversity of CoVs, all from Hipposideros bats in diverse African countries. Finally, the new β-CoV strain from the Nycteris bat, trapped in a cave, belongs to the MerbeCoV genus which includes the CoVs responsible for the human Middle East respiratory syndrome and closely related CoVs detected in camels and Vespertilionidae bats (Pipistrellus sp. from China, Uganda and Neoromica sp. from South Africa). Our sequence clustered specifically in a distinct clade with other strains from Nycteris bats from Mozambique and Ghana that was basal to the MERS-CoV related viruses.Overall, Rousettus and Hipposideros bats from our study are infected with at least three different CoVs (one α-CoV and two β-CoVs) and L. angolensis bats with α-CoV and β-CoVs.With the recent emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the previous highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks, it is important to better document the diversity and evolution of coronaviruses, particularly in regions at high-risk for emergence of infectious diseases of zoonotic origin. All CoVs in humans have a zoonotic origin with a direct or indirect link with bat CoVs. Here we documented for the first time the presence and genetic diversity of alpha and beta coronaviruses in bats in Guinea, West Africa, where contacts between humans and bats are frequent. In this pilot study, we analyzed more than 300 bats from at least eight frugivorous and six insectivorous species, collected at 14 different areas in seven prefectures across the country. We detected and characterized coronaviruses in 11% of the bats, at almost all sites and observed a wide diversity of α and β-CoVs with potential new viral lineages. Some strains belonged to the subgenera of MerbeCoV and SarbeCoVs known to harbor highly pathogenic HCoVs like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively. We also report for the first time, the presence of a coronavirus in a bat from the genus Nanonycteris.The overall rate of CoV detection (11%) in our study is consistent with the rates found in previous studies in Kenya and Mozambique [40, 51] , but infection rates in studies in central and southern Africa and the western Indian Ocean were generally lower [15, 35, [38] [39] [40] 42, 52] . Positivity rates of coronavirus detection can vary by species and season, therefore comparison between studies is limited. In Guinea, we also observed differences in positivity rates according to species. Although we tested only a few samples per species, high rates were observed in three insectivorous genera from three families (7/21 Hipposideros sp., 1/3 Nycteris sp. and 2/5 Rhinolophus sp.) and two frugivorous species (4/9 Eidolon helvum and 1/1 Nanonycteris sp.). However, it cannot be excluded that this could be related to the season when samples were collected, for example several studies have shown temporal variations of CoV infections associated with parturition [37, 41, [53] [54] [55] . Longer follow-up should be done on these bat species in Guinea to assess temporal dynamics of CoV infection. Most samples have been obtained in cities or villages close to human habitats, it is thus important to know whether exposure to bat CoVs vary during certain periods of the year. Differences in positivity rates can also be explained by the nature of samples that have been tested, for example in our study we observed higher rates in feces and rectal swabs than in saliva. This was also observed in other reports and confirms that coronaviruses are highly shed in the intestinal tract [56] . Therefore, non-invasive collection of fresh bat feces, under roosting or feeding sites, may be more efficient to study CoVs, especially for species that are difficult to access.Phylogenetic analyses revealed a wide diversity of α and β-CoVs with potential examples of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat hosts and examples of host diversity within CoV lineages. The genetic diversity observed in our study is most likely associated with the high diversity of bat species tested, which is in accordance with previous findings [40] . It also confirms the observations from the large study on CoVs in more than 12,000 bats across Africa and Asia from Anthony et al. (2017) who demonstrated that increasing sampling efforts leads to increased identification of new lineages. Although we studied only very few samples from Hipposideros bats, we did not only find a high infection rate (7/21, 33%), but observed also a high genetic diversity among their CoVs in accordance with most previous studies on Hipposideros species in Africa [15, 34, 35, [39] [40] [41] [42] . The human 229E α-CoV falls in a clade of bat CoVs that is widely present in Hipposideros bats from Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Gabon, Ghana and also in our study in Guinea. Hipposiderids roost in hollow trees, small caves and abandoned buildings, and indirect and direct exposure to infected bats and to the wide diversity of CoVs is thus very likely [57, 58] . Moreover, the β-CoVs observed in Hipposideros bats belong to the SarbeCoV subgenus where they form a sister-clade to the clade of human and animal CoVs related to SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Within this viral clade, the genetic diversity is also very high, and viruses from this clade are present in Hipposideros species across Africa [15, 35, 39, 41, 59] . CoVs have also been described in Hipposideros bats in China and Thailand, suggesting a potential new clade [55, 60, 61] . The β-CoV observed in the Nycteris bat from Guinea falls with other CoVs from Nycteris bats in the MerbeCoV subgenus, forming a sister clade to the MERS-CoV related viruses from humans and animals. This clade is also widespread in Nycteris species across Africa [37, 40] . All β-CoVs from frugivorous bats fall within the NobeCoV subgenus, in which for certain species potential new viral lineages are seen. However, this could be related to the low number of CoVs available among GenBank references. For α-CoVs we also observed mainly association between CoVs and their bat hosts, except for α-CoV virus identified in the frugivorous L. angolensis bat (CCGU550) clustering with α-CoVs from insectivorous bats.As in other studies, we also showed that the same bat species can be infected with different α and/or β-CoV lineages and species; this was seen in L. angolensis, R. aegyptiacus and Hipposideros sp. bats [15, 34, 39, 51, 56, 62] . We observed a co-infection in a single Rousettus aegyptiacus bat with an alpha and betacoronavirus. Co-infections have been previously reported among insectivorous bats in Asia, but not yet in Africa [61] [62] [63] .We confirm that different viruses co-circulate in the same species and that certain viral strains may be maintained in more than one host and that cross-species transmission may occur, as previously reported [34, 64] . These results are important because viral sharing and cross-species transmission may lead to recombination events and the emergence of novel bat coronaviruses or novel coronaviruses in other mammal species naturally infected with CoVs [64, 65] . Recent studies demonstrated that frequent cross-species transmission seem to explain the evolutionary history of CoVs rather than co-divergence [56, 66] . Moreover, viruses with a higher taxonomically and ecologically diverse host range seem to be more likely to adapt to humans and spread on a broad geographic scale and thus with a higher pandemic potential [65] .With this study in Guinea, we brought additional knowledge on coronaviruses in bats in Africa and especially in West Africa where only information was available for bats from Ghana and for small numbers of bats and species in Senegal and Nigeria [15, 35, 37, 59] . The fact that we observed a high genetic diversity with potential new viral variants illustrates clearly that knowledge on bat coronaviruses is still incomplete and that more bat CoVs will be discovered as sampling efforts will increase. Anthony et al. (2017) even estimate that more than 3000 bat CoVs circulate in the more than 1400 known bat species [56] . Given the impact of zoonotic transmissions from CoVs to humans, it is important to document the CoVs that circulate in bats, but also in other wildlife species because for certain HCoVs, intermediate hosts were involved. For example, the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 is the SARSr-Ra-BatCoV-RaTG13 from Rhinolophus bats from China, sharing more than 96% identity at the whole-genome level, but the receptor binding domain (RBD) exhibits stronger similarity to CoVs identified in pangolins, suggesting recombination [24, 25] . However, it cannot be excluded that a not yet identified CoV in bats or another animal species is at the origin of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. A prerequisite for cross-species transmission is compatibility between virus and human receptors, therefore future studies should not only focus on partial RdRp sequences but should thus also include characterization of the RBD of CoVs. In addition, as reminder, our findings are based on a small fragment of the RdRp gene, which is a highly conserved region. Therefore, complete genome sequencing and analysis of some key genes such as the Spike and ORF8 genes that have been shown to be hypervariable, should allow to assess recombination events [61, 64] . This will bring additional data to retrieve phylogenetic and temporal relationships between these bat CoVs and other pathogenic strains and thus give us more insight into their zoonotic potential.In this pilot study, we have demonstrated high rates and important genetic diversity of CoVs in frugivorous and insectivorous bats in Guinea. More studies are needed on CoVs in bats and wildlife in Guinea, but also in other geographic areas of Africa. This will certainly lead to the identification of more novel CoV species and maybe also new genera. Although we now have data for several thousands of bats worldwide, this still remains relatively small given the high numbers of bats that constitute colonies and the high number of bat species worldwide [67] . Future studies should focus on areas and species where contacts between humans are frequent or could become frequent due to environmental and climate changes. The high genetic diversity and complex evolutionary history of co-evolution, host switching, and recombination illustrates the complexity to track the animal reservoir of CoVs and to predict the areas at highest risk and species infected with CoVs with higher adaptive probability to infect humans. Efforts must continue not only on bats, but also on other animals to elucidate where CoVs circulate in wildlife and to clarify the role of intermediate species.",Guinea,abstract,2020-08-05,08
112ada6dcc8812157b51d50da64ce8df8fc28b95,Child Healthcare and Immunizations in Sub-Saharan Africa During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"After the first description of clusters of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 in China, the virus has spread all over the world. Monitoring activities and quarantine are playing an important role as rapid corrective strategies, but these processes could be very critical in the world's poorest health systems. Since COVID-19 in the pediatric population is infrequently severe (1), the indirect costs of the pandemic, related to the measures implemented to deal with the spread of the virus, can be worse than the infection itself.In this scenario, the COVID-19-related effects on child healthcare in Africa can be massive (2) , especially in the remote areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where health, economic, and social monitoring systems are poorly developed. This situation may even worsen, considering that several countries are soon entering the rainy season, which has major consequences for daily life and a potential impact on the rate of SARS-CoV-2 spread. A decrease in vaccinations could be among the most feared indirect effects of the pandemic, leading to a possible increase in morbidity and mortality in a population that has been considered to be less involved as regards the severe clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 compared to adults (1) .For these reasons, we aimed to understand the potential indirect impact of COVID-19 on child vaccinations and basic healthcare in a typical poor peripheral area of Sierra Leone (Kent, Rural Western Area, Sierra Leone). This area is not provided with basic services such as electricity and running water, with people needing to go to local streams for daily provision of water (3, 4) . Moreover, the area, although not far from the capital, Freetown, refers to local health centers for vaccinations as well as for routine antenatal and postnatal care. The area has an overall 90% vaccination coverage, which is in line with the overall national data published by the World Health Organization and UNICEF in 2019 (http://158.232.12. 119/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/sle.pdf). This research is part of a project that we started in 2015 in Bureh Town, Rural Western Area, Sierra Leone, partnering with the nearby community health center of Kent (Rural Western Area, Sierra Leone), which is the referral center for basic pediatric health services, from child visits (health controls and acute diseases) to vaccinations. In Sierra Leone, the first restrictive governmental measures (border control and closure, social distancing) were dated March 23, with total lockdown declared on April 3 (https://www.imf. org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19#S). As in many African countries, healthcare in Sierra Leone is free only for children under 5 years and pregnant women. Moreover, since health centers cover a wide area, most people need to pay for transport services to reach health centers, which is generally difficult and is even harder after COVID-19-related drop in income. Also, quarantine and fear of contagion, as well as the fear of being recognized as a COVID-19 case and stigmatized [a known problem in Africa, as already described with HIV and Tuberculosis (4)] might impact the routine child healthcare in these settings. In the same periods, the diagnoses of malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea were also assessed for the two different populations of children under 5 years of age as well as immunization for tetanus in pregnant women. During the lockdown, the health center continued to provide the same activities as in the pre-lockdown era, with all services guaranteed, from acute disorders to immunization services. Therefore, there was no reduction in the health activities offered to the local population due to COVID-19 restrictions. The data were collected, as absolute numbers, by the center's health workers in accordance with the usual rules held in Sierra Leone. Cases were retrospectively obtained using the health facility routine activity reporting forms. In many peripheral Sub-Saharan Africa health centers, data are collected by the health facility on a register by crossing off with a pen the type of vaccinations performed or the disease diagnosed, without registering personal data. Peripheral health centers have a registry book with dedicated pages for registration of diagnoses and type of vaccinations. For example, they have boxes to tick labeled ""PENTA1, "" ""PENTA2, "" and ""PENTA3."" This means that ""PENTA1"" is the first, and the others are the boosters. Written data were subsequently transferred to an electronic database and analyzed with SPSS software v.36. A comparison between the number of vaccinated children in the two periods of time, for each type of vaccine, was performed by applying a Wilcoxon test.The study was approved by a local commission composed of the research team of the Kent Community Health Post, the headman of the community, and the old men of the village, in a similar way as happens for all important political and economic Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org decisions in the examined area (n24_may-2020). Personal data were not collected.We noticed that a lower number of children received vaccination in 2020 compared with 2019, ranging from 50 to 85% depending on the individual vaccine analyzed, including BCG and OPV1, which are given directly at birth in Sierra Leone (see Table 1 for full details). Moreover, we also noticed a drop in common diagnoses, as has been happening also in developed countries (5) , and a reduction of the most common clinical conditions (malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea), although no increases in deaths were reported ( Table 2 ). There was a 50-80% drop in vaccination in 2020 compared to the previous year (p < 0.0005). Conversely, although the number of common diagnoses was lower in 2020, there was not enough evidence to be sure that this is a true difference (p > 0.05).Although we only analyzed preliminary data from an extremely poor area, they show an important decline in the vaccination rate and, although the difference was not significant, in child visits for acute diseases in the lockdown period in a rural area of Sierra Leone. The reduction in vaccination rates is particularly evident for booster vaccinations, suggesting that parents are not bringing their children back to health facilities for the subsequent controls and vaccinations, possibly because of fear of contagion. It is important to remark also the reduction of vaccinations given at birth in Sierra Leone in our sample (BCG and OPV1). This suggests either a decrease in the number of births or an increase in deliveries at home due to a fear of being infected in health facilities, which may be a high risk for woman and child health. These data highlight the need for active surveillance of births and immunizations registered in peripheral health centers in order to better understand the meaning of our findings. No increase in deaths in the area was reported. Anecdotical reports from our team highlighted no problems regarding vaccine supplies in the area due to COVID-19 restrictions, so the reduced vaccinations are not related to vaccine supplies. Also, it is important to highlight that, during the lockdown, the health center maintained the same activities as in the pre-lockdown era, with all services guaranteed, from acute disorders to immunizations services. Therefore, there was no reduction of the health activities offered to the local population because of COVID-19 restrictions.We are aware of the limitations of our findings. In particular, this is a retrospective study concerning a limited time period, we collected absolute numbers, and no comprehensive epidemiological data for the area are currently available (such as birth rates from local villages) since the current pandemic is creating a high workload for local workers and, at the same time, limits their possibility of interacting with other offices. However, we also understand that collecting more robust data in very remote, peripheral, rural areas of Sierra Leone is not easy, particularly in a period when movements between areas are not allowed. However, these findings are new and bear potential significant implications. Local health workers anecdotally reported they had the feeling that people could not afford routine care (from transport fees to visit fees for those over 5 years of age), and our data provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of a possible drop in access for basic but priority pediatric services in remote areas, while similar rates have already been reported in the adult population of South Africa (6) . A similar scenario is currently happening in the United States, where a recent nationwide analysis of vaccine information found that measles, mumps, and rubella vaccinations had dropped by 50% during the COVID-19 outbreak (6) . However, while the U.S. has tools to face this challenge, and the American Academy of Pediatrics is working hard to support pediatricians and families to ensure vaccination coverage, low-income rural/peripheral settings in Sierra Leone do not have easy access to the appropriate instruments to ensure that families bring children to health centers, and our data on a small sample population confirm what the World Health Organization predicted as one of the possible effects of the lockdown on child healthcare (7, 8) . Importantly, a drop in vaccination coverage in Africa bears potentially devastating consequences for child health.Although our data must be interpreted with caution, since we report only a single experience from an area of Sierra Leone, they clearly indicate a new scenario. It is not easy for low-income rural/peripheral settings in Sierra Leone to respond to COVID-19, giving rise to a potential risk that children could suffer from the indirect consequences of the pandemic more than in other parts of the world. Sources of income in peripheral/rural areas in Sierra Leone can be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (9) . Although testing, isolating, and quarantining are the best ways to prevent COVID-19 diffusion in Africa (10) , this can lead to difficulties in providing basic services to the local population, as previously described (3). People from the area we analyzed are already experiencing limitations related to the pandemic in accessing basic needs, such as food, water, health services, and preventive strategies, and are now depending on donations for basic food (3). Highly vulnerable populations, such as younger children, often already compromised by malnutrition and comorbidities, face a greater risk of developing diseases or missing preventive opportunities (11) . In these peripheral/rural areas in Sierra Leone, people need a comprehensive approach that aims to provide COVID-19 care facilities as well as social services and essential resources for more common problems, and economic support must not be directed only to epidemiologic research trials (12) . Importantly, the rainy season is coming soon, and the situation will probably worsen.In conclusion, despite the limitations mentioned, our findings highlight a possible drop in immunizations in children living in a peripheral, rural area in Sierra Leone, West Africa. Considering the potential short-and long-term impact of reduced immunization rates on child health, there is a need to actively monitor vaccination practices in low-resource settings to ensure that there is no break in service delivery.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.The study was approved by a local commission composed of the research team of the Kent Community Health Post, the headman of the community, and the old men of the village, in a similar way as happens for all important political and economic decisions in the examined area (n24_may-2020).

The antiviral activity of HCQ against viral diseases such as HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome studied many years ago 17 . It also showed in vitro activity against SARS CoV-2 by inhibiting viral entry through targeting early endosomes and endolysosomes 18 . Moreover, HCQ could modulate the immune response and reduce proinflammatory cytokines 19 which are important inducers of acute respiratory distress syndrome 20 . Few retrospective observational studies reported some benefits in treating COVID-19 patients, where HCQ decreased mortality and IL-6 level 21 , decreased case fatality rate 22 , and improved patient survival 23 . On the other hand, other observational studies reported no benefits and more frequent side effects while using HCQ [24] [25] [26] . The same controversies are found in the randomized clinical trials (RCT) that investigated HCQ efficacy in COVID-19. Additionally, HCQ is one of the most widely used agents for treating COVID-19 infection despite insufficient supporting evidence. A few numbers of meta-analyses investigating this subject were conducted. However, they were criticized for some flaws addressed and discussed afterward. Therefore, there is an urgency to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis including all available clinical trials that meet the prespecified inclusion criteria. The objectives are to summarize efficacy of HCQ use in COVID-19 relative to control based on available clinical trials indicated by all possible improvements of the disease This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.and to pool all short-term possible side effects related to HCQ therapy in COVID-19 patients.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement were followed to improve reporting the present systematic review 27 .The protocol was registered in the international prospective reregister of systematic review (PROSPERO) with registration number CRD42020195886 in June 2020.The inclusion criteria for the eligible studies for systematic review AND metaanalysis include:-Clinical trials either randomized or not -COVID-19 patients > 12 years -Infected with SARS CoV-2 and had a PCR confirmation test; the test should be based on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab.-Non-severe infection (mild and moderate) based on clinical assessment by each study.-The treatment arm is HCQ ± usual treatment that was given according to each hospital and was not proven to be anti-COVID-19.

All rights reserved.-Control group is only on the usual treatment -Outcomes: any clinical outcomes or drug-related side effects during the follow-up period.The advanced search was used in different databases with limitation to clinical trials and fields of title and abstract without other limitations. The synonyms applied in search terms were SARS or COVID and hydroxychloroquine or HCQ or Plaquenil.Three researchers independently underwent comprehensive searching and identified certain studies after removing duplicated ones.According to the PRISMA flow diagram (figure 1) 28 , the selection of eligible studies for meta-analysis from identified ones was conducted by two researchers through three steps; abstracts screening for relevant studies, full-text articles assessment for eligibility, and effect measures assessment for quantitative synthesis. Disagreements were resolved by discussion among the authors. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.2.6. Data collection process: ""Data collection form for intervention reviews: RCTs and non-RCTs"" developed by Cochrane was used for data extraction 29 . Numbers were extracted directly from text and tables and indirectly from graphs using Getdata graph digitizer version 2.26.0.20 30 . Data extraction was done by three independent authors.There are three types of variables; 1) independent variable is HCQ therapy, 2) dependent variables include viral clearance in the pharyngeal swab, clinical progression (increase in the baseline severity), radiological progression, adverse effects, and mortality, 3) confounders include usual treatment that varied among studies, age, sex, disease onset, and different HCQ doses.The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tools to assess the bias risk were followed 31 . It includes 6 domains: selection bias, reporting bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and other sources of bias. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) were also utilized 32 . The risk of bias was assessed by three authors and a final consensus was done. Publication bias couldn't be assessed because of the low number of the included studies. Sensitivity analysis was performed after removing the low-quality studies.The principal summary measures were risk difference (RD) for the outcomes, odds ratio (OR) for gender, and mean difference (MD) for age with 95% confidence This article is protected by copyright.

Each of fixed-effect and random effect models was used to pool the effect sizes according to the heterogeneity of each outcome 33 . Mantel Hazel method and inverse variance method were used for dichotomous data and continuous data respectively.All-time point meta-analysis was used to summarize the result of viral clearance at each available time point.PRISMA flow diagram in figure (1) shows that 432 studies were identified after the removal of duplications, 391 studies were removed after screening titles and abstracts based on their relevance, and 36 studies were removed after assessment of full article for eligibility based on the inclusion criteria. The remaining 6 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Some studies were excluded because of their retrospective design 34 , did not recruit PCR-confirmed cases 35, 36 , or recruited less than 12 years-old patients 36 .The population of the included studies had non-severe COVID-19 except 2 severe patients in Tang W. et al study 37 . The disease severity definition slightly varied by the studies. It was based on Chinese guidelines in three studies [37] [38] [39] [40] in Barbosa J. et al study 44 . The disease onset before HCQ treatment varied from 1 and 4 days in three studies [42] [43] [44] to 16 days in another study 37 .HCQ regimens varied among the studies; only three studies used loading doses of 800 and 1200 mg/d 37, 42, 44 . Maintenance daily doses of 200, 400, 600, 800 mg were also used according to each study (Table 1) .Usual treatment was given to all patients according to needs and varied widely among the studies. It included: supportive care, symptomatic treatment, steroids, antibiotics, and antivirals 37-39, 42, 43 (Table 1 ). The two groups were comparable in all mentioned baseline factors in each included study.The risk of bias is summarized in figure (2) . The study design of Barbosa J. et al was included as it emulated clinical trial design and the recall bias was unlikely 44 Heterogeneity was not significant (χ 2 = 2.47, P = 0.48). (Figure 4) 6-Twenty-eight-days mortality was not statistically significant between the two groups. RD pooled from two studies 37, 42 using fixed-effect model was 0.00 (-0.01 to 0.01). Heterogeneity was not significant (χ 2 = 0.00, P = 1). (Figure 4 After excluding the two low-quality studies 44, 45 , the same analyses on the applicable outcomes were performed. No difference was observed between the two analyses on the progression, mortality and viral clearance.HCQ therapy in COVID 19 is still a matter of debate among healthcare providers 47 . It was introduced early in the pandemic based on early studies 48 This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.observational and interventional studies raised concerns about the safety of the drug and even prematurely terminated due to serious cardiac side effects 24, 49-51 .Sensitive indicators for a possible efficacy of anti-COVID-19 drugs should rely on the improvement in the disease clinical course and modification in possible causes of the related mortality. Radiological abnormalities of the lung could be a good measure of the drug efficacy. Lung abnormalities on chest CT in COVID-19 patients changed gradually from ground-glass opacities on the first days to an increase in the crazypaving pattern after one week, then became consolidated on day 10 and started to resolve after 2 weeks of the disease course 52 . Ability of a drug to prevent disease progression from mild/moderate to severe has been targeted as a reliable efficacy measure 53 . Accordingly, it could inhibit the pathophysiological pathways of the virus.The disease severity was defined by WHO as SpO2 < 94% on room air, including those who require any form of supplemental oxygen 54 . Viral clearance is of clinical importance as it correlated with the clinical and biochemical outcomes 55 , but may underestimate the immunomodulators effect including HCQ 12, 56 . On the other hand, low rates of mortality were reported among non-severe COVID-19, large number is required to get enough power to show a significant difference 57 . Mortality may not be a sensitive indicator among those with non-severe COVID-19.The present meta-analysis targeted non-severe COVID-19 patients to assess the efficacy and safety of HCQ based on the available evidence. In addition, the minimal age of the inclusion criteria was expanded to 12 years to add more studies. HCQ was used in the RECOVERY trial for infants more than 6 months without concerns 58 , but it could not be included in this review as it also had no PCR-based confirmation test. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.The present study offers moderate-quality evidence built on five clinical trials and one quasi-trial. The meta-analysis investigated five measurable objective outcomes, two of them showed statistical significance; chest CT progression and incidence of some adverse drug effects. However, clinical progression, viral clearance at three time points, and 5-days mortality did not differ between the two groups. all time points meta-analysis to summarize the effect size on 5, 6, and 7-days was performed to get more accurate results 59 .The chest CT-based disease assessment was performed on days 0 and 6 to evaluate the disease progression in Chen Z. et al study 39 . It depended on pneumonia absorption on CT and weather it was absorbed by more or less 50%, it also depended on pneumonia absorption on CT in Chen J. et al study 38 .The clinical progression definition was consistent in three studies [37] [38] [39] Large RCT with sufficient power is required with longer follow-up period, it should report more sensitive outcomes stratified by the disease severity and based on the proposed mechanisms of action of HCQ to improve the clinical course of COVID-19.A lot of limitations faced the investigators due to conflicts between the included trials, high level of heterogeneity which is present among some studies methodologies and outcomes such as COVID-19 severity definitions and the background treatment. The This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.low number of studies with relatively small sample size and low quality is also another challenge.There are no tangible beneficial effects of adding HCQ to the treatment of patients suffering from non-severe PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. Reducing the chest CT progression by HCQ was neither sufficient to reduce the early mortality nor promote the early clinical progression more than the usual therapy used. Its use was accompanied with a significant incidence of adverse effects without any effect on viral clearance.Funding: None",Egypt,first author,2020-08-18,08
f311277a8bf7dbc1543f18b9e1d9685c0a518d32,A twin disaster: Addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and a cerebrospinal meningitis outbreak simultaneously in a low-resource country,"Confronting two deadly infectious diseases in lowand middle-income countries (LMIC) has severe implications for the quality of healthcare provided and overall wellbeing of the people. This is hugely due to the inadequate healthcare personnel and poor healthcare infrastructure in these countries. This is the case of Ghana that is presently battling with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM), two deadly infectious diseases. We examined how the response strategies being adopted in Ghana may affect management outcome of both diseases and what can be done differently, using scarce national and local resources, to improve the management of these infectious diseases.Within a spate of about three months, COVID-19 which started as an outbreak in Wuhan, China in late December 2019, became a pandemic. It is caused by the novel coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . As at 12 May 2020, 00:00 GMT, globally, there are 4,088,848 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 283, 153 deaths in 215 countries and territories [2] with 1,471,496 recoveries [3] . Ghana has recorded 5, 127 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 494 recoveries and 22 deaths as at 12 May 2020 [4] . These cases are confined to the two biggest cities (and their surrounding towns) of Ghana: Accra and Kumasi. This corresponds to a national case fatality rate of ~0.4%, lower than the global average of ~7%. Most of those who died were said to be old and had underlying comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension. In April 2020, 60% of COVID-19-infected persons were males. Following the confirmation of COVID-19 cases in the country, the government of Ghana and relevant State institutions; namely, Ghana Health Service and Ministry of Health, have activated the country's public health response system to manage the pandemic. At the same time, there was an outbreak of CSM in the northern part of the country.CSM is an infectious disease that is marked by inflammation of the meninges (membranous coverings of the brain and the spinal cord). Agents such as bacteria, virus, fungi and parasites cause CSM. Bacterial CSM, the commonest type of CSM, is caused mainly by Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenza [5] [6] [7] . Ghana falls within the African CSM belt that stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia. The CSM annual outbreak in Ghana occurs from November to May/June during the dry weather periods of northern Ghana (Northern, North East, Savanna, Upper East and Upper West Regions); a season characterised by cold wind and enormous dust [8] [9] [10] . Sporadic cases are also reported in parts of the then Brong Ahafo and upper part of the Volta regions.Acute bacterial meningitis is among the leading cause of disability in LMICs and has a higher prevalence rate in LMICs than in high-income countries [7, 11] . A five-year evaluation study on CSM in Ghana, spanning the period 2010-2015 [12] , reported that 1,176 cases have been recorded in the northern part of the country. Similarly, that from December 2015 to February 2016, 133 laboratory-confirmed cases of meningitis (46.5% of suspected cases within the period) were reported in the then Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions of the country [6] . From January 2008 to December 2010, 163 confirmed cases of meningitis were found [11] . In 2016, there were about 90 deaths and major morbidities that resulted from about 400 suspected cases of meningitis in Ghana [9] . With an overall mean age of 23.7 years, about 53% of suspected cases of CSM were males and the remaining 47% were females [9] implying an almost proportionate infection rate by gender [12] . Additionally, the researchers reported that from October 2016 to January 2017, 285 of a 330 CSF sample from 41 districts in the northern zone of Ghana tested positive for bacterial meningitis, depicting a positivity rate of 86%. Mortality rate of CSM in Ghana is between 36% and 50% [13, 14] .This year, more than 400 confirmed CSM cases with about 50 deaths in the country's CSM endemic regions: Northern, North East, Savanna, Upper East and Upper West Regions, have been recorded [15, 16] . The recent outbreak, particularly in the Upper West Region, has the highest number of CSM fatalities and it is caused by a novel strain, Neisseria meningitidis serotype X, and Streptococcus pneumoniae which has a mean case fatality rate of 40% [15] . Just like SARS-CoV-2, this novel strain (Neisseria meningitidis serotype X) has no vaccine. The Upper West region has about 15% CSM case fatality rate resulting from 258 CSM cases and 40 deaths. Overall, at the moment, the national data suggests a higher case fatality rate of CSM than COVID-19. This notwithstanding, not much governmental effort, for instance in terms of personnel and material resource allocation, has been channelled to combating the more deadly CSM outbreak. This is contrary to past experiences in CSM management in which control measures, case management, contact tracing and public education on identification of early signs and symptoms were vigorously and timeously carried out [6, 8] .COVID-19 and CSM have similar signs and symptoms including fever, headache and confusion or altered consciousness [6, 8] . Additionally, CSM is characterised by neck stiffness, vomiting and photophobia [8, 17] . Both diseases have been shown to result in some level of hearing loss, cognitive challenges and brain damage [12, 18, 19] . Specifically, neurological challenges including epilepsy and mental retardation have been reported in survivors of CSM [5, 7] . Both diseases may spread through air droplets, saliva and respiratory secretions when people are in close contacts [12, 20] . Their incubation periods are also similar and is estimated to be about 2-10 days [20, 21] .The management of COVID-19 and CSM in Ghana portrays a case of inequity in healthcare resource distribution. Equity in healthcare resource distribution requires that such resources are shared to people based on the extent of their needs of those resources [22, 23] . Since the confirmation of COVID-19 in Ghana, a high-level governmental involvement in confronting the disease has been shown. This has culminated in a number of interventions aimed at preventing, curbing the spread and treatment of the disease. These include the closure of the country's entry ports, enactment of imposition of restrictions law which resulted in lockdowns in parts of the country, demarcation of isolation and treatment centres, setting up of a national COVID-19 trust fund, acquisition of a one billion dollar bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and initiation of enhanced contact tracing and testing. This is partly due to the severe havoc being caused by COVID-19 in other countries particularly in Europe and the United States. Unfortunately, in Ghana, these efforts targeted at COVID-19 have resulted in CSM being pushed to the background while it causes much devastation in the outbreak areas. The activation of meningitis surveillance by the Ghana Health Service and deployment of its Rapid Response Team appeared late and ineffective [24, 25] . Additionally, Regional and District Public Health Emergency Management Committees were activated and provision of some medical supplies was carried out. However, these Teams had little or no resources to work with as healthcare officials and local authorities continued to appeal to the government and philanthropists for resources to combat the outbreak [26] . This is in stark contrast to the equity requirement in healthcare resource distribution. Equity in the distribution of healthcare resources ensures that people have access to the needed healthcare services hence improved management of medical conditions [27, 28] . Inequality exists in Ghana's healthcare system and has been largely driven, over the years, by urbanrural geographical differences [29, 30] . The differences exist in the distribution of healthcare services and resources (facilities and personnel). However, the markedly differences in response strategies in the two present outbreaks might be due to the severe danger being caused by COVID-19 in other countries as well as the probability of spread of COVID-19 to all other parts of the country compared to CSM whose likelihood of spread throughout the country is lower.While available evidence suggests that the aged are at higher risk of both infection and death resulting from COVID-19, children and young adults suffer much more from CSM [5, 8, 11, 12, [31] [32] [33] . This suggests that the entire population, particularly in the CSM endemic areas, maybe at a higher risk of infection of this 'twin disaster' -COVID-19 and CSM. Also, the CSM endemic areas are largely rural settings characterised by inadequate healthcare personnel and supplies such as drugs hence people are likely to receive poor medical care. Additionally, having to live through these diseases might come with psychological distress as people might be living their lives in fear and anxiety not knowing if they will survive these infectious diseases.A challenge associated with dealing with CSM is its diagnosis especially in the areas experiencing the outbreak [9] . In the management of CSM, early diagnosis contributes to better treatment outcome [9, 15] .Most of the few health facilities are health centres/ posts and Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) compounds which are meant to provide basic medical care [34, 35] . Since these facilities lack the requisite equipment and professionals, misdiagnosis of CSM becomes a likely occurrence [36, 37] . To complicate matters, because CSM and malaria have similar signs and symptoms, there may be misdiagnosis of CSM as malaria, a very common tropical disease in Ghana. This implies that persons suffering from CSM may be triaged as malaria patients, increasing the likelihood that they may be out there in the public infecting others. This is particularly the case for persons with CSM but who are asymptomatic.The lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers in the CSM endemic zones may create an increased sense of psychological distress among these workers. This becomes worse because on a daily basis, healthcare professionals throughout the country are calling for more PPE to fight COVID-19. Each day, as healthcare officials in the CSM endemic zones report for work, they are confronted with the thought of working in an environment where they are prone to be infected with two highly contagious diseases. Should they be infected with any of these two diseases, their immediate family members who they share rooms with at home are at high risk of being infected too.The 'twin disaster' of COVID-19 and CSM are having a huge toll on the livelihood of people in the CSM endemic areas. The area is, largely, a rural setting that forms part of the high poverty-ridden areas of the country. The many COVID-19 restrictions instituted by the government such as social distancing, some of which are also beneficial to preventing the spread of CSM, are affecting the livelihoods or work activities and finances of most of these people. This is likely to affect their overall preparedness to adhere to measures aimed at fighting off both the pandemic and the outbreak.Despite the acknowledgement of COVID-19 as a pandemic with its attendant consequences, the available data, presently, showed that CSM is equally catastrophic, especially in Ghana. Immediate strong governmental effort should be channelled towards the fight against CSM in the outbreak areas in the country. This will ensure that equitable distribution of healthcare resources will be adhered to. The government, through the Ghana Health Service, should increase its interventions in the area, including stockpiling of drugs such as antibiotics, intravenous fluids and laboratory CSM test kits (reagents, etc.). Having commenced local production of PPE aimed at fighting COVID-19, an increased effort should be made in this regard to make a lot more available for health professionals in the CSM outbreak areas. Indeed, available evidence suggests that many healthcare professionals are getting infected with COVID-19, both in Ghana and the world at large [38] [39] [40] [41] . To boost the confidence of healthcare professionals combating this 'twin disaster' as well as to ensure that they are not unnecessarily put at risk, it is recommended that enough PPE are made available to them. It is important to state that since both infectious diseases have a number of similarities, resources aimed at managing COVID-19 could be leveraged upon to fight CSM as well. When equity in healthcare resource distribution is ensured, there is better disease management and overall outcome [42] .Having known the exact strain causing the current outbreak, case definitions of CSM diagnosis should be updated. Consequently, healthcare officials, at all levels, in these areas should be informed of the needed update.Having conducted about 150 thousand tests for COVID-19 presently, available data showed that by 8 May, Ghana was among the leading countries in case testing per capita in Africa [43, 44] . This is partly attributed to the effective contact tracing being employed. It is also recommended that the country should, as a matter of urgency, deploy same approach to trace persons who have come into contact with CSM positive persons and test these people for CSM. This becomes imperative owing to possible asymptomatic CSM cases.Similarly, apart from the need for the central government to provide enough funding, the nation's health insurance authority must ensure prompt processing and payment of claims submitted by healthcare facilities managing CSM cases. This will enable the facilities to effectively acquire other needed essentials to ensure effective and efficient running of their activities. Additionally, just as for COVID-19 treatment, CSM treatment should be entirely free of charge, at all times. This will encourage the already economically challenged persons in the CSM endemic areas to avail themselves for medical treatment should they have signs and symptoms of CSM.Apart from dealing with the healthcare facilities and personnel-related issues, public awareness creation or education on CSM is critical. This is because lack of knowledge on early signs and symptoms of a disease affects treatment outcome [10] . Early case detection leads to early diagnosis and treatment [9] . Therefore, intense community-level public education on the prevention and curbing the spread of CSM should be carried out in the endemic areas. The need for early report of signs and symptoms of CSM to healthcare facilities, avoiding overcrowding and practising good personal hygiene should be emphasised in the campaign. This should be done not only by healthcare professionals but also by traditional and opinion leaders and NGOs operating in the outbreak areas. The use of local authorities in the awareness creation will enhance community buy-ins and adherence to the preventive measures. It can be done through the use of vans fitted with public address systems in which live and pre-recorded educational messages on CSM are broadcast. Equally, most local communities in Ghana now have public address platforms fixed at a central location in the community which can be used. Public education will also reduce misinformation about CSM; some of which could account for the refusal of people to seek early medical care. Importantly, this community-level education should be an annual programme that should be carried out prior to the start of the CSM outbreak period in the five northern-most regions of Ghana as well as the middle zones.For the medium-to long-term, the traditional housing facility in the most endemic areas which pose as favourable grounds for the spread of CSM due to poor ventilation should be improved. These houses, apart from their poor ventilation, are highly populated with many inhabitants owing to the communal living of Ghanaians as well as the high level of poverty in most of these areas. Government and other stakeholders should institute a modern and affordable housing scheme for the indigenes to tackle this.People living in the CSM endemic regions of Ghana are likely to be experiencing some level of psychological distress having to be fighting both COVID-19 and CSM simultaneously. This is because unlike CSM which is endemic in particular areas of the country, COVID-19, with the passage of time, is more likely to spread to other parts of the country. The psychological distress might be in the form of anxiety, depression, insomnia and the likes. This might affect their mental health and overall wellbeing. In this light, it is recommended that health authorities should engage the services of the Ghana Psychological Association and other professional bodies to help reduce the psychological distress people in the CSM areas might be going through in these times.A developing country confronted with two deadly diseases at the same time requires planned and concerted efforts to use its meagre resources, both human and material, to successfully tackle the diseases. We are presently doing quite well in managing the COVID-19 pandemic while doing little to combat the more deadly CSM, per our local case fatality rate. There is enormous similarity between both diseases and so it is recommended that we apply measures and effort that can help us achieve success at preserving lives and reducing the harmful effects of the two diseases on Ghanaians. Much effort should be paid to ensure equitable distribution of healthcare resources with an overarching aim of effectively managing the disease and improving overall outcome.None.SA: Contributed to conceiving and designing the study and writing the manuscript, DLE: Contributed to conceiving and designing the study and led in writing of the manuscript.

Simultaneously confronting an outbreak of an even deadlier infectious disease, cerebrospinal meningitis, in a low-resource country with already compromised healthcare system and infrastructure, is a major challenge. Effective management of these conditions to ensure better outcome and reduced psychological distress among the population require equitable distribution of scarce healthcare resources and public education suited to the peculiarities of such a developing country.http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9308-6031 Daniel Lawer Egbenya http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3223-8510",Ghana,abstract,2020-08-07,08
acfb08a7222a3071f3ed669dba12d6f263f12e1b,COVID-19 Recommendations for Patients with Cancer: The post-COVID-19 Era,"COVID-19 outbreak is a major health problem caused by a novel infectious disease (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) that appeared in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China.Today, more than 12 million of COVID-19 cases have been confirmed worldwide, including more than 500,000 deaths. In Morocco, the first case of COVID-19 was identified on March 2, 2020, with a progressive increase to reach 15,443 cases on July 11. Cancer patients, mainly those who have received surgery or chemotherapy, are more likely to develop COVID-19 infection and to develop severe forms of the disease. It is important to note that frail, elderly, or patients with chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory syndromes are at higher risk (× 3.5 to 5 times) of developing severe forms of the infection [1] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, national and international societies recommend continuing the management of cancer patients despite the spread of the virus in the world. They established guidelines to adapt patient care and to limit the risk of contamination by the virus while preserving their chances of recovery [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] (http://smc.ma/recommandation-cancer-etcovid-19-smc/). For example, Table 1 summarizes special recommendations implemented for patients diagnosed with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [4] . In the present paper we summarize our recommendations for patients with cancer during the post-COVID-19 phase.The post-COVID-19 era requires the implementation of new recommendations for the management of cancer patients that may be applicable until the end of 2020-beginning of 2021. In short term, it is necessary to adapt medical care to the regional health environment, according to availability of medical and non-medical staff and equipment resources, which implies that the recommendations made should be adapted to the particularity of each region and each establishment [8] .During the post-COVID-19 phase, all patients should be considered as COVID-19 positive until proven otherwise. Thus, a national strategy for screening of COVID-19 infection should be considered before admission of patients in cancer centers, to protect cancer patients and medical staff from COVID-19 disease [6, 8] .This article is part of the Topical Collection on COVID-19 In addition, caution should be undertaking, as the epidemiological situation today will not be the same in the upcoming weeks.It is recommended to follow the same measures established by the WHO during COVID-19 era to protect cancer patients from COVID-19 infection (https://www.who.int/ emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019): Prevention of risks of contamination by suspect cases in cancer centers should be based on a systematic evaluation of clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 disease, temperature taking at the entrance of the establishment, on a PCR test, and possibly coupled with a chest CT scan and serologies, depending on availability, in addition to biological workup to evaluate eosinopenia, lymphopenia, and increased of inflammation parameters [8] .Educating patients about the new context, the risk-benefit balance, the existence of a prioritization system for cancer care is an essential prerequisite (following the priorities proposed in Table 2 ).The decision on the priorities for surgery should be undertaking in a multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting in accordance with recommendations established by national and international societies [3, 4, 7, 8] . The possibility of adapting the treatment sequence will depend on the disease stage and the acceptable time to defer surgery. Postponing surgery should only be considered in the case of difficulties to access to operating rooms in case of occupancy of the structure by COVID-19 patients.General recommendations to limit contamination of patients in cancer centers while maintaining the chances of appropriate care [3] [4] [5] [7] [8] [9] Teleconsultation has become a new opportunity for triage of patients into those who should be physically examined, and those who should benefit from additional workup before their admission physically to limit their exposure to the hospital environment and therefore to reduce their risk of contamination. The main limitation of teleconsultation during follow-up is the impossibility of examining patients, but as long as the epidemic situation is not controlled, teleconsultation remains preferable [3] [4] [5] [7] [8] [9] .Therapeutic management should be discussed in an MDT meeting. The use of videoconferences is to be preferred whenever possible. If not possible, it is recommended to limit the number of participants and the duration of the MDT meetings.It is recommended to establish new schedules in order to avoid overloads of appointments (chemotherapy/radiotherapy) that may be deferred at the level of each unit. Prioritize patients in need of urgent care. Two separate situations should be considered, depending on COVID-19 status: COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive.Management of COVID-19-negative patients should be discussed according to the priority of care ( Table 2) .Clinical Setting of High Priority (H) Patients with high priority have a disease which immediately threatens the vital prognosis, a clinically unstable or completely intolerable situation for which even a short delay would considerably modify the patient's prognosis.Assuming effective treatment, these patients have priority, even if resources are limited, requiring urgent treatment to save their lives or control the progression of their illnesses or relieve their symptoms.Clinical Setting of Medium Priority (M) Patients who do not have an immediately life-threatening disease but for whom treatment or management procedures should not be delayed more than 1-3 months without any impact on their outcomes.Clinical Setting of Low Priority (L) Patients for whom treatment or management procedures can be postponed for more than 3 months.Urgent Treatments Which Cannot Be Postponed Chemotherapy Curative chemotherapy: germ cell tumors; neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer (HER2+ or triple-negative breast cancer); symptomatic metastatic cancers: breast cancer with visceral crisis; small cell lung carcinoma; advanced ovarian cancer, etc.Radiotherapy Radiotherapy for emergencies: spinal cord compression, symptomatic brain metastases, bleedings, etc.; radiotherapy for locally advanced lung cancer; radiotherapy for A dedicated circuit should be implemented for COVID-19positive patients whose management cannot be postponed. Otherwise, management should be postponed for 4 weeks in the case of non-serious forms. In severe forms of COVID-19 disease that required a long stay in intensive care units, the management should be discussed on a case-by-case basis in a multidisciplinary team meeting after the resolution of the COVID-19 infection [1] .During the post-COVID-19 era, new recommendations for the management of cancer patients have been implemented in Morocco as well as in Western countries. Medical care should ensure optimal treatment while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.It is recommended to follow the protective measures established by the WHO to protect cancer patients from COVID-19 infection.A national strategy for screening program of COVID-19 infection should be implemented before admission of patients in cancer centers, to protect cancer patients and medical staff.Optimal treatment should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting, and any decision made should be discussed and shared with the patient.Management of COVID-19-negative patients should be made according to the priority of care defined by the gravity of the cancer disease.A dedicated circuit should be implemented for COVID-19positive patients whose management cannot be postponed.Further clinical studies are needed to guide cancer patient care during the post-COVID-19 era.Author's contribution Nabil Ismaili contributed to the conception and design, drafting, and critical revision of this manuscript.Conflict of Interest The author declares that he has no conflict of interest.Ethical Approval This article does not contain any studies with human participants performed by the author.Consent Not applicable.",Morocco,abstract,2020-08-15,08
bae06199b661c29d7e42d84e18efb2e28ade059a,Cancer is Associated with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Severity and Mortality: A pooled analysis,"following criteria: (1) observational cohort or case-control studies reporting malignancy frequency data in COVID-19 patients (>18 years old), (2) used appropriate definition of severe disease or compared survivors to non-survivors, (3) disease severity was monitored throughout the study, (4) clearly outlined the definition of ""severe disease"" and (5) sample size >10. A clinically valid definition of ""severe disease"" (i.e. a composite of (1) respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥30 per min; (2) oxygen saturation on room air at rest ≤93%; (3) partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤300 mmHg; (4) patients requiring mechanical ventilation/vital life support/intensive care unit admission (ICU); (5) death/ mortality) was required for a study to be included. Reviews and studies with incomplete or irrelevant data were excluded. Any disagreements between reviewers arising during the eligibility assessment were settled through consensus.Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by three independent reviewers (I.C, B.N and V.K). For each study, the following information was extracted: the surname of the first author and the year of publication, the geographical region where the study was performed, the type of study, sample size, baseline demographic characteristics, proportion of cancer patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19/ survivors and non-survivors. Any variances were resolved by consensus. Quality assessment and analysis of risk of bias of all selected full-text articles were performed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) tool. The primary outcome of interest was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 severity, while the secondary outcome was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 mortality.The statistical analysis was carried out using MetaXL (software version 5.3, EpiGearInternational Pty Ltd., Sunrise Beach, Australia) and Meta-Analyst (software version 5.26.14, Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Brown University, Providence, USA). The strength of association between malignancies and COVID-19 severity and mortality was estimated using the odds ratio (OR). A random-effects model was applied. The magnitude of heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the chi-squared test (Chi 2 ) and I-squared statistic (I 2 ).For the Chi 2 test, a Cochrane""s Q p-value of <0.10 was considered significant. The values of the I 2 statistic were interpreted as follows at a 95% confidence interval: Thresholds of 25%, 50%, and 75% to designate low, moderate, and high heterogeneity were applied 4 . Random-effects meta-regression using log OR was performed to evaluate the impact of baseline characteristics (age and sex) on the study outcomes. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.Additionally, a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results and to further probe the sources of inter-study heterogeneity.

4b8da2b2ba21349eee938d865b8e5bea02fcb531,"Knowledge and Perception of COVID-19, Prevalence of Pre-Existing Conditions, and Access to Essential Resources and Health Services in Somali IDP Camps","• There are no studies to date examining COVID-19 symptoms, as well as attitudes and perceptions, in Somali IDP camps.• Investigations performed in other camp-like humanitarian settings have demonstrated high prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms. What are the new findings?• People living in Somali IDP camps are generally unfamiliar with basic COVID-19 information, such as the possibility of transmission by asymptomatic individuals.• A majority of respondents displayed at least one symptom consistent with COVID-19, and the vast majority were unable to access COVID-19 screening services.• Older age, having implemented one behavioral change to protect against contraction, new stress or anxiety, and a ""fair"" health perception were significant predictors of being concerned about contracting COVID-19.• There is a significant gap in the knowledge and perception of COVID-19 by those in Somali IDP camps.• Utilizing trusted sources of information may be an effective way of disseminating COVID-19 related information among Somali IDP camp residents.There are more than 41 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 25 million refugees around the world according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) [1] . Many of these displaced people live in large-scale camps with conditions that could undermine public health guidelines for the control of COVID-19, such as social distancing, and are thus especially vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases [2] . Additional legal, financial, and linguistic barriers often inhibit displaced residents from accessing their host country's health care system, exacerbating conditions precipitated by an absence of basic amenities, such as soap, running water, and medical personnel [2] . Eighty-four percent of displaced people reside in lowor middle-income countries, and these host countries are often ill-equipped to rapidly institute health management protocols and response teams within IDP communities, especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [3] . Providing continuity of care for chronic conditions as well as infection prevention and control measures within displaced communities are necessary to ensure the wellbeing of both displaced and host communities [2, 4] .The Ministry of Health in Somalia announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Somalia on March 16, 2020 [5] . As of July 8, 2020, the Ministry of Health of Somalia reported 3,015 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,827 of which are active and 92 of which have resulted in death [5] . Although the prevalence of COVID-19 remains low at the moment, the nation's health system is extremely underprepared for a further outbreak of COVID-19 [6] .In Somalia, thirty years of civil war and natural disasters have resulted in nearly three million internally displaced persons who now inhabit over 2,100 overcrowded settlements [7] . The prolonged conflict has severely damaged Somalia's healthcare infrastructure, leaving its inhabitants vulnerable to climate related disasters, malnourishment, infectious disease outbreaks, and other humanitarian crises [8, 9] .Somalis face several barriers in utilizing their country's healthcare system. Several reports inculcate that health worker shortages and a nonexistent health information system leave its residents without reliable access to care [8, 9] . Somali physicians have also reported that there are no ventilators and only two intensive care units with a total of 31 beds across the country, which is alarming given that these resources are regarded as necessary to treat severe COVID-19 infections [10] . In addition, it has been reported that two in three Somalis have difficulties accessing safe water and approximately 50% of health care centers do not have reliable access to electricity [11, 12] . Qualitative reports also signal that care-seeking behavior is very poor among Somalis, as a result of distrust towards the system's lack of regulation and unaffordable prices [13] . Consequently, Somalia has some of the lowest health indicators in the world with life expectancies of 54 years for males and 57 years for females [11, 14] . Studies in Somalia have reinforced a predisposition of internally displaced persons to infectious and water-borne diseases [15] . IDPs are among the most vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks as they face circumstances such as overcrowding, uncontained sewage and waste, limited access to health services, contaminated water, low immunization coverage, and stigmatization.According to the Global Health Security Index, Somalia ranks 194 out of 195 countries in preparedness for a globally catastrophic biological event [16] . To address the dire threat COVID-19 poses to IDPs in Somalia, ongoing efforts have primarily focused on scaling up water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, increasing monitoring, and disseminating information about COVID-19 [6, 7, [17] [18] [19] . Many organizations have also helped obtain equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators for providers, as well as soap and chlorine tablets for community members [7, 10, 19] . Several organizations have reported that the country's health system has no capacity to make early case detections, isolate and care for patients, and trace contacts, and have thus focused their efforts on preventive measures to mitigate the virus's impact [13] .Among these efforts, few have incorporated IDP knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 in their planning and implementation. However, studies on Bangladeshi IDP camps similar to those in Somalia warn of the profound consequences of COVID-19 on those without a strong healthcare infrastructure [20] . The scarcity of IDP-focused COVID-19 data has not prevented various international health authorities from warning of the grave threats the pandemic poses to these vulnerable populations [21, 22] . Nevertheless, there is an international information gap about IDP knowledge and perceptions that inhibit providers from implementing sustainable, culturally appropriate health interventions.This study aims to explore knowledge and perceptions of the symptoms, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 among persons living in IDP camps and to understand the unique structural barriers that inhibit a comprehensive public health response in this setting. We hope that our study findings contribute to the development of potential interventions to improve the response to COVID-19 in Somali IDP camps, where some of the world's most vulnerable individuals reside.A descriptive, cross-sectional survey tool was used to assess the current health profile, living conditions, and knowledge and perceptions surrounding COVID-19 among adults living in Somali IDP camps. To design the survey tool, guidance was drawn primarily from published WHO and CDC information on COVID-19 symptoms and transmission, a 2019 Displacement Severity Assessment among forcibly evicted Somalis conducted by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, and two previously published survey studies which evaluated COVID-19 knowledge and risk factors in limited-resource settings [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .Our adapted survey tool begins with a section collecting demographic information on participants, including sex, age, displacement status, geographic location of their camp, household size and status, education, and employment. Responses for educational status reflect the education system in Somalia, and included options for ""no formal education"" and for all levels from primary through tertiary schools, as well as options for graduate degrees and Qur'anic education. The next section of the survey gathers information on participants' health profile, with questions on self-rating of current health, existing conditions, and current symptoms if applicable. This section also employs a 12-item tool to gauge concerns brought on by COVID-19, such as potential effects on mental wellbeing, contracting COVID-19, or ability to buy essential food items. The third section of the survey measures knowledge of COVID-19, most commonly used sources of information, and trust in various knowledge sources and community efforts against COVID- 19 . An open-ended question on COVID-19 knowledge was followed by a 23-item tool which assesses knowledge of COVID-19, and consists of true-or-false statements regarding key facts or misconceptions surrounding the disease. The final section of the survey evaluates access to medical resources, COVID-19 tests and treatments, and essential services. Because many participants did not speak English, this survey tool was translated into Somali. The Somali version of the survey was then reviewed for its content and suitability in the given context. Minor changes to the language of the Somali version were made to improve readability.Responses from each survey were manually input onto Qualtrics survey software in English and analyzed using SAS Studio 3.8 [28] . Sample descriptive statistics were used to report median and standard deviation calculations for continuous variables, along with frequency and percentages of responses for categorical variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were also conducted to demonstrate the relationships between concern about contracting COVID-19 and sex, age (dichotomized), education, food access, employment status, pre-existing conditions, symptoms present, actions taken, and healthcare utilization. These findings are presented with 95% confidence intervals.The demographic characteristics of survey participants are shown in Table 1 . Of the 401 eligible participants who recorded responses, 382 (96%) identified as IDPs and 15 (4%) identified as refugees. The survey had a completion rate of 99%. The vast majority of the participants were female (86%, n=344) and the median age of the participants was 32.0, with a standard deviation of 13.2 years. Most participants either had no formal education (89%, n=353) or received Qur'anic education (32%, n=126), with only 10 participants (3%) having received education past secondary school.Participant responses concerning perceptions of their personal health status, pre-existing health conditions, use of nicotine substances, and COVID-19 symptoms are displayed in Table 2 . While 58% (n=224) reported being in ""good"" health and only 3% (n=13) reported using cigarettes or tobacco products, 50% (n=197) (not shown in tables) of participants reported having one or more of the listed pre-existing conditions. In regards to symptoms being experienced, headache (49%, n=188) and fever (23%, n=88) were reported as the most common. Furthermore, 63% (n=243) of respondents were concerned about getting adequate physical exercise, and 51% (n=198) had concerns about job security ( Table 3) , indicating physical and financial precarities. Five percent (n=21) of respondents also knew someone experiencing violence in their household (not shown in tables), and 27% (n=106) anticipated contracting the virus at some point (not shown in tables). Additionally, 235 participants (59%) indicated that the nation-wide lockdown as a result of COVID-19 had decreased their income or caused them to lose their jobs when asked how COVID-19 had changed their daily lives (not shown in tables).Furthermore, the majority of participants marked that they did not know the current possible treatment (83%, n=327), the symptoms (50%, n=201), or the incubation period of COVID-19 (79%, n=313) (all not shown in tables). Another 60% (n=237) reported being unfamiliar with the practice of social distancing (not shown in tables), and 63% (n=250) did not know that asymptomatic individuals could spread the virus ( Table 4) . However, a sizable proportion of participants were able to recognize headache (34%, n=135), fever (45%, n=179), cough (35%, n=139), and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (31%, n=12) as symptoms of COVID-19 (not shown in tables). Still, the proportion of participants who were not familiar with basic background information surrounding COVID-19 was higher than the proportion who answered questions correctly.When respondents were asked what role religion played in the COVID-19 outbreak, approximately 34% wrote in short answer responses that religion played an ""important"" or ""very important"" role and another 22% specified that reading the Qur'an was of particular importance (not shown in tables). Additionally, 49% of the participants (n=190) reported that they trusted religious officials to provide information about COVID-19, while only 37% (n=144) and 5% (n=19) said that they similarly trusted health officials and humanitarian aid workers, respectively ( Table 5 ). In contrast, 90% (n=360) reported accessing traditional media services (radio, television, and newspapers), with only radio being indicated as a more trustworthy source than religious officials (57%, n=225). Additionally, only 4% (n=11) of respondents stated that they would go to health information providers in IDP camps if they suspected they had contracted the virus (not shown in tables). As a majority of respondents indicated that they felt that healthcare workers and the government were working together ""moderately"" or ""a lot"" to prevent the spread of COVID-19 ( Table 6) , participants' lack of initiative to approach health care workers seems to indicate a lack of COVID-19 related information and services in refugee camps instead of a distrust of such.Additionally, 185 (47%) respondents indicated that camp living conditions needed to change to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (not shown in tables). In short answer responses, 142 (80%) respondents expressed desires for improved sanitation, hygiene, or housing conditions, and 14 (8%) specifically indicated their desire for more stringent social distancing practices (not shown in tables). Maintaining physical space from others was also reported to be difficult, as 40% (n=159) and 32% (n=128) indicated that it be impossible or only somewhat possible to selfisolate if taken ill, respectively (not shown in tables). An additional 10 (6%) respondents indicated their desire for the distribution of more information regarding COVID-19 (not shown in tables).Similarly, respondents' self-reported access to COVID-19 screening and medical services was also low, with 97% (n=381) saying that they could not access screening and only 20% (n=79) stating that they were ""Strongly Confident"" or ""Moderately Confident"" that they could receive medical services if infected ( Table 7) . However, most participants had received a vaccination for any condition within the past few years (59%, n=232) (not shown in tables), and a further 54% (n=215) responded ""Moderately"" or ""A lot"" when asked how available vaccinations were to them, suggesting that COVID-19 specific services would be harder to access. Participants also reported accessibility issues, with 48% (n=191) stating that there was no healthcare facility nearby and, of those, 31% (n=61) said that it would take over an hour to reach it (not shown in tables).Lastly, in an adjusted model ( Table 8) , those who were concerned about contracting COVID-19 were more likely to perceive their current health status as fair, describe an increased presence of anxiety or stress, and introduce behavioral changes to protect themselves against the virus compared to those who weren't concerned with contracting COVID-19. Compared to those who perceived their current health status as good, those who perceived their health status to be fair showed 5.69 (95% CI: 2.36-13.71) times higher odds of being concerned about contracting COVID-19, while those who felt more anxious or nervous and those who introduced one behavioral change showed 10.16 (95% CI: 4.83-21.36) and 5.20 (95% CI: 1.99-13.58) times increased odds of being concerned about disease contraction, respectively. In addition, a doseresponse relationship in the number of distancing and sanitization behavioral changes implemented was observed, with those who introduced two or more behavioral changes showing 9.89 (95% CI: 4.88-20.02) times higher odds of being concerned about contracting COVID-19 when compared with those without any introduced behavioral changes. Lastly, the older half of our sample (older than 32 years of age) showed 1.93 (95% CI: 1.06 -3.51) times higher odds in being concerned about contracting COVID-19.This study is the first to explore knowledge of COVID-19, access to essential services, COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors among individuals living in IDP camps in Somalia. To our knowledge, it is also one of two studies that document knowledge of COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors among displaced populations globally, with the other study conducted in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh [27] . Overcrowding, limited access to WASH services, and a lack of health infrastructure leave displaced populations living in IDP camps particularly vulnerable to the spread of infectious disease such as COVID-19 [2] .Although a majority of our sample (57.6%) reported that they were in good health, a considerable proportion of our sample reported experiencing symptoms that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19, including headache (48.5%), fever (23.0%), or muscle or body aches (13.6%) [29] . Previous studies on health profiles of displaced populations or individuals living in such settings are unavailable in Somalia and are sparse in international settings, limiting the potential for cross-comparison. However, compared to a similar study conducted in refugee camps in Bangladesh, our sample exhibited higher proportions of individuals experiencing fevers, headaches, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, and muscle or body aches [27] . In addition, our study findings reinforce concerns put forward in the literature regarding the spread of COVID-19 in humanitarian settings, with participants reporting concerns including the following: getting adequate exercise (62.6%), their mental health and well-being (22.1%), job security (51.2%), practicing social distancing (18.7%), experiencing conflict within the home (9.6%), and their ability to buy essential foods in the last 7 days (65.9%). These concerns could serve as priority areas for health and social service providers to engage with and address, particularly food insecurity, job security, mental health, and physical exercise.Only 3.3% of our sample reported use of tobacco or cigarettes, which appears to be consistent with smoking prevalence in Somalia, especially considering that the majority of our sample consisted of women [30] . That being said, our study reports a lower rate of tobacco use when compared to other studies conducted in similar limited-resource settings [31] . Furthermore, though little information is available regarding the health conditions of individuals living in IDP camps, self-reported pre-existing conditions from our sample appear to be considerably low, particularly for chronic and mental health conditions, when compared to values expected from the literature [32] [33] [34] [35] . Health staff administering surveys reported that many participants did not know what the surveyed conditions were, had little recollection of previous diagnoses, and had rarely visited a health professional in the past, which would be consistent with the significant lack of formal education (88.7%) among participants and lack of access to a nearby healthcare facility (48.2%) and may explain the lower reported prevalence of chronic, pre-existing conditions found in this study.This study found very poor knowledge related to COVID-19 and relevant universal safety measures among individuals living in IDP camps, with significant knowledge gaps in COVID-19 symptoms, treatment, and prevention measures such as social distancing. Though there is limited literature on this topic, especially in camp-like or humanitarian contexts, our sample exhibited significantly poorer knowledge of COVID-19 and safety measures, as compared to studies conducted in China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Nepal [36, 37, 26] . And, although related literature in humanitarian settings is severely limited, this discrepancy persists among the sparse COVID-related published research in camp-like settings, such as that of a study conducted in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh [27] . These findings may also be attributed to the lack of formal education (88.7%) among study participants, as well as the reality that Somalia has some of the lowest health indicators in the world and low levels of health literacy stemming from decades of conflict, civil strife, and limited access to healthcare and education -particularly for displaced populations like IDPs [38] [39] [40] [41] .The older half of our sample, those who had implemented at least one COVID-19-related behavior change, and those who characterize their health as ""fair"" were significantly more likely to be concerned about getting infected by COVID-19. While these results demonstrate possible increased apprehension by those who are physically or mentally vulnerable to the changes imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, our data interestingly demonstrate that those who characterized their health as ""fair"" were significantly more likely to be concerned about COVID-19 contraction, while those who characterize their health as ""poor"" were less likely, albeit insignificantly. These results may be explained by a small sample size, as only 58 respondents perceived their health status as ""poor.""The importance of education as a preventative measure in controlling the transmission of COVID-19 in camp settings cannot be understated. Given significant gaps in COVID-19 knowledge among Somali IDP camp residents, instituting precautionary measures, such as public awareness, is paramount. Knowledge is a critical determinant of health behaviors, and through targeted educational interventions, IDP camp residents can play an essential role in preventing community spread of the virus among those displaced and not displaced [42] . Ninety percent of our study sample utilized news and media outlets, such as the radio, to access information about COVID-19, and 40.3% used informational calls or text messages. Using such platforms to educate camp residents may be effective in disseminating information about COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Similarly, trusted sources, such as religious officials (48.5%), health officials (36.7%), or the radio (57.4), should be mobilized to engage with community members and to dispel misinformation about COVID-19.This study's results reveal a significant lack of access to treatment and preventative services for COVID-19 among individuals living in IDP camps, which is consistent with other assessments of access to health and water, hygiene, and sanitation services in Somalia and in camp-like settings in other countries [2, [43] [44] [45] . Of particular note, only 1.5% of participants reported having access to COVID-19 screening tests, and 43.8% reported not having access to any vaccines which may inhibit adequate uptake of a future COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, these findings reflect not only the lack of access to services necessary to prevent COVID-19 transmission and to identify and treat existing cases, but also the lack of access to services that may exacerbate known comorbidities of COVID-19, such as hypertension, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, which are increasingly difficult to provide continuous care for during the COVID-19 pandemic [1, 4] . Generally, respondents reported an inability to participate in preventative measures due to a lack of material resources such as face masks and disinfectants, lack of information about COVID-19 and such measures, and inadequate living conditions to enforce social distancing protocols. Additionally, respondents reported limited confidence that they would be able to be treated if they contracted the virus. These findings reinforce the necessity for substantial investment in improving access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services, as well as healthcare services, for displaced populations living in camps.This study's sampling methodology is subject to several limitations. First, participants were recruited from twelve Somali IDP camps across six areas (Ceelasha, Lafoole, Xaawo Cabdi, Carbiska, and Afgooye) of the Lower Shabelle region, which limits the generalizability of the study findings to IDP camps in other areas of Somalia. That being said, the Lower Shabelle region harbors one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia, as well as one of the highest concentrations of individuals in need of humanitarian support [46] . Second, because an overwhelming majority of participants surveyed (86.2%) were women, the generalizability of the study results to males living in IDP camps may be limited. Third, the respondent health profiles reported ( Table 2 ) consist exclusively of self-reported data. As such, the limited reliability of participant responses for pre-existing conditions must be noted. Fourth, because our multivariate analysis did not adjust for potential confounding factors, residual confounding may have been introduced. Finally, given that this study utilizes a cross-sectional survey design, it cannot be used to analyze the evolution of COVID-19 knowledge, health conditions, and access to services in Somali IDP camps over an extended period of time.Ultimately, this study provides strong evidence for immense gaps in knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 and access to treatment and preventative services among individuals living in Somali IDP camps. In addition, this study also provides insight into the health profile of IDP camp residents, as well as their concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. A massive influx of additional resources and targeted interventions will be required to adequately address COVID-19 in Somalia, starting with educating those individuals most vulnerable to infection. Future research is needed to further elucidate the health profile of camp residents and the most at-risk individuals and to identify entry points to facilitate the implementation of COVID-19 preventative and treatment measures. International organizations operating within Somalia, as well as the Somali government, should view investments in addressing COVID-19 as long-term investments in sustainable health infrastructure, as well as the health and prosperity of its population.",Somalia,abstract,2020-08-19,08

COVID-19 suddenly appeared, leading not only the health authorities, but also the scientific community to swift actions toward it. As a result, the entire-genome series of SARS-CoV-2 was issued and subsequently it was scientifically spotlighted (Jiang et al., 2020; Stebbing et al., 2020) .The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus group, sharing ancestry with bat coronavirus HKU9-1, alike to SARS, and regardless of arrangement variety its Spike protein intensely networks with human ACE 2 -receptor (Ul Qamar, Alqahtani, Alamri, & Chen, 2020). By July 13, the global death toll exceeded 574,000, with 13,200.000 confirmed cases, and 7,600.000 thousand recovered cases in 213 countries (https://www.world omete rs.info/coron avirus).Recent studies emphasized that SARS-CoV-2 genes stake <80% nucleotide uniqueness and 89.1% nucleotide likeness with SARS-genes (Kim, Kim, & Lee, 2020; Moorthy, Restrepo, Preziosi, & Swaminathan, 2020) . Usually, β-coronaviruses yield a ~800 kDa polypeptide upon dictation of the genome. This polypeptide is proteolytically slashed to create numerous proteins, and the proteolytic diversion is facilitated by papain-like protease, and slicing the polyprotein at 16 different spots to create several nonoperational proteins that are vital for the viral reproduction (Macchiagodena, Pagliai, & Procacci, 2020) . Thus, this protease portrays a key task in the virus duplication, and distinct structural/fitment protein-encoding genes situated at the 3′ end that F I G U R E 1 2D-chemical structures of 19 selected hydrolysable tanninsGrandinin Tercatain Tellimagradin Granatin A Casuarinin Geraniin exhibit extreme inconsistency (Rut et al., 2020) . Therefore, 3CL Pro enzyme may assist as a possible target for natural inhibitors against COVID-19.Structure-based effect analyses and high output findings have recognized possible inhibitors of SARS-and MERS-3CL pro (Pillaiyar, Meenakshisundaram, & Manickam, 2020) . Bioactive substances, especially hydrolysable tannins, have attracted significant attention which could be valorized to develop medications without side-effects (Liu et al., 2016) . Hydrolysable tannins are also measured to be valuable in eliminating the opposing effects of several chemotherapeutic stuffs as well as in extending permanency and achieving positive overall health with anticancer possible and can be utilized as a substitute cancer-drug supply (Buzzini et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2011; Aires, 2020; Jia et al., 2019; Zhu, Khalifa, Peng, & Lic, 2018) . Hydrolysable tannins, including punicalagin, punicalin, and geraniin, exerted antiviral effects toward B virus by averting the creation of cccDNA and indorsing cccDNA decline, which may aid as chief components for the expansion of novel agents to remedy HBV-infection (Liu et al., 2016) . Likewise, tannin-type compounds, such as epiacutissimins A and B, castalin, vescalin, chebulagic acid, and punicalagin showed anti-herpesvirus activity via targeting viral glycoprotein-glycosaminoglycan binding to inhibit access and cell-to-cell feast (Lin et al., 2011; Aires, 2020 The current study was designed to find out a potent inhibitor against COVID-19 from 19 structural different hydrolysable tannins which could target the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 using in silico approaches (molecular docking and drug-likeness scan). The findings of our study will enable the researchers to rally the status of natural therapeutics against COVID-19.Structure-based simulated inspection tactic was performed using high-performing computing work-station with the subsequent stipulations (Intel(R) Core-(TM) i7-3210M CPU @ 2.50 GHz, 5 Core(s) CPU of 4.00 GB RAM and 64-bit Windows-10 Functioning System).Operating Environment (MOE 09).The structures of 19 hydrolysable tannins including, castalin (CID- Likewise, three-dimensional structure of 3CL pro of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6y84) was regained from Protein-Data-Bank (http://www. rcsb.org) with 2.16 Å resolution. To enhance the 3CL pro -structure, previously interacted ligands and H 2 O substances were detached from 3CL pro -structure, 3D-protonation, and energy minimalization were dedicated in MOE-09. The minimalized structure was utilized for further docking operation in the following steps. It creates 2D-images signifying the forces steadying ligands within binding pouches of receptors (Khan et al., 2017) . To investigate the medication likeliness of 19 tannins, all were further clarified based on behavior suitable molecular characters to be candidate inhibitor against COVID-19.Molecular dynamics simulations (MD) were done to refine our docking results and to analyze the assembling performance and con- Furthermore, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 is much comparable to SARS than MERS, and imparts a mutual forebear with bat-based coronaviruses (Ji, Wang, Zhao, Zai, & Li, 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . The findings also discovered that SARS-CoV-2 had a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41), reliable with SARS-3CL pro (Cys145 and His41),TGEV-3CL pro (Cys144 and His41), and HCoV-3CL pro (Cys144 and His41) (Yang et al., 2003) . It was disclosed that SARS-CoV-2-3CL pro receptor-binding concise configuration and be similar with that of SARS-3CL pro binding compact and increases the opportunity that inhibitors projected for SARS-3CL pro may also mitigate the motion of SARS-CoV-2-3CL pro .To manage with the continuous essential of new and operative small molecule as natural therapeutics against COVID-19 with negligible side-effects, studies are now directing more on computational drug finding (Desai et al., 2008) . Several reports testified the antiviral possible of tannins via computer-assisted medication strategy (Buzzini et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2011) . To speed the drug agreement process and to realize more effectual inhibitors with novel frameworks that can progress the antiviral-based therapeutics status, computational drug discovery methods are extremely steadfast. Note: Mol: An output pose, S: The final score, which is the score of the last stage that was not set to None, E-conf: The energy of the conformer, E-place: Score from the placement stage, E-score: Score from the rescoring stage.tannins, simulated selection was ended to realize new allosteric compounds as inhibitors against COVID-19. Allosteric directive has been described as an operative tactic to conquer irretrievable inhibition. Spatial alignment and dock score of present stated four topranked chiefs discloses effectual interacting of functional residues with greatest binding affinity. These tannins fit with the drug prospect norms tabulated in Table. 1 and S1 and may attest exceptional perceptive to use as a preparatory point.Interacting affinity analysis of 19 tannins through LigX revealed in Figure 3 . It was revealed that 19 tannins differentially interacted SARS-CoV-2-3CL pro . Among these hydrolysable tannins, pedunculagin, strongly interacted with the catalytic dyad residues (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2-3CL pro , with sense binding affinity, docking score, and ADMET properties. As supplemented in Table S2 , pedunculagin is an excellent compound regarding solubility, and having high intestinal absorption, and does not shows any mutation. This molecule is not inhibitor of HERG l and HERG ll that means it is not harmful to cardiac muscles (heart muscles).Previously, pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin which could be biological activities (Chang et al., 1995; Silva et al., 2016; Zuo, LI, Chen, & Xu, 2005) . In a related study, Park et al. (2017) acids are also the monomer types of hydrolyzed tannins (Serrano, Puupponen-Pimiä, Dauer, Aura, & Saura-Calixto, 2009; Smeriglio, Barreca, Bellocco, & Trombetta, 2017) . It was informed that ellagitannins release ellagic acid upon hydrolysis in rat's intestine.Gallic acid is infused via a paracellular route in Caco-2 cells, with t max of absorption around 1.27 hr in humans. Regarding ellagic acid absorption, some authors have detected ellagic acid in human plasma between 0.5 and 3 hr after oral administration of pomegranate juice. Following absorption, ellagic acid undergoes conjugation, and conjugated forms with methyl, glucuronyl, and sulfate groups have been found in plasma and excreted in urine.Gallotannins are easily degraded by bacteria, fungi, and yeast.Tannase produced by a group of microorganisms is active in galloyl residues of galloyls esters, as well as on hexahydroydi-phenoyl.Unlike proanthocyanidins, colonic bacteria are capable of metabolizing hydrolysable tannins. The presence of lactobacilli with distinct tannase activity proposes that gallic acid from gallotannins may be available during colonic fermentation. For example, casuarictin incubated with caecal content increase the release of ellagic acid. In rats fed with punicalagin, ellagic acid is transformed by rat microflora to 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo (b,d)-pyran-6-one (urolithin B)derivatives, the total urinary excretion accounting for 0.7%-52.7% of the ingested punilagin in rats. When a single dose of ellagitannin-containing foodstuff was taken by each group of human volunteers, the metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8% to 16.6% of the ingested ellagitannins. Therefore, the health effects of tannins intake are probably a consequence of the biological activity of their metabolites. Looking at the antiviral drug possible of aforenoted tannins, current study was an endeavor to feat the chemical nature of three hydrolysable tannins as natural inhibitors against COVID-19. Present molecular docking study has publicized the significant interactions of medicinal tannins with the main protease of COVID-19, which were successfully block both His41 and Cys145.To authenticate the drug capacity of selected tannins, ligand characters were considered with LigX tool of MOE. All chosen tannins disclosed constructive results and accomplish the standards of the Lipinski's regulation of five (Khan et al., 2017) . The regulation defines that possible drug-like components should have about 5 H-bond donors, maximum 10 H-bond acceptors, and an octanol water panel coefficient log P not > 5. These results suggest that natural components identified in our study, specially pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin, may demonstrate more valuable contenders for COVID-19 drug rehabilitation. To further examine the molecular docking results, pedunculagin was subjected to MD simulation; and RMSD, radius of gyration (RoG), and H-bond characters were expressed. Pedunculagin-SARS-CoV-2-3CL procomplex did not show any obvious fluctuations, referring to the stability of tannin-protein complexes with a typical RMSD value of 1.4 ± 0.01 Å ( Figure S1a ). It was also suggested normal behavior for pedunculagin-SARS-CoV-2-3CL pro complex; where it was persisted dense and steady during the 80 ns simulations ( Figure S1b) .Likewise, H-bonds which are the key stabilizing forces in proteins,proposed that the pedunculagin-SARS-CoV-2-3CL pro complex remain stable throughout the simulation, with no noticeable fluctuations ( Figure S1c ). It can be concluded from this study that each Secondary metabolite components are regularly found in medicinal plants. We therefore predicted the pharmacophore of pedunculagin based on its active groups. Hydroxy groups (−OH), ketone groups (=O), and phenolic rings in pedunculagin are projected to play parts amino acid residue binding at the energetic spot of SARS-CoV-2-3CL pro (Figure 4) . These groups were found to directly interact with the 3CL pro of SARS-CoV-2 through H-bonding and other forces.In conclusion, our study exposed that some medicinal plant rich in hydrolysable tannins, especially pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin, could be theoretically used to treat the outbreak of COVID-19.Herein, we screened the structural relationship activity of 19 hydrolysable tannins as potential antiviral components and we chose the top three hits that may inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and hence virus copying. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to transmute these probable hydrolysable tannins inhibitors into clinical drugs. We predicted that the understandings gained in the current study may evidence valued for discovering and unindustrialized novel natural inhibitors against COVID-19 in the near future.This work was self-supported by the authors.

e14ff4e8fc3785ab4ff92b3dd4e11f8e0a954da0,Convalescent Plasma as a Treatment Modality for Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Sudan,"The pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in Wuhan, China in 2019 was called COVID-19 [1] . The virus emerged as a global pandemic which was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11 of March 2020. Currently, the COVID-19 disease is threatening lives and livelihoods across the world, including Sudan [2] . On 13 March 2020 Sudan reported the first case of COVID-19, and as of the 13th of July, more than 10,000 cases have been confirmed with 657 resulting fatalities [3] .While there is no proven vaccine or therapy for COVID-19, the clinical management protocol of the disease recommended by WHO focuses on infection prevention, monitoring and detection [4] .Convalescent whole blood or plasma was recommended by WHO as an empirical treatment in several viral outbreaks and pandemics: Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2015 [5] , the hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola West Africa outbreak in 2014 [6] , as well as Human influenza-A (H1N1) in 2009 and avian influenza-A (H5N1) pandemics in 2019 [7, 8] .Recently, plasma collected from patients in the convalescent phase of infection has been used as an empirical treatment for COVID-19 in many countries [9] . For example, outcomes of an uncontrolled study carried out in China, following 5 severe COVID-19 cases showed clinical improvement after convalescent plasma transfusion [10] . Another study also conducted in China included 10 patients reported a significant progress after 3 days of convalescent plasma transfusion [11] . Furthermore, a study in South Korea showed 2 cases of COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma exhibited good progress in oxygenation and chest X-rays with decrease in the viral load and inflammatory markers [12] . Another reported beneficial effect for convalescent plasma transfusion is improvement and normalization of hypercoagulable state and lowering the incidence of thrombosis that may be present in many of COVID-19 patients [13] .Despite the promising results of these studies some limitations should be considered like the absence of large scale randomized clinical trials with control groups and the fact that in some of these studies plasma transfusion was done concurrently with the administration of antiviral drugs, which may interfere with the outcomes [9] .Additionally, the safety of using convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19 patients has not been confirmed yet, notwithstanding the fact that convalescent plasma therapy can be associated with serious adverse events including circulatory overload, risk of infectious disease transmission, allergy and fever. Even though some propitious early safety results in 5000 patients with severe COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma showed that less than 1% had serious adverse events, and the mortality rate in 7 days was 14% which is not disturbing, providing that in some of these cases plasma transfusion was done as an attempt to save ICU patients with other critical mortality causes or multi-organ failure [14] .The effect of COVID-19 in Sudan will weaken the economic and health system which is responsible to provide the latest approved medication against COVID-19. Convalescent plasma transfusion is a promising and readily available therapy with low risk and good feasibility. The capacity of the National Blood Bank Service in Sudan is quite suitable with adequate numbers of Aphaeresis machines. Moreover, during the course of this pandemic blood transfusion service in Sudan have been urged by clinicians to provide convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients.Consequently, we defined the requirements in donor selection, collection, preparation and transfusion of convalescent plasma from people who have fully recovered from COVID-19; and its administration to patients with active COVID-19. In this massive local transmission, convalescent plasma transfusion can be adapted as one of the treatment interventions and preparedness plans applicable to all health authorities and blood transfusion services in Sudan.This paper is not a clinical trial; an approval from National ethical committee is required to design precise clinical trials and evaluate the safety and efficiency of convalescent plasma therapy.The protocol also requires the patient or next of kin written informed consent to receive plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19 (see appendix A). 3. All donors must meet the WHO blood donor selection criteria in terms of age, weight, hemoglobin level (Hb) and blood pressure and subjected to pre-donation tests including ABO grouping compatibility, screening tests for HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis [15] . To date, transmission of COVID-19 through blood products has not been reported and limited data have shown detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma or serum samples with unclear possibility of COVID-19 transmission through plasma transfusion. Thus, further studies are needed to confirm this, therefore care must be taken to avoid transmission from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic donors in the donation facilities [16] . 4 . Priority in convalescent plasma collection should be given to un-transfused male donors or females who have never experienced pregnancy or abortion; this should be done to avert transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and reduce the chance of transmission of human leukocytes antibodies that might cause TRALI. TRALI can be very serious and fatal and may appear within 6 hours following plasma transfusion [17] .No changes should be allowed on the donor selection criteria except in extreme circumstances.Deviation in the donor selection criteria is allowed by WHO blood regulators network, for parameters such as; age limits, Hb level and donation intervals, provided that it will not result in harmful effect to the donor [18] . Male donors can undergo double or triple plasmapheresis J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f donation and should be watched carefully during the process with medical care staff constantly available [13] .Neutralizing antibodies produced by humoral immunity plays an important role in reducing disease severity and viral replication hence they can eliminate and treat viral infection [19] .Normally viral load peaks in the first week of infection and seroconversion in SARS-Cov-2 occurs by day 10-14 after onset [20] . Many studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity will present in most recovered patients regardless of clinical and onsets severity during the infection. A study conducted in China showed that the seropositivity in 70 COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentation reached 100% within 20 days of the onsets, 52% had antibody titer between 1:64 -1:512 and 47% had titer of 1:4000 -1:40000, antibodies titers peaked at 31-40 days and remained till 41-53 days since onsets, then started to decrease slightly [21] . Another study found that among 40 donors recovered from COVID-19, 39 were suitable convalescent plasma donors and showed SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers > 1:160, whereas only one had an antibody titer of 1:32 [11] . Additionally, Ling Li et al. found only one out of 64 convalescent plasma donors had SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer of 1:160, while the rest had titer >1: 320 [22] .Titration for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in the donor serum or plasma should be done to identify the most suitable donor with efficient neutralizing antibody titer and to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion. The optimal threshold of neutralizing antibody is still currently debated and further studies are needed to standardize the effective therapeutic titer.In this protocol we recommend SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer of at least 1:160, as per FDA recommendations and when not available a titer of 1:80 should be acceptable [23] .Since it is unknown whether the passive antibody protection will last for weeks or months preference in donation should be given to un-transfused recovered donors [24] . More studies are needed to disclose the immunity timeline and when exactly the neutralizing antibody titer will J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f start to decline. For SARS-CoV, the immunity lasted for 7 months in recovered patients before they began to decline again [25] .Plasma collection and handling should be done by experienced staff in certified facilities that use standard operating procedure in plasma collection according to international guidelines [26] . The plasma bag should be labelled as COVID-19 convalescent plasma and have the label (caution:new drug limited to investigational use) [27] .Where applicable pathogen reduction techniques like ultraviolet C (UVC) light should be applied to eliminate infectious agents and provide additional safety to the plasma product [13, 28] .Unfortunately this technique is not applicable in Sudan and many developing countries moreover; routine plasma transfusion is performed normally without viral inactivation.In plasmapheresis, the plasma is separated from the cellular component in a collection bag and retained then the cells are re-infused to the donor. The procedure can be used to collect immune plasma from donors with increased concentration of certain plasma immunoglobulins for patients who are immunosuppressed and have been exposed to varicella, herpes or other diseases [29] . To Plasma should be distributed to the hospital by the blood bank only if the patient fulfils the eligibility criteria, and has given the informed consent. Also hospitals should agree to provide the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f blood bank with the outcome data and fill the patient's data collection and monitoring forms provided in the appendices [30] . 1) Contraindication to transfusion (server volume overload, history of anaphylaxis to blood products).2) Documented uncontrolled infections, severe disseminated intravascular coagulation needing factor replacement, on dialysis, active intracranial bleeding, clinically significant myocardial ischemia, sever multi-organ failure and hemodynamic instability.3) IgA deficient patient are not eligible due to sever anaphylactic reaction that may occur during plasma transfusion. 4) Pregnant or breast feeding females.Published peer-reviewed protocols in COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion applied a first dose of 200 ml, subsequently followed by two supplementary doses of 200 mL depending on the disease coarseness and patient's tolerance to multiple plasma infusion [11, 12, 18] .We recommend between 400-500 ml of ABO compatible plasma in 2 or 3 doses of 200 -250 ml for adult patients, for 1-4 hours. Intravenous plasma transfusion should be observed during the first 15-20 minutes to check absence of transfusion reactions [11] . Premeditations other than antiviral agents may be administered prior to plasma administration according to individual acute care facility protocols [32] .Passive immunotherapy is generally more effective when given earlier and can be effective even with lower doses. In addition, plasma transfusion is more beneficial when done before clinical condition deterioration [28] . Previous literature indicated that transfusion of convalescent plasma as early as possible will have favorable outcomes. A study by Cheng et al. showed that convalescent plasma transfused after 14 days of the onset resulted in higher mortality rate (21%) and longer hospital stay when compared to a group infused with plasma before 14 days in which mortality rate was (6%) [33] . Another study showed that convalescent plasma treatment can contribute to longer survival duration and virus shedding but cannot reduce mortality in critically ill patients [34] . A randomized clinical trial also showed no significant difference in the mortality rate between sever and life-threatening COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma and the control group [35] .The national blood transfusion service in Sudan is non-profitable and depends only on voluntary blood donation. The cost of consumables for apheresis machines will be covered completely by Sudan's National medical supplies fund. Compared to the superlative price of antiviral drugs that may reach more than $3000-4000 per treatment course and given the scarceness of these drugs, convalescent plasma can represent a cheap and readily available potential treatment for COVID-19 in Sudan.The issue of patient's safety is a prime concern in this protocol. Several measures should be taken to ensure optimal compliance with the protocol. Any serious adverse events should be reported immediately to the protocol project manager. A patient's data form should be filled by a physician before and after plasma transfusion with suggested follow up days (see appendices C and D).Patient monitoring is very important before and after the convalescent plasma transfusion to determine its safety, and efficacy, as well as to monitor the clinical outcomes and maximize the knowledge gain. To achieve this, a case report form should provide the following information (see appendix D).Body temperature checking, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score which contains several blood investigations to assess the functions of vital organs (range 0-24), with higher scores indicating more severe damage. PAO2/FIO2 (ratio is the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen). These clinical parameters will help to assess if there is any adverse reaction like hypersensitivity reaction type-1 as well as the improvement of health conditions [4] .Complete blood count CBC, clinical chemistry tests evaluating kidney and liver function, inflammatory factors: C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and IL-6. In addition to chest Xray radiograph; and reports on complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bacterial infection and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [11] .With an absence of other treatment options for COVID-19, convalescent plasma is now used widely as a therapy of COVID-19. Nevertheless, large-scale, randomized and well-designed clinical trials are urgently required to study the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma especially in Sudan.We recommend health authorities to follow this protocol in mild to moderate cases to improve clinical outcomes as early as possible, decrease the need for ventilator support given the scarcity of intensive care units and the shortage of the medical supplies in our health facilities.Mozan Authors declare no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work.Authors declare no conflict of interests.",Sudan,abstract,2020-08-27,08
06059e7948f8cda0b4cd9071907cd061bcaf8739,Journal Pre-proof International society for gynecologic endoscopy (ISGE) guidelines and recommendations on gynecological endoscopy during the evolutionary phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic International Society for Gynecologic Endoscopy (ISGE) guidelines and recommendations on Gynecological Endoscopy during the evolutionary phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Corresponding Author,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised some important interrogations on minimally invasive gynaecological surgery. The International Society of Gynaecological Endoscopists (ISGE) has taken upon itself the task of providing guidance and best practice policies for all practicing gynaecological endoscopists. Priority should be given to relatively urgent cases such as malignancies. ISGE supports medical optimization and delaying surgery for benign non-life-threatening surgeries. When possible, we recommend to perform cases by laparoscopy and to allow early discharges. Any procedure with risk of bowel involvement should be performed by open surgery as studies have found a high amount of viral RNA (ribonucleic acid) in stool. Regarding urgent surgery, each unit should create a risk assessment flow chart based on capacity. Patients should be screened for symptoms and symptomatic patients must be tested. In the event that a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 is found, every attempt should be made to optimize medical management and defer surgery until the patient has recovered and only emergency or life-threatening surgery should be performed in these cases.We recommend to avoid intubation and ventilation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and if at all possible local or regional anesthesia should be utilized. Patients who screen or test negative may J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f have general anesthesia and laparoscopic surgery while strict protocols of infection control are upheld. Surgery in screen-positive as well as SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that cannot be safely postponed should be undertaken with full PPE with ensuring that only essential personnel are exposed. If available, negative pressure theatres should be used for patients who are positive or screen high risk. During open and vaginal procedures, suction can be used to minimize droplet and bioaerosol spread. In a patient who screens low risk or tests negative, although carrier and false negatives cannot be excluded, laparoscopy should be strongly considered. We recommend, during minimal access surgeries, to use strategies to reduce production of bioaerosols (such as minimal use of energy, experienced surgeon), to reduce leakage of smoke aerosols (for example, minimizing the number of ports used and size of incisions, as well as reducing the operating pressures) and to promote safe elimination of smoke during surgery and during the ports' closure (such as using gas filters and smoke evacuation systems). During the post-peak period of pandemic, debriefing and mental health screening for staff is recommended. Psychological support should be provided as needed. In conclusion, based on the existent evidence, ISGE largely supports the current international trends favoring laparoscopy over laparotomy on a case by case risk evaluation basis, recognizing the different levels of skill and access to minimally invasive procedures across various countries.The International Society of Gynaecological Endoscopists (ISGE) is privileged to enjoy patronage of members from around the globe. Countries affiliated with the ISGE are experiencing different stages of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, for example, South Africa is slowly reaching its peak while other countries such as China and Italy have passed their first peak and plateau phases and others USA, Brazil are still in the midst of the pandemic. Factors affecting decision making processes in minimal invasive surgery (MIS) vary depending on factors such as the phase of the pandemic, policies on control and prevention, expertise and existing infrastructure. Given the uncertainty of immunity and new emerging strains, caution must be practiced to ensure the safety of all health care providers, ancillary staff and patients during this unusual period. The ISGE is proud to be a global leader in this regard. We The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus Disease 19 -COVID 19) which originated in Hubei was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1, 2] and now poses a massive health and economic burden internationally [3, 4] . This pandemic is further complicated by the substantial risk of viral spread posed by asymptomatic carriers [5] .Endoscopic procedures potentially and theoretically put all involved at risk of inhalation and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f conjunctival exposure from bioaerosol (endoscopically generated and otherwise), direct contact and contact with fecal matter [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . As gynecological endoscopists, it is imperative to review current practices by evaluating and mitigating risks, to ourselves, colleagues, staff and above all, to patients.The theoretical risk of infection from endoscopically generated bioaerosols may potentially be increased due to three main factors peculiar to laparoscopy [11, 12] :1. The use of gas insufflation, both during entry and intra-operatively.Creation of bioaerosols from electrosurgery, a cornerstone of endoscopy. with four documented cases of HPV and none of HBV or HIV. Despite the reassuring nature of these findings, caution should be maintained, especially when extrapolating to potentially more virulent pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] .The main route of transmission is via droplet spread and via contact transmission from contaminated surfaces to mucosal surfaces [14, 15, 16] . The virus may also become aerosolized during certain airway interventions and cardiopulmonary resuscitation [17] . Additionally, Wang This is supported by a study in children where they tested negative for nasopharyngeal swabs but positive for rectal swabs and further highlights the false negative rates of nasopharyngeal swabs [19] .The above information is mostly anecdotal evidence and highlights a severe paucity of academic ammunition available for decision making and we must attempt to apply it with care and caution to clinical practice]. It must also be noted that the risk of open surgery with regards to the spread of COVID-19 disease is also not known, and open surgery also produces electrocautery fumes that can potentially spread the virus.It is important to take advantage of governmental strategies in the early phase of an outbreak which would be to create capacity by anticipating the exponential nature of infection. For example, the Australian and New Zealand Hepatic, Pancreatic and Biliary association categorized three phases [20] : It would be prudent in the early phase to fast track ""time sensitive diseases"" during this time, such as certain oncological cases, as failure to do this might worsen patients' outcomes. Once the exponential phase overruns capacity, surgeons will find themselves with inadequate operating J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f time and safe recovery facilities for their urgent cases and left with uncertainty as to when these cases can be performed. Priority should be given to urgent cases such as early stage endometrial and cervical cancer. Perform urgent cases by laparoscopy and discharge early while the pandemic and the cancer are in their early phases. It would be prudent to prospectively stratify and prioritize the urgency of each cancelled case. Universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be carried out wherever possible 40 hours prior to surgery for all patients booked for semi-urgent surgery such as endometrial cancer cases to be performed laparoscopically. This will allow identification of most asymptomatic carriers and will allow appropriate management of those who test positive, including postponement of surgery where possible.In the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, all elective surgical procedures should be postponed where it is possible to safely to so without harm to patients [21, 22, 23] . It is prudent to ensure that postponement is balanced against the patient's outcome and quality of life. Decisions regarding the management of malignancies should be undertaken in conjunction with an oncologist. ISGE supports medical optimization and delaying surgery for prolapse and incontinence. Where a delay in surgery will influence the reproductive prognosis of a patient, the case should be managed with a reproductive medicine specialist with the aim of optimizing medical management and consideration given to fertility preservation options. Surgery for endometriosis should be deferred as it is not life threatening and when J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f bowel involvement is present, the risk of viral exposure is increased during excision [22] . Any procedure where there is a risk of bowel involvement including conditions (such as pelvi-abdominal sepsis, or tubo-ovarian abscesses) should be performed by open surgery as studies have found a high amount of viral RNA in stool [18] .In countries where the peaks have been reached, there is ongoing uncertainty as to when elective surgeries can begin. This period should start with addressing the needs of the health care workers and an inventory of available capacity / resources. These need to be balanced against the backlog of the elective cases. Debriefing and mental health screening for staff is recommended. Psychological support should be provided as needed. Human inventory must be balanced with hospital capacity. Although universal testing is probably ideal for all patients, this may not be practical in all settings. Screening and testing should be employed as per local protocol.Testing includes screening for symptoms, nasopharyngeal swabs with nucleic acid amplification such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which has a high specificity but a low sensitivity, rapid antigen/antibody but considering the 5-10-days delay for the production of antibodies [24] .The role of chest imaging is controversial. Zhu et al demonstrated radiological evidence of pneumonic changes in 67% of SARS-CoV-2 patients who tested negative [25] . In contrast PCR confirmed patients had normal computed tomography (CT) scan findings in 56% of positively tested patients [26] .The role of imaging probably lies in the ""grey zone"" where there is discrepancy between clinical suspicion and test results. With a high index of clinical suspicion, imaging is probably beneficial. Each unit/center should create a risk assessment flow chart based on capacity. Ideally all preoperative patients should be tested if resources allow. Where universal testing is not available, patients should be screened for symptoms based on the local guidelines for example the National Institute of Communicable Diseases [27] . Symptomatic patients must be tested.  With a high clinical suspicion pulmonary assessment with chest X-ray or CT scan preoperatively may be of benefit.In addition to laparoscopically generated bioaerosols, SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory virus and the team involved in general anesthesia performing endotracheal intubation and extubation, are at the highest risk of viral transmission [17, 29, 30] .  In the event that a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 is found, every attempt should be made to optimize medical management and defer surgery until the patient has recovered, and only emergency or life-threatening surgery should be performed in these cases. Every attempt should be made to avoid intubation and if at all possible local or regional anesthesia should be utilized.  Trendelenburg optimization may facilitate ventilatory needs and this should be balanced between surgical and anesthetic requirements.A study by Li et al. concluded that the risk of aerosol spread may be lower during laparotomies [11] , however this theoretical risk must be balanced with the advantages associated with laparoscopies, including: earlier discharge, reduced nosocomial infections, reduced rates of complications (and therefore re-admissions into hospital, thus increasing the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection) [31] . These advantages are robustly supported in the literature [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38] and provide much needed capacity in terms of bed space and critical staff for health care institutions during this time.Brücher et al. did assess the risk of open and laparoscopic surgery to be the same provided the gas/smoke was evacuated safely and water lock filters were used or if gasless laparoscopy was performed [24] . and it stands to reason that the SARS-CoV-2 virus which has a wider diameter of 70-90 nm would not pass through the filter [39] . This highlights the role of filters which may be used during laparoscopy after which these filters should be discarded according to local protocols.It must be clearly stated that there is no robust evidence of increased risk of viral transmission during laparoscopy. The current evidence is purely extrapolated from work with other, above mentioned, pathogens. While recognizing these facts, all precautions must still be taken during this time until more evidence becomes available.Aerosols are also produced during open and vaginal surgery [6, 11, 13] . Unlike during laparoscopy there is no way to contain the aerosols by using filters and closed system smoke evacuators. This risk is increased with the use of any electrosurgery including monopolar, bipolar and advanced energy devices such as advanced bipolar, laser and ultrasonic devices [13, 40] .  In a patient who screens low or tests negative, although carrier and false negatives cannot be excluded, laparoscopy should be strongly considered.Currently we need to balance a hypothetical risk of aerosol spread in low risk patients to the vast array of evidence proving the benefits of laparoscopic surgery.The importance of infection, prevention and control (IPC) and adequate PPE cannot be over emphasized. Whilst prioritizing patients' needs first, it is imperative that the safety of healthcare workers is not compromised. Ensure that only essential personnel are exposed. For example, there is no need for the entire theatre staff to be present during intubation.  Although disposable instruments, tubing and filters are ideal, this should be tailored to resources within the unit.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThere is no substitute for practicing sound surgical principles to ensure seamless surgery and good patient outcome. Care should be employed when choosing advanced energy sources. The theoretical risk of increased smoke and particle dispersion is associated with the high frequency oscillating mechanism of ultrasonic devices [13, 40] . Consider potential particle dispersion when choosing energy devices. Employ sound principles of energy to optimize tissue effect. Employ basic surgical principles: minimize bleeding, careful handling of tissue, minimal use of energy at the lowest but effective settings and use of atraumatic instruments. The most experienced, proficient and knowledgeable surgeon available should perform the procedure. This will ensure the implementation of SARS-CoV-2 protocols, shortest operating time and minimal exposure of the theatre staff to potential aerosols.Communication and meticulous planning will result in fewer human errors. Staff should be well briefed on the surgical plan. If needed SOP and protocols can be simulated for intraoperative strategies such as avoiding leakage by not opening ports to release smoke, use of filters, smoke evacuators, disposable tubing, use of wall suction and removal of specimens to name a few. Provide in service training for theatre staff and detail the surgical plan preoperatively. Consideration should be given to the number of ports used and size of incisions. Minimize the operating pressures where possible to minimize gas leaks. Prudent preoperative planning helps reduce gas leaks which occur during instrument changes.Where gas leaks are anticipated, such as with specimen retrieval and removal of the uterus at total laparoscopic hysterectomy, certain strategies may be employed: Use of retrieval devices may minimize gas leaks. Ensure all colpocleiators (vaginal cuff delineators with air seal) are checked preoperatively for gas leaks. Once the vault has been circumcised, all the gas should be removed by suction and/or closed system evacuators, before removing the specimen vaginally.  If one is not able to maintain colpocleisis during colpotomy, then consider an alternative strategy such as vaginal colpotomy after removing all the gas, as performed at laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). It is advisable to use closed smoke evacuation systems intra-operatively when available. Filters should be used and tailored to what is available to the center. Wall suction connected to a central system is preferable to mobile suctioning devices. Suction should be generously utilized to remove the plumes of smoke generated during surgery. Suction should be used at the end of the procedure to remove all the gas from the abdominal cavity prior to removing the ports.  Use closed system smoke evacuators to safely remove surgical gas at the end of the procedure.The trough of the pandemic should not herald old practices. This must be done for two reasons: uncertainty of repeated waves of infection [41, 42, 43] and even in a post SARS-CoV-2 world, this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f practice will continue to keep staff from unknown toxins and bioaerosols. Even after the peak of the disease the practice of safe elimination of smoke should continue. Where possible central suction should be used in all casesThe recent article by Mallick et al. discusses the conflict between the traditional practice of port removal under vision before desufflation and the newly adopted practice of desufflating prior to removing the ports to prevent bioaerosol infection [13] . This deviation in practice marginally increases the risk of port site herniation and unrecognized port site bleeding but supports the reasoning and applied practice. Port site herniation is more likely to occur if all the gas has not been removed and the ports are not removed under direct vision. This occurs because the positive pressure in the abdomen can push structures such as omentum and small bowel through the port while the gas is trying to escape. ISGE supports the interim practice of desufflation prior to the removal of ports for purposes of reducing bioaerosol spread. Remove all ports only after all the gas has been removed to reduce port site herniation. At the end of the procedure, the sheath at port-sites ≥ 10 mm must be closed using a J needle. Avoid using commercial endoscopic port closure devices as they may allow for gas leaks.  Consider the routine use of gas filters. Remove ports only after all the gas is removed. If ports are removed before gas is removed, this must be done under vision. The use of a protective fitting face mask is recommended.As with laparoscopy the evidence on hysteroscopic bioaerosol production is sparse.Electrosurgery during hysteroscopy seems to produce less smoke than laparoscopy, although there are no comparative studies to support this. In this regard mechanical hysteroscopic morcellators pose an advantage [21, 35] . In the absence of evidence, it is not possible to adequately quantify the risk of bioaerosol production at hysteroscopy but the risk appears low. All elective cases should be postponed. It is plausible that hysteroscopic tissue removal systems reduce bioaerosol exposure. Suction device should be connected to an outflow sheath.  ISGE recommends no anesthesia or if indicated conscious sedation, local or regional anesthesia for hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopic morcellators may pose an advantage over hysteroscopic electrosurgical devices. Hysteroscopy is preferentially performed on a day case/outpatient basis to relieve the pressure on main theatre resources.The literature supports laparoscopy in allowing for same-day or early discharge [30, 44] . This reduces patient exposure and enhances capacity at hospitals during this resource constrained era.Although screened, patients may not have been symptomatic at the time of surgery but may have been infected. It would be prudent to identify false negatives, their contacts (at home and at the hospital) need to be identified and appropriately managed. Attempt same-day or early discharge where possible to avoid nosocomial infections. Employing early recovery after surgery (ERAS) principles will help facilitate quicker discharge. It may be prudent to telephonically contact the post-operative patient to screen for symptoms after the surgery. A log should be kept of all staff involved in the care of any specific patient in order to aid contact tracing should a patient test positive at a later stage. Gynaecological Endoscopy (SASGE) and the British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy (BSGE) [21, 22, 2345, 46] recommend the use of laparoscopic procedures over open procedures when appropriately evaluated. ISGE acknowledges the dynamic times we are in and based on current evidence, ISGE largely supports the current international stance favoring laparoscopy over laparotomy on a case by case risk evaluation basis. ISGE also recognizes the different levels of skill and access to minimally invasive procedures across various countries, and supports individual clinical decision making during this time with regards to surgical access.

A total of 8136 pooled clinical specimens were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2, the majority were nasopharyngeal swabs (69.6%). A lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had a positive rate (PR) of 71.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.3%-82.3%) while no virus was detected in the urinogenital specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) specimen had the PR of 91.8% (95% CI: 79.9%-103.7%), followed by rectal swabs; 87.8% (95% CI: 78.6%-96.9%) then sputum; 68.1% (95% CI: 56.9%-79.4%). A low PR was observed in oropharyngeal swabs; 7.6% (95% CI: 5.7%-9.6%) and blood samples; 1.0% (95% CI: −0.1%-2.1%) whereas no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine samples. Feces had a PR of 32.8% (95% CI:1 5.8%-49.8%). Nasopharyngeal swab, a widely used specimen had a PR of 45.5% (95% CI: 31.2%-59.7%). In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was highly detected in LRT specimens while no virus was detected in urinogenital specimens. BLF had the highest PR followed by rectal swab then sputum. Nasopharyngeal swab which is widely used had moderate PR. Low PR was recorded in oropharyngeal swab and blood samples while no virus was found in urine samples. Last, the virus was detected in feces, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transmission by the fecal route. However, there are reports of SARS-CoV-2 detections from other sites including feces, 6, 7 and, therefore, extending the spectrum of specimens other than those from respiratory tract to be considered for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. From the beginning, health authorities, that is, World Health Organization (WHO) 8 and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocated massive and rapid testing of COVID-19. Testing as one of commendable approaches in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic needs to be done using both most appropriate specimen 6 and an accurate diagnostic test like PCR. 9 If testing is properly done especially during this time when the reopening is on its way in most of the countries, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be minimized.Currently, the detection profile of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from different clinical specimens using qRT-PCR after onset of symptoms is not yet well established. A recent study by Wang et al 6 using 1070 clinical specimens such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (FBB), sputum, nasal and pharyngeal swabs, urine, feces, and blood collected from 205 patients revealed a dynamic profile with a high detection rate of virus from lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens, that is, BLF and zero detection from urogenital tract specimen, that is, urine.Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to establish the profile of detecting SARS-CoV-2 from different types clinical specimens using a standard diagnostic test (qRT-PCR).A systematic review protocol was developed based on the question ""What is the positivity rate for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using qRT-PCR in different types of clinical specimens?"". The review was developed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. 10 The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO database: https://www.crd.york.ac. uk/PROSPERO with a registration number CRD42020189107). inclusion. The strategy was primarily developed for PubMed using keywords (Supporting Information Additional File S1). The search terms were combined using Boolean logic ""OR"" for synonymous terms and ""AND"" across elements of PCO (population, comparability, and outcome). Filters were set to exclude nonhuman studies, limit the publication period exclude review, and case report articles, among others. Keywords such as ""laboratory diagnosis,"" ""polymerase chain reaction,"" ""clinical For inclusion in the final analysis, at least two simultaneously tested samples were required to be reported per study.Study selection was managed using EndNote software version X7 (Thomson Reuters, 2015) where two independent reviewers (GMB and BJN) evaluated articles for potential inclusion by screening titles and abstracts followed by full-text screening to determine eligibility for final inclusion. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, and/or consulting a third reviewer where necessary. Data extracted from study documents, included author's information,year of publication, study design, and positivity rate (positive tests/total specimens) (Table 1 ). Unavailable, unclear information and additional details were requested from the corresponding author. In some of the studies, 7,13,14 patient was regarded as positive, if one of the specimens tested positive. Additionally, at least two specimens reported per test qualified for analysis where a positive patient was considered when one of the specimens tested positive, and recovered patient was considered when at least two qRT-PCR consecutive tests tested negative in all tested specimen.The number of laboratory tests was counted based on the specimen tested not the number of patients.DerSimonian-Laird (DL) random-effects analysis was performed to establish a summary estimate (positivity rate/proportion) by a randomeffects model using Open Meta Analyst software 17 Output generated by Open Meta Analyst software through a cumulative forest plot was indirectly employed to assess the publication bias. 18 As such, the estimate of the proportions decreased with the increase in sample size. This decrease could be due to publication bias or it could be due to small-study effects. However, when the analysis was limited to study with at least 100 sample size, the overall positive detection rate would have been 34.6% (95% CI:17.9%-51.3%) while that with all studies included regardless of the sample size was 42.7% (95% CI: 32.2%-53.3%) (Supporting Information Additional File S2). On the other hand, the quality of the included studies (risk of bias) was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies (Supporting Information Additional File S3) as previously described elsewhere. 19 The risk of bias was evaluated by two independent reviewers (GMB and BJN). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, and/or consulting a third reviewer (MVM) where necessary.Of 780 pooled studies, seven studies qualified for final analysis (Table 1) . Among the seven articles, information reported on positive detection rate was extracted from four studies 5,6,15,16 for suspected cases, while in three studies 7,13,14 information was recorded if at least one specimen tested positive (confirmed cases) from the simultaneously tested specimens and the recording of positive tests were stopped when at least two consecutive qTR-PCR tested negative in all specimens. 7,13 Different types of clinical specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2, BLF, 5,6 FBB, 6 sputum. [5] [6] [7] 14, 15, 16 Some of the studies reported pharyngeal specimen without specifying whether the route was nasal of oral. 6, 7 One study reported nasal and pharyngeal swabs combined, but for the purpose of this review, it was categorized as nasopharyngeal swabs. 5 Nasal swabs were reported in one study, 6 feces, 6,7 blood, 6 urine, 6,14,15 nasopharyngeal, 5,13-16 sputum, 5,7,14 rectal swab, 13 oropharyngeal, 16 Regarding the type of clinical specimens, BLF had a positivity rate of 91.8% followed by rectal swab (87.8%) then sputum specimens (68.1%). Nasopharyngeal swab which is commonly and widely used 1 had a positive detection rate of 45.5%. A low detection rate was observed in oropharyngeal swab (7.6%) with zero detection from urine samples.There was low (1.0%) detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood sample, but ",Tanzania,first author,2020-08-02,08
36dd32a625fc472d3c76193f8b4f6ae7374c811e,,"e first case infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China, in late November 2019. In December 2019, several patients have been presented to the hospital for acute pneumonia of unknown origin [1] . Later, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the lower respiratory tract of hospitalized patients, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the disease as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) on January 12, 2020. e virus has spread rapidly, and the condition is still extending up to now. On March 11, the WHO declares the COVID-19 outbreak as pandemic [2] . We are still counting to this day 11,577,979 confirmed cases with 537,103 deaths worldwide. Initially, no skin manifestations were observed among patients with COVID-19 [2, 3] . e first case was described in ailand with petechiae rash mimicking a dengue fever [4] , and then a few other cases followed [2] [3] [4] [5] . ese skin lesions can guide clinicians for diagnosis if the patients present other COVID-19 symptoms; however, viral infection cannot be the only cause; mediated inflammatory responses and drug reactions can also be suspected. e aim of our literature review is to report the various cutaneous manifestations described to date associated with COVID-19, the skin problems related to personal protective equipment, and the different cutaneous anti-COVID-19 drug reactions [6, 7] . We also discuss the different interventions proposed to manage these patients [8, 9] and solutions to protect skin and mucous membrane barriers for healthcare workers [10] [11] [12] .Since the epidemic began in Europe, some countries have presented virus-spreading indicators higher than others. In Italy, the first cases were detected in the last ten days of February. Its case fatality rate at present is 14.4%. In France, the mortality rate has continued to increase, reaching 17.9% (July 6, 2020). In the United States, the first cases appeared around March 10. e country represents more than 25% of the cumulative cases worldwide. As for Morocco, the first case emerged on March 2; official indicators seem to display volatile trends. It is tough to demonstrate a correlation between them. e growth factor can vary from a value of 2 to a value of 0.5 within 24 hours. e contamination rate displayed every day (new cases in 24 hours compared to the number of tests carried out in 24 hours) is also very volatile ranging from 9% on March 28 to 30% on April 8 and 2.2% on July 5. As for the mortality rate, it decreased from 6.2% to 1.6% lately (July 6, 2020) [13] . e pathophysiology of COVID-19 has not been well elucidated, but it seems similar to that of SARS-CoV [14] . SARS-CoV has the appearance of a crown under electron microscope. It is composed of genomic RNA and four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). It can attach to the host cell by binding its S protein to the receptor protein membrane [15] [16] [17] [18] . A number of studies showed that angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor on the host cell membrane, with a high affinity to SARS-CoV-2 protein (S) [19, 20] . Yet, the significance of this binding affinity is still under intensive research study [17] . ACE2 is shown to be expressed by epithelial cells of the intestine, kidney, blood vessels, and most abundantly in type II alveolar cells of the lungs [19, 20] . Importantly, Hamming et al. [20] demonstrated that ACE2 is also present in the basal cell layer of the epidermis extending to the basal cell layer of hair follicles, which might explain the cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19. Decreased ACE2 function can cause dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and intensify inflammation, vascular permeability, and neutrophil accumulation [14, 21] . Rapid viral replication can also cause cellular apoptosis and triggers a cascade of inflammatory reaction, as well as an increase in cytokine and chemokine blood levels [21] . erefore, the inflammatory response of the body also plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury cases, since the high production of these cytokines is responsible for the accumulation of cells and fluids (cytokine storm) [18] . ese cytokines arriving at the skin and reaching the various cells of the cutaneous immune system can cause the dermatological lesions described during COVID-19 infection (urticarial lesion, erythema, and vesicles) [22] .Wenzhong et al.'s latest hypothesis suggests that lung damage and inflammation are secondary to extreme lung cell poisoning [23] . In fact, ORF8, a SARS-CoV-transcribed nonstructural protein, could bind to porphyrin as well as other proteins and can attack the heme on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin. Consequently, this will decrease hemoglobin and gas exchanges, which eventually results in ground-glasslike lung images.Several cases of patients with COVID-19 showed leucopenia, lymphocytopenia, increased D-dimer level, and prolonged prothrombin [1, 17] . Besides, abnormal findings of different organs function assessment may indicate multiorgan failure [17] . It has been suggested that COVID-19 is a zoonotic infection as the first infected people were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan city [1, 17] . However, the intermediate host is still unknown. e virus is transmitted by inhalation of aerosol droplets from the infected patients [1, 17] . e fecal-oral transmission was also hypothesized [21] . erefore, it is essential to strictly adhere to environmental and hand hygiene to control the infection [24] . So far, the golden clinical diagnosis methods to confirm cases of COVID-19 include the detection of nucleic acids in the nasal and throat swab sampling by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [25] . e identification of SARS-CoV-2specific IgM and IgG antibodies can also be useful for diagnosis [17] .19 Patients e most common symptoms in COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and dry cough, succeeded by other symptoms, such as headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, myalgia, and arthralgia [1, 26] . Initially, no skin involvement during COVID infection was observed, but more recently, some cases (Table 1 ) have been reported [2, 4, 5, 11] , as well as the skin problems related to personal protective equipment. Secondary skin reactions to the different treatments suggested are also possible.e frequency of the skin lesions associated with COVID-19 infection varies according to the series; in a Chinese study of 1099 positive cases, the incidence was only 0.2%, while in an Italian series of 88 patients it was 20.4% [42] .Joob and Wiwanitkit described in ailand, where the first case of COVID-19 outside of China was reported, a skin rash with petechiae in a case of COVID-19 [4] . Because of the frequent dengue cases in this country, it was the first diagnosis to be mentioned. After the appearance of other respiratory problems, COVID-19 has been diagnosed by RT-PCR. In Italy, in a series of 148 cases, Recalcati reported, after the exclusion of 60 patients who have started new drugs in 15 previous days, that 20.5% of the 88 patients developed skin manifestations [2] . Eight of the 18 (44%) had skin eruptions with symptoms in the beginning and the rest after hospitalization. Erythematous rashes were the most common sign (78%) and then urticarial (3 cases) and chickenpox-like vesicles (1 case). However, no documentation has been assembled in these cases (photos or biopsy) to prevent the spread of infection. At the end of March, the French Society of Dermatology launched a call for a case, after discovering erythematous maculopapular lesions on the faces of three patients with a very probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection [5] . Finally, 113 cases have been reported, of which 74% of them had frostbite-like lesions.An American team with a series of 505 patients with dermatological lesions tried to study the characteristics of pernio lesion or chilblain lesions in acral skin. Despite the absence of a confirmation test of COVID-19 infection in all these patients, the results showed that 318 of them had pernio-like lesions and most of them were young. e localization of these lesions was in the feet in 84% of the cases, in the hands in 5.1% of the cases, and in both in 10% of the cases [27] .In another Spanish study [30] , including 20 children and adolescents with acral lesions, four clinical patterns were described: acral erythema (30%) (Figure 1 ), dactylitis (20%), purpuric maculopapules (35%), and mixed pattern (15%).RT-PCR could not confirm the presence of the virus. e authors believe that it is secondary to a realization of a diagnostic test at an early stage of the disease.Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia are also common complications for COVID-19 infection [17, 26, 43] . In Wuhan [26] , patients with COVID-19 might present acroischemic lesions; there were 7 patients, in a critical situation, hospitalized in the intensive care unit with different clinical presentations, including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla, and dry gangrene. Four patients among them were diagnosed with definite disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A team from Italy [28] tried to collect cases from a website, and 63 cases were collected, but only 54 pictures were analyzed: 31 of 54 patients had erythematous-edematous lesions and 23 of 54 had blistering lesions.A report by Fernandez-Nieto et al. [36] describing the characterization of acute acro-ischemic lesions in 132 patients showed two different clinical presentations: chilblain- Fernandez-Nieto et al. [31] described a patient in Madrid with an urticarial rash that appeared six days after the first symptoms. ey also mentioned the presence of other cases with different skin manifestations, and for that, a prospective study is in progress. In France, Henry et al. [32] reported a similar case; however, the urticarial rash in this patient was inaugural. e only associated symptoms were odynophagia and arthralgia. is eruption was in the form of disseminated erythematous plaques with facial and acral localization. Estébanez et al. [33] published another type of cutaneous manifestation: lesions in the form of yellowish erythematous papules located in the heels. A very recent publication in Italy [34] suggested that papulovesicular eruption (varicella-like) was rare but specific to COVID-19. Twenty-two patients have been reported with the same clinical presentation; itching was present in 40.9% of patients. And the eruption was generally localized at the trunk. Another article by the same authors [35] detailed the case of a little girl who has papulovesicular skin eruption on the trunk, face, and genital tract ( Figure 2 ); after 6 days, the patient had a moderate fever and was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Sanchez et al. [37] described a new clinical presentation of skin lesions associated with COVID-19. ey reported a skin eruption similar to that of pityriasis rosea: erythematous and squamous plaque, in the trunk, upper arms, and periumbilical.A Spanish publication has classified the skin lesions observed during COVID-19 into 5 types: maculopapular eruptions in 47% of cases, urticarial lesions in 19% of cases, acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules in 19%, other vesicular eruptions in 9%, and livedo or necrosis in 6% [29] .In the pediatric population, the frequency of coronavirus infection is estimated to be less frequent than adults (<1%) [22, 44] . A particular presentation has been reported in children in Europe and North Africa, with a lesion similar to Kawasaki syndrome [38, 44, 45] .Hence, the WHO established a preliminary definition and case for multisystem inflammatory disorder in children and adolescents [44] to help define and recognize these cases for better management and possible surveillance.Clinical presentation includes fever, rash, mucosal inflammation associated with gastrointestinal problems, myocardial dysfunction, and sometimes even hypotension or shock [44] .According to a French series, concerning 16 children with this syndrome, the skin rash was present in 81% of patients, edema with plantar and palmar redness was present in 67% of patients, and 87% of them had dry lips [38] .As part of this syndrome, the skin eruption can be very varied; for example, an erythema multiforme rash has been described in a 13-year-old patient [39] .Other lesions have also been reported, such as androgenic alopecia (AAG) [40] , sebopsoriasis, herpes, and exanthem [41] . Also, nonspecific erythematous lesions in the trunk and face have been described [2] .To control this infection, all personnel must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) for an extended period in addition to other safety and health measures. Eczema is the most common problem among healthcare workers [10] , often secondary to frequent hand hygiene and long-time gloves wearing [46] . Besides, humidity, prolonged contact with masks, and goggles may cause a variety of cutaneous diseases such as contact and pressure urticaria or contact dermatitis and pigmentation of the nasal bridge [3, 11] . In a survey study [12] , Lan et al. found that 526 participants among healthcare professionals mentioned that they had damaged skin. e nasal bridge was the most affected area and then hands, cheek, and forehead. Dryness and desquamation were the most common symptoms, and these damages depended on the hours of work, especially for gloves wearing.Another questionnaire distributed among 66 patients objected that wearing of masks has caused in 95.1% of cases side effects including first, nasal bridge scar. Wearing of gloves has caused in 88.5% of cases skin reactions [47] . We are currently carrying out a study to clarify the consequences of wearing personal protective equipment on the skin. To date, 268 health personnel have completed the questionnaire. Because of frequent handwashing to prevent the disease, dry skin was present in 68.3%, with erythema in 31.3% of cases (Figure 3) . Exacerbations of preexisting dermatoses such as acne, rosacea, atopic dermatitis, and neurodermatitis have been observed [3, 7] . is can be explained by the prolonged wearing of masks during the epidemic. e occlusion generated by protective hats may provoke pruritus and folliculitis or exacerbate seborrheic dermatitis [11] , and the frequent use of disinfectant and soap can impair the hydrolipid mantle of the skin and increase the risk of contact dermatitis [7] . e current stress generated by the global situation and confinement can also exacerbate dermatoses [12] .Treatments. Preventive measures are currently the best strategy to fight COVID-19. While vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are under development, several other therapies are proposed [48, 49] , hence the interest to review the skin side effects of these molecules. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a widely used antimalarial and autoimmune disease drug, has been demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and blocks viral activity by increasing endosomal pH [48] [49] [50] . However, the use of this drug remains controversial; some studies have tried to prove the effectiveness of this treatment [48, [50] [51] [52] . Nevertheless, each had methodological deficiencies [53] . Other studies are underway with a large sample. Chloroquine is widely used in dermatology disorders and autoimmune disease; its toxicity is infrequent [54] , and reactions can be mainly gastrointestinal and cutaneous (pruritus or urticaria), usually mild [54, 55] . Few cases of HCQ toxidermia have been reported. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) was the most common presentation [56, 57] ; it appears like a sterile nonfollicular pustule with an erythematous base [58] . Also, drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been described in four reports [58] . Besides, rare cases of HCQ and Sweet syndrome have also been reported [6, 59] .e Moroccan Health Ministry and National Technical Committee for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 decided on March 23, 2020, to adopt the therapeutic protocol based on using hydroxychloroquine under medical supervision, and no problem has been noticed yet. Other prescription drugs such as OTC, antibiotics, healthcare products, and a variety of plants can also cause a skin reaction. Zheng and Lai [7] reported cases of urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, and other pruritus lesions in coronavirus pneumonia patients after accepting anti-COVID-19 medicines.Healthcare institutions and policymakers developed various plans to control the pandemic, including preparing hospitals and clinics, developing a strategy for the identification of suspected COVID-19 cases, and implementing a strategy to reduce the spread [24] . Prevention of nosocomial infection should be another priority; this will require specialized protocols and training of the medical staff. In most countries, several dermatological services have been transformed into a structure for the treatment and isolation of patients with COVID-19 infection, and many private dermatology practices have closed doors [3] . Different solutions have been proposed. [64] revealed that over 75% of the patients were interested in using telehealthcare (medical consultations and electronically transmitted prescriptions). During a patient visit, the dermatologist and the patient should both wear a surgical mask with hand hygiene. e dermoscopy should be performed with caution and only if necessary to prevent dermatoscope from becoming a possible source of nosocomial spread [65] . In addition, this exam should be avoided for specific sites such as hands, nails, face, eyes, and mucosa, and for all patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 [65] . Several skin diseases, such as psoriasis, as well as depression and anxiety, can increase the risk of 2019-nCoV infection [61, 66] . Phototherapy and the other hospital treatments are needed to be adjusted to avoid displacement [7] . Up until today, there is not enough evidence or guidelines for managing the patients with severe inflammatory skin disorders treated with immunomodulators during this pandemic, and there is no proof that these persons may have a more increased risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 [8, 9, 61] . e first treatment option in this particular period must be the one who has lower effects on personal immune functions such as IL-17 inhibitor [7] . Other treatment options include decreasing the dosage of traditional immunosuppressants (methotrexate and cyclosporine) [8] . On the other hand, there has not been any recommendation or indication justified to stop or reduce the systemic corticosteroid dose [8] .In the case of skin cancer, surgical treatment, if indicated, should not be delayed, especially in critical localization [67] .e wearing of the PPE for an extended period and the cutaneous complications that generate with stress and anxiety can reduce the efficiency of the health workforce [10] . As such, it has been recommended to use latex-free gloves or use of cotton gloves inside it to avoid cutaneous hand problems. Moreover, the use of cleansing products containing moisturizing ingredients and the application of hand cream frequently are highly recommended [3, 11, 68] . e alcohol hand sanitizers may be used more frequently as they have been shown to be less irritating than washing hands with soap [69] . To avoid friction and pressure from wearing the mask, it has been suggested to wear a properly fitted mask, in different ways, and apply moisturizers or gel just before [10, 11] , or combine a paper towel with facial mask [67] .e medical training of future doctors and the scientific communication between dermatologists have also been affected. In Morocco, the Ministry of National Education has deployed an online platform for continued remote instruction for students. e Department of Dermatology and Allergology of the Ludwig Maximilian University Hospital [70] has presented numerous online case studies and offered opportunities for continuous education. Other similar projects with different features and focus already exist on the Internet [71] .To date, several skin manifestations related to COVID-19 have been reported, but additional efforts are needed to collect further data. It is essential not to forget the patients who suffer from other skin diseases and to insist on preventive measures for healthcare professionals.No data were used to support this study.e authors declare no conflicts of interest.",Morocco,first author,2020-08-11,08
2c9a7a78c474ccab3604e54d19718664fd2d37a3,Impact assessment of containment measure against COVID-19 spread in Morocco,"• The model is able to predict the peak-size, peak-time, final size and epidemic duration.• We estimated the basic and control reproduction numbers.• The model shows that the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined.• We performed sensitivity analysis which shows that COVID-19 depends strongly on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates.Morocco on March, 21 on the spread of COVID-19 epidemic across the country. The model takes account of the unconfined individuals that continue to work or to leave their home for urgent needs and the existence of infectious asymptomatic and unreported individuals within susceptible population. Furthermore, the model is able to predict the peak-size, peaktime, final size and epidemic duration according to different rates of containment. Advanced knowledge of these details will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control or eradicate the epidemic. Indeed, mitigating and delaying the epidemic peak allow the official health authorities to anticipate and control the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, prediction of the epidemic duration can help the government to predict the end time of containment to avoid consequent social-economic damages as well. Using our model, the basic reproduction number R 0 is estimated to be 2.9949, with CI (2.6729 − 3.1485) , reflecting a high speed of spread of the epidemic. The model shows that the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. In the absence of other efficient measure of control, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July, 4, 2020 with 7558 final cumulative cases. Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, has been determined. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is performed and showed that the COVID-19 dynamics strongly depends on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our previsionsCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel betacoronavirus that primarily targets the human respiratory system [12] . Severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Indeed, some people generally have mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment [32] . Others, like older adults and people with existing chronic medical conditions, are more likely to develop serious illness and have a high risk of death [32] . Human-to-human transmission of disease occurs via direct contact with the droplets saliva, discharge from the nose of an infectious person's coughs, sneezes or through contaminated objects and surfaces [32, 12] . The novel coronavirus was first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. In a few months, the virus rapidly spread throughout China and was exported to 114 countries around the world [12, 35] .The worldwide number of humans diagnosed with COVID-19 has surpassed 118,000 and nearly 4,300 people have died [1] . On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has officially declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic [2] . To the best of our knowledge, no specific vaccine or antiviral exist for COVID-19 up to date, but there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments [14] . Meanwhile, classical public health measures such as isolation and quarantine, social distancing and community containment were adopted by many countries to prevent dissemination of the disease within their populations and to curb the epidemic [1, 35] . The containment measure, defined as an intervention applied to an entire community in order to lower intermixing of unreported infectious individuals with susceptibles as well as the spread of the virus [35] , ranges from social distancing to community-use of face masks, including locking entire cities or areas.Morocco is one of the countries affected by COVID-19. As of April 09, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in Morocco was reported to be 1374 infectious and 97 deaths [26] . becoming ill are identified and tested [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] . Since seven imported cases have emerged, Moroccan government decided to suspend flights to neighboring countries affected by COVID-19 such as Italy, Spain, Algeria and France [29] . However, reported cases continued to grow with eight new imported cases and a first confirmed local case appeared on March 14 [23] . The epidemic spreads to other Moroccan cities such as Tetouan,Rabat and Khouribga and, therefore, Morocco rapidly responded to the COVID-19 infection and the Moroccan authorities implemented a series of control measures to limit person-toperson transmission. The Ministry of interior has decided to close all schools of the country and promotes online interactive learning as an alternative [28] . Movements of Moroccan people are restricted to their living space and all gathering of more than fifty persons has become prohibited [29] . Mosques and non-essential common areas are closed except for pharmacies and stores selling necessary goods to citizen. Moreover, all international flights are suspended and all public events are canceled [29] . On March 19, the government decreed a state of health emergency and the compulsory containment of population has been declared [27] . However, a part of the population continued to work to supply the basic necessities to the confined population. Every day, infectious individuals are reported by the Ministry of Health and all individuals that have a close contact with them are identified and quarantined.Unfortunately, the unreported and asymptomatic infectious cases may exist within confined or working people and constitute a source of contamination of susceptible individuals like family members, co-workers, sellers, etc. Despite being the most affected country in the world by the disease, China is the first country that has succeeded in mitigating the progression of COVID-19 by a stringent containment of the population [33, 36] . Others countries such as Morocco still continue their fight to curb the growth in the number of daily infectious cases. Up to date, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to increase and changes on a daily basis. The efficacy of containment and how long it must be maintained is still unknown. The longer the period of containment, the more serious consequences on the socioeconomic situation of the country will be. In addition, the short peak period of the epidemic and large notified cases prevent health care teams from adequately preparing for and responding to the huge load of patients. Thus, lowering the peak size and the postponing the peak time of the reported cases are of major interest.In this study, using the reported cumulative confirmed cases in Morocco from March 2nd, 2020 to April 9, 2020 (See Table 1 The data of reported symptomatic infectious cases is collected each day at 11 pm from the official Coronavirus Portal of Morocco [26] . The model without containmentThe population considered in our basic model , as shown in Fig Here, we assume that reported symptomatic infectious individuals are hospitalized andcan not contact susceptibles anymore. We assume also, as confirmed by Rothe et al. [13] , that asymptomatic individuals can infect susceptible individuals through an effective contact. Furthermore, MacIntyre in [15] proved that asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals share the same infection probability. Taking account of the previous assumptions, the dynamics of COVID-19 can be described as follows: Susceptibles (S) contacted with either unreported symptomatic (Ĩ u ) or asymptomatic infectious individuals (Ã), at an effective contact rate, c, are infected with infection probability, β, and move to the asymptomatic infectious class (Ã). After an average period 1/δ days the asymptomatic infectious individuals (Ã) become symptomatic and proceed either to the unreported symptomatic infectious (Ĩ u ), at rate δ 1 , or to the reported symptomatic infectious (Ĩ r ) at rate δ 2 with δ = δ 1 + δ 2 . Once becoming symptomatic, individuals of classĨ u andĨ r remain asymptomatic for 1/µ days on average before they are recovered.Since the containment measure started 19 days since the first reported case then the model equations without containment is defined for 0 ≤ t < t 0 := 19 as follows Here, we assume that confined asymptomatic and confined unreported individuals can still spread the virus to their families. Furthermore, since the Moroccan government starts to impose public major measures, and taking account the fact that Moroccan individuals gradually began to reduce their contact with the people nearby, we assume that the contact rate changes from a constant rate to an exponentially decreasing rate, cl(t), with time. It is meaningful to assume that the only subpopulation that will not be confined is the reported symptomatic infectious subpopulation.The model with containment control will given, for t ≥ t 0 days, by the following equationsis the total asymptomatic infectious population and I u (t) = I N u (t) + I c u (t) is the total unreported symptomatic infectious population. Moreover, if the containment rate of susceptible, asymptomatic infectious and unreported infectious subpopulations is denoted by p, then the new initial data for system (2.2) shall be given byThe basic reproduction number, R 0 , is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infectious individual is introduced into a host susceptible population. This quantity determines whether a given disease may spread, or die out in a population. To compute this number, we apply the next generation matrix method in [31] . Computation method of R 0 is presented in the Appendix.Here, R 0 can be explained as follows: Assume that one asymptomatic infectious individual is introduced into the susceptible population. This asymptomatic individual produces, on average, βcS 0 1 δ asymptomatic individuals during his average lifespan 1/δ. These asymptomatic individuals then become unreported symptomatic infectious individuals over their lifespan 1/δ at a rate δ 1 and then each infectious symptomatic produces, on average, βcS 0 1 µ asymptomatic individuals during his lifespan 1/µ.The control reproduction number, R c , is an important value, used to determine whether a control policy, such as containment in our case, will be efficient to decrease the number of secondary infections to be less than one. Here, we compute the control reproduction number related to the early stage of the containment (During the first 20 days starting from the first day of containment). Computation method of R c is presented in the Appendix.The parameter estimation is a crucial step of our study since the epidemiologically relevant choice of the parameters must establish and confirm the observed dynamics of the infection during the onset of the epidemic. Table 2 gives the values of the parameters used in the model. In our simulations, the the total population of the Moroccan Kingdom,S(0), is chosen based on estimates from [5] , the asymptomatic duration, 1/δ, based on estimates from [26] and the symptomatic duration, 1/µ, based on estimates from [34] . Note that the data of reported cases used to estimate the model parameters was carried out before containment and during the epidemic period. Thus, we assume that the contact rate, c, since the first reported case and before the first day of containment is around 10 contacts per person in average [9] . Furthermore, we assume that a likely confined individual can only go out once every 2 weeks on average to do the necessary shopping while an individual who cannot respect containment, due to a job of paramount importance, must go 5 days a week to work.Thus, it is meaningful to assume that, during the short time from March 21 to April 9, the average contact rate satisfy the relation 1 39−20´3 9 20 cl(t)dt ≈ c/10. Thus, we assume that α ≈ 0.078. The other parameters and initial data are estimated as follows:Since the first and the only infectious symptomatic individual is reported on March 2nd, 2020, which corresponds to t = 0, thenĨ r (0) = 1. For the estimation of β,Ã(0) andĨ(0) we will use the data of cumulative reported cases collected from March 2nd to March 20 (before the start of containment) in Table ( 1) and we follow the procedure by [8] . The cumulative reported infectious population is given, for t ≥ 0, by CR(t) = δ 2´t 0Ã (s)ds + 1. It is obvious that cumulative reported infectious population increases slowly and then accelerates rapidly with time. Hence, we will use exponential regression with 95% of confidence level to find an exponential function that best fits the data, from March 2nd to March 20th, in Table ( From the second equation of system (2.1) and using (2.3) we obtain The government have deployed a series of severe control measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 across Morocco. The Moroccan people entered compulsory containment 19days since the first infectious case has been confirmed. In this study we adopted a deterministic mathematical model of COVID-19 dynamics which took into account the Moroccan containment strategy used to control and eradicate the disease in the country. We used reported infectious case data, from March 2nd to April 9th, 2020, provided by the Health Ministry of Morocco to parameterize the model. On the one hand, as shown in Fig. 3 .1, our simulations shows that our model fit well the cumulative data of reported infectious cases giving in Table 1 , under the absence of compulsory containment conditions. On the other hand, to be as close as possible to reality, we used the cumulative reported case data from March 21th to April 09th and we applied the same method in Section 2.4to estimate the containment rate p during these first 20 days of containment (See appendix 4). The Fig. 3 .2 showed that our model is able to predict the provided real reported data during the first 20 days past after the beginning of containment. These results are horrifying and no country in the world could control a major wave of infectious cases. For practical reasons, it is imperative to reduce the peak-value so as not to exceed the limit capacity of hospital beds and lead the country towards an uncontrollable dramatic situation. It is also better to delay the peak appearance time to allow official health structures to prepare for such a high level of emergency. Increasing the containment rate p from 0.73 to 0.90 lead to a rapid saturation of cumulative number of reported infectious cases, ranging from 16950 to 7558 (Fig. 3.4) . Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3 .4, the peak times of reported infectious cases decreased slightly while the epidemic duration decreased significantly from 180 to 125 days and the peak-sizes decreased from 338 to 188 cases (See Table 3 ). If Moroccan government succeeded to contain more than 90% of population, then the peak size of infectious cases would be less than 188 reported cases on April, 27th, 2020. However, these results could be overestimated or underestimated since many epidemiological factors are still unknown and are subject of study by researchers. Up to date, Morocco still did not reach the epidemic peak yet. Furthermore, if the containment period will last so long, Morocco must combine its actual strategy with the mass-testing or the contact-tracing strategies which allow finding and controlling the suspected cases through the susceptible population [10, 6] . For example, to the best of our knowledge, South Korea is the only country that has succeeded to greatly slow its epidemic without resorting to drastic containment [3] . The increase of the containment rate does not significantly affect the peak-time but acted differently on epidemic duration (see Fig. 3.4) . Indeed, we found that, by increasing the containment rate, there exists a threshold control reproduction number R c = 1 corresponding to a threshold containment rate p * = 0.73, below which the epidemic end-time is postponed ( Fig. 3 .5) and above which the epidemic end-time is advanced (Fig. 3.4) . This phenomenon can be explained as follows: In the absence of containment, the whole population becomes infected within a short time. However, by increasing the rate of containment gradually to the threshold p * , the daily number of infectious individuals becomes lower and continues to significantly infect the susceptible individuals, which increases the duration of the epidemic.Moreover, if the containment rate passe the threshold, the containment becomes efficient since the daily number of infectious individuals significantly diminish, which in turn decrease the number of new infected and, consequently, shorten the duration of the epidemic. Finally, the study of sensitivity analysis supported the results above and found that the containment rate has significant impact with correlation coefficient PRCC=−0.8. In general, the only three parameters playing a major role on the model dynamic are the contact rate, the containment rate and the asymptomatic duration ( Fig. 3.6 ). However, our sensitivity analysis study show that the asymptomatic duration have a greater impact, with correlation coefficient PRCC=0.863, and consequently, can play a major role in COVID-19 spread across Morocco. Indeed, it has been shown that younger age individuals are the most contributor of silent transmission of COVID-19 to older family members [15] , which could be the case in Morocco since 26% of the Moroccan community are less then 15 years old [4] . Fortunately, the Moroccan government have decided to close schools earlier to avoid such a critical epidemic consequences.The COVID-19 infection was primary imported to Morocco from European countries. and the associated Jacobian matrix is given by and R 0 is its spectral radius which is givenFollowing the remark on the contact behaviour and the estimation given in Section 2.4we will assume that, in average, cl(t) = c/10. Consequently, the control reproduction number is given by R c = (βcpS(t 0 )/10 + βc(1 − p)S(t 0 )) 1 δ + δ 1 δµ .Estimation of p between March 21 and April 9The cumulative reported cases for t ≥ t 0 is given by CR(t) = δ 2´t t 0 A(s)ds+I r (t 0 ) = be at .Here we will use once again the exponential regression with 95% of confidence level to find an exponential function that best fits the data, from March 21 to April 9, in Table (1) .We found that exponential model given by be at with a = 0.139 with confidence interval CI (0.125 − 0.153) and b = 7.8303 with CI (5.176 − 11.858) fits well the data with a correlation coefficient given by R = 0.981. Differentiating the both terms of CR(t) leads toSince the initial susceptible population is not dramatically affected in the early phase of the epidemic, we will assume that S(t) ≈S(t 0 ).

This virus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. The first case was reported on the 8 th of December 2019 for many patients lived around the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (Chan et al., 2020) . The novel coronavirus was identified from the throat swab sample of a patient . World Health Organization has abbreviated this novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV then the pathogen was renamed to SARS-CoV-2(WHO, 2020). After that, World Health Oorganization declared the pandemic when the virus hit many other countries.Human infections by the SARS coronavirus are known to be closely associated with interactions between the viral spike protein (S-protein) which has favorable binding affinity for the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) (B€ ohm & Schneider, 2005; Li et al., 2005; Prabakaran et al., 2004; Veeramachaneni et al., 2020) . Several studies have also provided evidence of the COVID-19 S-protein binding to the ACE2 receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020) .Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related carboxypeptidase is a zinc metallopeptidase ectoenzyme, which is predominantly found in the lungs (Skeggs et al., 1956) . ACE2, is a type I integral membrane protein, which it consists of 805 amino acid residues with one Zn 2þ essential for enzyme activity. ACE2 was implicated in the regulation of heart function and as a functional receptor for the coronavirus, which is linked to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). ACE2 is the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which is causing the serious pandemic COVID-19 (Hasan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003; Towler et al., 2004; Yan et al., 2020) .In a recent study, it was suggested that the 2019-nCoV binds to the human ACE2 receptor via densely glycosylated spike (S) protein as the initiation step of the entry mechanism to human cells (Basit et al., 2020; Boopathi et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020) . The entry of the virus depends on its binding with the cell surface units at site 1 and site 2 S1/S2 that contains Zn þ2 , an important cofactor for numerous viral proteins as well (Te Velthuis et al., 2010) . Existence of this metallic ion facilitates the viral attachment to the surface of target cells. It is well known that zinc ions serve as intracellular second messenger and may trigger apoptosis or efficiently impair replication of a number of viruses and this effect may be based on direct inhibition (Alirezaei et al., 1999; Frederickson et al., 2005; Lazarczyk & Favre, 2008; Te Velthuis et al., 2010) . ACE2 exists in every human body but in different quantities (Gurley & Coffman, 2008) . Patients, who suffer from hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, have high concentration of ACE2 enzyme in their bodies (Fang et al., 2020; Gurley & Coffman, 2008; Zhou et al., 2020) . These categories of people can be easily infected by coronavirus compared with children who have low concentration of ACE2 enzyme, their infection percentage is only 2% (Bunyavanich et al., 2020) .Blocking the active site of ACE2 by suitable pharmaceutical compound will prevent the virus entering to the human cells. Therefore, synthesis of such pharmaceutical compound is in great demand. Many scientists worldwide are trying to synthesise new drugs to stop spreading the new infectious disease. We think that this route takes a long time, at least 18 months, until the new vaccine will be available in the markets. Thus, using medicaments already exist is the shortcut to tackle such issue. In 2005, chloroquine was found as a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and it was suggested to treat the new novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 with hydroxychloroquine (Adeoye et al., 2020; Amin & Abbas, 2020; B€ ohm & Schneider, 2005; Smith & Smith, 2020; Vincent et al., 2005) . However, due to its cardiotoxicity hydroxychloroquine has been red flagged by USFDA for use as a prophylactic measure.In this study, 18 drugs were selected to evaluate their binding with two receptors ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE2 ([SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex). These drugs were chosen due to their similarities in structure with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in order to find an alternative drug for COVID-19.Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation was applied to the drugs selected from the DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 2018) to study their affinity with coronavirus antibody ACE2 receptor (PDB ID: 1R42) (Towler et al., 2004) and also study their affinity with the crystal structure of [SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) (Lan et al., 2020) to select the most active drugs that inhibit COVID-19. Global reactivity descriptors of the selected drugs were calculated to understand their structures, stability and reactivity. The methodology of this work is illustrated in Figure 1 .The chemical structure of drugs inhibitors of ACE2 and similar structures were extracted from the DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 2018) in MDL Mol format and converted to 3 D format using Mervin Sketch (MarvinSketch, 2019). The structures were pre-optimized with semi-empirical AM1 method (Stewart, 2013 ) using Hyperchem 8.08 software (HyperChem, 2009 ). The structures were optimized using density functional theory DFT method by employing the B3LYP/6-31G basis set (Becke, 1997; Frisch et al., 2009 ) to obtain the most stable conformation, which was also used to calculate the global reactivity descriptors through Gaussian 09 (Frisch et al., 2009) . The convergent value of maximum force, root-mean-square (RMS) force, maximum displacement and RMS displacement are set by default and achieved ""YES"". All values are positive after calculation vibrational frequencies to drugs, those results indicate that the drugs are stable (Cavalli et al., 2006) . The optimized structures were combined in one database on MOE software (Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), 2015) in order to study the affinity of ligands ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ).The crystal structure of the angiotensin-converting enzyme related carboxypeptidase ACE2 receptor (PDB ID: 1R42) Because Zn 2þ is an important cofactor for many viral proteins, Zn 2þ can inhibit the replication of ARN polymerase, two active sites containing zinc (Zn 2þ ) in 1R42 and 6M0J enzymes were chosen as shown in Figures 3 and 4 respectively (Te Velthuis et al., 2010) . After that, the protein structure was prepared by correcting the missing bonds, which were broken in X-ray diffraction, and then the hydrogen atoms were added (Table 2) . All the docking and scoring calculations were performed using the molecular operation environment software (MOE) (Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), 2015). The crystal structure of human angiotensin converting enzyme (PDB entry: 1R42) (Towler et al., 2004 ) at a resolution of 2.20 Å and the crystal structure of [SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex (PDB entry: 6M0J) (Lan et al., 2020) at a resolution of 2.45 Å were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2020) .A resolution between 1.5 and 2.5 Å is considered as a good quality for docking studies (Didierjean & Tête-Favier, 2016; Venugopal et al., 2008) . It is known that the best score of RMSD values should be near to 2 Å with an energy score less or equal to À7 Kcal/mol (Kellenberger et al., 2004; Ramalho et al., 2009 ). These two values are often used as criterion to validate the result of the molecular docking. Global reactivity indices are the most relevant traits, which can be derived from the conceptual density functional theory (DFT). They have important properties which enable us to understand the chemical reactivity and kinetic stability of compounds (Shahab et al., 2016) . The global reactivity descriptors can be described by energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (E HOMO ), energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E LUMO ), energy gap (DE), global electrophilicity (x), chemical potential (m), chemical hardness (g), chemical softness (S) and nucleophilicity (N) (Defranceschi & C. Le Bris, 2000; Domingo et al., 2016; Harkati et al., 2017; Zekri et al., 2020) . Those descriptors were calculated at B3LYP/6-31G using the following formulas:In this study, the global reactivity descriptors were calculated to compounds that have best result in docking with ACE2 and [SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study was carried out for the most promising drugs Delapril, Lisinopril and Ramipril to target [SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex (6M0J) using standard default parameter setting in the MOE software (Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), 2015).There are four algorithms implemented in MOE software for MD simulations; the Nos e-Poincar e-Andesen (NPA), the Nos e-Hoover-Andersen (NHA), Berendsen velocity/position (BER) and Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD). In this study, the NPA is: the most precise and the most sensitive, was used to study the molecular dynamics of ligands (Sturgeon & Laird, 2000) . In MD calculations, MMFF94x force field, sphere shape, water as a solvent, six margins and delete far existing solvent with distance greater than four Å were selected to optimize the system.Molecular docking was run for 18 ligands against the [SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex and the ACE2 receptor.Tables 3 and 4 present the results of docking the drugs in 1R42 at two selected pockets S1 and S2 respectively. The results, as shown in Table 3 , indicate that only seven ligands have an interaction with the receptor in pocket S1. Delapril has the best docking score (-6.9809 kcal/mol) followed by Lisinopril (-6.6886 kcal/mol)) with RMSDs 2.2570 Å and 1.5417 Å respectively. On the other hand, Ramiprilat and Piperaquine had RMSDs more than 3 Å and Trandolaprilat, Chloroquine and Perindopril had RMSDs less than 1.5 Å, which this is inadequate .Interactions were further examined for bond lengths and hydrogen bonds in site 1 and were illustrated in Figure 5 . The results from this Figure 5 showed that Delapril interacts with three amino acids residues in three different interactions; H-donor with amino acid Ser409, H-acceptor with Gln442, H-pi with His374 as well as two H-acceptor and pi-H interactions with the water. The distance and energy binding of interaction are listed in Table 3 .From Table 4 , the docking results in pocket S2, it can be noticed that Delapril had the lowest docking score (-6.5831 kcal/mol) with RMSD (2.0115 Å) followed by Perindopril, Ramipril and Chloroquine with docking score and RMSD values of (-6.2821 Kcal/mol, 1.1895 Å), (-6.1181 Kcal/mol, 1.5054 Å) and (-5.5271 Kcal/mol, 1.3462 Å) respectively. Even in this site, Chloroquine had a good score but actually it had an inadequate RMSD value (1.3462 Å), which is less than the accepted limit 1.5 Å. The same things can be said for Enalaprilat, Perindopril and Quinacrine.The interactions of drugs with site 2 were also examined and depicted in Figure 6 . Figure 6 shows that Delapril had Hacceptor interaction with water, while Perindopril had H-pi interaction with amino acid His401. Meanwhile, Ramipril had H-acceptor interaction with amino acid Asp350 and H-acceptor with water and Chloroquine had H-donor interaction with amino acid Ala348 and pi-pi interaction with Trp349. The distance and the energy binding are presented in Table 4 .Tables 5 and 6 show the results of docking of the drugs in 6M0J at two selected pockets S1 and S2 respectively. The results in pocket S1 revealed that Piperaquine had the lowest docking score (-8.6132 Kcal/mol) and RMSD (2.3325 Å) compared with Delapril and Hydroxychloroquine, which they had energy scores and RMSD values of (-7.5271 Kcal/ mol, 2.1735 Å) and (-7.2272 Kcal/mol, 2.1035 Å) respectively.In spite of Delapril and Hydroxychloroquine did not have the lowest score, they have the best RMSD values. Lisinopril and Quinacrine Mustard had RMSD value less than 1.5 Å.The results of the binding of drugs with 6M0J in site 1 are shown in Figure 7 . From the Figure 7 , It is apparent that Piperaquine had pi-pi interaction with amino acid Phe438, whereas Hydroxychloroquine had pi-H and pi-pi interactions with amino acid Phe438 and Delapril had numerous interactions; H-donor interaction with amino acid Glu375, Hacceptor with Arg514 and metallic interaction with zinc.The interaction of carboxylic functional group in Delapril with zinc motivates the zinc to interact with His374 by metallic interaction and with His378 and Glu402 by ionic and metallic interactions respectively. As mentioned above, zinc had an antiviral activity and this type of interaction may inhibit the COVID-19.The results of docking of drugs with 6M0J in site 2 are shown in Table 6 . According to the results in this site 2, almost all drugs make interacted in pocket S2 via zinc. Delapril showed excellent docking score À8.1604 Kcal/mol and RMSD 1.5603 Å compared with Perindopril, Lisinopril, Hydroxychloroquine and Ramipril with energy scores and RMSD values of (-6.7968 kcal/mol, 2.2965 Å), (-6.6966 Kcal/ mol, 1.9981 Å), (-6.3125 Kcal/mol, 1.8513 Å) and (-7.6305 kcal/ mol, 2.4853 Å) respectively. Although in site 2, Enalaprilat, N-(2-aminoethyl)-1-aziridineethamine, Piperaquine, Piperazine, Quinacrine Mustard, Trandolaprilat and Quinacrine have interactions with the active site but they have unacceptable RMSD values.In all pockets, N-(2-aminoethyl)-1-aziridineethamine, Triethylenetetramine and Piperazine had energy docking scores higher than À4 Kcal/mol, they had energy scores out of the accepted limit, therefore these compounds could not be considered. Also, in all results, Chloroquine had energy scores higher than Hydroxychloroquine and Delapril. Figure 8 presents the interactions of drugs with 6M0J in site 2. From Figure 8 , it can be seen that Delapril had a metallic interaction with Zn, meanwhile Zn interacts with three amino acids by two types of interactions. These are: two ionic and one metallic interactions with Glu402, one ionic and one metallic interactions with His378 and ionic interaction with His374.Perindopril had many interactions, three H-donor interactions with amino acids Glu398, Glu402 and Glu375, two Hacceptor with water and with amino acid Arg514 as well as metallic interaction with Zn. Meanwhile Zn had two ionic and metallic interactions, with amino acid Glu402, metallic and ionic interactions with amino acid His378 and metallic interaction with amino acid His374. Hydroxychloroquine had H-donor interaction with amino acid Glu375, metallic interaction with Zn, H-pi interaction with amino acid His378, while Zn had the same interactions with these amino acids. Lisinopril had H-donor interaction with water and metallic interaction with Zn, whereas Zn interacts with the same amino acids. Ramipril had two metallic interaction with Zn. whereas Zn interacts with the same amino acids.The chemical reactivity descriptors were calculated and presented in Table 7 . The E HOMO and E LUMO were obtained from GaussView (Dennington et al., 2016) . The results of the global hardness and softness, which they are related to the stability of chemical system, as shown in Table 7 , indicate that Ramipril, Chloroquine, ORE-1001 and Delapril are harder than the Hydroxychloroquine and other compounds.In addition, Ramipril have the smaller energy gap (DE ¼ 2.9508 eV), Delapril and Lisinopril have smaller energy Notes: the HOMO energy -8.6559 eV. of the reference system (TCE) had been calculated at DFT/B3LYP 6-31 G. gaps than Hydroxychloroquine. Moreover, Ramipril, Chloroquine, ORE-1001 and Delapril have softness values higher than that of Hydroxychloroquine. These results indicate that Ramipril, Chloroquine, ORE-1001 and Delapril are more stable and more reactive than Hydroxychloroquine. The electronic chemical potential (m) for Perindopril (m¼ À2.6386 eV) is higher than other compounds followed by Hydroxychloroquine, Enalapril and Delapril. According to these results, these compounds can exchange electron density with the environment efficiently (Azarhazin et al., 2019) .A further classification of organic molecules as strong (N > 3 eV), moderate (2.0 eV N 3.0 eV) and marginal nucleophilic (N < 2.0 eV) were obtained by analysis of a series of common nucleophilic species participating in polar organic reaction. Note that nucleophilicity value is referred to tetracyanoethylen (TCE) taken as a reference, because it presents the lowest E HOMO in a large series of molecule already investigated (Jaramillo et al., 2008) . According to the results in Table 7 , Chloroquine can be classified as strong nucleophile and the others as moderate nucleophile except ORE-1001, which is considered as marginal nucleophile.The electrophilicity x had become a potent tool for the study of the reactivity of organic compounds that can participate in polar reaction (Domingo et al., 2016; Srivastava, 2020) . Ramipril had the highest electrophilicity value (x ¼ 7.1873 eV), whereas as Delapril had an electrophilicity value (x ¼ 1.9888 eV) higher more than that of Hydroxychloroquine (x ¼ 1.4291 eV).In order to examine the conformational flexibilities of docked drug-receptor complexes and to attain dependable drugreceptor-binding affinities, the MD process combined with binding energy (MM-GBSA) (De Vivo et al., 2016; Kerrigan, 2013) calculations was run for 600 ps on the most promising drugs Delapril, Lisinopril and Ramipril to target [SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex (6M0J). The evaluated average MM-GBSA binding energies are given in Table 8 .In general, it is apparent from this table that the selected three drugs exhibited considerable binding energies). In site 2, Delapril and Ramipril showed promising binding energies À54 and À46 kcal/mol respectively. On the other hand, Lisinopril showed relatively weak binding energy À33 kcal/ mol. Whereas, in site 2, all three drugs Delapril, Lisinopril and Ramipril showed promising binding affinities with binding energies. Figures 9 and 10 show the results of the atomic potential energy function during dynamic study calculation for Delapril, Lisinopril and Ramipril in the 6M0J at site 1 and 2 respectively. To explore the dynamic stability of the 6M0J/ inhibitor drugs complexes, the time-dependent potential energy of the complex were calculated during MD trajectories. It is apparent in Figure 9 , site 1, that complex A (6M0J/ Delapril) achieved equilibrium around 300 ps. Meanwhile complex B (6M0J/Lisinopril) achieved the equilibrium around 350 ps. Whereas, complex C (6M0J/Ramipril) achieved the equilibrium stability around 400 ps. It can be seen from Figure 10 , site 2, that the complex A achieved the equilibrium stability around 400 ps, complex B achieve the equilibrium stability around 400 ps, meanwhile complex C achieve the equilibrium stability around 350 ps.In general, if the interaction energy between a residue and a ligand is lower than À0.8 Kcal/mol, the residue is regarded as an important residue in the molecular recognition of the ligand. For the 6M0J/Delapril complex A (Figure 11 ), the major favourable energy contributions (-2.2 to À1.4 kcal/mol) originate predominately from Glu375 (-1.4), H 2 O1030 (-1.5) and Trp203 (-2.2), As shown in Figure 11 the complex B had energy binding with Asp292 (-7.8) and Ala413 (-4.7). However, complex C did not interact in this site.It is clear from Figure. 12 that complex A had interactions in site 2 of 6M0J with Glu375 (-8.7) and Zn901 (-3.4), while complex B had the major favourable energy contributions (-0.6 to À6.2 kcal/mol) which originate predominately from Glu402 (-2.3), Asp382 (-6.2), H 2 O1033 (-1.3), Tyr510 (-2.8), H 2 O1004 (-1.5), His401 (-0.6) and Trp349 (-1). Nevertheless, His401 cannot be considered as an important residue.Complex C showed more favourable interactions with residues Glu402 (-3.8), H 2 O1030 (-1.3), H 2 O1002 (-0.9), Zn901 (-4.1) and Asp350 (-2).The aim of the present research was to examine the binding of eighteen candidate drugs with ACE2 enzyme and [SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex using docking analysis. The docking ranking results in this study showed that some of these ligands might have the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The results of docking these ligands with ACE2 enzyme (1R42) in two pockets indicated that Delapril gave the lowest energy score and good RMSD value followed by Lisinopril (site1) and Ramipril (site 2). In addition, the docking results with 6M0J showed that only Delapril and Ramiprilat interacted with Zn in site 1, while in site 2 Delapril gave the best energy score followed by Ramipril. The drugs mentioned above presented good results with the two chosen enzymes compared with Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine. Moreover, the results obtained from global reactivity indices indicated that Ramipril is the most reactive drug, it had the highest electrophilicity value followed by ORE-1001, Chloroquine and Lisinopril. The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that Ramipril, Delapril and Lisinopril gave good docking results compared with Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine. Also, Delapril, Lisinopril and Ramipril showed encouraging binding affinity, MM/GBSA energies, to [SARS-CoV-2/ACE2] complex. Further investigation and experimentation into Delapril, Lisinopril and Ramipril, which they are promising candidate drugs for COVID-19 patients, is strongly recommended.No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.Basil A.

4339b37c5536afbe567a4541935d11420d717ee6,Mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya: a review,"The ongoing coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak which was declared a pandemic in March 2020 [1] , has exerted a substantial negative impact on the health and socio-economic structures of countries across the globe [2] . The disease, caused by a novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected close to 17 million people and resulted in over 600,000 deaths globally [3] . Disease mitigating measures such as quarantine, isolation, curfews, lockdowns and travel restrictions have resulted in loss of income, disruptions to daily routines and social isolation [4] laying the ground for negative mental health outcomes among societies.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that by far, the largest public mental health impact has been in the form of stress and anxiety, and predicts a rise in depression, suicide and substance use in the comingInternational Journal of Mental Health Systems Page 2 of 6 Jaguga and Kwobah Int J Ment Health Syst (2020) 14:68 days [5] . According to a recently developed emotional epidemic curve [6] without adequate mitigation measures, countries will experience two peaks of negative mental health consequences. The first peak is dominated by anxiety and corresponds to the peak in COVID-19 cases. A second peak of negative mental health outcomes comprising of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, suicide, complicated grief bereavement, and relapse of those with existing disorders, corresponds to the post-pandemic period [6] . Given the substantial anticipated burden of mental disorders in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that the mental health response is given high priority.The recently developed Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework (MHPAF) [6] provides a useful schema for evaluating and guiding the mental health response during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework was recently developed by mental health professionals drawn from all six WHO regions after realization that the WHO-Global Influenza Preparedness Plan (WHO-GIPP) [7] had no mental health component. The MHPAF is comprised of five interrelated components: (1) preparation and co-ordination; (2) monitoring and assessment; (3) reducing mental health distress and misinformation; (4) sustainability of mental health care services and (5) communication [6] . According to the framework, 'preparation and co-ordination' involves developing a mental health response plan, creating COVID-19 specific mental health services and training of healthcare workers on psychological first aid. Psychological first aid is a supportive response that involves offering practical support to persons who are suffering or facing crises. It involves assessing and addressing basic needs such as food, water and information. It further entails listening to people, helping them calm down and protecting them from further harm [8] . 'Monitoring and assessment' requires the development of a mental health surveillance system to enable continuous collection of data on mental health for at risk populations as well as the general population. A second role of the mental health surveillance system is 'reducing mental distress due to misinformation' . This includes monitoring various media platforms for myths and countering them by spreading accurate information. Finally, 'sustainability of mental health care services' entails the allocation of adequate funds to help mitigate the burden of mental health disorders during and after the pandemic [6] .The cases of COVID-19 are rapidly rising in the sub-Saharan Africa with concerns being raised about its capacity to deal with the pandemic [9] . Kenya, a Low Middle Income Country in Eastern Africa, was listed as being at high risk for importation of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic in Africa [9, 10] . In addition, Kenya has been reported as having a low Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IVDI) indicating its high vulnerability to the outbreak due to fragile health systems [9] . As at 31st July 2020, Kenya has 21,354 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 377 deaths [11] . A 21 member national emergency response committee has been set up and is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the overall COVID-19 response [12] guided by the National 2019 Novel Coronavirus Contingency (Readiness and Early Response) Plan [13] . The plan however offers no guidance on a mental health response, despite direction from the Kenya Mental Health Policy 2015-2030 [14] requiring that mental health care is provided during and after disasters.The Ministry of Health (MOH) through its Division of Mental Health has nonetheless embarked on efforts to deliver mental health care during the pandemic. Unfortunately, the mental health response is occurring against a backdrop of an under-resourced mental health care system characterized by inaccessible services, an acute shortage of mental health workers and limited funding [15] . This, coupled with the lack of a formal mental health response plan is hindering current efforts aimed at mitigating the mental health impact of COVID-19 in the community. Given the rising incidents of domestic violence [16] and alcohol use [17] during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, and the importance of behavioral strategies in containing the pandemic, a stronger mental health response is warranted.The aim of this review is therefore (1) to provide an overview of the mental health response to COVID-19 by the Government of Kenya guided by the MHPAF. A literature search revealed no paper describing the mental health response to COVID-19 in a sub-Saharan Africa country [2] to offer context specific recommendations for improvement of the mental health response in Kenya. Such information could be useful in guiding the mental health response in Kenya and in other sub-Saharan Africa countries.The aim of this narrative review is to describe the mental health response to COVID-19 by the Kenyan government. Documents for review were identified following consultation with experts working at the Division of Mental Health at the MOH. We additionally hand-searched the websites of the MOH and other ministries that were listed by the government as being key in the COVID-19 response [13] for documents and web-pages with content relevant to the five components of the MHPAF. In total, 11 documents released between 13th March 2020 when the first case of COVID-19 was announced in Kenya, and 31st July 2020 were identified and included for review (Table 1) .According to the MHPAF [6] , the mental health response during the early phases of the pandemic should focus on the preparation of a mental health response plan to serve as a guide for actions to be taken during the pandemic. The 'National 2019 Novel Coronavirus Contingency (Readiness and Early Response) Plan [13] has no provision for a mental health response. The National Disaster Response Plan, the Kenyan government's blueprint for disaster management [26] has operational objectives relating to mental health. However, some objectives are not specific to the COVID-19 context (for example the plan emphasizes the need to ensure access to social activities such as religious activities and schooling), limiting its applicability during the current pandemic.In order to manage the distress and anxiety often witnessed during pandemics, the MHPAF [6] recommends that health care workers are trained on how to administer psychological first aid during the early phases of the pandemic. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, the Division of Mental Health at the MOH prepared a guide for psychological first aid [8] . Training of healthcare workers on psychological first aid using the guide is ongoing via virtual platforms. A health sector situational report on COVID-19 as at 14th May however indicated that there was an unmet need for psychological first aid in the community [18] .Lastly, 'preparation and co-ordination' entails the setting up of COVID-19 specific mental health services. In Kenya, a number of guidelines have been developed by the Division of Mental Health in partnership with professional bodies such as the Kenya Psychiatric Association to ensure provision of COVID-19 specific mental health services. The 'Interim guidelines for managing mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic' [19] is one such document. It provides instruction on the in-patient and out-patient management of persons with mental health and substance use disorders who test positive for COVID-19. The document additionally outlines the delivery of mental health care for persons in isolation and quarantine, and offers guidance on how to conduct telepsychiatry. In order to ensure continuity and accessibility of mental health services, the same guidelines provide direction on the management of persons with newly diagnosed mental illness and the continued care for those with pre-existing mental illness during the pandemic. The guidelines recommend that health care facilities constitute mental health response teams in order to co-ordinate care during the pandemic [19] .Two other documents that have been prepared by the Division of Mental Health include a guide for health care workers on how to offer mental health and psychosocial support to the public [20] ; and standard operating procedures for psychologists and counselors to ensure standardized delivery of psychosocial interventions during the pandemic [25] .A major challenge likely to be faced despite the guidelines is that the number of mental health facilities and mental health workers available in Kenya is scarce. For example the psychologist to population ratio is 1:4,600,000. In addition, less than 1% of the public sector health care facilities offer any form of mental health care [27] . Using mobile phones to deliver mental health services in Kenya during the current pandemic, could potentially overcome the challenges of limited infrastructure as well as ensure compliance with pandemic containment measures. Such a strategy is likely to bePsychological first aid guide for COVID-19 response in Kenya, 2020 [8] Kenya Situation Report of 14th May, 2020 [18] Interim guidance on continuity of mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 [19] A comprehensive guide to mental health and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 [20] Frequently asked questions about COVID-19 [21] Public mental health education handout [22] COVID-19 outbreak in Kenya daily situation report-132 [23] COVID-19 mental health messages for healthcare workers [24] Standard operating procedures for counselors and psychologists providing mental health and psychosocial support for the COVID-19 response in Kenya [25] Ministry of Interior and Co-ordination of National GovernmentThe National Disaster Response Plan [26] Page 4 of 6 Jaguga and Kwobah Int J Ment Health Syst (2020) 14:68 feasible given that the country has a 91% penetration of mobile subscriptions. In addition, Kenya has the highest share of internet usage from mobile phones as compared to desktops globally [28] . Currently, counseling is being conducted via mobile phone voice calls for persons in isolation and quarantine. In addition, a call centre whose aim is to offer both knowledge and psychosocial support to frontline health workers has been established [29] . There is however a lack of mobile mental health interventions targeting the general public.The MHPAF recommends the setting up of a mental health surveillance system during the early phases of the pandemic. This is to ensure systematic and continuous collection of data on mental health in order to assist with planning and designing of appropriate interventions [6] . Data collection and monitoring for the COVID-19 situation in Kenya is being conducted by the government and daily situational reports are provided by the MOH. None of the parameters reported relates to mental health [23] , a manifestation of a Health Information System in Kenya that does not prioritize collection of data on mental health [30] . Without a system for continuous collection of mental health data, a clear understanding of the burden and risk factors of mental health problems during the current pandemic remains elusive. This may result in a poorly co-ordinated response with inefficient use of the scarce resources. Currently in Kenya, research studies seem to be the main strategy for collecting and analyzing information on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors are aware of on-going online studies that are being conducted by mental health professionals to investigate the burden of mental health conditions among health care workers.An additional role of the mental health surveillance system is the dissemination of accurate and timely information and to address myths surrounding COVID-19. This has been shown to reduce anxiety and stress during pandemics [6] . According to the MHPAF some of the information that ought to be relayed to the public includes strategies for promoting and preventing mental health problems, available mental health services and regular updates on the state of the pandemic [6] .In Kenya, the Ministry of Information Communication & Technology (ICT) has been tasked with communication functions during the pandemic with focus on dissemination of information on COVID-19, public education and dissemination of health messages [13] . To achieve this, the ministry has set up toll free lines and hotlines through which the public may call to receive information [31] . In addition, the Ministry of ICT in conjunction with the MOH has set up a call center whose aim is to provide information on current practices on COVID-19 to health care workers [29] .The MOH has been involved in providing information on COVID-19 to the public. Specifically, the MOH provides daily situation reports on COVID-19 which usually detail the number of cases, deaths, recoveries and offers key public health messages [23] . The MOH has in addition prepared handouts on frequently asked questions about COVID-19 [26] , public mental health education [27] and COVID-19 mental health messages for healthcare workers, for online dissemination [24] . Further, the MOH has partnered with a local mobile service provider to provide accurate information on COVID-19 to the general public via a 24-hour call center. The call center has incorporated the services of medical doctors who offer assistance with technical questions [32, 33] .Direct funding to the mental health response could not be ascertained. Given the lack of a formal mental health response plan, it is likely that funding for the mental health response is erratic and inadequate.In the post-pandemic period, Kenya should conduct a thorough evaluation of the five components of a mental health response as outlined in the MHPAF. Lessons learnt should be utilized in preparing a well co-ordinated mental health response plan specific for pandemic situations.Kenya has made attempts at instituting a mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic despite underlying systemic challenges. However, major gaps remain. The country has no formal mental health response plan, there is an unmet need for psychological first aid, access to mental health care and psychosocial support during the pandemic remains a challenge and there is no systematic collection of data on the mental health impact of COVID-19. We therefore propose four key strategies for strengthening the mental health response in Kenya: to enable access to psychological support for those in distress during the pandemic particularly at the grassroots level. Such trainings could be administered remotely via video conferencing given the good internet coverage and smart phone penetration rates in Kenya. 3. Scaling up of mobile health to increase access to mental health and psychosocial support for the general public during the pandemic. We propose that the medical doctors manning the 24-hour call centre receive online trainings on mental health and psychological support following which the service is expanded to incorporate delivery of brief psychological interventions to the general public. 4. In order to ensure proper surveillance of the mental health situation during the current pandemic, we propose that systematic and regular surveys are conducted to allow for monitoring of the mental health impact of COVID-19 in Kenya. Major mobile service providers in Kenya have survey platforms that use text messaging. These constitute potential means through which mental health surveillance could be conducted. Given, the existing partnerships between the MOH and local mobile service providers, such an initiative is likely achievable. ",Kenya,abstract,2020-08-18,08
40a925f2ea521e48ec38a6121d54fde4123268fd,Journal Pre-proof Fatal case of HIV and COVID-19 HIV and COVID-19 patient: multi-organ failure following acute kidney injury Short title: HIV and COVID-19 case of death,"1Abstract Background: We describe the first death in Libya from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting as acute kidney failure.We report an 86-year-old woman in Tripoli, Libya, with no recent travel history. She had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for which she reported noncompliance with treatment. On March 15, 2020, she was diagnosed with lobar pneumonia and her condition did not improve. On March 30, the patient presented to Tripoli University Hospital Emergency Department with a cough, temperature of 39°C, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, a pulse of 110 beats/min, and blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On April 1, 2020, the patient's status deteriorated and she was diagnosed with acute kidney injury as a complication of sepsis, with a urea level of 240 mg/dL (reference range, 5-50 mg/dL) and creatinine level of 7.69 mg/dL (reference range, 0.4-1.3 mg/dL). The patient was referred for dialysis at Tripoli University Hospital on April 2. However, the patient died despite attempting resuscitation due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome following acute kidney injury. A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were collected, which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time RT-PCR. including >373,000 deaths as of June 1, 2020 (3) (4) (5) . We describe the first confirmed fatal case of COVID-19 in Libya.We report an 86-year-old woman in Libya, with no recent travel history. On April 1, 2020, she presented to Abu-Seta Respiratory Outpatient Clinic due to worsening cough, dyspnea, headache, and fever. However, the patient was referred to Alhadba Alkhadra Hospital as they refused to admit her due to a shortage of facilities.On admission to the hospital on April 1, 2020, her temperature was 38.5°C, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, pulse 115 beats/min, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 77% on room air. High-resolution computed tomography On April 1, 2020, the patient's status deteriorated and she was diagnosed with acute kidney injury, with a urea level of 240 mg/dL (reference range, 5-50 mg/dL) and creatinine level of 7.69mg/dL (reference range, 0.4-1.3 mg/dL). The patient was referred for dialysis at Tripoli University Hospital on April 2. However, the patient died despite attempted resuscitation due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f following acute kidney injury. A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were collected, which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time RT-PCR by the National Centre for Disease Control. However, her family members and healthcare workers who managed the patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. This case raises questions about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and testing capability in Libya.Testing for SARSCOV2 as reported here is mandatory in any situation to avoid exposing care providers. This needs an important investment in testing capability.Civil war and fragility of the healthcare system are ongoing challenges for the ability of Libya to manage and control COVID-19. Therefore, a surveillance plan is needed in Libya to increase the capacity of the government to detect cases of COVID-19, as the NCDC has a low daily capacity to perform SARS-CoV-2 testing, with a mean daily testing capability of less than 50 test per day during March and April 2020 (6).This case also provides an insight into the importance of co-infection between HIV and SARS Cov2. Immunocompromised patients may be at higher risk of complication and deterioration due to COVID-19 infection. Finally, physicians in charge of such patients should be aware that antiretroviral therapy for HIV patients does not seem to prevent COVID-19, especially those onto lopinavir-ritonavir (7) Also, we should emphasize that relying on PCR for diagnosis carries the risk of delaying treatment and management of suspected cases of COVID-19. This case provides an insight into the importance of testing for SARS-CoV-2, in the context of an epidemic, all patients with atypical presentations particularly those with associated HIV infection.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",Libya,abstract,2020-08-11,08
b36c243f2854ff8fdfa011ddd95739bd18733736,"Study of the structural, chemical descriptors and optoelectronic properties of the drugs Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin","COVID-19 is an emerging disease due to a novel coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, which started in Wuhan, China in 2019 and spread to the other continents [1, 2] . It was declared to be pandemic in 2020 by the World health Organization [3] . Haman Corona viruses which belong to the family of Coronaviridae were first identified and observed in 1960 [4, 5] . Corona viruses are enveloped-single stranded-positive sense RNA virus. COVID-19 is a new form of corona virus which is round in shape with a diameter of approximately 60-120 nm [6] and with an incubation period [5] . Among potential drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning of old drugs such as Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Remdesivir etc for use as antiviral treatment is an interesting strategy because knowledge on their mode of action, safety profile, side effects, dosage and their interactions with other biological molecules are well known [7, 8, 9] . This study is limited to Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin.Hydroxychloroquine is a drug derived from 4-aminoquinoline. It is used as an antimalarial drug ever since the Second World War. It is also widely used in the treatment of lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory and skin diseases [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] . Hydroxychloroquine is rapidly absorbed by the intestine, accumulating in organs such as the liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys. It is partially converted to active metabolites in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidney when ingested [15] . According to literature [12, 16, 17, 18] , some risk factors increase the likelihood of retinopathy caused by Hydroxychloroquine; for instance, the daily dosage, the cumulative dose, and renal or liver disease, besides age and previous retinal diseases. Thus, pharmaceuticals containing Hydroxychloroquine must undergo strict quality control, which requires the development of simple, rapid, and accurate analytical procedures for the identification and quantification of this drug in both pharmaceutical and biological samples. Gautret et al. 2020 [19] conducted a clinical trial aiming at assessing the effect of hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients after approval by the French Ministry of Health. In their report, they focused on the virological data in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group. Their results showed that, Hydroxychloroquine is efficient in eliminating viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in only three to six days, in most patients and a significant difference was observed between Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and controls starting even on day 3 post-inclusion. Their results also suggested a synergistic effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. They recommended that patients with COVID-19 should be treated with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the World. Equally, they proposed that further studies should be carried out on this combination because such combination can both act as an antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and prevent bacterial super-infections. Hydroxychloroquine which is an analogue of Chloroquine has demonstrated to have an anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro [20] . Even though Chloroquine has proven to have an inhibitor effect on the growth of SARA-CoV-2 in vitro, the clinical safety profile of Hydroxychloroquine is better than that of Chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose [21] and has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions [22] .Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic which differs chemically from erythromycin by methyl-substituted nitrogen atom in the macrolide ring. It is composed of fifteen-membered ring structure having two sugar moieties, several hydroxyl groups, two tertiary amino groups, and one oxycarbonyl group [23] . Azithromycin launched in 1991 has become one of the most widely used antimicrobials [24] . Favorable pharmacological properties such as acid resistance, a short time to achieve peak concentrations with an up to 800-fold accumulation in phagocytes at the infection site, and long half-life allowing a large single oral dose to maintain bacteriostatic activity in the infected tissue for 4 days have contributed to the success of Azithromycin as an antibiotic [25, 26, 27] . Clinical studies have demonstrated that patients suffering from both intermittent and chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, e.g., cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), were treated using Azithromycin [28, 29] . Studies by some researchers, have shown that Azithromycin concentrations are highly accumulated in alveolar macrophages and lung which is 100% higher than that reported in plasma [23, 30] . Based on these studies, Azithromycin has been largely recommended for the treatment of some respiratory diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, some skin diseases, and otitis media [23, 31] . Among other reasons, this antibiotic formulated mainly as suspension or tablets is used in human and in veterinary medicine [23] . Kumar and Park, 2011 [32] reported Azithromycin to be a new chiral selector in capillary electrophoresis studies with multiple stereogenic centers. Due to the presence of different functional groups and multiple chiral centers, Azithromycin may undergo multiple interactions with the analyte enantiomeric molecules [32] , biological molecules and with the enzymes produce by COVID-19 for chiral recognition. Recently, the drugs stereochemistry has become a significant issue in the pharmaceutical industry. The stereoisomers interact differently with the macromolecules in the body, while waiting for the process of passive diffusion and transporters uptake into cell membranes which is equivalent for both moieties [33, 34, 35] . Imperi et al. 2014 [36] studied the antivirulence activity of Azithromycin in Pseudomona aeruginosa. In their studies, they showed that besides the growth-inhibiting activity of Azithromycin, Azithromycin has potent anti-inflammatory properties, as well as antivirulence activity on some intrinsically resistant bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antivirulence activity of this molecule mainly relies on its ability to interact with the ribosome, resulting in direct and/or indirect repression of specific subsets of genes involved in virulence, quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and intrinsic antibiotic resistance in the bacterium.Most drugs and drug-like molecules are likely to bind to multiple transporters, for example; drugs are known to interact with no fewer than six targets and many proteins are known to interact with hundreds of drugs to get the biophase [37] . Hence, the differences in active transport in serum secretion protein-binding, metabolism, and pharmacological effects for both Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin may have differences for achieving the biophase. Therefore, a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 is significantly more efficient for the elimination of the corona Virus as reported in literature [19] . Azithromycin has shown to be active in vitro against Zika and Ebola viruses [38, 39, 40] and to prevent severe respiratory tract infections when administrated to patients suffering from viral infection [41] . Hence, we can say that the molecules Hydxoxychloroquine and Azithromycin have many important biological characteristics including antibacterial, antifungal, immunomodulatory properties and antivirulence activity.From structural studies [42, 43, 44] and experimental studies [44, 45, 46] , SARS-CoV-2 appears to bind to the human receptor acethyl choline esterase 2 (ACE2) and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a functional polybasic (furin) cleavage site. Based on these studies, SARS-CoV-2 seem to have a receptor-binding domain that binds with high affinity to ACE2 from humans, ferrets, cats and other species with high receptor homology [ 42] . The SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure (Mpro) was first released to the Protein Data Bank, on March 2020 [47] . Proteases are central enzymes in the biology of humans and viruses, and several of them have become drug targets for anti-viral therapy as well as for the treatment of various diseases. There is a number of approved drugs that act as protease inhibitors [20] . SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a cysteine protease [48, 49] and it cleaves the viral polyprotein at no less than 11 sites [47] . It implies SARS-CoV-2 can easily bind with other molecules with high binding affinity. In this regard, we want to study the physico-chemical properties of the molecules Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin which are used for treatment of the COVID-19 which is ravaging the World. Furthermore, we want to determine the chemical descriptors of these molecules so as to see if they correlate with experimental and other theoretical results given in literature. We also want to determine the optoelectronic properties and spectra of these molecules. Some of the important electronic properties such as electrophilicity index, global hardness, chemical potential, ionization potential, electron affinity, dipole moment, polarizability, anisotropy and hyperpolarizability will be determine so as identify the nature of the pharmacological properties of these molecules [50, 51] . Most of these properties are use in quantitative structural analysis relationship (QSAR) and drug design [52, 53, 54] .The optimized molecular structures, structural properties, thermochemical properties, vibrational frequencies and electronic properties of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were calculated using the Gaussian 09 quantum chemical program [55] and the Gauss view visualization program [56] . Firstly, the optimized molecular structures of the molecules were performed using by 6-31þG(d,p) basis set with the WB97XD, O3LYP and B3LYP functional. Secondly, the vibrational frequencies were determined and their fundamental vibrational modes were characterized by their potential energy distribution. Finally, based on the optimized structures, some of physical and chemical properties were calculated.Quantum mechanical methods have proven to be very accurate in generating molecular geometries and in the prediction of relative conformational energies, and have become a useful tool in drug related computational research [57] . It has also found application in prediction of transition state properties, reactivity and enzyme mechanism studies, and in the investigations of drug-receptor and protein-ligand interactions and binding energies [57] . Furthermore, the use of these methods permit us to determine accurately a wide range of molecular descriptors including dipole moment, ionization potential and electron affinity, which are accessible only through quantum mechanical calculations [58, 59, 60, 61] . As a result, the molecular properties determined by DFT and other quantum mechanical method are often used in quantitative structure-activity and structure-property relationship models.3.1. Optimized molecular structure and geometric parameters of the molecules 3.1.1. Optimized molecular structures of Hydroxychloroquine and AzithromycinThe optimized molecular structures of the molecules Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin are reported in Figure 1 .The geometrical parameters of the molecules that is the bond lengths and bond angles of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin are given in Table S1 and Table S2 respectively of the supplementary materials. We observe a slight difference between the geometric parameters calculated with the B3LYP, O3LYP and wB97XD functional. The wB97XD functional differs significantly from the B3LYP and the O3LYP functional by the long range interaction which is taken into account in the geometric optimization. Thus, the addition of dispersion effects does not significantly influence the structural parameters of these molecules. In order to validate the optimized geometrical structure of Hydroxychloroquine, a comparison of some calculated properties is carried out with the experimental results of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate [62] . It should be noted that the geometric orientation of the groups of atoms of Hydroxychloroquine present in this research work is similar to that of Hydroxychloroquine found in Hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The calculated C-C, C-N, C-O and C-Cl bond lengths are in good agreement with the experimental values reported in literature. Similarly, the calculated bond angles are in good agreement with the experimental values reported in literature [62] . These results show that the optimized geometrical structure of Hydroxychloroquine is valid.Frequency analysis was performed to verify the stability of the optimized structures. Figure 2 shows the IR and Raman spectra of hydroxychloroquine and those of Azithromycin are shown in Figure 3 . As shown in these spectra, no imaginary frequencies were observed. This means that local minima was reached at the end of the optimization.The molecular descriptors of interest in our research are LUMO-HOMO energy band gap (E g ), ionization potential, electron affinity (EA), chemical potential (ϑ), chemical hardness (κ), chemical softness (S), electronegativity (δ), electrophilicity index (ω), dipole moment (μ tot ), average polarizability (α 0 ), related anisotropy (Δα) and first order hyperpolarizability (β 0 ) of the molecules which have been predicted using the wB97XD, O3LYP and B3LYP functional and are given in Table 1 . Whereas the dipole moment and polarizability represent information about charge distribution within the molecule, and therefore affect solvation and the molecule's membrane permeability, the ionization potential and electron affinity supply information regarding molecule's stability, which could also find a reflection in drug's metabolism [63] . Based on studies found in literature, which shows that increase in polarity, polarizability and the ability for hydrogen bonding strongly reduced brain penetration [64] which is in accord with our results. The polarity of the molecules, represented mostly by a dipole moment is the most important factor in inhibition activity, where the activity increases with increasing dipole moment. Equally, studies have shown that binding to an active pocket of some receptor depends on the electronic structure of the ligand, with a significant contribution from dipole moment and polarizability [65] . This may be due an electrostatic field generated by the receptor, and therefore would affect more strongly and interact with molecules which have a higher dipole moment or polarizability [66] . Moreover, drugs with greater dipole moment are less well absorbed while those with high electron affinity are most important for intestinal absorption [67] . From Table 1 , it is observed that the dipole moments values of these molecules are within the range 3D < μ < 5D which corroborate with μ values of most drugs given in literature [68] . From these μ values of the molecules, it implies the molecules have high absorption and are actively transported.We equally observed from Table 1 that the polarizability values of the molecules are less than 5 A o3 (1 au 3 ¼ (0.529) 3 Å 3 ) [69] which implies Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin have good membrane permeability as documented in literature [68] . Though polarizability, hyperpolarizability and hyper-order electric moments can be used to study the toxicity of drugs, polarizability is the main factor influencing the binding affinity of the drug. This can be explained by the fact that polarizability is a representation of molecular hydrophobicity [70] . Hence, the large values of the . The spectra lines in black represent the spectra obtained at the wB97XD, that in red for O3LYP and that in blue for the B3LYP. Table 1 . HOMO and LUMO molecular orbital energies, LUMO-HOMO Energy band gap (E g ), Ionization potential, electron affinity (EA), chemical potential (ϑ), chemical hardness (κ), chemical softness (S), electronegativity (δ), electrophilicity index (ω), dipole moment (μ tot ), average polarizability (α 0 ), related anisotropy (Δα) and first order hyperpolarizability (β 0 ) of the molecules. of state presented in Figures 6 and 7 are restricted to some occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals around the HOMO and LUMO molecular orbitals. Interestingly, the large energy gap of the molecules tell us that there are many hydrophilic interactions that could facilitate the binding with the receptors. This suggests that such hydrophilic interactions considerably impact the binding affinity of these drugs to the receptors. During the binding process, the HOMO of a certain drug and the LUMO with the adjacent residues could share the orbital interactions [5] . The large HOMO-LUMO energy gaps obtained in our studies also reveal to us that the molecules have high excitation energies and good stability [72] . The electron affinity which is used for the investigation of optimal bioavailability [73] and ionization potential which is related to the blood-brain barrier permeation [74] are also reported in Table 1 . The values of the IP and EA of the molecules are within the range of values given in literature for most drugs 1.5 eV < EA < 2 eV for EA and 6 eV < IP < 9 eV for the IP [68] . Molecules with high IP are equally characterized by high EA, showing that IP filter might not have any additional influence once the EA filter is applied. The values of the dipole moment, polarizability, ionization potential and electron affinity are approximately equal those reported in literature [68] . Hence, it is observed from our studies that most of the descriptors of interest presented above show association with some processes, including absorption, blood-brain barrier transport, binding and even toxicity.The Nonlinear optical properties such as dipole moment, average polarizability, related anisotropy, molar refractivity and first order hyperpolarizability of the molecules are also among the quantum chemical descriptors of the molecules. Nonlinear properties are very important in pharmacology. Indeed, the two main characteristics that govern interactions between drugs and biological molecules are spatial structure and electronic distribution. The polarity of a molecule comes from the non-homogeneous distribution of its electronic cloud. Polarizability refers to the ease with which the electronic cloud of a molecule can be moved under the effect of an electric field or another molecule. Therapeutic molecules can also be exploited for applications in nonlinear optics. The incorporation of an organic molecule into nonlinear optical materials is usually performed by comparing its dipole moment, average polarizability, hyperpolarizability value with that of a prototype molecule such as urea and 3-methyl 4-nitropyridine 1-oxide. The nonlinear properties such as dipole moment, average polarizability, first order hyperpolarizability and molar refractivity of hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin are reported in Table 1 . The large values of the dipole moment, average polarizability, first order hyperpolarizability and the molar refractivity of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin are much higher than that of urea [75, 76] and therefore these therapeutic molecule may also have good nonlinear optical applications.Electronic properties such as HOMO energy, LUMO energy and the HOMO-LUMO energy gap are also given in Table 1 . The energy gap is a very important index of stability with respect to external electromagnetic radiation. It also provides information on the conductive, semiconducting or insulating nature of a material. As shown in Figures 6 and 7 the energy gap of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin decreases slightly when we move from B3LYP to O3LYP level. However, when dispersion effects are introduced into electronic property calculations, a very large increase in the energy gap value is observed. The value obtained with the wB97XD is almost double the value obtained with the B3LYP which may be due to the dispersion effect at the level of the 6-31þG(d,p) . wB97XD functional. Several research works reported in the literature [75, 76, 77, 78, 79] have shown that the B3LYP functional gives good energy gap results. Thus, by increasing the accuracy of calculation, the energy gap would be lower as can be observed with the value obtained with the B3LYP functional compared to that obtained with the wB97XD functional. Even though the energy gap values are high for these molecules, it permit us to say that the molecules Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin may have semiconductor character with wide band gap and therefore a high stability index.The optoelectronic properties such as dielectric constant, electrical susceptibility and refractive index of the molecules are grouped in Table 2 . These properties were determined using formulae reported in the literature [75, 76, 77, 78, 79] . The values of the dielectric constant, the electric susceptibility and the refractive index computed with B3LYP functional are lower than the values obtained with the O3LYP and wB97XD functional for Hydroxychloroquine and vice versa for Azithromycin. The small value of the dielectric constant and the large values of the electric susceptibility and refractive index of hydroxychloroquine indicate that the molecules Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin can also be promising materials in the production of optoelectronic devices [80] .The enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, entropy and heat capacity at constant pressure of Hydroxychloroquine molecule are presented in Table 3 . The results presented in this table correspond to standard temperature and pressure conditions. The values obtained with B3LYP vary when we move to O3LYP or wB97XD functional. Temperature is a very important thermodynamic parameter in the production, storage and use of therapeutic molecules. For this reason, the effect of temperature on the calculated thermodynamic properties was examined. Figure 8 shows the variation curves of standard thermodynamic properties H, G, S and C p with temperature of the Hydroxychloroquine molecule while Figure 9 gives that of Azithromycin. The temperature range is limited from 175 K to 330 K so that the lower bound is close to the minimum temperature of the globe, while the upper bound is close to the maximum temperature of the globe. As shown in Figures 8 and 9 , the values of H, S and Cp increase, while the values of G decrease with increasing temperature. A key part of drug design and development is the optimization of molecular interactions between an engineered drug candidate and its binding target. Thermodynamic characterization provides information about the balance of energetic forces driving binding interactions and is essential for understanding and optimizing molecular interactions [81] . The crucial parameter describing the interaction of binding partners is the free energy where both the magnitude and sign describe the likelihood of biomolecular events occurring. The large negative values of G signifies that the molecules have higher affinity. The free energy is made of the enthalpy and the entropy. Enthalpy reflects heat differences between reactants and products of a binding reaction as a result of net bond formation or breakage, with negative values indicating a net release of heat energy with the resulting products at a lower energy level than the reactants [81] and variation of enthalpy with temperature at constant temperature gives the C p . Entropy reveals the ease of distribution of binding energy among molecular energy levels with positive values associated with an increase in disorder, and vice versa.A negative Cp indicates that the binding complex has a lower heat capacity than the free binding partners and, along with a positive entropy. This is typically associated with hydrophobic interactions and conformational changes upon binding [82, 83] . Hence, these results are very important thermochemical information in pharmacology. Based on structural and experiments studies, SARS-CoV-2 appears to bind to the human receptor acethyl choline esterase 2 (ACE2) and the spike protein of SARS CoV-2 has a functional polybasic (furin) cleavage site. From these studies, SARS-CoV-2 seem to have a receptor-binding domain that binds with high affinity to ACE2 from humans, ferrets, cats and other species with high receptor homology. Thus, due the highaffinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 and from the high binding affinity of both Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin implies that these molecules can easily bind together. Hence, the treatment of COVID-19 using Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin in some patients as single dose and their combination in patients with Corona virus resistance can be more effective. It is also observed from our studies that most of the descriptors of interest presented above show association with some processes, including absorption, blood-brain barrier transport, binding and even toxicity. From the parameters determined, we can conclude that these parameters together all affect the degree of the binding affinity of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin with the active protein sites to afford a certain degree of inhibition thereby preventing the entrance and formation of the viral particles. The calculations were carried out by relaxing the structures of the molecules.Equally, the key thermodynamic parameters of the molecules are the binding free energy (G), enthalpy (H), entropy (S) and heat capacity change (Cp). G indicates the likelihood and extent of biomolecular interactions and is composed of H and S components, which define the molecular forces governing the binding process. It is the balance of these forces that determines the overall thermodynamics of molecular interactions.Furthermore, from the large values of the dipole moment, average polarizability, first order hyperpolarizability and the molar refractivity of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin, we are tempted to say that these therapeutic molecule may also have good nonlinear optical applications and may equally have semiconductor character with wide band gap due to the large energy gap.Furthermore, from the small value of the dielectric constant, the large values of the electric susceptibility and refractive index of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin indicate that these molecules can also be promising materials in the production of optoelectronic devices.Author contribution statement",Cameroon,first author,2020-08-11,08
