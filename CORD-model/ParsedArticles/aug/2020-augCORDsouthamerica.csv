3c17928c4da11514aae4dd5f58e306d530de1e86,In a Pandemic Are We More Religious? Traditional Practices of Catholics and the COVID-19 in Southwestern Colombia,"Recent studies on religious behaviours suggest the correlation between fear and beliefs. The literature exposes two causal links: fear motivates religious faith and then the last one mitigates fear (Donovan 1994; Ellis and Wahab 2013; Jong et al. 2013; Jong et al. 2017; Wen 2010) . The former has to do with a feeling of helplessness in the face of annihilation itself. Hence the answer is an ""effort"", ""imagination"" (Hayden 2003; Hepburn 1992; Trevors and Saier 2010) , ""illusion"" (Becker 1973: 202) or ""desire"" that encourages the idea of immortality, be it literal or symbolic (Cicirelli 2002; Dechesne et al. 2003; Unamuno 1989) . At the base of this notion, there is generally the affirmation of the existence of supernatural beings, the practice of certain rituals and the regulation of behaviours through moral codes. The latter indicates that all this religious experience mitigates the anxiety produced by the awareness of one's own finitude. Thus, religious people would enjoy lower levels of anxiety thanks to their rites, norms, community ties and belief system (Jackson et al. 2017; Jong et al. 2017; Wen 2012) .Although there is empirical evidence of the previous relationship (Daaleman and Dobbs 2010; Harding et al. 2005) , other proofs show that beliefs can also increase fear of death (Homans 1941) . For example, the feeling of eternal damnation could arouse the fear of dying. From another perspective, the theory of the apprehension of death (DA) stresses that death does not always produce the same fear. This response is not directly related to the religiosity of a person but to the individual sensation of increased pain and decreased pleasures in life (Ellis et al. 2013; Falkenhain and Handal 2003) . Something similar happens with other research that indicates that although there is a linkage between anxiety/fear of death and religiosity, this connection is weak. According to these inquiries, one of the errors of the studies that defend the previous correlation is that their samples do not proportionally include religious and non-religious interviewees, as well as that they do not consider gender or age differences.With regard to religion as a form of coping, we could say that it helps to combat immediate challenges, imagine and plan diverse futures, and resist to a personal and social state of permanent insecurity (Ano and Vasconcelles 2005; Bentzen 2019; Norenzayan and Hansen 2006; Pargament 2001) . Religious narratives often make it possible to think beyond the current conditions of space and time and accept the emergence of multiple worlds, senses and worldviews. Under these conditions, people can ""imagine"" realities or develop meanings that can limit damage or curb the sense of risk of an adverse event. However, these ""imagined beings"" may not necessarily be ""gods or spirits"" (Meerten 2009: 198) . Societies have created a series of resources to deal with this instability and fallibility throughout history also to hide, normalize or distract people from their condition of finitude. 1 Notwithstanding, most of the time, these inventive processes also recreate ancient mythologies. These stories generally recall the struggle between life and death, good and evil and chaos and order. Hence, hostile events can ""reenchant"" the world (Maffesoli 2004; Weber 1963) or at least allow religious rhetoric to be used as the property of the public who uses it as tales from a still-near past. This procedure is done to talk about interrogations that are not alien, but neither are they identifiable with what is literally said (Certeau 2006: 197) . Hence, religion functions as a representation of certain social problems or as cultural and ethical fortress of structures that lack this, or it simply works as support for a certain power.Consequently, the global pandemic of COVID-19 unpredictably re-confronts people with the instability and chaos (Bentzen 2019) . Probably, in this scenario, we can observe how believers use religion to face unexpected and sudden adversity (Bentzen 2020; Pargament 2001; Smith et al. 2000) . 2 For example, in the USA, according to a report by the Pew Research Center (2020), more than half of adults said that they have prayed for an end to the spread of the coronavirus. Two-thirds of Catholics (68%) also said that they have prayed for the end to the outbreak. According to this survey, more women than men said that they have prayed for an end to the spread of the disease. Older people are more likely than younger adults to say that they have prayed for an end to the virus. Fifty-seven per cent of those who claim to attend religious services, generally at least once or twice a month, said that they have watched religious services online or on TV.Albeit worship places have been closed preventively, religious services have been transferred to the internet quickly and efficiently. Churches have multiplied several offline and online initiatives to overcome the disturbance caused by the coronavirus. These proposals include a variety of activities through various media, especially through the internet: rites and prayers, educational courses, messages, sermons, religious music concerts, practical information on health and social actions in favour of the neediest (Campbell 2020) . These actions have not been exclusively carried out by the leaders of religious institutions but also by many faithful. Consequently, we must ask, do believers, particularly Catholics, intensify their religious practices by facing a threatening event such as COVID-19 and by doubling the religious offer?Religious activities transferred to a virtual environment are not a new phenomenon (Campbell 2012) . Online religious studies have explored this topic from different perspectives and contexts: ritual transformation, virtual temples, online religious communities, etc. (Baesler and Chen 2013; Campbell and DeLashmutt 2014; Campbell and Vitullo 2016; Cowan 2005; Hutchings 2011 ). However, the transfer of churches to the internet as a ""pragmatic response"" (Campbell 2020: 10) to this cultural change does not exhaust the diversity of religious practices during the pandemic. 3 The religious experience is usually more polymorphic. Although some academic reports point out the negative effects of virtual participation in religions that accentuate the sense of community and embodiment of their practices, the growth of religious exchange through the internet is evident (Bare 2020) . For example, recent research shows that one of the most searched for prayers on google in March 2020 was the ""coronavirus prayer"", a prayer in which believers ask God for protection against the coronavirus, strength to resist and thanksgiving for the efforts of health professionals. The same research indicates that prayer searches increased more in the poorest, most insecure and most unequal countries, although these countries are also the most religious (Bentzen 2020). 2 The use of religion in this context is not only personal but also institutional. For example, some interfaith leaders prayed together for salvation from the pandemic in Israel (April 22). Pope Francis has appeared in public several times praying for the end of the pandemic. In sum, in different parts of the world, we have seen religious leaders multiplying activities-with some eccentricities-to comfort their faithful. See Ecuadorian bishop bless people from a helicopter.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/watch-ecuador-bishop-deliversblessing-by-helicopter/videoshow/75075273.cms 3 The transfer of Catholic churches to the internet is included in the concept of Ritual Online or Religion Online. Currently, most digital religion studies focus on strictly virtual communities and rituals (Online-Ritual -Online-Religion). See Miczek 2008: 145. Therefore, although these religious transfers to the Internet play an important role as ways of coping with the pandemic, appreciating the transformations in the religious field also involves examining the ways in which believers interpret the pandemic, the information they have about it and the sources that they consult to know its evolution. This is the first element that I will discuss in this essay. Second, I explore changes in Catholics' religious practices, not only with reference to their institutionalized rituals but to individual or private exercises of their faith, as well as the means and contexts in which they are performed. In this sense, interpretative frameworks and religious practices could be taken as an epiphenomenon of the society or group that I am analyzing because spirituality answers the questions of a time and never answers them in any other way than in the same terms of such questions (Certeau 2006: 48) . Finally I propose some conclusions and questions for future researches.This study was conducted with Catholics residing in the Department of Nariño, Colombia, a region that borders Ecuador. 4 Its rather rugged relief is a symbol of a heterogeneous population, made up of numerous ethnic groups, and also of its historical isolation. Despite its diversity, Nariño has suffered in recent years from the scourge of armed violence, drug trafficking and poverty. On the other hand, although Catholicism has been prevalent in this area of the country, this population is undergoing a series of important transformations, which are particularly evident in the religious field through the combination of traditional and modern elements (Villamarin 2019). These conditions offer an ideal setting for an exploratory study of the impact of COVID-19 on the religious practices of Catholics.The sample of this research included people over 18 who declare themselves Catholics and who currently reside in the Department of Nariño. Considering the limitations imposed by the coronavirus pandemic and with the interest of saving time, financial resources and energy, the data collection was performed through a convenience sampling strategy based on a non-reasonable and non-probabilistic choice. The questionnaire was designed through a google form that was shared on various Facebook pages. 5 In total, 1192 people responded to the survey during the month of May.Even if the results are not easily generalizable due to the strategy through which the sample was selected, this procedure has served to obtain information promptly and at a low economic cost. This qualitative research uses an exploratory-descriptive design that aims to discover the incidence of this pandemic on the religiosity of Catholics in this region of Colombia. Predefining the categories in a comprehensive and representative way allows us to specify the fundamental elements through which these people create an image of the pandemic and to identify changes in their religious practices. Despite the fact that the questions do not completely exhaust the scope of the subject in question, grouping them into two sections and having pre-established options allow us to measure statistically with some precision the various dimensions of this phenomenon. The analysis and interpretation of the data are intended to verify the intensification of religious practices in relation to the threatening conditions produced by COVID-19. The relevant results will be highlighted trying to delimit what challenges emerge for Catholicism in the future (Tables 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16) .The distribution of the sample into structural categories is as follows: (a) sex: women (635), men (555), other (2); (b) age: 18-29 years (139), 30-49 years (565), 50-64 years (255), over 65 years (9); (c) residential area: rural (67), urban (452), city, more than 100,000 habitants. (421); (d) educational level: primary education (7), high school (457), technical education (195), university (533); (e) marital status: married (461), separated/divorced (58), free union (126), single (523), widowhood (24); (f) labour status: unemployed/pensioned, disabled (23), students (212), home (128), day labourer (3), worker-private employee (permanent) (289), worker-government employee (191), employer (35), own-account worker (311).Among the interviewees, there is a great consensus of opinion on the evidence of the pandemic. About 91.78% maintain that it is a virus that produces various affections in the human body, while only 3.78% affirm that it is an invention of politicians. Although, a relative majority (54.87%) indicates that COVID-19 is a reaction of nature to abuse perpetrated by human being, there is a tendency to attribute its origin to a nonnatural element: created in a laboratory (49, 58%), a global conspiracy (37.58%) and a strategy of the pharmaceutical companies to earn money (27.01%). In relation to the religious and existential dimension of the pandemic, 30.03% believe that it is being part of the prophecies of the end of the world, 25.67% that it is divine punishment and The predominant mass media for our population is a traditional channel, the television (82%); however, Facebook appears second (72%) and then WhatsApp (52%). Radio reaches 33% and newspapers and magazines (online) 29%.Most of the sample (72%) prefers to take advice the information that comes from the authorities and government institutions (national, regional or local). Health authorities Newspapers and magazines (printed) 1%Radio 33%Television 82%Facebook 72%Twitter 8%WhatsApp 52%Youtube 9% Table 3 What sources do you consult to stay informed about COVID-19? You can select up to three options % Government authorities and institutions (national, regional or local) 72%Scientists or academicians 18%Journalists 32%Leaders of opinion 3%Relatives and friends 21%Influencers 0.5% (49%) as well as journalists (32%) are also important sources. Finally, friends and family (21%) are also consulted about the pandemic and with a lower percentage, scientists or academicians (18%). With regard to the priority of people during this period of confinement, most women (66.61%) select health as first option in relation to 21.26% of men. On the contrary, they opt for work and economic income (67.57%) and women 1.73%. Another important item for women is the relationship with God (17.17%), for men only 4.68%.Hope is the most recurrent attitude for 43.15% of women compared with 10.81% of men. In the opposite direction, 44.86% of men selected fear and 32.97% anxiety respecting to 23.15% and 16.85% of women, respectively. On the other hand, 14.02% of women said that they are anxious along with 7.75% of men.Women participated in the mass more frequently, for example, around 45.20% of them did it once a week, compared with 15.50% of the men. With quarantine, women's daily participation intensifies slightly (from 19.84 to 21.10%), although the percentage of those who did not (from 4.88 to 12.60%) also increases. Among men, participation decreases: those who participated once a month (42.70%) are now only 4.14% and the percentage of those who did not participate grew from 1.62 to 36.40%. The rosary seems to be an activity practiced sporadically by women. Roughly 28.98% pray it once a month and 26.61% very rarely. Contrary to 72.25% of men who do not and 9.73% who pray it very rarely. During pandemic, women have intensified their prayer several days a week (from 17.95 to 38.27%). The variation between men is minimal (5.59 to 10.99%). The percentage among men who do not pray it remains unchanged.About 86.14% of the women prayed all or several days a week in relation to 25.05% of the men and 39.82% of the seconds do it once a week and 32.07% very rarely. There are no significant changes with the pandemic for these two groups.Reading the Bible is also not a recurring practice for our interviewees. Around 28.82% of women did it suddenly before quarantine and 71.17% of men did not. During quarantine, there is a small growth in women's reading: All or several days a week (12.28 to 17.48%) and once a week (16.54 to 18.27%). In this group, the number of those who do not read it also grows (16.69 to 21.26%). Among men, there are minor variations.The study of Catholic doctrine is a not very frequent activity among Catholics in this region. About 75.68% of men said that they never do it in relation to 31.65% of women. There are no significant changes during quarantine; in fact, the percentage of non-study among women increases a little (31.65-38.27%). This devotional practice is more common among women. About 24.09% of them did it rarely, 19.84% all or several days a week, 20.47% once a week and 23.15% once a month. Among men, 45.95% did it sporadically and 38.02% had not. With quarantine, this action is intensified in women in two ways: several or every day a week, it grows from 19.84 to 31.34% and those who do not from 12.44 to 18.90%. Among men, the option once a week increases from 4.86 to 42.16%.This religious activity is not widely practiced by men: roughly 9.37% do it once a month, 8.11% very rarely and 75.68% do not do it. The percentages among women are different: 33.70% of them do it once a month, 29.61% very rarely, 10.08% all or several times a week, 11.50% once a week and 15.12% of them did not. During the quarantine, the figures for men do not vary significantly. Among women, it increases a little: all or several times a week (15.43%), once a week (14.65%) and those who do not it (23.94%).The means chosen to carry out the above religious practices are still the most traditional. However, while 67.71% of men prefer television, 31.52% of women choose this medium. About 34.01% of women choose the Internet (social networks and other The usual way of practicing some religious action is together with some relatives (54.28%). However, the percentage of those who prefer to do it alone is representative (36.83%). Regarding to this option, 41.08% of men choose it compared with 33.07% of women.Most men are oriented to practice the religious acts so that God frees them from the coronavirus (39.77%) and for fear (30.57%). Instead, women do so because these actions give them tranquillity and strength (65.04%) and because they identify themselves as convinced Catholics (19.15%).Although 61.58% of the sample agrees with the closing of the churches, 32.80% think otherwise. About 67.87% of men are in favour of this measure compared with 54.23% of women. Those who answered no were asked to specify their motivation. Most of the answers can be grouped as follows: we have nowhere to meet Jesus; in churches we find peace; and they are sacred places. Before analyzing changes in the religious practices of Catholics, I have examined their relationship to this pandemic in terms of information and reactions. The first observation that emerges is the notorious consensus of the interviewees when accepting the consequences that this virus produces in people's health. This unanimity is not as strong when considering the possible causes of the pandemic. The percentage of those who accept the non-natural origin of the virus is considerable, as well as those who religiously reinterpret this crisis.Men are more likely to accept conspiracy and apocalyptic visions. However, academic training and youth favour the opposite trend. This tendency is linked to the fact that the most recurrent attitude among men is fear and helplessness in the face of the pandemic, and their primary concern is employment and incomes. The opposite occurs with women; they are not so in agreement with these interpretations and privilege their health, the relationship with God and claim to have hope as a fundamental attitude during quarantine.Therefore, it is important to inquire about people's vision of the world. This set of Catholic believers does not have the same priorities, does not react the same way and does not have a single image of the virus. Hence, the response to the virus even within Catholics is not univocal. These images not only come from a particular religious tradition but are modelled by the media and the sources that they often consult. In this Table 12 How often did/do the following practices before/during the quarantine? Make a promise or sacrifice to ask for a favour or grace case, it is clear that not consulting specialized sources such as scientific journals or the opinion of academics can strengthen misconceptions about the virus. What kinds of fears do the pandemic raise and how does each influence religious practices? What type of information privileges the religious interpretation of this phenomenon? What kind of information do they find on television, Facebook and WhatsApp? What social factors contribute to interpretive differentiation by gender?The hypothesis that an unpredictable and adverse event such as the pandemic may intensify religiosity in Catholics is not supported by the findings of this research. Those who consider religious practices in general do not take into account their diversity. As we will see later, the type of religious activities could determine the frequency of participation. Furthermore, it would be important to analyze how the priorities of these people during the pandemic may or may not be linked to the intensification or decrease of their religious practices.We wanted to avoid an instrumental interpretation of religion when considering various religious practices. According to this vision, many religious institutions evaluate the commitment of their faithful according to their participation in public rituals and official meetings. The problem with this approach is that membership in a religion is primarily defined in place-based institutional terms. The transfer of churches to the Internet is still based on this traditional vision of community. This notion excludes not only the acceptance of the concept of community as a dynamic and changing process, structured with multiple connections and determined by the personal needs and choices of its members, but also the set of religious practices that individuals carry out in domestic groups or individually (Campbell 2020) . Comparing participation in various religious practices before and during confinement has allowed us to find basically four things: First, private or personal religious practices have a greater degree of intensification during the pandemic with regard to institutionalized rituals such as mass. Second, the intensification of some religious practices is a more visible phenomenon in women than in men. Third, both women and men who are not very practicing tend to abandon these practices during quarantine, in other words, pre-pandemic religious behaviour functions as a preacher about increasing or decreasing religious actions during pandemic. Fourth, simple and brief devotional practices are more frequent than those that require a religious official, connect online or meet in community. Similarly, religious actions of prayer prevail over those that are formative, such as reading the Bible or studying Catholic doctrine.On the other hand, men prefer traditional media, such as family gatherings or television, to participate in some religious celebrations during compulsory isolation. In that same direction, they privilege instant and individual religious actions, such as lighting a candle. On the other hand, although men are the ones who most claim to be afraid of the pandemic, there does not seem to be an increase in religious practices among them. Hence, compared with women, they mostly accept the closure of churches.In sum, there is no strong intensification of religious practices during this time of pandemic, despite the fact that the religious offer both on the Internet and by other means of communion has multiplied. How much does the long duration of the pandemic have to do with these changes? Is religious discourse losing its validity in this area of Colombia or does popular practice still prevail over institutional practices? How much could the crisis caused by COVID-19 affect the hegemony of religious discourses and practices, especially those of Catholicism?It has been generally accepted that events such as COVID-19 generate a greater religious response. The data provided shows that many of the practicing believers do it this way. The non-intensification of these religious practices in many Catholics makes us suppose that there are other forms of coping that would influence the decrease in religious participation. However, it should not be assumed that this process is exclusively one of recomposition. In other words, people not only have religious practices to regain their world view and maintain a sense of calm in the presence of some looming threat. This situation can also lead believers to break certain conventions of thinking, feeling and practicing religion, even away from this system of interpretation and action. Crisis, as many academics explained, not only allow a rapid change in the practical and pragmatic aspects of religious commitment, which is what we have discussed above, but also open a space to consider what aspects of beliefs and practice they represent the core of your religious identity and community, but also to get away from that core and get closer to another (Osteen and Campbell 2020) . Beyond the theories that try to define whether religious services on the Internet can be considered rites and if they constitute churches, our questions are as follows: What will happen to religious practices after the pandemic? Will they return in masses to places of worship or will there be a decline? What will happen to the other religious practices? Probably and as Peter asserts, the ""new normal"" means that there may never be a complete return to the business of religion as it was before, depending on the event and location (Osteen and Campbell 2020: 59) .This analysis is quite modest with respect to offering certain answers on the changes in the religious practices of Catholics during the COVID-19 pandemic. I consider, however, that it can offer several guidelines towards more systematic and rigorous research on the above questions. I conclude with a series of questions and hypotheses that, in our opinion, could be fruitfully studied in the future.In the first line, the religious interpretations of the pandemic could be studied: its ways and channels of reproduction and its relationship with daily care practices and with political treatments of the problem. For example, i saw some indication that not consulting specialized sources (i.e. sharing information not verified by a specialist through family networks like Facebook and WhatsApp) may increase apocalyptic and religious interpretations of the virus. This is not a new discovery since each individual in their innermost circles receives and transmits unconfirmed information, that is, each group usually reinforces its own vision of the world. This will help us gain certainty about this dynamic, in the context of religious accounts and social media.Similarly, i hypothesized that the propensity to share these views of the pandemic could be correlated with older people and low levels of education. Testing this hypothesis would certainly show the old idea that lack of education is a breeding ground for the transmission of Manichean and plotting ideas. However, it would be interesting to analyze how religious leaders respond to these representations and discourses.A third group of questions refers to possible contrasts between genders. I saw some evidence that men behave religiously differently than women. Likewise, their vision of the pandemic, priorities and reactions during this time are diverse. This could be a culture matter, namely, that religious sensibilities have been constructed intersectionally with gender roles or a simple matter of skills. Focused inquiry into these differences could help us gain greater clarity.Fourth, i find that there is a de-intensification of religious practices during the pandemic, which is greater in institutionalized rites than in personal ones. I observe that people who practice certain religious acts with little regularity tend to abandon it during this period. Why do they do it? What will happen after the pandemic? Is there a break with your religious field of reference?Finally, there are two broader theoretical questions. First is the question of the hegemony of Catholic religious discourse in a post-pandemic environment. As i observed in our literature review, unpredictable events suggest an increase in religious behaviour as a form of coping. If this is not happening, at least in the study population; what is changing? Does the pandemic reveals the current loss of power of Catholicism or makes evident its constant inability to regulate the practices of its faithful? How can the Catholic Church, the epitome of a society in retreat, prosper in this period of crisis? Second is the question of the use or creation of new forms of coping. If the pandemic creates a sense of vulnerability in people or arouses awareness of finitude in them, how are people reacting? What coping or avoidance strategies are they using? This question and the consideration of the modes of living the quarantine (new forms of connection, devices etc.) have a direct relationship with the style of societies that are emerging at the moment and the discourses that govern them.Conflict of Interest The author declares that he has no conflict of interest.",Colombia,abstract,2020-08-31,8
5231a243889d9862b936337a17158ec2ef3b7b1f,"Spatiotemporal dynamic of COVID-19 mortality in the city of São Paulo, Brazil: shifting the high risk from the best to the worst socio-economic conditions","Deaths from COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), are considered avoidable because some collective and individual measures can prevent infection and because appropriate health assistance greatly reduces death risks. Nevertheless, the risk of dying extremely varies according to some individual and geographic risk factors resulting in health inequity observed in several parts of the world (Maroko et al., 2020; Wang and Tang, 2020) since the beginning of the pandemic. In Brazil, COVID-19 was first reported in the city of São Paulo on February 25, 2020 (Souza et al., 2020) . Until August 3, four months after the first reported death, the disease had already resulted in 2,733,677 confirmed cases and 94,104 deaths in the country (Brasil. Ministério da Saúde, 2020a) . At the moment, the United States of America and Brazil are the epicentre of the disease.Brazil is the fifth country in the world in territory and population, classified as an uppermiddle-income economy (The World Bank, 2020) . Almost 60% of the Brazilian population is concentrated in 6% of the big cities among which São Paulo is the largest. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) guarantees healthcare for all citizens and thousands of foreigners residing or passing through the country (Santos, 2018) . Despite this universal and whole care, geographic differences in mortality rates across areas have been observed in the national and intra-urban scales. Spatial heterogeneity in population features, such as age, underlying health, household densities, partial lack of sanitation, socio-economic status, contact networks and, mobility patterns (Yang et al., 2020) have emerged as potential propellants of the spatiotemporal spread of the disease.Since the beginning of the pandemic, mapping the disease occurrence and spread has become a powerful tool to track and support measures to slow down the infection transmission (Kamel Boulos and Geraghty, 2020) around the world and at the local scale. Web-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have allowed near real-time monitoring using map-centric dashboards (Early Alert, 2020; Johns Hopkins University, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020) . Despite advances in the use of technology to reduce the impact of the pandemic, little is known about the spatiotemporal patterns of mortality from COVID-19, especially in an intra-urban setting. Studying the spatiotemporal dynamic of deaths instead of cases may help better evaluate inequity. All the health disadvantages accumulated over decades of life due to any kind of deprivation increases the risk of dying from COVID-19. The lack of a robust spatiotemporal analysis undermines the comprehension of the mitigation strategies to potentialize the disease-control efforts. Thus, this study aims to unveil the spatiotemporal dynamic of COVID-19 mortality at a fine granular level in the city of São Paulo considering the socio-economic context of the population. This approach may shed light on the urgent need for solid evidence on health inequities during the COVID-19 outbreak.This ecological study, based on COVID-19 secondary mortality data, was delineated in the city of São Paulo, state of São Paulo, Brazil (Figure 1) , where live an estimated population of 11,869,660 inhabitants whose distribution over the area produces a mean demographic density of 7,803 inhabitants/km², in 2020 (Fundação SEADE, 2020) .When using COVID-19 data, underreporting is always an issue that deserves attention, even for mortality. To minimize the effect of possible sub notification in deaths, we analyzed confirmed and suspected deaths from COVID-19. Thus, death data comprised confirmed and suspected deaths occurred between March 15 and June 13, 2020, extracted on June 18 from the Mortality Information System (SIM), Mortality Information Improvement Program (PRO-AIM) from the Epidemiology and Information Coordination (CEInfo) of the São Paulo Health Secretariat (SMS-SP). Confirmed deaths due to coronavirus infection corresponded to the code B34.2 (coronavirus infection disease), according to the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Suspected deaths are coded as U04.9 (severe acute respiratory syndrome).The places of residence of the COVID-19 deaths were geocoded by CEInfo/SMS-SP according to the residence place using its databases and Google Maps API geocoding script that uses public places as the base map. Resulting geocoded addresses were validated comparing the road or ZIP code where the record was allocated with the original ZIP code. Geocoded data were assigned to the 310 sample areas of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), for which demographic and socio-economic census data are available (IBGE, 2010) . We considered these areas as the spatial units in our models (Figure 1) .The records, including the basic cause, age, sex, the date of the death according to the epidemiological week (EW) (Brasil. Ministério da Saúde, 2020b) and the sample areas of residence were obtained by formal request to the São Paulo Electronic Information System (e-SIC, protocol 48567), whose data information is hosted in an open session, on the municipality's transparency portal for public access (São Paulo. Prefeitura, 2020) . Here, we named this information as e-SIC database. It was not necessary to submit this study to an Ethics Committee because we did not have access to the names and addresses. Thus, the use of secondary data, without personal identification and in the public domain, dispenses with the need for prior approval by the Ethics Committee on Research with Human Beings as per Resolution No. 510/2016, of the National Health Council (Guerriero, 2016) .We also used the data available in Tabnet-DataSUS and named this information as Tabnet database. Tabnet is an app, available in <https://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/saude/tabnet/>, provided by the Municipal Health Department of São Paulo and developed by DataSUS. This app provides free access (to any user) to population databases and to the database information systems of SUS, such as the Mortality Information System (SIM), which is supplied by the Secretariat's Program (PRO-AIM). Through the Tabnet app, it is possible to perform tabulation and crossing several variables of interest such as epidemiological week, sex, age group, and specific cause. The databases are updated periodically.As a measure of the socio-economic context of the population, since individual-level data are not available in the mortality database, we used a socio-economic index especially elaborated for health research. The GeoSES index (Barrozo et al., 2020) was developed using Principal Component Analysis, starting with 41 variables. The index conceives the socio-economic context preserving seven dimensions based on the theoretical background (Duncan et al., 2002; Krieger et al., 1997) : education, mobility, poverty, wealth, income, segregation, and deprivation of resources and services. The index was defined in three scales: national, Federative Unit and, intra-municipal. Figure 1 presents GeoSES for the sample areas of the city of São Paulo, showing that the areas with the best socio-economic conditions (GeoSES equal to or close to 1) are located in the central part of the city and that these conditions deteriorate towards the periphery, where they reach the worst levels (GeoSES equal to or close to -1). It has been shown to be useful in studies of mortality from avoidable causes of deaths (from 5 to 74 years old) due to interventions at the Brazilian health system in the national scale and, mortality from circulatory system diseases in the city of São Paulo (Barrozo et al., 2020) .We used the information of confirmed (B34.2) and suspected (U04.9) death from COVID-19 available for the entire city of São Paulo from EW 11th to 29th of Tabnet database to calculate the weekly mortality rates of confirmed (B34.2), suspected (U04.9) and total (B34.2 + U04.9) COVID-19 deaths. We did the same using the e-SIC database from EW 11th to 24th. We exclude from the information e-SIC database the COVID-19 deaths occurred on 25th because the data from this week was incomplete (it was extracted on 18th June 2020 and included only part of EW 25th). These rates were obtained dividing the respective numbers of deaths in each week by the total population of the city and presented as death per 100,000 inhabitants-week. In the sequence, we obtained the mortality rates for confirmed, suspected, and total COVID-19 deaths by sex and age for the entire period from EW 11th to 24th using Tabnet and e-SIC databases. These comparisons between the data of these two sources were useful to evaluate how complete was the data we used for the spatial and spatiotemporal analysis. For the calculation of the mortality rates by sex and age, we excluded the data without this information.As only one suspected COVID-19 death occurred in EW 11th, we restricted our spatial and spatiotemporal analysis from EW 12th to 24th and spatial or spatiotemporal architecture was considered in all the models we performed. We first modelled the confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths using spatiotemporal models only with the intercept and random effects accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelation and the interaction between them. The spatial dependence was modelled considering a Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) model with two components representing the spatially structured and non-structured random effects (Blangiardo et al., 2013; Blangiardo and Cameletti, 2015) . These two components were considered independent one for another and followed the parametrization proposed by Simpson et al. (2017) . The temporal dependence was modelled by a non-structured random effect and a structured random effect given by a random walk autoregressive model of firstorder (RW1). The interaction between space and time was modelled considering spatial and temporal non-structured random effects (Blangiardo and Cameletti, 2015) .The number of confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths by EW and sample areas were modelled using Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson probability distributions in a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. We considered the expected confirmed and total COVID-19 death for each EW and spatial unit as an off-set in these models. The expected deaths were estimated by indirect standardization taking into account the age and sex structure of each sample area and the mortality rates for the entire study period and city. This, therefore, enables us to interpret the outcomes of our analysis as relative risks (RR) concerning the mortality rates for the entire period and city. We obtained, from these models, the temporal and spatiotemporal RR. Subsequently, we introduced the socio-economic covariate (GeoSES) in these models and obtained the corresponding RR.Finally, we used a spatial approach to model the confirmed and total COVID-19 death by EW to evaluate the role of the socio-economic covariate in each one of the EW. For doing this, we considered spatial models with intercept, BYM spatial random effects, and the GeoSES as a covariate. The expected COVID-19 deaths were obtained in a similar way for the spatiotemporal models, but considering the entire city mortality rates for each EW, allowing us to interpret the RR concerning the entire city mortality rates for each EW.We did our models in a Bayesian context using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach (Rue et al., 2009) . We selected our best models using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) so that the best-adjusted models were those with lower DIC values (Blangiardo and Cameletti, 2015) . We used non-informative priors for the fixed effects and priors with penalized complexity for the precision parameters of the random effects (Simpson et al., 2017) . We ran our models in the R environment (R Core Team, 2019).We found 14,753 confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths in the Tabnet database, from EW 11 th to 29 th , and 10,760 in the e-SIC database, from EW 11 th to 25 th , in the city of São Paulo. We removed 67 deaths from the e-SIC database because they were referent to the EW 25 th which was not completed when the data were extracted. Figure 2 shows the mortality rates for COVID-19 for both sources of data, considering the confirmed, suspected and total deaths. The curves from the e-SIC database are similar to the curves with data from the Tabnet database and the differences among these curves in EW 23 th and 24 th are related to a delay in the notification of the COVID-19 deaths. Table 1 shows the numbers and mortality rates of confirmed, suspected, and total COVID-19 deaths obtained from e-SIC and Tabnet databases from EW 11 th to 24 th by sex and age. To build Table 1 , we excluded six deaths with ignored age and three deaths with ignored sex from the 10,693 (10,760 -67) death in the e-SIC database and we excluded six ignored age and four deaths with ignored sex from the 11,098 deaths in the Tabnet database. We can observe that mortality was higher for males and that it increases as age increases, corresponding to 460.9 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (in fourteen weeks) for people aged 60 years or older. This pattern of increased mortality as age increases is also observed when making a greater stratification among people aged or older, as shown in supplementary material 1. Table 1 shows that the data we used to build our spatial and spatial models (e-SIC database) is close to the municipality's official data on the pandemic (Tabnet-DataSUS). For doing these models we excluded, from the e-SIC database, a suspected COVID-19 death occurred on EW 11 th (the first one in the city) and nine with ignored sex or age and 68 whose addresses were not geocodified and did not have the sample area codes. We achieved a high geocoding success rate of 99.3%, once 10,619 records were geocoded using address data out of a total of 10,692 (excluding the first death in EW 11 th ). Of these, 5,837 refer to ICD B34.2 (99.4% of the initial total of 5,875 records) and 4,782 to ICD U04.9 (99.2% of the total of 4,817 records).During this period, 30.6 and 17.4% of the sample areas had zero confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths and, therefore. The DIC values of the spatiotemporal models with Poisson probability distribution were lower than the value of zero-inflated Poisson distribution (Supplementary material 2) . Considering each week separately, the amount of zeros deaths in the sample areas varied from 6.1 to 85.5%. The DIC values for the spatial models with Poisson probability distribution were, in most cases, lower than the values with zero-inflated Poisson distribution, and, in the cases that this did not occur, they are very close to each other (Supplementary material 3). From these results, we considered the best-adjusted spatial and spatiotemporal models that ones with the Poisson distribution.First, we present the results of the models with spatiotemporal architecture only with intercept. We have, in Figure 3 , the temporal RR from EW 12 th to 24 th , where we can see that maximum RR occurred on EW 20 th for the total COVID-19 deaths and in EW 23 for the confirmed ones in our study period. These results, even adjusted for the temporal autocorrelation, are similar to those presented in Figure 2 . Considering the data presented in Figures 2 and 3 , the apparent pattern of the temporal curves shows a tendency to stabilize, but a new rise in mortality cannot be ruled out soon. Figures 4 and 5 show the posterior means of the spatiotemporal RR for the sample areas and EW, respectively, for confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths. Apart from the fact that the RR is greater for the total deaths than the confirmed ones, the distribution of the RR is similar between them, following the behaviour of the temporal RR. In the first two EW, the sample areas presented lower values of RR that increased over time. However, this increase occurred with greater intensity in the peripheral areas.Next, we performed the spatiotemporal models, now taking into account the socioeconomic variable (GeoSES). Table 2 shows the spatiotemporal RR and the 95% credibility intervals for GeoSES obtained for the models with confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths. In both models, it is noted that the high socio-economic level was shown to protect against the risk of dying from COVID-19 throughout the study period. Thus, the increase of one unit in the socioeconomic indicator represented a 25% reduction in the risk of dying from COVID-19, for the model using confirmed deaths, and a 33% reduction in the risk of dying, for the model using COVID-19 total deaths. Moreover, the risk of dying from COVID-19 in the sample areas with the best socio-economic conditions (GeoSES close to 1), about the areas with the worst ones (GeoSES close to -1) was 50% lower for the model with confirmed deaths and 66% lower for the model with the total deaths.Finally, we performed the spatial modelling of confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths in the EW separately, taking into account the socio-economic covariate. Figure 6 shows RR and 95% credibility intervals for GeoSES, according to the confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths for each one of the EW. We identified a shift in the pattern of the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and socio-economic status over time. The best socio-economic level presented itself as a risk factor for COVID-19 deaths in the first two EW in the city of São Paulo. From EW 15 th , for the total death, and from EW 16 th , for confirmed and total death, the worst socioeconomic level became a risk factor. Even if some values were not significant, there was a continuous decrease in RR from EW 12 th to 17 th , followed by stabilization.This is the first population-based study on the evolution of the spatiotemporal pattern of mortality from COVID-19 in the intra-urban setting of the largest city of Brazil. Using two different datasets, analyzing confirmed and confirmed + suspected deaths separately allows evaluating how uncertainty would impact the association between RR and the socioeconomic context. The robust models by EW clearly show when the high risk of death shifted from the best to the worst socio-economic conditions in the city.Our findings showed that the most critical period regarding mortality by COVID-19 in the city of Sao Paulo occurred between EW 20th and 23th, followed by an apparent stabilization of the temporal trend. However, it is not possible to predict a future scenario, as social distancing measures have been relaxed in the city since the 25th week (MS, 2020) this could increase the number of infected people and, consequently, the number of deaths. Albeit social distancing alone seems not to be enough to contain COVID-19, many studies frequently concluded that it is a critical component of outbreak control (Nussbaumer-Streit et al., 2020) . It is important to point out that both total deaths and only confirmed deaths showed similar patterns in our study, despite its differences. The suspected deaths need, for the one hand, to be treated with caution, because they may be not COVID-19 and, for the other hand, to consider them is one of the strengths of the study. First of all, there is a delay in the confirmation of the suspected cases, consequently part of the suspected deaths will be confirmed as COVID-19 deaths in the future. Furthermore, part of them would be confirmed, if there were no difficulties related to the strict case definition, which requires testing often not available or not performed in the appropriate time window. From this point of view, the amplitudes of variation in rates and relative risks obtained from confirmed and total deaths could be considered as lower and upper limits (or vice versa) for the magnitudes of these measures.The elderly population represents one of the groups that are more prone to the infection and symptomatology by COVID-19 in the city of Sao Paulo, with a higher risk of death for men after the seventh decade of life, similar to statistics found for China and the United States (CDC. The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020). Recently Souza et al (2020) analyzed the Brazilian population and also found that most COVID-19 deaths were male, and the most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Behavioural elements, especially posture that may prejudice adherence to lockdown measures, have been demonstrated as potentially crucial in determining susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (Pawlowski et al., 2008; Raisi-Estabragh et al., 2020) . This unequal death ratio in men may be interpreted considering a lot of factors: their comparatively higher presence of comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease) (Sharma et al., 2020) , higher risk behaviours (i.e., smoking and alcohol use), occupational exposure (Global Health 5050, 2020) and, sex differences in immune responses (Klein and Flanagan, 2016) . In contrast, there may be other social and behavioural characteristics that favour women, with previous studies proposing women are more likely than men to adopt hand hygiene practices (Johnson et al., 2003) and seek preventive care (Bertakis et al., 2000) .The spatial distribution of suspected and confirmed deaths by COVID-19 in the city of Sao Paulo shows inequalities, with spatial dependence and positive correlation associated with socio-economic factors of the areas, remarkably similar to the results of Maciel et al. (2020) . Our findings reveal that socio-economic status acts as a protective factor against the risk of dying from COVID-19. In the models with only confirmed deaths and with all deaths, the increase of one unit in the socio-economic indicator represented, respectively, a 25% and 33% decrease in the risk of dying. The first observation is that, when considering all deaths, the protective effect of the socio-economic level is more evident, showing that there must be a higher incidence of suspected deaths in the less-favoured areas concerning the most favoured areas (in areas with better socio-economic level, access to confirmation for COVID-19 probably is more available). A study conducted by Souza et al. (2020) reinforces this finding. They compared the spatial pattern of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory infection with unknown aetiology with the socio-economic level in the metropolitan region of São Paulo and found that the firsts were more associated with better levels and the seconds. They pointed out the degree of underreporting of COVID-19 cases should increase with a decrease in socio-economic status. Therewith, our results have confirmed the association between COVID-19 and human development, pointing to the importance of geographic screening in locations with a potential for local infectious transmission as a fundamental aspect to coordinate better actions against the pandemic (Maciel et al., 2020) .The low levels of socio-economic position reveal that not only the vulnerability of the population but also the difficulties in health services concerning diagnosis and treatment of the condition, similar to the overview of fragility expected from health services in Brazil (Ribas et al., 2020) and in the countries of Latin America to face the pandemic (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020). Besides, living conditions also may be strongly influenced by the low income in different ways, such as residence in more poor neighbourhoods and housing conditions, particularly confined or overcrowded housing (Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020) , which has been related with a greater risk of contagion from several other pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori (Webb et al., 1994) , tuberculosis (Gupta et al., 2004) or Epstein-Barr virus (Gares et al., 2017) . Besides, a person's employment may expose them to different risks related to the type of job (Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020) . Work requiring continuous human contact, such as caring for people or interaction with others means that risk of infection dissemination through droplets of aerosol is higher (Rule et al., 2018) . Regarding COVID-19, studies showed that occupation is an explicit determinant of contagion and a secondary determinant of COVID-19 severity and deaths by the association between occupational social class and comorbidities (Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020) . For example, workers such as cleaners, retail staff, teachers, or healthcare workers suffer the direct impact of the COVID-19 incidence (Koh, 2020) . People with underprivileged socio-economic conditions are more prone to be exposed to job stress including burnout syndrome and unemployment, which may contribute to disrupted immune and inflammatory system responses (Berger et al., 2019; Nakata, 2012) as well as a higher risk for comorbidities for COVID-19 (Kivimäki and Kawachi, 2015) . Until now, both debilitated immunity and the existence of comorbidities are recognized risk factors of COVID-19 severity (Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020) .We showed that the first cases of deaths occurred in the neighbourhoods with the best socio-economic position in the city of Sao Paulo. This may be related to the fact that all of the infected subjects had been abroad (MS, 2020). In the first two weeks, the best socioeconomic level was presented as a risk factor. Then there was a change in the spatial pattern: from the fourth week onwards, the worst socio-economic level becomes a risk factor. Similarly, Souza et al. (2020) showed a higher risk of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in census tracts with higher per-capita income in the Sao Paulo metropolitan region during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. After these first cases in richer areas, the virus started to circulate in the suburbs of the city, with high population density and worsened sanitary conditions (Silva and Muniz, 2020) , and probably explain its fast transmission. The city of Sao Paulo is particularly vulnerable because it is the most populous in the country, with approximately 12 million inhabitants (IBGE, 2020), and is highly connected within Brazil and around the world. Its main airport, the São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, is the largest in Brazil, with non-stop passenger flights to 103 destinations in 30 countries (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020) .In this study, we used the SIM database instead of SIVEP-Gripe, unlike other studies (Souza et al., 2020) . The recommendation of the Ministry of Health to register the notification of death and the monitoring of mortality from this system, in practice, leads to a longer time between the event and the use of information by the teams since the registration of death occurs initially in the SIM, based on the death certificate and requires health service teams and/or COVISA, who access the systems, to insert the evolution for each notified case or the notification of death for cases not previously notified. These characteristics, combined with the coping strategy adopted by SMS-SP, which did not include mass testing, motivated the option of using SIM data considering the confirmed and suspected diagnoses for analyzing mortality caused by coronavirus infection in the analyzes performed.Our study findings must be considered in the context of several assumptions and data limitations. We associate patient's addresses or postcodes to area-based socio-economic positions using the geolocalisation, which may provide some insight into the likelihood of exposure to health factors and COVID-19 risks. This approach is frequently used as representative for the individual socio-economic condition; nevertheless, they are not a perfect picture of individual circumstances, could underestimate the magnitude of social disproportion related to individual social measures (Lamy et al., 2019) and are best employed in complement with individual-level variables to reflect geographical or aggregate-level risks (Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020) . We highlight that our spatial analysis is subject to methodological limitations caused by ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit problem. These constraints are intrinsic to any spatial analysis using aggregated data (Subramanian et al., 2009) . Even so, our study contributes to healthcare planning measures and for future precision studies focusing on the effects of social health factors on COVID-19 deaths. Also, one of the strengths of our study was dealing with deaths by COVID-19 instead of using the cases, due to the better accuracy and reliability of the data. When we consider only the cases, there may be many underreporting asymptomatic patients that can hamper the conclusions.We used models with spatial and spatio-temporal architectures to investigate the spatial and spatio-temporal patterns of confirmed and total (confirmed and suspected) COVID-19 deaths in the city of São Paulo. The obtained results from considering both categories showed differences regarding the magnitude of rates and RR, however, there were no differences concerning the conclusions we achieved. The maximum risk of dying from COVID-19 occurred between EW 20th and 23th, followed by an apparent stabilization of the temporal trend, but we did not rule out a new rise in mortality soon. We identified that the high socio-economic level was shown to protect against the risk of dying from COVID-19 throughout the study period. However, this was not a uniform pattern, since we identified a shift in the risk of dying from COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo over time: from high risk in the best socio-economic contexts in the first two EW to high risk in the worst contexts, from EW 16th ahead. Concerning sex and age, men and elderly people presented the highest risk from dying of COVID-19. Our study has corroborated the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and socio-economic condition, revealing the importance of geographic screening in areas with a higher risk for deaths as a crucial aspect to integrate better actions to face the pandemic.

a265e6978dad9cd52b0344546b76ca39eab6ef41,,"The global pandemic, COVID-19, formally known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) [1] , was declared a pandemic and a global threat by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11-03-2020 [2] .Since December 2019, when its outbreak was first announced in the city of Wuhan in China, the disease has spread very rapidly to many other countries. As of 11-03-2020, when the disease was declared a global pandemic, a total of 6,546 cases and 355 deaths had been recorded by WHO [3] .Ghana had its first imported case of COVID-19 in Accra, the nations capital, and the regional capital of the Greater Accra Region, on 12-03-2020 [4] , [5] .The disease then rapidly spread across the other regions. As of 3-08-2020, 10:35 GMT+2, a total of 37,014 cases had been confirmed. The Greater Accra Region alone accounted for about 18,882, which is about 51% of the total cases in Ghana [6] . Figure 1 summarized the events from Ghana, etween March-July. The coronavirus disease is caused by a pathogen that attacks the respiratory system of humans. Non-infected persons may contract the disease after physical contact with an infected person or contaminated surfaces and objects. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and tiredness, which manifests within 14 days of infection. Other symptoms include diarrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, headache, and loss of taste and smell [7], [8] . To slow down and control the spread of the virus, The WHO defined some measures in the absence of an approved cure [9] .Many governments soon adopted and implemented these measures in their own countries. These measures include physical distancing between persons, wearing face masks, avoiding physical interactions like handshaking, and hugging, and lockdowns, etc [10] . These measures have been communicated to individuals through various communication channels, including social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc.As a result, concerned individuals and public health officials are able to stay up to date with research findings, statistical and precautionary measures. Others use these platforms to share their own opinions and sentiments towards media reports or news [11] . A careful analysis of what individuals talk about will help satisfy digital epidemiological needs for efficient disease surveillance and case severity analysis. Healthcare providers or policymakers will then understand the state of the situation, thereby making it easy to reach out with available remedies [12] .In this work, we use data sourced from Twitter, which is the most used social network after Facebook and YouTube [13] by a section of the Ghanaian population in the Greater Accra Region.We contribute by providing a data-based assessment of the COVID-19 situation and the populations response. This will aid healthcare providers and educators to assess how individuals at the target location feel, respond and understand matters concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on this information, healthcare needs and decisions that are more suited to the population can be made and implemented.This section describes the proposal to analyze the situation in the country of Ghana in detail. The next step are part of the proposal:-Select keywords related to covid19 pandemic -Set the parameters to collect related data -Pre-processing text -Visualization to support AnalysisThe scope of the analysis is the Greater Accra region of Ghana. This choice was informed by the concentration of the population and access to the internet. The search terms used to retrieve information from the social network are:-'covid', 'coronavirus', 'sars'Twitter is a social network with thousands of users sending micro-messages, up to 240 characters. Then, the collection process is through Twitter Search function using the parameters that follow:date: 01-03-2020 to 15-07-2020 terms: the chosen words mentioned in previous subsection geolocalization: 5.646129,-0.065209, see Fig. 2 language: English radius: 25.3347 kmIn this step, the following procedures are taken to remove unwanted words and characters while maintaining the relevant ones. We also create visualisations to support our analysis and visual understanding. The last step is useful to avoid coronavirus keywords and discover other terms related to the topic. According to the objective, this set of words can be chosen.After cleaning the data, the text is ready to create graphics to help the understanding of the situation in Ghana during the last months.-Bar plots to show the frequency of tweets per day, per month -Cloud of words to visualize the most frequent terms per month -Line plots to show the trend of dataThis section explains the results obtained and the respective analysis. First subsection 3.1 introduces the description of the dataset. Next subsections 3.2, 3.3 presents the frequency of post daily,monthly and 3.3, the most frequent terms per month. Finally, a crossing graphic is presented in 3.5 to analyze the relationship between Twitter, Google Trends, and new reported cases per day.This dataset is the result of the collection explained in 2.2 previously.-Total size of dataset: 9475 tweets -Fields: date(YYYY-MM-DD), text(alphanumeric) -Range Date: 01-03-2020 to 15-07-2020 -Language: EnglishFirst, it is important to know how many tweets/posts related to the topic of the study because this can express the interest of the users about the topic around covid-19 pandemic. Figure 3 , shows March and April had the highest number of posts and from April there is less tweets month after month.April 01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  0   50   100   150   200   March   01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  0   25   50   75   100   125   150   175   April   01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  0   20   40   60   80   100   May   01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  0   20   40   60   80   June   01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11 The highlighted dates can be the start of an elaborated study around these days, then the study can be extended.The terms: covid19, coronavirus, sars were extracted because the intention is to know the most frequent terms around these keywords per month. First, graphic 5 shows case, people, pandemic, update, positive. Then, this keywords are more related to Public Health reports. Next figure 7 presents the most frequent N-grams with N=2,3 to perform a better analysis about the previous terms. By consequence, it possible to confirm most of the tweets are related to actions of government, i.e. president akufo addo, stay home, taken combat spread, update measure taken.The choice of words of users on social networks indicates their attitude and feeling about the situation they post about. In this section, we focus on words that conveys sentiments of the user from their composition. We categorized the pre-processed tokens into three namely; positive, negative and neutral based on their polarity scores.In figure 8 , frequently occurring words across months are ""death"", ""die"", ""kill"". These words suggests that people were worried about the alarming death rate of the pandemic and the cause of the panic among them. Again, ""racism"" appears in May and more frequently in June pointing out another cause of distress that likely surrounds the issues and behaviours against racial minorities.April MayJune July First, Twitter can be a useful source of data. Process to analyze text includes the cleaning of the text. Second, there was an increasing interest on the pandemic as topic in Ghana user at the beginning, during the first reported cases. But, during the time, the interest about the pandemic were decreasing. The evidence for this affirmation is found in Google searches, Twitter posts daily, in spite of the number of new cases still is growing up.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-27,8
3cfba39b98248fe21f3b1d4239f4168589074673,Data Mining Approach to Analyze Covid19 Dataset of Brazilian Patients,"The outbreak of Coronavirus(Covid19) started with first cases on December 2019, in Wuhan(China). The first reported case [4] in South America was in Brazil on 26 February 2020, in So Paulo city. The strategy to stop the infections in the country was a partial lockdown to avoid the propagation of the virus.On 28 January 2020, Ministry of Health of Brazil reported a suspected case of Covid19 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, recently one student returned from China [1] , [13] . The same day were reported two suspected cases in Porto Alegre and Curitiba [5] . The first confirmed COVID-19 case [11] were reported in Brazil, a man of 61-year-old who returned from Italy. The patient was tested in Israelita Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo state. On 14 May[12] , more than 200 000 cases were confirmmed, this number double during the first days of May.Until August 11, the numbers of Brazil 1 are: total of 3,112,393 cases, with an increasing rate of new cases of 44,255(+1.4%) and a total of 2,243,124 recovered cases.Nowdays, many scientists are working around coronavirus covid19, but searching for conducted studies in South America, there is only a few number. After a searching in IEEX Xplorer using coronavirus, covid19 terms, one paper with Brazilian Affiliation is found [18] , related to data augmentation for covid19 detection. Considering a preprint repository related to Medicine(Medxriv), using terms: covid19, coronavirus, data mining more than 50 papers are found.The table 1 presents the top 10 results of MedxRiv query. Four of this papers is a conducted study for South America countries and there is any work analyzing Brazilian context. In spite of, there is 4 papers with Brazilian Affiliation. Considering, the previous evidence it is necessary to conduct studies with Brazilian data, then the initiative of Fapesp is valuable to foster research on covid19 topic. The actual paper uses Data Mining Approach to perform an exploratory analysis of the dataset of Brazilian patients of Sao Paulo State. The methodology to explore data is presented in Section 2, the experiments and results in Section 3. Conclusion states in Section 4, final recommendations and future work are presenten in Section 5, 6.The conducted work follows a methodology inspired in CRISP-DM [17] . The image 1 presents the flow between the phases of the exploration. This step is related how to deal with data before of generate graphics for analysis.-If a specific variable must be numerical, but there is string values, so it is discarded -If null values are found, a discarding process must be considered.-If range reference for one exam, analytes is null then the analysis is not possible.Using clean data is possible to answer some questions related to age distribution, sex distribution, distribution of results to detect anomalies or outliers. The questions can require a kind of specific graphic to suppot analysis.Considering distribution of few classes, a pie chart is useful to check proportions, subsection 3.3, 3.8 . For age distribution, bar plot can show how is the distribution, see subsection 3.4, 3.5, 3.6. The analysis is dozen of values can be supported for boxplot graphics, in subsection 3.9, 3.10.The release of the datasets is the result of collaboration between Research Foundation (FAPESP) [15] , Fleury Institute, Israelita Albert Einstein Hospital, Sirio-Libanes Hospital and the University of Sao Paulo. The goal is to contribute and promote research related to Covid19. The datasets share the data dictionaries of Patients(see Tab. 1), Test (Tab. 2). The size of dataset are presented in Table 3 for three data sources. SL Hospital provided a dataset about outcomes of the patients. This subsection present some graphics to describe data and let posterior analysis, besides the requeriment of some graphics related to distribution, i.e. bar plot, boxplot.Description of datasets The Figure 2 is presented with counting values, unique values, top for each field. The name of columns were transformed to lowercase to have an uniform name of fields. Fleury has the highest de exame(722), de analito(978). SL has de exame(478), de analito(652). Therefore, numer of de valor referencia are related. -SL Hospital presentes NaN(Not a number) values, then it is possible find NaN values in the datasets.Female population is slightly bigger than male population in Einstein, Fleury but SL presents male population bigger for 0.05%(29 people), see Fig. 3 . The graphic Fig. 5 presents the number of collect exams per day and month, Einstein presents an increasing number from January to June, Flury a decreasing from January to April but a peak on May, June. Besides, SL Hospital has an increasing from February to June.To answer what were the most frequent exams during the month of each dataset, graphic Fig. 6 presents the 20 most frequents.-Three datasets has blood count exam on the top of each month.-Only Fleury has exams related to covid19 detection on April, May, June on the top 5. Einstein and Fleury presents analytes related to covid19, i.e. resultado covid19, Covid19 deteccao por PCR, Covid19 material and more. Again, Fleury presents a variety of names for analytes related to covid19. And SL Hospital does not have any in the top 20(see Fig. 7 ). Considering analytes related to covid19, graphic 8 presents the number of detected/not detected during the months for Hospital Einstein. Fleury and SL do not have an standardized outputs of covid19 exams, therefore is not possible to generate the graphics yet. Considering top 14 of de analito and de resultado, the graphic Fig. 9 is presenting boxplot of the values of Einstein Hospital. It is necessary not to consider qualitative values, then only numerical values were used to build the plot. Analyzing the graphic is remarkable to many outliers in many of analytes, then a cleaning process is necessary. Using a cleaning process using standard deviation(std) is proposed, because the outliers are further than median and in normal case two or three times higher is considered an abnormal value but in this situation, to have a better visualization of boxplot was used 0.5*std(see Fig. 11 ) and 0.2*std(see Fig. 11 ) on Einstein dataset considering analytes with abnormal values. The next graphics are created splitting Einstein dataset for genre. There is presence of NaN values in the reference value then these analytes are discared for the graphic, table 3.10 presents the no valid de analito, it is a total of 8. Plotting the distribution (Fig. 12) for 30 most frequents analytes for men. The next graphic 13 present the distribution for positive cases of covid19. In the two previous images 12 and 13 is possible to observe a concentration of outliers in the sides of the normal distribution, i.e. TGO, TGP, Creatinina, Neutrfilos #, Ureia. only the lowest and highest value were used to filter data. Then, the reduction can be from 0.83 to 75.30 %. An initial number of exams was 108,152 and final value after filtering 86,814 with a reduction of almost 20% of the available data. Now, dataset is ready to answer more question and the research can continue. Coronavirus pandemic is active in the world, scientist are working to understand how to stop the virus, many areas are studying the covid19 impact in Heath, Economy therefore datasets related to patients are useful and important. Fapesp initiative to gather university and hospital is remarkable because it can foster research on the topic. Real world datasets are not clean or ready for Data Mining or Data Science tasks then an exploratory phase is mandatory to see if data can be representative or useful to answer questions. Then, many cleaning steps were necessary to generate the final dataset and graphic, besides this cleaning step reduced the available dataset of men in 20%, with a maximum value of 75.30% for Magnesium Analyte, then it is possible a meanignful reduction of data is a cleaning task is performed.Finally, share the process of analysis is useful for researchers interested to analyze with this dataset, so it can save time, effort to future research.For researchers interested to work with these datasets, consider:-Check if range of dates for each dataset to know if this data is useful for your study. -Sirio-Libanes Hospital has some issues related to encoding, this is the smallest dataset then you must analyze if it useful for analysis and search for the problems to fix them. -Only Einsteing dataset has a standardized output for covid19 exams: detected or not detected. If you are from Computer Science or related field, this is better for your study. Because, Fleury has a variety of outputs, therefore is necessary the presence or advice of one person related to Medicine to explain you the different values. -If you want to automatize filtering considering reference range of values, remember there are many for many analytes, then the suggestion is check this manually to check if it is possible to code the process.For further work, a crossing of data is proposed to improve the analysis considering other variables, i.e. social-economic data, previous existence of health issues related to patients, considering data of other hospital to enhance the study. By the other hand, a deep analysis will be performed with this new cleaned dataset.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-26,8
76d5159cb991d9eff72952bd4b0b0bd196883337,Featuring ACE2 binding SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through a conserved evolutionary pattern of amino acid residues,"Viruses are the most numerous type of biological entity on Earth and the identification of novel viruses continues to enlarge the known viral biosphere [1, 2] . This collection of all viruses presents enormous morphological and genomic diversity as a result of continuous exchange of genetic material with the host cells [3, 4] . Moreover, this well succeeded long-term virus-host interaction indicates that viruses are more than simple genomic parasites in all cellular life forms [5] . A number of evidences has led to the proposal that viruses play an astonishing role as agents of evolution because of their capacity in propagating between biomes [6] and in gene transfer between species [7] [8] [9] [10] . For this purpose, viruses have developed large number of genome replication and protein expression strategies to benefit from the host translational machinary over time [11] .Despite all of such enormous diversity in gene sequence, it is not possible to achieve huge number of highly distinct protein structures mainly because of stereochemical constraints on the possible protein folds [12] . In fact, it has been observed common secondary structures throughout different virus families while the sequences are not fully conserved [12, 13] . This may result in evolutionary efficiency once viruses can exploit already well designed motifs from similar cellular functions [11] .Currently, the world population is confronting a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease to humans. This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is affecting human health worldwide. Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the large and diverse family Coronaviridae, within the order Nidovirales and suborder Cornidovirineae [14] . Their subfamily Orthocoronaviri- * patricia.duzi.2018@usp.br † alves@ffclrp.usp.br nae contains four genera based on phylogeny and termed as α, β, γ, and δ-coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus genus as well as SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and hCoV-HKU1, to cite a few [15] . Other important representative viruses as human hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E belong to αcoronavirus.Phylogenetic relationships among the known members of this subfamily indicate that α and βcoronavirus infect mammals, while γ and δ-coronavirus infect both mammalians and avians.Members of Coronaviridae family are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses and render the largest genomes among all known RNA viruses [16] [17] [18] [19] . The +ssRNA genomes undergo rapid mutational changes [20] , leading to faster adaptation to new hosts, though also contain conserved sequence motifs as observed, for example, in multiple alignments do CoV strains [13, 21, 22] .Coronaviruses attach to host cell surface receptors via their spike (S) glycoproteins, located on the viral envelope, to mediate the entry into the host cell. Each monomer of trimeric S-protein comprises two subunits S1 and S2, responsible for the viral attachment and for the membrane fusion, respectively [23] [24] [25] . The S1 coronavirus subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is able to recognize different host receptors, highlighting its remarkable capacity to adapt to their hosts along the viral evolution. Thus, it is not unexpected to observe in this domain high sequence divergence even for the same coronavirus identified in different host species. In contrast, the S2 subunit presents the most conserved region in the S-protein.The binding of RBD spike proteins to the receptor on the host cell is the first step in virus infection. This initial step is followed by an entry mechanism of enveloped viruses into target cells. Usually, most viruses enter cells through endocytotic pathways with the fusion occurring in the endosomes, although a direct entry into cells can occur by fusion of their envelopes with the cell membrane [26] .A number of CoVs utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor into cells, exemplified by β-genus human respiratory SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and α-genus hCoV-NL63 [15, [27] [28] [29] . In particular, SARS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2, enter the cell via endocytosis induced by RBD complexed with human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . In contrast, the β-genus MERS-CoV and its genetically related bat CoV-HKU4 utilize dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as the viral receptor [35] . Other viral receptor is aminopeptidase N (APN), recognized for example by the α-genus hCoV-229E [36] .The human coronaviruses hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43, cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections [37] , while SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause severe respiratory diseases, with SARS-CoV-2 being far more lethal than SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV strains vary enormously in infectivity, which can be connected to their binding affinities to hACE2 [38] . This binding affinity, in turn, can be correlated with disease severity in humans [39] .While RBD in spike proteins is determinant for the virus-receptor interaction, the active residues lie at the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which is part of RBD and plays a fundamental role binding the outer surface of their receptors [27, 28, 38, 40, 41] . The importance of the RBM is further explored here in relation to its structural topology. Thus, instead of analysing specific residues that make contacts with ACE2 after binding, we followed the molecular origin that drives the viral attachment to this cell receptor. This investigation has revealed a highly conserved amino acid residue sequence Tyr-Gly-Phe (YGF) in coronavirus variants that employ this receptor. Thus, we hypothesize that the short sequence YGF is vital for RBD-ACE2 interaction because of the formation of the hydrophobic pocket proper to the receptor specificity [40, [42] [43] [44] ], as exposed next. It is likely that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains able to use ACE2 proteins have adapted their RBM along the viral evolution to explore this YGF-based mechanism to infect host cells.Amino acid sequences of type XGF, where the residue X is frequently the residue Met, form a highly conserved loop characteristic of ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that occurs in a variety of proteins. The UBA domain is a conserved motif through eukaryotic evolution and is found in many proteins related to the ubiquitin metabolism and in particular, associated with ubiquitinmediated proteolysis [45, 46] . The MGF loop in the UBA domain is typical of a hydrophobic pocket that is critical for recognition and binding affinity to ubiquitin through a hydrophobic surface patch located in the vicinity of this loop [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] .NMR analyses of UBA-ubiquitin interactions identify hydrophobic surface patches formed by the conserved MGF sequence as the main determinants for the dimerization interface. A number of alignments of p62/SQSTM1 UBA domain with other UBA-domain proteins has revealed single-point mutation in the MGF sequence, mainly M→L, or F→Y, maintaining its overall hydrophobic characteristic [55] .Here, we examine the occurrence and importance of the specific amino acid residue sequence YGF for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains able to use ACE2 proteins as receptors. It is displayed in Fig 1a the interface of SARS-CoV RBD spike-protein (magenta and green color) complexed with hACE2 (blue color) to gain insight about the importance of this kind of conformational mechanism in creating a shape complementarity between receptor and ligand. The RBM is in magenta color, with the yellow color displaying the YGFY sequence in that pocket, which establishes the proper relative position for favorable binding to ACE2 exposed residues. The YGFY sequence seems strongly conserved for many SARS-CoV. It is located at residues 481-484 in RBM. Noteworthy, no other GF sequence occurs in this region, neither in its RBD. As a consequence of this hydrophobic pocket, amino acid residues responsible for binding interaction are located close to this conformational structure. For instance, the residues N479 and T487, which have been identified to be essential for receptor binding [39, 41, 56] . The residue N479 in SARS-CoV is located near K31 of hACE2 and makes a salt bridge with E35, a residue buried in that hydrophobic environment. The residue T487 is located close to K353 on hACE2, and in turn makes a salt-bridge with D38, also buried in that pocket (Fig 2a) . Other important residues for this attachment are Y442, L472, and D480 [40] . Figure 1b displays the interface of SARS-CoV-2 RBD spike-protein complexed with hACE2, also in blue color. Now, the sequence YGFY observed in SARS-CoV is replaced by YGFQ (Fig 3) . The single-point mutation Y484→Q498 replaces a hydrophobic residue in SARS-CoV by a hydrophilic one in SARS-CoV-2. Figure 3 compares amino acid sequences of human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains aligned with RBM of SARS-CoV Tor2, an epidemic strain isolated from humans during the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003. The human Tor2 strain has high affinity for hACE2 [38] . We highlight in Fig 3 in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.The important residues for the interface interaction found in SARS-CoV are mutated in SARS-CoV-2. The sequence alignments show the mapping, Y442→L455, L472→F486, N479→Q493, D480→S494, and T487→N501. These mutations do not present a drastic change in their hydrophobic character [57] , thus preserving the overall receptor-binding topological structure for these viruses. In particular, residues L455 and Q493 in SARS-CoV-2 preserve the noted favourable interactions with the residues E35 and K31 in hACE2 [58] (Fig 2b) . Interestingly, a new GF sequence appears in the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 strains as a consequence of the mutation L472→F486, producing a small hydrophobic surface, but does not seem to disrupt the proposed topological formation mechanism for ACE2 Details of protein-protein binding interfaces can be quite different among strains, likely related to their infectivity degree. It has been noted that mutations in RBM residue T487 have an important role in the human-tohuman and animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV [36, 38, 56] .It is known that not all SARS-CoV strains isolated from bat hosts have exploited ACE2 as a cellular at-tachment. Therefore, the set of amino acid sequences displayed in Fig 4 may exemplify the successful relation between virus evolution and the binding mechanism. This set highlights in medium purple color the preserved amino acid residues in the sequence YGFY, characteristics of human SARS-CoV. For comparison, we also display CoV strains with mutations in that SARS-CoV pattern to explore the relation between the hypothesized mechanism and the cell receptor recognition.It has been demonstrated that LYRa11 [28] , Rs3367 [59] , Rs4874 [60] , WIV1, and WIV16 [28, 61] , have the capacity to use ACE2 for cell entry, in line with our hypothesis. Also, the near single-point mutation Y→F in the next six strains does not interfere, as expected, in the attachment mechanism. This remark is supported by cell entry studies for Rs7327 [28, 60] , Rs9401, RsSHC014, Rs4084, and Rs4231 [60] , because they are in a group that is likely to use the ACE2 receptor. Moreover, this mutation replaces a hydrophobic residue by another one with higher hydrophobicity, reinforcing the conformational topology for binding with the receptor.The next group corresponds to the mutation Y→T, decreasing the initial hydrophobicity of the expected pocket. It seems unlikely that this mutation and amino acid residue deletions in the RBM associated to Tor2 sequence affect the YGF-based attachment mechanism for BtKY72 and BB9904/BGR. However, there is no available experimental data concerning their receptors. It is important to remark that the residue F492 in BM48-31/BGR produces another hydrophobic sequence IGF at residues 490-492 (Fig 4) . We speculate that this double occurrence may disrupt the aforementioned mechanism because of indications that BM48-31/BGR does not interact, at least with human ACE2 [28] . No other GF sequence occurs for these strains in the RBM nor in their RBD.Next CoV strains do not contain such GF sequences of residues in the RBM neither in their RBD, except Rf1/2004, which is located in RBD and with GF surrounded by hydrophilic residues. Although we have considered only part of their sequences that better align with RBM of Tor2, it has been demonstrated that the spikes of HuB2013, HKU3, CoVZC45, CoVZXC21, Rf1, Rf4092, and Shaanxi2011 do not use hACE2, a result that is not just a consequence of deletions at the RBD [28] . Further support has been presented against HKU3 in using hACE2 [62] . It seems unlikely that Rm1/2004 infects hACE2 because its unfavourable binding free energy [63] . Another result concludes that Rp3 is unable of infect hACE2 or even bat ACE2 [64] .We have placed together the alignments involving Tor2, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV-2 at the end of Fig 4 for further comparison. The whole genome of RaTG13 shares 96% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2, and it is considered the most closely related genome to this CoV [65] . Considering its spike protein, and RBM, RaTG13 shares respectively 97% and 76% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2. For comparison, RaTG13 shares 79%, 77%, and 53% identity, respectively, for the whole genome, spike protein, and RBM with SARS-CoV Tor2. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is mostly similar to RaTG13 than SARS-CoV strains in all regions.To explore further the role of YGF-based attachment mechanism, we exhibit comparative residue sequences for civet and pangolins, again aligned with RBM of SARS-CoV Tor2 (Fig 5) . This figure shows that the pattern YGFY characteristic of human SARS-CoV is maintained for the collected data, but with a single-point mutation Y→H for pangolin hosts PCoV. No other GF sequence occurs even in the RBD of these strains.We have included SARS-CoV-2 on the last line of Fig 5 for a direct comparison. PCoV GX-P2V shares 79%, 77%, and 50% amino acid identity with Tor2, respectively for whole genome, spike protein, and RBM aligned with Tor2. In relation to SARS-CoV-2, PCoV GX-P2V shares 85%, 92%, and 75% amino acid identity, respectively for whole genome, spike protein, and RBM. It is believed that human SARS-CoV passed from palm civets to humans in the 2002-2003 epidemic because their genome sequences are highly similar [38, 56, 66] . The amino acid alignments show an almost identical RBM between human SARS-CoV, represented by Tor2 strain, and collected data from palm civet strains. This identification also includes the YGF-based mechanism able to use ACE2 proteins. Nevertheless, these alignments display high similarity between pangolins and SARS-CoV-2, which also support previous conclusions on pangolins being the probable origin of SARS-CoV-2 [65, 67] . However, based on our data related to host receptor binding and their RBM and S-protein alignments, we can not discard bat RaTG13-like strain as also the possible origin of SARS-CoV-2.Although there is no many available experimental data identifying the viral receptor-binding protein for CoVs, it is well established that human SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 both employ ACE2 as the cell receptor to infect host cells [68, 69] . Interestingly, SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 domains do not present high sequence similarity. For example, their spike-S1 subunities share only 10% in similarity. Other features separate SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 [70] . SARS-CoVs are classified as β-coronavirus with subgenus sarbecovirus, while hCoV-NL63 is in genus α-coronavirus and subgenus setracovirus. Although hCoV-NL63 also enters the cell via endocytosis, its functional receptor requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans for the initial attachment, representing an important extra factor for ACE2 act as a functional receptor [33, 70] . Moreover, the spike-S1 glycoprotein of SARS-CoV binds more efficiently ACE2 than the corresponding spike-S1 of NL63 (NL63-S) [71] . This may be linked to the fact that SARS-CoV and NL63-S contact hACE2 differently, a conclusion based upon the experimental results that NL63-S does not bind to hACE2 through a single and large domain [69, 72] . Actually, different RBD regions have been identified within NL63-S. One of these regions was positioned at residues 476-616 and comprising three discontinuous RBM regions, RBM1 (residues 497-501), RBM2 (residues 530-540), and RBM3 (residues 575-594) [73] [74] [75] . A slightly different RBD has been identified for this CoV [72] . It would be located at residues 482-602, also with three discontinuous RBM regions, which surround a shallow cavity at hCoV-NL63-ACE2 binding interface. Curiously, its spike protein alignment with Tor2 does not show the expected residue pattern in the corresponding RBM of Tor2 nor in the aforementioned RBD regions of NL63-S. This may help to explain the unusual pathway of binding to ACE2 for this CoV.All sequences were analysed with ClustalW and Jalview. The list of GenBank accession codes for the spike proteins analysed in this work is available in supplementary Table S1 . CONCLUSION We have analysed a number of CoV strains to support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains share a common evolutionary mechanism for the initial attachment to ACE2. Moreover, we speculate that the YGF-based mechanism can act as a protein signature to distinguish CoVs able to use ACE2 as a cell entry receptor whenever this residue sequence is located at the CoV RBM region. For example, SARSr-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45, the closely related spike sequences to SARS-CoV-2, can be promptly put under suspicious in their ACE2 binding affinity. Of course, as exemplified by hCoV-NL63, we can not discard that another mechanism can act helping such binding. It must be accentuated that the occurrence of other XGF sequences, mainly with X being a hydrophobic residue, in the RBM, or even in the RBD region, is likely to disrupt the proposed topological mechanism for ACE2 binding. This because it might introduce hydrophobic loops promoting a new ligandsubstrate recognition.Table S1 GenBank accession numbers for the coronavirus sequences used in this study.

63c6a76773b88a51fc30dca931bd4de615756a12,SEIRD model in heterogenous populations: The role of commuting and social inequalities in the COVID-19 dynamics,"In the beginning of December 2019 a new type of coronavirus disease was identified in the city of Wuhan, the largest city of the Hubei province in China.Currently known (officially) by the name COVID-19, this novel coronavirus was only reported to the world by the end of the same month [1] . According to the World Health Organization, with the data published by February 21st, just three months since the first case, over 75 thousand cases were reported just in China, with a fatality ratio around 3%. Also, at that same time other 26 countries have confirmed infected cases [2] .Since then, the spread of the COVID-19 became one of the most problematic public health case of epidemic diseases around the world, causing relevant socioeconomic impacts: primarily by the relatively high death rate causing deaths by the health complications or even by the saturation of health care systems, and secondarily since this is a new type of coronavirus, so the majority of the individuals are susceptible to the disease. Hence, until the the development of the vaccine, it will stagnate the entire system of social interaction leading to the increase in unemployment rates, weakening the health of the population and many other complications.At the present time, early August of 2020, the World Health Organization[3] reported over 18.6 million confirmed cases of infected including over 700 thousand deaths. The Americas concentrate over 50% of all infected cases with over 380 thousand deaths, Europe concentrates the highest mortality rate with approximately 18, 5% of all infected cases with over 216 thousand deaths representing over 30% of all death cases. In total, COVID-19 is affecting 213 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances [4] .Many efforts have been made by the scientific community around the world in an attempt to propose models that allow mapping the spread and predictions about numerical issues involving this current pandemic. Although these models do not portray reality with absolute precision, they have helped us guide control measures (such as quarantines and educational campaigns of social distance, use of masks, cleaning and hygiene tips, and many others) to minimize the effects of the pandemic with relative success.In [5] , the author proposes a SEIR model with a partial differential reactiondiffusion system to explain the spread of COVID-19 in France and analyzed the different situations without lockdown and with partial lockdown scenarios.In [6] , the authors developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak in Canada using time series analysis with a machine learning approach. In [7] , an age-structured SEIR model was studied and the efficiency of age-oriented control strategies were assessed. In [8] , the authors present an optimal control result for an age-structured SEIRQ model by using quarantine strategies as the control force.For results more connected this work, one can see [9] , where the authors investigated a model for spatial epidemics and analyzed the effects of human mobility patterns to spatial spread of an infectious disease. Also, in [10] the authors proposed a SEIRA model for the spread of COVID-19 in a heterogeneous population. Finally, as we can see in [11] and [12] , studies have indicated that pandemic scenarios affectsdifferently Afro-Americans and immigrants in the United States due to unfavorable socioeconomic conditions. It is stated that African Americans represent three-quarters of the total deaths in U.S.In Brazil, as in many other Latin America countries, due to the great socioeconomic inequalities and the partial lockdowns adopted with relatively low time of implementation (together with the large underreporting of cases) it is expected that the dynamics between locations with greater and lesser financial resources will also have great divergences in the epidemic scenarios since individuals with fewer resources in addition to not having large and efficient access to heath facilities, may not be able to comply with isolation measures (such as quarantines) and precautions (such as the use of masks). Inspired by the above comments, in this paper we present a SEIRD model for COVID-19 with a population divided into patches and we analyze the influence of two important factors: social inequalities and commuting between patches.This work is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present our SEIRD model, explain the epidemic parameters and compute the basic reproductive number R 0 by the next generation approach. In Section 3 we fit the parameters to real data from Brazil and analyze the sensitivity of R 0 with respect to them.In Section 4 we present numerical simulations considering the dynamics with a population divided into two patches and analyze the effects of commuting and social inequalities. Finally, we present the conclusion of this work in Section 5.As proposed by [9] , we consider a population that is divided into n patches, which could represent countries, regions, cities, or even parts of a city. People from one patch can travel to other patches, and the model distinguishes individuals by their home locations. Residents of patch j that are presently in patch i commute to patch k at a rate m j ki . A diagram for the n = 2 case for a generic population denoted by X is displayed in Figure 1 . The population of residents of patch j which are presently in patch i is also divided into four epidemiological classes. These are the susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered individuals, denoted by S j i , E j i , I j i and R j i . We also include D j i to represent deaths due to the disease. A diagram for the n = 2 case describing the commuting dynamic in one of the patches and the progression in classes is displayed in Figure 2 .Our SEIRD model is, then, composed of 5n 2 equations, described in (1) for In (1),denotes the number of residents presently in patch i from the other patches.All parameters are nonnegative. For C ∈ {S, E, I, R}, representing a generic epidemiological class, m j ki (C) is the commuting rate from patch i to patch k for individuals of class C that are residents of patch j. It will be assumed that m j ii (C) = 0 for all i, j since there is no commuting in these cases. We denote a generic parameter ρ j i for residents of patch j, presently in patch i. The remaining parameters are described in Table 1 . It is assumed that the total population is constant because the analysis considers only a short time in comparison to the demographic time scale. Hence, the equations in (1) do not include vital parameters. Parameter DescriptionExit rate of exposed class. We now show how to calculate the basic reproductive number, R 0 , for model (1) . This will be done by a next generation approach. Due to the high number of dimensions, we only consider the case n = 2. Firstly, we need to find the disease-free equilibrium, which is defined byNotice that the total population in each patch is constant. At the equilibriumwe haveandSolving the system that arises from (3) and (4), one can see that the diseasefree equilibrium isFinally, R 0 is given by the spectral radius of the next generation matrix (see [13] , [14] )with diagonal elements as in Table 2 . Due to the complexity of K and its eigenvalues, we do not give an explicit formula for R 0 , which would not have much analytical use with so many parameters. Instead, we perform a numerical sensitivity analysis in the next Section.In this Section we consider model (1) with 2 patches, which represent two regions of a given large city of Brazil. The parameters for these patches will be chosen arbitrarily to model social inequalities. One patch will consist of wealthier individuals, who are better able to self isolate and have greater access to hospitals.In order to allow us to choose the parameters better, we start by fitting the number of infected people in Brazil for the first 20 days of the outbreak in a SEIR model with only one patch. The data from [4] is shown in Table 3 . The model isBrazil's population will be rounded to 200 million people. Now, a minimization routine based on the least squares method is used to find parameters β and γ to the data in Table 3 . Since the latency period is estimated to be 5.2 days [15] , we assume that σ = 1/5.2. The minimization algorithm is an adaptation of one that is available in [14] , starting with an initial guess of β = 1 and γ = 0. The data from Table 3 and the infected curve with the parameters chosen as above are shown in Figure 3 .We assume that patch 1 is the wealthier one. For C ∈ {S, E, R}, we assume thati.e., the commuting rates do not depend on the epidemiological class for noninfected individuals. In their case, we suppose that the symptoms reduce their mobility, so we takeFurthermore, we assume that m i ji << m i ij , i, j ∈ {1, 2}, that is, individuals spend much more time in their base locations, and that m 1 21 << m 2 12 , i.e., residents of patch 2 are more likely to go to patch 1 than the other way around.In a specific case, this can be seen as follows: patch 1 concentrates more places of entertainment and commerce compared to patch 2. For our numerical analysis of R 0 and the simulations in the next Section, we take We also assume that the number of residents in each patch is 30000. From (5), the disease-free equilibrium is, then, S 1 * 1 = 27000, S 1 * 2 = 3000, S 2 * 1 = 10000, S 2 * 2 = 20000.For the epidemiological parameters, we suppose that β 1 1 = β 2 1 , β 1 2 = β 2 2 , σ k ij = σ * for i, j, k ∈ {1, 2}, γ 1 1 = γ 1 2 and γ 2 1 = γ 2 2 . This means that the transmission coefficients will be considered as a property of the patch in which individuals currently are, whereas the recovery rates depend only on the patch they live in.Our choices, then, will be β 1 1 = β 2 1 = β * , γ 1 1 = γ 1 2 = γ * and β 1 2 = β 2 2 = (1 + p)β * , γ 2 1 = γ 2 2 = γ * /(1 + p), where p > 0 is a parameter that reflects the social inequalities between the two patches. We consider p = 0.5. A summary of parameter values is available in Table 4 . The normalized forward sensitivity index of R 0 (see [16, 17] ) is given bywhere ρ is a parameter. This number gives the percentage change in R 0 with respect to a percentage change in ρ (see [14] ). For example, if Υ R0 ρ = 0.1, then a 1% increase in ρ increases R 0 in 0.1%. After computing the partial derivatives numerically, we find the results displayed in Table 5 . Notice that the effect of changes in the commuting rates on R 0 is small in comparison to other parameters. This shows that, even though travel restrictions are useful methods of controlling the spread of as epidemic across patches, they are not as effective as measures that affect the transmission coefficient (such as wearing masks and social distancing) and the recovery rate (such as screening measures and the isolation of infected individuals) [18] .However, the rates corresponding to the mobility of residents of the poorer patch induce percentage changes in R 0 around five times those corresponding to the wealthier patch. Moreover, we see that leaving your base patch decreases R 0 , whereas returning home increases it.On the other hand, we see that a 10% reduction in p produces a 5.1% reduction in R 0 , so reducing social inequalities is paramount in regard to the control of future epidemic outbreaks.In this Section we use the parameters from Section 3 to gather information about the disease spread in a population divided into two patches. We aim to answer the following questions:(i) How does the maximum of the infected curve depend on the parameter p?(ii) How many deaths are due to traveling between patches?(iii) How are these extra deaths distributed in the populations of the two patches?As initial conditions, we consider susceptible populations as the equilibrium values from Table 4 , zero exposed, recovered and deaths, and one infected individual, which is a resident of the wealthier patch. This happened in a few large cities of Brazil such as São Paulo [19] and Recife [20] , where the first cases were infected after trips to Europe.To analyze the first question, we plot, in Figure 4 , the maximum of the total infected curveas a function of p ∈ [0, 1]. Notice that, as p increases, the maximum also increases. However, if we do the same forandwe see that the maximum is essentially constant with regard to p for residents of the wealthier patch, so the increment in the overall maximum comes at the expense of the poorer patch.A bigger number of simultaneously infected individuals poses a serious problem, because it could lead to the saturation of the healthcare system [21] . Figure   4 suggests also that the more unequal societies are, the bigger the toll on hospitals and other facilities is on the poorer regions, whose residents already have less access to it to begin with. The second question is answered with Figure 5 . On the left, it shows plots of D 1for p = 0.5. The blue curve is the solution that arises from the parameters from Table 4 , whereas the red curve represents a situation with no commuting, i.e., The case fatality ratios considered in patch 1 were c 1 1 = c 1 2 = c 0 = 0.05, that is, 5% of infected residents from this patch die from the disease. In patch 2, we assume that the case fatalities increase with p in such a way that, when p = 0, we have c 2 1 = c 2 2 = c 0 , and when p → ∞, we have c 2 1 = c 2 2 = 1. Hence, we takeThe plot on the left of Figure 5 shows that commuting increased the total number of deaths, given by the equilibrium values of the two curves, in around 2.5 times. In order to determine if this was a property of the specific value of p that was chosen, the other two plots of Figure In patch 1, whose residents are richer, the final number of deaths was multiplied by a factor of 1.11. On the other hand, this factor was 3 in patch 2 so, once again, the disease has much worse consequences for poorer individuals. Finally, we look at the percentages of deaths coming from each patch. For p = 0.5, the results from Figures 5 and 6 are presented in Table 6 .Once again, the effects of travel among patches are felt in a much harsher way in the poorer patch. In this paper we developed a SEIRD model for the COVID-19 epidemic in a population distributed in different patches. We assumed that individuals can travel between patches and also that the patches have different socioeconomic resources and studied the effects of commuting and social inequalities on this dynamic. The residents of each patch were divided in four epidemiological classes of a SEIR model without vital dynamics and we included a D class to represent deaths from the disease.We calculated the basic reproductive number using a next generation approach. To fit the parameters, we used data of the infected people of the first 20 days of the pandemic outbreak in Brazil in a SEIR model with a single patch and a minimization routine based on the least squares method and then we analyzed the sensitivity of the R 0 with respect of these parameters.This analysis pointed to many interesting facts. The mobility rates of residents in the poorer patch causes percentages variations in R 0 around five times higher when compared to the wealthier one. Also, the travels provoke different variations on R 0 : leaving your base patch reduces it whereas returning increases it. Another result is that the mobility rates between patches cause only small variations in R 0 , thus indicating that avoiding commuting is not as effective a strategy as measures that directly affect the infection or recovery rates. For p, the parameter reflecting social inequality, the analysis is quite different. We observed that reductions of 10% in p causes reductions around 5% in the basic reproductive number, indicating that the reduction of socioeconomic inequali-ties is an effective strategy in the control of epidemic outbreaks.We did numerical simulations of the proposed model considering two patches and supposing that one is wealthier then the other. These results (present in Section 5) lead us to some important conclusions. The first one is that social inequalities play an important role in the concentration of infected individuals.To be more precise, the maximum of the infected curve increases as the parameter p increases. On the other hand, the total cases of the wealthier patch remain almost constant with the variance of p, therefore the most affected patch is the poorer one.The second is that mobility between patches directly contributes to the increase of the cumulative number of deaths. It is important to observe that in this situation there is a vast difference in the death rate when we compare commuting and no commuting scenarios in each patch: in the wealthier one we have a difference around 11%, whereas the approximated difference is of 200% in the poorer one.The percentages of deaths coming from the poorer patch decreased in 15% in a scenario with no mobility between patches, for p = 0.5. Therefore we conclude that both human mobility and social inequalities represent important facts to be considered in future models.We expect that our model with the results presented in this paper help the scientific community to a better understanding on how human mobility and social inequalities affect the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar structures, which could lead the authorities to better public-health policies to control or minimize the effects of epidemics. Finally, it is important to mention that one can adapt our model to consider important others dynamical processes in Epidemiology, Ecology or Biology.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-15,8
c18aa63af13585390e59ca05c3f79feb8782008b,AN EXPLORATORY TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF TOTAL DEATHS PER MONTH IN BRAZIL SINCE 2015 A PREPRINT,"In broad terms, a time series consists in a set of numbers corresponding to the observation of a certain phenomenon. Figure 1 shows the Nile River mimima for the years 622 AD to 1284 AD 1 [9] . By nature, such numbers are realizations of random variables. In general, a collection of random variables, {x t }, indexed by t, is referred to as a stochastic process [10] . In this paper, t will be discrete and vary over the integers t = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .. Box and Jenkis [11] introduced the class of stationary ARMA(p, q) (autoregressive moving average) models 2where µ = E{x t } is the mean of x t , {φ 1 , φ 2 , . . . , φ p } and {θ 1 , θ 2 , . . . , θ q } are parameters of the model, and w t is a wide-sense stationary white noise process with zero mean and power σ 2 , i. e., w t ∼ (0, σ 2 ). In a more compact form, we havewhere x t = x t − µ, B is the backward shift operator (Bx t = x t−1 ), φ(B) is the autoregressive (AR) operator of order pand θ(B) denotes the moving average (MA) operator of order qIn the rest of this paper, we will assume µ = 0 without loss of generality.The process x t can be viewed as the output of a digital filter (ARMA filter) whose input is w t , with system functionwhere H(z) denotes the z-transform of the impulse response h t of the ARMA filter. An ARMA(p, q) process x t is said to be wide-sense stationary (or non-explosive) if the poles of H(z) in (5) lie inside the complex unit circle (|z| = 1), and it is invertible if the zeros of H(z) in (5) lie inside the unit circle. The autocorrelation function (ACF) 3 ρ h of an ARMA(p, q) process shows exponentially decay to zero, i. e., at lag h converges rapidly to zero as h → ∞ (short memory property) [11] .A random process x t is wide sense (or weakly) stationary if its mean is constant [12, p. 298 ]and if its ACF depends only on the lag τ = t 2 − t 1 :In the literature, it is common to use the terms time series and stochastic process interchangeably [10] , [13] , [14] , [15] . From now on, we will only use the term time series. The context will indicate to the reader whether it is a process or a realization of a process.The modeling of a time series x t consists on estimating an invertible function h(.), called model of x t , such thatin which w t ∼ Independent and Identically Distributed -IID andin which g(.) = h −1 (.). The process w t is the innovation at instant t and represents the new information about the series that is obtained at instant t.In practice, the adjusted model is causal, i. e.,The model construction methodology is based on the iterative cycle illustrated by Fig. 2 [11] :(a) a general class of models is considered for the analysis (specification); (b) there is the identification of a model, based on statistical criteria; (c) it follows the estimation phase, in which the model's parameters are obtained. In practice, it is important that the model is parsimonious 4 ; and (d) at last, there is the diagnostic of the adjusted model by means of a statistical analysis of the residual series w t (is w t compatible with a white noise process?)The process x t of (10) is linear when it corresponds to the convolution of a process w t ∼ IID and a deterministic sequence h t [16] [p. 377] 3 We assume that the autocorrelation function is given by ρ h = γ h γ 0 , where γ h corresponds to the autocovariance of xt at lag h. 4 We say that a model is parsimonious when it uses few parameters. The use of an excessive number of parameters is undesirable because the uncertainty degree of the statistical inference procedure increases with the number of parameters. Eq. (11) is also known as the infinite order moving average (MA(∞)) representation [17] .As the models in practice are invertible, the model of x t can be rewritten in an infinite order autoregressive (AR(∞)) form:An order p AR model satisfies the equationin which φ(B) is an order p polynomial.In practice, the order p of an AR series is unknown and must be empirically specified. In this paper, we use an information criterion function [14] as will be explained below.The basic idea of an ARMA model selection criterion is to choose the orders k and l that minimize the quantityin whichσ 2 k,l is a residual variance estimate obtained by adjusting an ARMA(k, l) model to the N series observations, and C(N ) is a function of the series size.The quantity (k + l) C(N ) N is called penalty term and it increases when the number of parameters increases, whileσ 2 k,l decreases.Akaike proposed the information criterium [18] , [19] AIC(k, l) = lnσ 2 k,l +known as AIC, in whichσ 2 k,l is the maximum likelihood estimator of σ 2 w for an ARMA(k, l) model.Upper bounds K and L for k and l must be specified. Eq. (15) has to be evaluated for all possible (k, l) combinations with 0 ≤ k ≤ K 0 ≤ l ≤ L. In general, K and L are functions of N , for example, K = L = ln N .For the case of AR(p) models, (15) reduces toHaving identified the AR model's order p, we can go to the parameters estimation phase. The methods of moments, Least Squares and Maximum Likelihood may be used [20] , [21] . As, in general, the moments estimators are not good [21] , statistical packages as R and S-PLUS use some Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood estimator.If a process which corresponds to the difference of order d = 1, 2, . . . of x tis stationary, then y t can be represented by an ARMA(p, q) modelIn this case,is an ARIMA(p, d, q) model and we say that x t is an ""integral"" of y t [21] becauseThe ARIMA(p, d, q) modelis marginally stable [22] , as it has d roots on the unit circle. Also, x t of (19) is a homogeneous non-stationary process (meaning non-explosive) or having unit roots [13] , [14] , [21] .Observe that [21] [p.139]:(a) d = 1 corresponds to homogeneous non-stationary series with respect to the level (they oscillate around a mean level during a certain time and then jump to another temporary level);(b) d = 2 corresponds to homogeneous non-stationary series with respect to the trend (they oscillate along a direction for a certain time and then change to another temporary direction).The ARIMA model (19) may be represented in three ways:(a) ARMA(p + d, q) (similar to Eq. (1))(b) AR(∞) (inverted format), given by (12) or (c) MA(∞), according to (11).Consider the model y t ∼ I(1)in which x t is a stationary process. If we assume the initial condition y 0 , (23) can be rewritten as an integrated sumThe integrated sum t j=1 x j is called stochastic trend and it is denoted by T S t . Observe thatin which T S 0 = 0. (23), then y t is known as random walk. Including a constant in the right side of (23), we have a random walk with drift,Given the initial condition y 0 , we can writeThe mean, variance, autocovariance and ACF of y t are given by [21] µ t = y 0 + tθ 0 (28)Observe that ρ k (t) ≈ 1 when t >> k and the literature states that the random walk has ""strong memory"" [14] .The random walk's Sample Autocorrelation Function (SACF) decays linearly for large lags.Spectral analysis is a well-established research area [20] . However, the estimation of the power spectrum of a signal is not a trivial matter. There are two classes of spectral analysis techniques currently in use: parametric (or model-based) and nonparametric analysis. Both methods are used in this work.The fundamental idea of parametric spectral analysis is fairly simple. The parametric approach assumes that the signal satisfies a generating model, such as an AR(p), with known functional form and then proceed by estimating the parameters in the assumed model [20] , [23] . The most widely used form of parametric Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation uses an AR(p) model [20] .Let us now consider the nonparametric (or classical) method. Then, the estimation of PSD of a time series x t can be made using periodogram methods based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which can be efficiently calculated by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Algorithm.In the sequence we present the periodogram method.Consider a time series x t with N values or samples, i. e., x t = 0 outside the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ N − 1. In some cases of interest, we consider that x t has a size N , even if its actual size is M ≤ N (in such cases the series x t must be completed with (N − M ) zeros (zero padding).The equation (32) is the DFT of x t :The PSD of x t can be estimated by calculating the periodogram, given bywhere X[k] denotes the DFT of x t , andThe periodogram is an asymptotically unbiased spectral estimator of the PSD of a random signal [20] , [23] . Its main problem lies in its large variance. In other words, the periodogram is inconsistent (i. e., the dispersion of the estimates is independent of N ). This motivates the use of a ""refined periodogram method"", like the Daniell method.It is possible to show that the periodogram values P x (f k ) are asymptotically uncorrelated random variables [20] . Thus we may reduce its large variance by weight averaging the periodogram over small intervals centered on the current frequency f k . The practical form of the Daniell estimate can be performed using the FFT. This work uses a Daniell kernel for nonparametric PSD estimation. For further details, please refer to [20] and [23] . The series in the Fig. 3 strongly suggests that we can specify a model of the type [10] [p. 58]where x t are the observations, y t is a stationary process, and µ t denotes a linear trend given by the regression modelin which β 0 and β 1 are the intercept and the slope parameters. Table 1 shows the estimated coeffcientes for (35) and its p-values, which are negligible. The goodness of fit is summarized by the R 2 of the regression [13] [p. 169]. Note that the R 2 statistics given by Table 2 indicate that the proposed model for µ t explain approximately 75.8% of the total variability of the data. The great value of the F-statistic and the neglibible model p-value show that we can not reject the null hypothesis of linear regression. Thus, we can consider a linear model for (35) to be statistically significant given the statistical significance level of 0.01. Figure 4 shows the time series with the superimposed linear regression model. To verify that the model (35) is appropriate, it is also necessary to investigate the residuals. This is what is called residual analysis.The residuals of (35 ) correspond to the discrepancies between the observed values (µ) and the values adjusted (μ) by the model. The i-th residual is given byê Figure 5 shows the residuals vs fitted model and the Quantile-Quantile plot (QQ-plot) of the residuals, which suggests that they are normally distributed. Table 3 shows a residual diagnostics using the Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilks tests [13] [p.61] for the null hypothesis of normality of the residuals. The null of normality is not rejected using either tests.At this point, we can conclude that: • there is no change point in the deterministic linear trend of the historical series.The first step in exploratory analysis is to remove the deterministic trend of Eq.(35) [10] [p. 58]. There are two alternatives: remove the line estimated by the regression or take the first difference in the series. As our goal is to coerce the data to (a possible) stationarity, then differencing may be more appropriate [10] [p. 61]. The first two samples of the historical series were discarded so that the series corresponding to the first difference has 64 points, that is, 2 6 points, which facilitates the spectral analysis with FFT.The first difference can be denote as(37) Figure 6 shows the series r t (we also demeaned the series) and its SACF. Figure 7 shows the histogram of r t with a superimposed normal distribution and its Q-Q plot, which suggests that r t follows a normal distribution. Figure 8 shows the smoothed periodogram using the Daniell method and the PSD for the estimated model of r t , which is an AR (11) .We used the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test [24] for the null hypothesis that r t is level stationary, i. e., that the series is I(0). We obtained a p-value of 0.1, which means that one can not reject that r t is level stationary.Finally, but not least, an informal analysis of Fig. 6 suggests that the variance of r t has a change point around t = 22 (2017/jan). However, if this really happened, which we cannot guarantee with the techniques employed in this article, ocurred long before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil. This possible change point motivates a time-frequency domain analysis using wavelets, as the localized nature of wavelet coefficients allows one to analyze the evolution of the series variance over time [20] . This will be investigated in future work.In this paper, we presented an exploratory time series analysis of the historical series of the total number of deaths per month in Brazil since 2015. Our preliminary results indicate that: • there is no statistical evidence that COVID-19 affected the deterministic linear trend of the historical series, i. e., on average, the monthly growth in the number of deaths, which is approximately 675 deaths/month, did not change since the first recorded death in Brazil on March 16, 2020; • there is no change point in the deterministic linear trend of the historical series;• there is significant statistical evidence that the first difference time series is stationary; and • there is no statistical evidence that COVID-19 provoked a change in the stochastic process that generates the time series under analysis 5 .These results are thought provoking and not intuitive. COVID-19 has caused many deaths around the world. This is an indisputable fact. However, our results suggest that this disease does not have so far an additive effect on the total number of deaths per month in Brazil.

A SEIR model with the interaction of n distinct populations for Covid-19 in Brazil. *,"The mathematical modeling of infectious disease has played an important role in the definition of action protocols and public policies to combat diseases aiming at the least social impact. It has been successfully used since the Bernoulli's pioneer work [1] on infectious diseases. An up-to-date example of the importance of mathematical modeling on public policies for epidemic diseases is the recent change in the UK's strategies regards to the Covid-19 pandemic [2, 3] . An extensive review of the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases can be found in [4, 5, 6, 7] and references therein.isting plateau in Covid-19 reported cases. However, such dynamics need to be calibrated, and it is possible only if a massive testing program is considered. Moreover, these approaches can not be applied to explain how a plateau-like phenomenon arises in an out of control epidemic outbreak.Main contributions: Our main contribution with this manuscript is to provide enough shreds of evidence that a structured SEIR model, where the structure is characterized by n distinct populations in interaction (see (1) ), can predict a plateau-like shape for infected cases. The distinct populations can represent, for example, geographically separated communities, different groups (such as the elderly or people with co-morbidity ), etc. As we shall see in the analysis that follows (see Section 3), such plateau is a product of a diffusion-like effect withing distinct populations. Although the derived analysis seems to be simple, it is possible to simulate distinct scenarios, reflecting the Covid-19 infected data ranging from countries where strict vertical isolation was implemented to scenarios with practically no population mitigation was adopted. In particular, we conjecture that the Covid-19 diseased diffusion from the capitals to the Brazil interior, reflected by the proposed model, is responsible for plateau-like reported cases in the country.The work is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the model. We devote Section 3 to share some known facts about the proposed model as well as to analyze the scenarios of the model that predicts a plateau-like shape of reported cases. We also analyze what shall be the real-life scenario that reflects such a situation. As we will see, the plateau-like shape can be associated with the diffusion of the disease within populations (see Subsection 3.1. In Subsection 3.2, we briefly discuss how the proposed model can be use to predict the scenario for vertical an horizontal social isolation. In Section 4, we present numerical simulations of a diversity of scenarios (see Subsection 4.1), for with an extensive discussion is provided. Moreover, we also show how the proposed model can describe reported Brazilian Covid-19 infected cases in Subsection 4.2. In subsection 4.3, we show how vertical social isolation is illustrated by the proposed model. Finally, Section 5 is dedicated to our conclusions.In the forthcoming analysis, we shall consider a variation of the well-known epidemiological SIR compartmental model proposed by Kermack and Mckendrick [21] . Actually, our model is a generalization of the classical SEIR model [4, 7] where we introduce the interaction of n distinct populations. Let N i be the number of individuals in population i (i = 1, 2, ..., n), and N T = N 1 + N 2 + · · · + N n be the total integrated population. Let S i , E i , I i and R i be the fractions, in regard to N i , of population i that are susceptible, exposed, infectiously and recovery, respectively, at time t. In the model we consider, the time evolution is given by the following dynamic system for i = 1, 2, ..., n:where β ij are the disease transmission rate (proportional to the average contact rate in the population and within the population), α i is the inverse of the incubation period, γ i is the inverse of the mean infectious period, for i = 1 · · · , n. Furthermore, we assume that mortality rates µ i is equal to the birth rates, such that the total population N i is constant during the diseases. Hence, we haveMoreover, the dynamics (1) is considered with the following initial conditionswhere I i (0) is the fraction of the population i infected at the time 0.3 Some facts about the model In this section, for easiness, we shall consider the model (1)-(2) with µ i = 0. Notice first that, from the third equation in (1), we get that the variation of I i (t) is proportional to the variation of E i (t). In this setting, summing up the second and the third equation in (1), we have the well-known SIR model, witĥ I i (t) = I i (t) + E i (t). We consider that the properties we shall explore will be well understood if some well-known facts about the model (1)-(2) are revisited. We provide some details here for the sake of completeness. The model (1)-(2) has a unique smooth solution, that depends continuously on the parameters and the initial conditions, e.g. [22] . Then, whenever S i (0) andÎ i (0) are strictly positive, results in S i (t) andÎ i (t) non negative, for all i = 1, · · · , n. It follows from the first equation in (1) that S i (t) is decreasing. Moreover, adding the first three equations in (1), we get the following conservation lawConsequently, (3) also imply that lim t→∞Î i (t) = 0. The basic reproduction number of the population i ,R i 0 , is the quantity that express the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population and withing the selected population, at the initial phase of the infection, is defined as βiiSi (0) γi . It is wellknown that if R i 0 > 1,Î i (t) start increasing and then decreasing. Therefore, given the smoothness ofÎ i (t) (as a result of the existence of a solution of (1)) and the above mentioned properties ofÎ i (t), we conclude that it trajectory has a concave hump with extremes inÎ i (0) andÎ i (∞) = 0, see Figure 1 . Hence, I i (t) attains a maximum at a point t i p , known as the turning point. Adding the second and third equation in (1) and the fact thatİ i (t i p ) = 0, implies thatAlthough simple, the analysis of the equation (4) revels several scenarios for the dynamics, as pointed below:1. Assuming that we have n isolated populations, i.e., β ij = 0 for j = i, thenas in the canonical SIR model. In this particular setting of no-cross contamination between different populations, we have t i p = t j p and then, we see the pick of the populations as one.2. It is clear from (4) that S i (t i p ) is lower and thereforeÎ i (t i p ) is higher, depending on the infected connection network, since the quantity n j =i βij βiiÎ j (t i p ) appear in the quotient. It implies that the infection will be higher as higher is the infected connection network. Consequently, any kind of population isolation shall be tacked horizontally on the populations, in order of the diseases spread mitigation be effective.3. Let I(t) := n i=1Î i (t)/n and S(t) := n i=1 S i (t)/n the total proportion of the population infected/exposed and susceptible, respectively. By adding (3), we find out that the same behaviour discussed above is true also for I(t). Indeed, its expected trajectory is a positive concave hump, beginning at I(0) and ending at I(∞). Furthermore, the maximum of I(t) will occurs at t i * p (that is population dependent) related to maximum value of n j =i βij βiiÎ j (t i * p ).A more interesting question that we would like to discuss in this approach is the observed plateau-like phenomena as a consequence of the diseases diffusion. Below, we shall argue how the proposed model (1) can be used to describe such phenomena in the exposed/infected dynamics. It started as follows: Assume that the diseases started at the population i = 1, i.e., at time t = 0, we haveÎ 1 (0) > 0 andÎ i (0) = 0, for i > 1. Hence, the diseases will spread out throughout the population thanks to the population interaction (see the first equation in (1)). Therefore, it would take some time for the diseases spread out to the entirely population. It turns out that, for any turning point t i p , the quantity n j =i βij βiiÎ j (t i p ) will present a sort of equilibrium (as i changes) since for the population j, with j relatively far-way form i, the infection is starting to growth and themÎ j (t i p ) have a relatively small value, (for example, is we are looking for i close to 1 and j close to n), or then, the opposite situation holds; the infected proportion of the population already start declining, consequentlyÎ j (t i p ) is relatively small ( for example, is we are looking for i close to n and j close to 1). As far as β ij /β ii remains proportion throughout the population, the diffusion phenomena withing populations takes S i (t i p ) at the same level (see (4)) . As a consequence, the picksÎ i (t i p ) forms a plateau-like effect observed in the infected/exposed compartment I. By the way, this phenomena is observed for the COVID-19 real data on large territorial counties as US and Brazil, see Figure 4 .Another consequence of the diffusion phenomena discussed above is that the largest n is longer will take for the diseases starts to decline. Consequently, the plateau-like phenomena is larges (see Figure 2 ). Moreover, it follows from (4) that it takes higher levels as higher are the proportion of β ij /β ii , as expected in largest populated cities or metropolitan regions.Vertical and horizontal social isolation: How far we can get into this discussion with the SEIR model (1) Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and the lack of a treatment with efficacy evidences, the social isolation is the unique known measure for the pandemic controlling, e. g. [2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and references therein. Some counties as UK and Sweden pointed or adopted a vertical social isolation strategy (to protect only elderly or co-morbidity proportional of the population), contrarily to the World Health Organization recommendation of a horizontal social isolation. Regardless of economical impacts of the adopted social isolation strategy, in this section we discuss how far the proposed model (1) can share light on the best strategy to be adopt to protect the population. It is worth to mention that we do not intend to exhaust the discussion on the subject, but only to make some comments on the subject based on the model (1) .At this point is reasonable to assume an age-structured population, where i = 1 represents the proportion of elderly and co-morbidity population. Although the vertical isolation seem reasonable (it is equivalent to take β 11 as lower as possible, but of course, it is impossible assume it to be zero), since the mortality for the COVID-19 are concentrated mostly in the elderly/co-morbidity proportion of the population [23] , it follows from (4) that β 11 lower will get effect on the number of infected at the class i = 1, at least on it pick, might be compensate for the interactions with the other ages-classes (βij = 0) on the day-to-day life. The particular in-housing interaction between many aging people are the reality of many families on lower incoming countries like Brazil [23] . Notice that is sufficient thatÎ j (t i p ), for one j = 1 with a high value to take S 1 (t i p ) down (and consequentlyÎ 1 (t i p ) be large). See the scenario presented in 4.3 for a numerical representation of such situation.On the other hand, in a horizontal isolation scenario we have β ij (consequently,Î j (t) for all t) closed to zero, for all i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}. Hence, it follows from (4) that quantity S i (t i p ) is large resulting inÎ i (t i p ) relatively closed toÎ i (0), meaning that pressure on the health system might be kipped under control.In this section we present numerical solutions for some particular cases of our model (1). We consider, for simplicity, that all the n populations have the same number N of individuals, namely, N i = N = 1000000. We also consider the simplest interaction case where each population interacts with only two neighbour populations, namely, β ij = β = 0 if j = i ± 1, β ij = 0 for |j − i| > 1. In this case we have a one dimensional chain of populations where |j − i| can be used to define a distance from populations i and j. Furthermore, in order to avoid asymmetries in the interactions of the first (i = 1) and the last (i = n) populations, we also consider β 1n = β n1 = β (this consideration implies that we have a periodic uni-dimensional chain). Finally, we set β ii = β, α i = α, γ i = γ, µ i = µ = 0 (homogeneous populations). All numerical solution are obtained by the traditional backward finite difference method with a time step of ∆t = 0.5 days.We consider in this case α = 1/5 (we are supposing that the meantime before an exposed individual becomes infectious is five days), γ = 1 (the meantime before isolation for infectiously individuals is one day), β = 1.5 to result in a severe epidemic outbreak, and µ = 0. For the interaction between neighboring populations we consider β = 0.02, that is the contagious rate from individuals outside the population is seventy-five times smaller than from individuals of the same population. Initially, we consider that there is 200 infectious individual in population i = 1 and zero in the other populations.In Fig. 1 we show the role of interaction β in each population for n = 4. In Fig. 1 (a) we show the time evolution of exposed E i and infected I i compartments. The exposed and infected compartments of population i = 1 reaches its maximum point first, followed by populations i = 2 and i = 4. The last population to reach its epidemic peak is i = 3. These results are consistent since the epidemic outbreak starts in population i = 1, propagating to the first neighbouring populations i = 2 and i = 4, and finally achieving the most distant population i = 3. The total exposed E = (E 1 + E 2 + E 3 + E 4 )/4 and infected I = (I 1 + I 2 + I 3 + I 4 )/4 fractions in relation to the total population N T = N 1 + N 2 + N 3 + N 4 is displayed in Fig.1 (b) . The difference in the time that each population reach its maximum point have as a consequence the emergency of a plateau when the number n increase. In Fig. 2 (a) we show the total exposed E = n i=1 E i /n and infected I = n i=1 I i /n fractions for n = 1, 10, 20, the case n = 4 was displayed in Fig. 1  (b) . For n = 1 we have the classical SEIR model [4, 7] with a sharp curve for both exposed and infected fractions. For n = 4 (see Fig. 1 (b) ), both curves broaden but still there are not a plateau. By increasing the number of distinct populations to n = 10 a well-defined plateau arouses. For n = 20 we can see that the plateau extension increases with the growth of n. As a consequence of the appearance of the plateau, we have an increase in the duration of the epidemic outbreak, but with a smaller fraction of sick individuals in the population at every moment. However, the accumulated fraction of sick people (I + R) at the end of the outbreak varies little with n, as can be seen in Fig. 2 (b) .Finally, Fig. 3 displays the role of the intensity of interaction β for the epidemic outbreak dynamics. We consider two scenarios with n = 20. For β = 0.02 we have a strong interaction between distinct populations (a population is heavily contaminated by neighboring populations). As a consequence, we observe a plateau that results from small-time distances between the epidemic peaks for each individual population i. For a small interaction β = 0.001 (distinct populations are almost isolated) the time-distances between the epidemic maximum points for each individual population i increases, resulting in an oscillatory behavior for exposed and infected fractions (instead of a plateau) and in a long It is important to stress that it is not the objective of the present work to describes real data by using realistic values for the model parameters (as realistic values for populations N i and parameters α i , β ij , γ i and µ i ). The result displayed here shows that our model has a great potential to describe real epidemic outbreak, but a detailed stud of real data will be done in a future work.Our present objective is only to show that the model has the ingredients to correctly describes the behavior of Covid-19 dynamics found in real data from Brazil, including the appearance of a plateau phenomenon. With n = 200 and N i = N = 1000000 we found that our model describes very well the behavior of Covid-19 epidemic outbreak when compared against real data from Brazil (see Fig. 4 ). The real data displayed in Fig. 4 is from the ministry of health of Brazil from February 26 up to July 28 of 2020 [20] . The model parameters are set to α = 1/5, β = 1.5, β = 0.01 and γ = 1.004. Fig. 4 (a) shows the diary number of infected individual, and Fig. 4 (b) displays the accumulated number of sick people (I + R). The emergence of a plateau in the real data is characterized by an almost constant mean value for new reported daily cases, which results in an almost linear growth for the total accumulated cases. By looking at the real data in Brazil, in Figures 4 (a) and (b), we can stipulate that the Covid-19 epidemic outbreak reaches a plateau in Brazil approximately four months after the first reported case (at February 26). From these figures, we see a good concordance between real data and our model both in the emergence of a plateau and in the general curve shape of the daily and total accumulated cases, respectively. This result indicates that the plateau of the Covid-19 epidemic outbreak in Brazil may be a consequence of the disease's geographic diffusion. This fact motivates further research aiming at a more accurate description of the real problem through a more realistic choice for our model's parameters. Finally, in addition to populations in different geographic regions, our model (1) can also be used to describes different partitions of a population in the same geographic location. We consider as an example the problem of vertical social isolation. In this case, a number of N 1 individuals in risk groups (such as the elderly or people with co-morbidity) are isolated, while the rest N 2 individuals of the population are not confined. Let us assume that isolated individuals are confined alone. In this case, we should have β 11 = 0 since isolated persons do not have contact with other isolated individuals. The disease contagion follows from contact with non-confined persons. Let also we set β 22 = 1.5 for the disease transmission rate of non-isolated individuals (proportional to the average contact rate in the i = 2 population). By supposing a hypothetically simple case where non-confined persons go out from home five times a week, while isolated individuals go out only one time a week, we can set β 12 = β 21 = β 22 /5 = 0.3. For simplicity, let us consider N 1 = N 2 = 1000000 and that initially there are 200 infectious individual in the non-confined population and zero in the isolated one. We show the exposed and infected fractions for isolated and non-confined individual in Fig. 5 (a) . As expected, the epidemic outbreak is more severe for non-confined individuals. However we despite the small disease transmission rate β 12 = β 21 , the total fraction of isolated persons that becomes sick is not negligible as can be seen in the accumulated number of sick people (I i + R i ) in Fig. 5 (b) .The proposed model of n distinct populations interaction structured SEIR (1) stands as one alternative to describe the spread of COVID-19 pandemic diseases. The proposed model has the flexibility to include geographically separated communities as well as taking into account aging population groups and their interactions. Furthermore, we have shown how some strategies of nonpharmacological intervention as vertical and horizontal social isolation can be discussed using the proposed model. Analyzing some possible scenarios reflected by the proposed model, we show how a plateau-like curve of infected is a result of a disease's diffusion effect within distinct populations, resembling collected data from large countries as Brazil (see Figure 4 ). In particular, we conjecture that the Covid-19 diseased diffusion from the capitals to the Brazil interior, as reflected by the proposed model, is responsible for plateau-like reported cases in the country. Collaborating with the analysis, we also present in Section 4 numerical solutions for some scenarios of the model (1) showing its applicability, in particular for describing the plateau-like shape of reported infected cases in Brazil.Many open questions in regard to the proposed model (1) remains, and shall be explored in the future. Between them, we pointed out the following:• Investigate more realistic geometries, where a population interacts with more than two neighbors.• Include more partition in the model, as for example dead and quarantine fractions.• Explore the complexity of the population interplay network more carefully, including age and distinct population interaction.• Analyze bifurcations and its consequences.• Study optimal strategies for vaccination associated with the interacted population dynamics (1).",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-03,8

The use of a collaborative information pathway provides a rapid way for the data collection on symptomatic individuals in the territory, to complement traditional health surveillance systems [7, 8] . In Brazil, this methodology has been used at the national level since 2014 during mass gatherings events since they have great importance for monitoring public health emergencies [9, 10] . With the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the limitation of the main non-pharmaceutical interventions for epidemic control -in this case, testing and social isolation -added to the challenge of existing underreporting of cases and delay of notifications, there is a demand on alternative sources of up to date information to complement the current system for disease surveillance. Several studies [11] [12] [13] [14] have demonstrated the benefits of participatory surveillance in coping with COVID-19, reinforcing the opportunity to modernize the way health surveillance has been carried out. Additionally, spatial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f scanning techniques have been used to understand syndromic scenarios, investigate outbreaks, and analyze epidemiological risk, constituting relevant tools for health management [15] [16] [17] [18] . While there are limitations in the quality of traditional health systems, the data generated by participatory surveillance reveals an interesting application combining traditional techniques to clarify epidemiological risks that demand urgency in decision-making. Moreover, with the limitations of testing available, the identification of priority areas for intervention is an important activity in the early response to public health emergencies. This study aimed to describe and analyze priority areas for COVID-19 testing combining data from participatory surveillance and traditional surveillance for respiratory syndromes.The study's method is a descriptive transversal, performed in the city of Caruaru, Pernambuco state, within the period of 02/20/2020 to 05/05/2020. Data included all official reports for influenza-like illness notified by municipality health department and the self-reports collected through the participatory surveillance platform Brasil Sem Corona [19] .To volunteer for the Brasil Sem Corona participatory surveillance platform, the individual should download an app called Colab. Through that, the volunteer has the option to agree with its terms of use that describe the purpose of this platform and ethical aspects, including the use of data for scientific studies that will help local public health authorities to improve the understanding of the epidemiological setting. After accepting the terms and conditions, participants can fill out a selfreport questionnaire on symptoms and exposure in order to actively inform their health status. This questionnaire is based in a syndromic approach, including symptoms that are related with respiratory syndrome mixing up protocols used for participatory surveillance [9, 10] . Moreover, questions that could help to understand the severity of symptoms, such as if user sought a health facility or if it has elderly people as household members.Daily reports are permitted, and a participant can report a maximum of two reports a day. Each time a participant completes and submits a report, it provides the respective latitude and longitude, which are anonymized in the server within a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f radius of 2 kilometers. Personal identification is also anonymized, and participants can drop out their enrollment in the platform at any time, and the data is completely deleted from the servers, following national privacy laws.Data from traditional disease surveillance system was accessed by the epidemiological bulletins, publicly available at local government communication channels.To verify a correlation between participatory surveillance (PS) and traditional surveillance (TS), it was carried out a linear regression [20] extracting summary of fit and parameter estimates:A local polynomial regression (LOESS) [21] was also performed to generalize a moving average to generate a scatterplot smoothing among the data points, where its function can be shown as:where is the distance of data point from the point on the curve being fitted, scaled to lie in the range from 0 to 1.On the spatial scanning method, it was performed a purely spatial analysis scanning for clusters with high rates using Bernoulli model assuming that in the studied area there are cases and non-cases represented by a dummy variable, acting as a spatial case (respiratory syndrome cases)/control (users that responded no symptoms) approach. It was decided not use temporal parameters for the SatScan analysis due to case-report delay from TS as well as the latency of 14 days that could be possible on COVID-19 cases.The likelihood function for the Bernoulli [22] model is expressed asIn order to detect the zone that is most likely to be a cluster, it was found the zone ̌ that maximized the likelihood function, where ̌ is the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter . To achieve this, it needs to have two-stage actions.First, maximize the likelihood function conditioned on .and otherwiseThe most likely cluster is of interest in itself, but it is important also to have aThe likelihood ratio, , can be written asIn addition, the SatScan runs a Monte Carlo simulation based on pseudorandom number generators. This allows to obtain the p-value for hypothesis testing, comparing the rank of the maximum likelihood from the real data set with the maximum likelihood from the random data sets.In this case of spatial scanning clusters, statistical significance was defined as p-value < 0.1, bringing not only the clusters with a confidence interval of 95% and a maximum error of 5% but also considering a credible interval of 90% and a maximum error of 10%.For the clusters that presented statistical significance [23] , an overlaying in a geographic information system was done using QGIS 3.12 [24] . This map was used by the local authority to choose the area to deploy 50 serology tests for COVID-19.Other 50 tests were deployed in areas outside those clusters. For data wrangling, data tidying, and data visualization, an R language framework was used The combination of TS and PS showed a relevant potential in the improvements of disease surveillance in the studied region, presenting 6 risk clusters that supported the decision of health managers. City areas that do not have health facilities can take advantage of the use of PS in order to cover blind spots for the TS, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the official disease surveillance system.There was a strong correlation between the participation of individuals in the PS strategy over time, whereas there was a moderate association in the same period with the increase in notifications related to influenza syndrome from TS.Regarding spatial scanning, the use of clusters to target priority regions for testing was of relevant importance in the adequacy and rationalization of the use of diagnostic resources, which are sometimes scarce in different contexts. The finding of 32% people reagent for the COVID-19 antibody in areas that the analysis showed a variation between 34% and 38% demonstrates an excellent result for the method to be replicated not only in this city, but also in other places that need tools to prioritization of tests. The remaining clusters that did not overlap but were statistically significant will be implemented in the coming weeks.The challenge of coping with COVID-19 is even greater in settings where there is a lack of access for testing, low schooling of the population, and minor investment in health policies. In addition, there are a large number of cases that are not registered due to the small number of symptoms [27] or by complete absence [28] of any symptoms that may guide accurate health care, at the right time and in the right place.Brazil is one of the countries that have the lowest number of tests among those that have the highest number of confirmed cases for COVID-19, and one of the epicenters is the state of Pernambuco, where the number of cases can be up to 10 times greater than those officially presented in epidemiological reports [29] . The study region became known as one of the main areas affected by the Zika Virus syndrome in 2015 and 2016 [30] , where there is a population that is affected by several problems such as measles, leprosy, and other diseases overcome elsewhere of the world. This increases the need for rapid response during the COVID-19 pandemic, since the health system is already overloaded with basal demands.Even though most of the documented cases of COVID-19, in studies carried out in China, are in the age group between 30 to 79 years old [31] , the fact we can observe in the PS a more prevalent age group of 36 is a relative trend on the use of digital mobile apps for a younger adults. This trend followed previous studies made in Brazil using participatory surveillance during mass gatherings [9, 10] . In addition, for the present study another relevant finding is that were detected clusters were present in low-income areas that corroborate with other finds in Brazil [32] .In a study carried out by the Imperial College of London comparing the evolution of COVID-19 in 54 countries on several continents, it showed that Brazil is the country most threatened to be one of the main epicenters of the disease in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f world, mainly due to the great possibility of spreading the disease with an R0 greater than 2 and an increasing number of deaths [33] . Knowledge of risk areas is essential for appropriate non-pharmacological interventions [34] , as well as for the definition of priorities regarding medical care, for example. The best time to start treatment is another big challenge because as the disease has a rapid and almost silent evolution, knowing where the probable cases are can save lives, expand the possibility of differential diagnosis and favor an effective treatment.The use of alternative methods as participatory surveillance showed a relevant role by taking advantage on the insertion at community levels, generating real-time spatial information not only for self-reported symptoms individuals but also for participants that informed to have no symptoms. Although the presented approach demands other sorts of validation and diagnostic methods (PCR) and it also needs to be carried out in different cities to address potential biases, our application shows an alternative to rapid mass screening in areas to prioritize tests and supporting local public health authorities to implement public policies based in evidence.Leal-Neto, OB: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing-original draft preparation.

The disease caused by the virus, called coronavirus disease , is characterized by a flu-like syndrome, with symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (4) . Most cases are mild, some may be asymptomatic, but approximately 15% of patients have a more severe presentation, and approximately 5% are critical (5) . The acute respiratory failure among critically ill patients with COVID-19 is unique in its presentation: difficult-to-treat hypoxemia, clotting disorders, renal failure, and changes in immunity and inflammatory phenomena (6) (7) (8) all pose challenges to the management of these patients.The virus spread from China to Europe and then the Americas, causing more than 20 million cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths as of August 15 th (9). Brazil is one of the countries with the highest number of cases as well as deaths, and Sao Paulo is currently the state with highest number of cases in the country (10) , with over 26,000 deaths by mid-August.Reports of the most important risks factors and mortality rates have become available (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) , but as Latin America emerges as the new hotspot of the pandemic, there are no epidemiological data on COVID-19 or any epidemic of this magnitude in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) that could help predict the impact of the new disease on its health system. The burden of critical illness is higher in LMICs (18) , and the mortality of patients on mechanical ventilation in Brazil is high (19) . Given the differences in the age distribution of the population, intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, lower availability of diagnostic testing for the new virus, difficulties in the implementation of public measures to mitigate virus spread in highly populated cities, and delayed access to health care, the burden of COVID-19 tends to be higher in LMICs than in high-income countries (HIC).Knowing the characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and their clinical outcomes in LMICs is extremely important to inform clinical decision-making and public health management in this setting. Therefore, we designed an observational study to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the ICUs of the largest public hospital in Sao Paulo during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.This is a cohort study conducted at Hospital das Clínicas from University of Sao Paulo Medical School. It is the largest academic, tertiary, university-affiliated hospital in Brazil with 300 adult ICU beds dedicated exclusively to the care of COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic in Sao Paulo.The Research Ethics Committee of Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de Sao Paulo approved the study protocol (number 31382620.0.0000.0068), and the study was registered in a public database (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04378582). The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational nature of the study.From March 13 to April 16, 200 previously functioning ICU beds were converted into COVID-19-dedicated ICU beds. In the following 45 days, operating rooms and several hospital wards were repurposed to accommodate 100 additional COVID-19-ICU beds. Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists were hired to constitute new ICU teams dedicated to patients occupying these additional beds. New staff were trained and distributed within experienced ICU teams.The study is observational, and patient care was carried out following institutional protocols developed specifically for COVID-19 patients. The protocol recommends routine use of deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and systemic antibiotics if bacterial coinfection is suspected. Specific drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 were not recommended but could be administered at the discretion of the attending physician. The study also included specific protocols for the ventilatory management of respiratory failure and for sedation management throughout ICU stay. Other critical care standards were not changed during the pandemic.We will include all consecutive adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICUs between March 30 and June 30, 2020 with an expected ICU stay longer than 24 hours ( Figure 1 ). The only exclusion criterion is ICU stay shorter than 24 hours. Patients readmitted to the ICU during their hospital stay will be included in the study only at their first ICU admission. Patients will be classified as confirmed COVID-19, highly suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation, and ruled-out COVID-19. Positive results on either an RT-PCR assay of nasal specimens, throat-swab specimens, or tracheal aspirate or a serologic (antibody) test will be used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients highly suspected of having an infection but with negative RT-PCR test results initially will be submitted to a second RT-PCR test and/or a serologic test after seven days of symptom onset. Patients with ruled-out SARS-CoV-2 infection will be transferred to another facility in the same institution and will be excluded from analysis.The main outcome is ICU survival at 28 days. Secondary outcomes include duration of mechanical ventilation, need for rescue therapies for severe hypoxemia, need for renal replacement therapy, ICU complications, and hospital survival at 60 days. Data collection, management, and quality control Data will be collected prospectively from study approval (May 6) to August 30, 2020 and retrospectively from March 30 to May 5, 2020. Trained data collectors will retrieve patient information from the hospital electronic medical records, and at the bedside ( Figure 2 ). Study data will be collected and managed using a secure, web-based data collection platform (REDCap -Research Electronic Data Capture) (20, 21) . Data collected include demographic information, race, initial symptoms, comorbidities, outpatient medications, simplified acute physiology score (SAPS 3) (22, 23) , and laboratorial test results at admission (Table 1 and 2). We will also collect data on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) (24) , need for oxygen support, mechanical ventilator parameters, use of specific interventions to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, and decision to withhold or withdraw life support (Table 3 ). Patients will be followed up for 28 days, and data on exposures and outcomes, such as use of non-invasive ventilation, use of a high-flow nasal cannula, number of days on mechanical ventilation, need for renal replacement therapy, tracheostomy, occurrence of thromboembolic events, use of prone positioning or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, and ICU discharge status, will be collected (Table 4) . Arterial lactate mg/dL mean (SD) Aspartate aminotransferase -U/L mean (SD) Alanine aminotransferase -U/L mean (SD) Total bilirubin -mg/dL mean (SD) Creatinine -mg/dL mean (SD) Creatine kinase -U/L mean (SD) D-dimer -ng/mL mean (SD) Lactate dehydrogenase -U/L mean (SD) Ferritin -ng/mL mean (SD) White blood cell count/mm 3 mean (SD) Lymphocyte count/mm 3 mean (SD) Platelet count/mm 3 mean (SD) C-reactive protein -mg/L mean (SD) We will follow up patients to register vital status at 60 days or at hospital discharge, whichever occurs first. Quality control measures will include the use of REDCapbased structured data collection forms, training data collectors to ensure data completeness and consistency, and data management processes within the platform to deal with missing data, outliers, and data collection mistakes.We will report study results in accordance to recommended guidelines for reporting observational studies, the Strengthening The Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) (25) , and the guidance from Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep journals on causal inference and prediction research (26, 27) .A sample size of 300 patients was initially anticipated. As the epidemic in Sao Paulo grew fast, the hospital included new ICU beds, and we revised the anticipated sample size to 500 patients. Given that the study carries no risks for participants and that the requirement for informed consent was waived by the IRB, we intend to collect data on all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICUs during the study period, a sample possibly larger than the anticipated sample size. Such a large sample would suffice to allow identification of predictors of survival.Categorical variables will be expressed as counts and percentages, and continuous variables, as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range), as appropriate. All hypothesis tests will be two-tailed, with a significance level of 0.05, and they will be performed using the R software (R Core Team, 2016, Vienna, Austria). We will build Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate 28-days survival. ICU survival will be defined as the time interval between ICU admission and patient death from any cause or ICU discharge. Time will be censored at 28 days for patients who are still alive. Hospital survival will be defined as the time interval between ICU admission and patient death from any cause or hospital discharge. Patients discharged home will be considered alive at day 28. We will perform survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model censored at 28 days to identify the main risk factors for ICU survival beyond expected associations, such as age, comorbidity burden, and severity of disease at ICU admission. Variables identified a priori as clinically relevant (Table 5 ) and additional variables with a p-value o0.20 in a univariate analysis will be evaluated as independent risk factors of poor prognosis in a multivariable Cox model. The order of inclusion of variables into Cox multivariable models will follow statistical significance criteria and clinical relevance. Alternative models will be chosen on the basis of information criteria and likelihood ratio-based Table 4 -Clinical outcomes at ICU discharge. tests. Wherever possible, continuous variables will be modeled to account for nonlinearity with splines or polynomials and avoiding dichotomization. Additivity will be addressed with interaction terms. The proportional hazards assumption will be tested using Schoenfeld residuals. We will use mixed models to analyze the impact of ventilatory variables collected during hospitalization on the main clinical outcomes. We will perform complete case analyses, without missing data. We will also perform a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation.Our study will report characteristics and outcomes of all patients admitted to the ICU at the largest academic hospital in Brazil during the peak of the pandemic of COVID-19 in Sao Paulo. The hospital developed a preparedness plan that included grouping COVID-19 patients in a building dedicated exclusively for the care of these patients, creation of surge ICUs to increase ICU bed capacity, and hiring additional healthcare professionals to work exclusively in the COVID-19 ICUs. The actions were coordinated by a crisis committee composed of critical care specialists, pulmonologists, infectious disease specialists, nurses, respiratory specialists, pharmacists, engineers, and administrators, among others, who met daily to make shared decisions. Such an effort helped prevent shortage of personal protective equipment and important medications, facilitated the development of institutional protocols for patient care and infection control, and contributed to a rational distribution of limited resources with potential impact on patient outcomes (28) . The results will allow for the assessment of clinical outcomes of critically ill patients that will be representative of a middle-income country in a highly strained environment caused by the pandemic. Overall healthcare inequity in the treatment of chronic comorbidities in the Brazilian healthcare system, delayed access to proper critical care, and heterogeneity in ICU within the hospital (surge vs. previously functioning ICUs) are some of the system-level characteristics that highlight the importance of this study to assess overall survival of COVID-19 patients in LMICs.We will also be able to assess resource utilization beyond mechanical ventilation, such as renal replacement therapy and ICU length of stay, to characterize the burden of this surge of severe respiratory failure patients to our hospital and healthcare system. In the main manuscript, both characterization of the cohort and the risk factors for increased mortality will be assessed and compared to the current literature. Our main benchmark for ICU and hospital survival is the result published regularly by the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC), that is, 35%-45% hospital mortality among patients receiving mechanical ventilation (29) , which represents the outcomes of a universal healthcare system in a HIC.In addition, the study will provide answers to many ancillary research questions:A) Rate of use and success rate of non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula use to treat respiratory failure and of commonly used strategies for refractory respiratory failure, including inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, and ECMO. B) Prediction models of hospital mortality specific for COVID-19.C) Characterization of subgroups of interest, such as oncologic and transplant patients. D) System-level research questions to compare outcomes and processes of care in ''surge'' ICUs and previously functioning ICUs, which would allow planning for future surges in critical care capacity. In conclusion, we will be able to describe the characteristics and outcomes of a large sample of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to a dedicated hospital in a LMIC, which could inform health policy and resource allocation and allow for many exploratory research questions to be answered.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-21,8

X-axis: day of examination; Y-axis: rate (%) of patients whose examinations allowed a clinical decision X axis: day of exam; Y axis: rate (%) of paƟents whose exams allowed a clinical decision Image acquisiƟon learning curve Keywords Diabetic retinopathy · Telemedicine · Blindness · Screening · Primary care · COVID-19Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of severe visual loss which affects approximately 30 million individuals worldwide and can be prevented with timely screening, detection and treatment; however, even in high-income countries, access to yearly eye examinations is limited to only one-third to one-half of adults with diabetes, leaving a substantial number of patients at risk [1] . In the USA, only about 60% of people with diabetes have recommended yearly screenings for diabetic retinopathy; in some community-based studies, that rate is even lower [2] ; in middle-to low-income countries, where access to ophthalmic care is generally limited, the rate of individuals with diabetes who have access to eye examinations is remarkably low [3] . In Brazil, primary health care is developed through forms of teamwork composed of a physician, a nurse, nursing assistants and community agents of health, aiming to assist populations defined by basic health units (""Unidade Básica de Saúde""-UBSs). In turn, the UBS is responsible for support and infrastructure; since there is no availability of an ophthalmologist in the medical staff of most UBSs, diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening is performed in secondary care units [4] ; hence, the waiting time for an appointment is often increased, causing DR monitoring and timely treatment to be extremely difficult.Teleophthalmology programs have facilitated the identification of DR cases by utilizing digital retinal imaging [5] ; additionally, teleophthalmology based on mobile imaging units can ameliorate DR screening and decrease the possibility of poor compliance or lost follow-up appointments [6] . The combination of teleophthalmology with portable devices may further increase access to eye care in underserved populations. The importance of the teleophthalmology strategy lies on decreasing the burden on the health system, referring to specialized care only those individuals with treatable conditions and allowing timely treatment to prevent diabetic blindness. Hence, image quality is paramount to the success of the screening program, as low-quality images will not yield diagnosis, making necessary an evaluation by the specialist.Handheld cameras are increasingly available for diabetic retinopathy screening, having several advantages over traditional tabletop cameras, such as increased portability and decreased cost, with the potential of improving DR screening rates [1] . For optimal image quality, training in image acquisition and ocular media transparence are needed.The present study was designed to evaluate diabetic retinopathy screening with a portable retinal camera and telemedicine in a primary healthcare urban setting. The learning curve for image acquisition, performed by non-medical healthcare personnel without previous experience on retinal imaging, was also evaluated.This study enrolled 627 individuals aged over 18 years with a previous type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis who were treated in a UBS on the outskirts of the city of São Paulo. Non-inclusion criteria were not adopted. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the institutional ethics committees (#3050387 and #3141417). After being informed of the risks of pupil dilation, generally consisting of transient ocular discomfort, blurry vision and photophobia, participants signed the informed consent, were assessed for demographic, clinical and biochemical features and had the anterior and posterior ocular segments of both eyes photographed after mydriasis (Fig. 1) .Clinical and demographic data analysis shows that the population was composed by 63.2% female individuals, age median of 66 years, diabetes duration 10.7 ± 8.2 years and HbA1c 7.7 ± 1.9% (61 + 20.8 mmol/mol). The most prevalent associated comorbidities were arterial hypertension (80.3%) and dyslipidemia (50.2%).A smartphone-based handheld device (Eyer, Phelcom Technologies, São Carlos, Brazil) was used for retinal image acquisition according to a previous protocol used in the Brazilian multicenter study of diabetic retinopathy [7] , and photographs of the anterior and posterior ocular segments were obtained for both eyes, after mydriasis induced by two 1% tropicamide eye drops. Two 45 o images of the posterior segment, one field centered on the fovea and the other field centered on the optic disk of each fundus, were captured. The professionals responsible for image acquisition were a team of four nurses involved in diabetes care in their own basic health unit, without previous experience in this kind of procedure. They underwent a four-hour training about image protocol and acquisition procedure by an ophthalmologist, and thereafter, they started performing retinal imaging and relied on the continuous remote feedback given by the specialist as images were interpreted. Image acquisition occurred from February 6 to March 14, 2020, comprising a 5-week period, in non-consecutive days.Remote image reading was performed in a store-andforward approach at EyerCloud platform (Phelcom Technologies, São Carlos, Brazil) by the same retinal specialist (FKM). First, the photographs of patients' retinas were evaluated by quality and classified as gradable or ungradable images. Subsequently, diabetic retinopathy classification was performed for those with gradable images, and patients with ungradable images had their anterior ocular segment images assessed regarding the presence of cataracts or other media opacities. Whenever the severity of cataract or of other media opacity precluded fundus evaluation, the patient would be considered as referable for ophthalmologic evaluation. When ocular media had enough transparence to allow DR grading, each patient was categorized according to the most affected eye, in accordance with the American Diabetes Association criteria [8] : non-referable (absent or mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic maculopathy) or referable (severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; presence of macular edema in at least one eye). Table 1 presents the retinal lesions found at each DR classification level [7] . The images with poor quality for reasons other than media opacities and also images from patients who did not comply with the proposed protocol, for example, by lack of image fields or image taken of non-representative fields, were considered as protocol failure; such patients were also referred for ophthalmological evaluation. To evaluate the image acquisition learning curve, a specific analysis was performed regarding each day of examination, and the daily rate of patients successfully evaluated by teleophthalmology, regarding the presence of media opacities, DR classification and presence of maculopathy, was calculated. Furthermore, information concerning the duration of examination per patient was collected.Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS/STAT software. An ANOVA one-way model and Fisher's exact test were applied to compare variables, and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was employed for the comparison between patients' groups; p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Six hundred and twenty-seven individuals with T2DM underwent retinal evaluation by the smartphone-based handheld device. The photographs allowed a clinical decision in 509 (81.2%) patients, who either had their diabetic retinopathy graded (439) or presented with ocular media opacities that supported their referral to the specialist (70). In the remaining 118 patients (18.8%), images were ungradable for causes other than ocular media opacities, such as inadequate technique or frames that did not comply with the proposed protocol; those patients were referred. Patients who were referred because of media opacities comprised 61 cases of cataracts and 9 cases of vitreous, corneal or posterior capsule opacities. Among the 439 gradable patients, DR classification was as follows: 333 with no DR, 40 with nonreferable DR and 66 with referable DR. Overall, a total of 373 patients had no indication for specialist referral because of DR and/or ocular media opacities (Fig. 2) . There was no adverse reaction to mydriatic drops.Except for HbA1c, all other clinical and demographic variables were not different regarding DR classification, as shown in Table 2 .The learning curve of image acquisition was evaluated according to the rate of patients whose images allowed clinical decision on daily basis. All images for the present study were collected along 16 non-consecutive days; from the 7th day onward, the rate of patients whose images allowed clinical decision was maintained above 80%, as shown in Graphic 1. Examination duration per patient had an average time of 2.5 + 1.7 min (median 2.0, maximum 15 min).In a sub-analysis, the patients were divided into two groups: those in whom DR could be graded or who had media opacities detected by the examination (images allowed a clinical decision) and those whose images were ungradable for causes other than ocular media opacities; clinical and technical variables were compared between these groups. Patients whose images did not yield were older (p = 0.04), and examination duration for image acquisition was longer (p < 0.001); other parameters such as gender, HbA1c and duration of diabetes did not reach statistical significance.After a brief training and a short learning curve, healthcare professionals without previous experience on retinal imaging acquisition performed well, attaining after 7 days a rate of over 80% of examined patients whose examination allowed clinical decision. The training, the image protocol and the remote reading, together with a short examination time, showed that image acquisition with a portable device associated with teleophthalmology is a feasible strategy for DR and cataract screening in patients with diabetes who dwell in an urban area and are followed in a primary healthcare setting. DR screening programs have been implemented with success over the last decades in several countries, resulting in lower rates of diabetic blindness [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Adequate image quality is a major factor upon which the success of the screening strategy is dependent [14] , and we hereby present favorable results and a high rate of clinical yield attained after a brief training and subsequent continuous remote feedback. Of note is the previous lack of experience of the trained team, as previous reports have presented high-quality rates obtained with experienced personnel [1, 15, 16] . The sustainability and cost-effectiveness of screening programs are also fundamental for its implementation and success; to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first report on the performance of low-cost, portable handheld devices for DR screening in an urban setting in Brazil, a continent-sized country with very heterogeneous socioeconomic realities and an uneven distribution of ophthalmologists [17] , home to the fifth biggest diabetic population in the world [18] and also to the largest public free and chronically underfinanced healthcare system [19] . Multiple socioeconomic barriers prevent access to eye examination in the poor regions of Brazil [3] . Recently, several authors have proposed teleophthalmology to increase access in Brazil and elsewhere, with favorable cost-effectiveness results and a reduced burden to specialized services [3, 16, 17] , in both geographically isolated [15] and highly urbanized areas [20] .In the present study, we propose a decision tree based not only on DR grading, but also on the presence of ocular media opacities. Systematic evaluation of the anterior segment is not universally performed in teleophthalmology strategies of DR screening [15, 16] , and the presence of cataracts is usually considered a flaw in such strategies, as lens opacities frequently preclude DR classification [21] ; some screening protocols propose the exclusion of patients with cataracts [22] . However, by evaluating anterior segment images, the reader is able to judge whether cataracts are the reason for ungradable fundus images, which is a clinically relevant information, as cataracts are a significant public health issue and an important cause of blindness in developing countries [23] . We believe that grouping cataract and referable DR patients is effective in providing proper health care for those individuals; cataract referral and treatment in patients with diabetes should follow a special protocol because of the increased risk of ocular complications in such patients. The patients enrolled for diabetic retinopathy screening with a portable retinal camera adequately represent the population with DM2 treated in primary health care, characterized by the predominance of the elderly, mostly women, diabetes duration over 10 years and regular glycemic control. Arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most prevalent comorbidities associated with DM [24] . We observed that patients with referable DR had higher HbA1c than those with DR absent or non-referable, while other clinical and demographic variables were similar. The association between poor glycemic control and severity and progression of retinopathy is well established in the literature, in addition to diabetes duration, nephropathy, hypertension and dyslipidemia [8] . Further, DR has been related to the development of macrovascular complications of diabetes, specifically, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and peripheral complications [25] . Our results also showed that the imaging protocol had a poorer diagnostic yield in older patients, who have also experienced a longer duration of the examination. Ocular characteristics such as impaired pupil dilation may have played a role, even though the images acquisition has been done after pharmacological mydriasis.This study's strengths are its ""real-life"" approach, since it was performed during ongoing health care by a team of nurses in a primary care setting, and the feasibility of a protocol that involves a handheld device and a telemedicine approach, offering the perspective of DR screening with mobile units and home evaluation. Such strategy potentially increases access in underserved areas, concomitantly offering a safer alternative to individuals with diabetes, considering the vulnerability brought by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: Mobile units can ultimately reduce the number of patients' travels and contacts; furthermore, image acquisition with such devices is compatible with physically distancing between the patient and the operator and may even be performed outdoors. Regarding study limitations, it should be pointed out that only patients who dwell in an urban area were evaluated; furthermore, other ophthalmological evaluation modalities, such as visual acuity measurement, slitlamp examination or optical coherence tomography, were not available, thus limiting the conclusions on diabetic maculopathy.Our data point to the feasibility of a low-cost DR screening strategy which involves training of non-specialized healthcare personnel, a handheld device and telemedicine. Such protocol is compatible with the Family Health Strategy, with the potential to increase the coverage of DR screening in underserved areas; the possibility of mobile units is also relevant as an alternative to clinical examination for DR screening in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A major challenge is to provide timely treatment for detected cases of sight-threatening DR and cataract.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-04,8
873a85e3466a742246635f4e3bd86128ddb34003,Forecast predictions for the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil by statistical modeling using the Weibull distribution for daily new cases and deaths,"Since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, in January 30, 2020, more than ten million cases of the disease and more than 600,000 deaths related with the infection by SARS-CoV2 virus were registered worldwide. The impacts of COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) are of great concern [1, 2] , since these countries present a large percentage of the population living in overcrowded conditions, with deficient access to clean water and sanitizers, among other factors that limit people living in LMICs to follow the public health advices on how to reduce the spread of the virus [3] . Although Brazil has the World ninth larger gross domestic product [4] , 42% of the Brazilian population live with less than 10 USD per day and more than ten million Brazilians live in extreme poverty [5] . As in other countries, poverty and social inequality are being aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Brazil occupies now the second place in number of registered COVID-19 cases [6] . Forecast predictions made by the Imperial College (London, UK) present Brazil as the country with the highest rate of transmission and one of the countries where a large number of deaths are expected from, on next weeks [7] . The health crisis is sharpened by a political crisis, depicted by two changes of the Health Minister in less than 1 month [8] , and by Federal government authorities constantly denying the severity of COVID-19 pandemic and the scientific consensus on the lockdown and social distancing measures [9] .Forecast predictions configure a pivotal strategy for decision-making in the evaluation of measures against COVID-19 [10] [11] [12] [13] and should be closely considered by governments and health authorities. In this work, we have used the Weibull distribution on the number of daily new cases and deaths data of COVID-19 to predict the evolution of the pandemic [12] . The Weibull distribution is one of the most commonly used parametric lifetime models [14] , mostly for its parsimony, its ability to satisfactorily model data which are commonly encountered in survival analysis, and its availability in statistical software packages [15, 16] . A parameter called Diagnostic-Death lag (DDlag), given by the temporal distance, in days, between the peak of daily new cases and the peak of daily new deaths, which strongly correlates with the lethality rate (LR) of COVID-19, was calculated for Brazil's official data. DDlag represents the average time between the diagnostic of new infections and patient deaths due to the diagnosed disease. Intuitively, one could suppose that the more efficient are the detection and the health care delivered to patients, the larger DDlag would be. DDlag can be used to predict COVID-19 evolution and to evaluate its LR, as well as to infer the level of underreported cases of COVID-19 [12] . We took in account four distinct scenarios based in the daily number of new deaths, considering the maximum of 1250, 1500, 1750, and 2000 daily new deaths at the maximum turning point of the curve. Because our predictions are based in the number of daily new deaths, it can be daily reviewed aiming to evaluate the measures further taken to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, such as lockdowns and mass testing and, also, when these measures should be reformulated.Data on Brazil's daily and total number of confirmed cases and deaths were obtained from the Our World in Data Project [6] as comma-spaced values (CSV) files, processed in MS Excel 2019 and exported to Sigma Plot 14.0, with the aim to build scatter and regression plots. Data fitting was performed by non-linear regression through SigmaPlot, using the Dynamic Fit Wizard Tool. The curve fitter uses the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm to fit the data by the least squares method [17] . The following starting values were used for the fit calculations: t 0 = 100, β = 200, η = 100, step = 1, and tolerance = 10 −10 , using the built-in 4-parameter Weibull distribution (Eq. 1), described as:where t is the time in days; f(t) is the number of new cases or new deaths as a function of t; t 0 is the time where the maximum of the projected peak is observed (maximum number of daily cases or deaths, or maximum turning point); α is the value of f(t) at t 0 ; β and η are Weibull's shape and scale parameters, respectively. Values of α, t 0, β and η were calculated in order to find the best fit to t and f(t) data. Although this is a built-in SigmaPlot equation named by the software as 4parameter Weibull peak equation, it is, indeed, derived from the Weibull 4-parameter density function in which the location parameter was substituted by t 0 −η β−1 β 1 β in order to put the parameters α and t 0 in evidence.Since the Diagnostic-Death lag (DDlag) expresses the temporal distance between the peak of daily new diagnosed cases and the peak of daily new deaths, it could be calculated by the difference of the Weibull t 0 parameter computed from cases and death curves, determined as [12] :where Δt 0 = DDlag, t C 0 is the value of t on the maximum turning point of the daily new cases curve, and t D 0 is the value of t on the maximum turning point of daily new deaths curve (mode). The correlation between DDlag and LR was determined by the analysis of Weibull projections on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19 in many countries, as shown in a previous work [12] . This correlation responds to a logarithm function given by:As the curves for daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19 in Brazil are still in the exponential growth phase, it was not possible to determine when-and how much cases and deaths withthe maximum turning point will be reached (data not shown). Thus, the forecast predictions in this work were performed in four distinct prospective scenarios, based on the maximum number of daily new deaths for COVID-19 registered at the peak (maximum turning point). Such scenarios were arbitrarily chosen taking into account the actual number of daily deaths and possible worsening situations for near future: scenario a: 1250, scenario b: 1500; scenario c: 1750, and scenario d: 2000 deaths per day at a maximum turning point. Data of daily new cases and daily new deaths for COVID-19 in Brazil were fit as described above. Calculations for each scenario were performed with addition of constrains for the values of α in Eq. 1, corresponding to the number of daily new deaths at the maximum turning point for each scenario.The lethality rate (LR) of COVID-19 was calculated as the relation between the cumulative number of cases and deaths, as:where α C is the total number of cases and α D is the total number of deaths. The estimation of the safe date to start relaxing lockdown measures in Brazil was done empirically, based on the observation of the relaxing measures in other countries, indexed by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). OxCGRT systematically collects information on several different common policy responses that governments have taken to respond to the pandemic on 17 indicators such as school closures and travel restrictions [6] . Most of the countries that faced COVID-19 epidemic on January or on early February start to ease lockdown measures in the beginning of May. For instance, Spain, Italy, and Germany presented the first easing measures on May 3; Portugal and Belgium on May 4; France, Netherlands, and Canada on May 10; and so on. The numbers of daily new cases and daily new deaths in some of those countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) when they start to ease the lockdown measuresevaluated by the decrease of the OxCGRT indexwere around 20 cases per million habitants and 3 deaths per million habitants in average, respectively (precisely 21 ± 11 daily cases/million and 3.3 ± 1.8 daily deaths/million), as extracted from data in Oxford's Our World in Data Project [6] .In Brazil, with actual population of 209.5 million habitants, if one considers that 20 cases per million habitants and/or 3 daily deaths per million habitants as a threshold to start easing stay-at-home requirements, it would correspond to 628 deaths and 4190 cases, respectively. We do not have theoretical fundaments to evaluate if this number can be safely considered a base for health measures against COVID-19 pandemics. However, purely based on the examples previously described for other countries, we used these numbers in this work to project dates to start easing the stay-at-home requirements in Brazil. The dates in which Brazil will present less than 628 daily new deaths and/or less than 4190 daily new cases can be estimated by calculating the value of t that gives these value as f(t) in Eq. 1, with the respective constants for each scenario.Errors presented here were calculated from asymptotic errors and from coefficients of determination (R 2 ) given by the software fitter. Error propagation was done as by regular rules [18] .Data on cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazil were extracted from Our World in Data Project on Coronavirus [6] and used to perform forecast prediction of the COVID-19 epidemics in Brazil. Analysis of the epidemic data in many countries displays that the LR of COVID-19 evolves following a common behavior. LR of COVID-19 in Brazil was calculated using the number of cumulative deaths divided by the number of cumulative cases, as shown in ""Material and methods."" The first case in Brazil was registered on February 26. Since then, the LR for COVID-19 in Brazil has grown until it reaches a constant value around May 13, when it displayed a slight decrease (Fig. 1 ). This behavior of the LR is similar to those observed for most countries, in which the LR raises up to the peak of the epidemic and then maintain stable or with a slight decrease (data not shown). Figure 1 shows that percent LR for COVID-19 in Brazil reached 4.68 ± 0.01%. This value was used to estimate the maximum number of daily new cases at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic curve from the number of daily new deaths chosen for each scenario by applying Eq. 4 (see ""Material and methods"").Brazil is still facing an exponential growth of daily new deaths and cases, what does not permit acceptable predictions on when the curve is going to bend. However, taking into account four distinct scenarios based on the maximum turning point of the Weibull prediction curve of daily new deaths for COVID-19 in Brazil, it was possible to draw non-linear regression curves depicting the forecast predictions on the number of daily new deaths in every day, until the end of the epidemic. Figure 2 shows the plots of the number of daily new deaths and cases as a function of time, in days. Values of the number of daily new cases at the maximum turning points for each scenario were calculated with Eq. 4 from the LR observed in Fig. 1 (0.468) . Thus, panels a to d show scatter plots based on data for daily new cases and deaths, and line plots based on the results of the Weibull predictions of these data for each scenario, being the scenario a the most optimistic and the scenario d the most pessimistic. Numbers of daily new deaths and daily new cases at the maximum turning points, calculated with Eq. 4 for each scenario, are as follows: panel a, 1250 daily deaths and 26,709 daily cases; panel b, 1500 daily deaths and 32,051 daily cases; panel c, 1750 daily deaths and 37,393 daily cases; and panel d, 2000 daily deaths and 42,735 daily cases (parameter α at Eq. 1).The forecast projections were done by using the Weibull distribution to fit the number of daily new cases and deaths for COVID-19 in Brazil. Each panel in Fig. 2 shows projections Fig. 1 Evolution of the lethality rate (LR) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. LR is given by the number of cumulative deaths divided by the number of cumulative cases. Points were fit within Weibull's density function equation for the number of daily new cases in traced lines and for the number of daily new deaths in solid lines. It was possible, from fit curves and from β and η parameters, to predict the date at the maximum turning points of the curves, given by t 0 in Eq. 1. Thus, the total number of deaths and cases at the end of pandemic could be determined by the areas under the fit curves, as well as the predicted numbers of daily new cases and deaths at a forward day in the future, by the value of f(t) for such day (t).As shown in Fig. 2 , as we move to more pessimistic scenarios (from panel a to panel d), not only the heights of the peaks increase, and the dates at the maximum turning points tend to shift to latter times, but also the lasting of the peak tails becomes longer. Both the increase of the height of the peak and the elongation of the peak tail would contribute to the raise of the overall death toll for COVID-19 in Brazil. The y-axis scales of the plots in Fig. 2 were calibrated to match the number of new daily cases (left y-axis) and the number of daily new deaths (right y-axis) at the turning points of the regression curves (traced lines for daily cases and solid lines for daily deaths). With this view, plots in Fig. 2 visually reflect DDlag as the distance between the solid and the traced lines.DDlag could be calculated from curve fit parameters in Fig.  2 by applying Eq. 2, as well as the overall death toll of COVID-19 from the area under the curve. Table 1 summarizes the main results estimated from Fig. 2 . As shown, DDlag for COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil varies from 7.3 to 17.5 days from the most optimistic scenario (a) to the most pessimistic scenario (d), respectively. Additionally, the overall death toll of COVID-19 in the most optimistic scenario (a) is 78,347 deaths, though it increases successively up to 176,757 deaths in the most pessimistic scenario (d). Yet, it was possible to estimate, from fit curves in Fig. 2 , the date in which the number of daily new deaths would decrease to less than 3 new daily deaths and/or 20 new daily cases per million habitant (i.e., less than 628 and 4190 deaths and cases per day, respectively, for the population of Brazil). These values were arbitrary taken as examples from other countries that started to relax the lockdown measures when they presented, in average, about 3 new deaths and 20 new cases per million habitants per day (see ""Material and methods""). As displayed in Table 1 , the forecast predictions presented here estimate that Brazil would present less than 3 deaths per million habitants per day, in the most optimistic scenario (a), on July 5. However, if the curve for daily number of new deaths is not going to bend soon, i.e., if the country would present an increase in the number of new daily deaths in the next days, that date might be shifted up to August 29 in the most pessimistic scenario (d). At last, predictions for the date in which Brazil may present less than 20 cases per million habitants per day are presented in Table 1 . These predictions are quite distinct from those estimated by the number of daily new deaths. We believe that it is due to the decrease of the LR of COVID-19 in Brazil observed since May 22 (Fig. 1) , what will be further discussed below.COVID-19 is a global health emergency that is going to change the way in which people, institutions, and governments manage their lives and duties. The fact that there is no known specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 until now raises the importance of behavioral strategies, such as social distancing, lockdowns [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , and mass testing [24] [25] [26] [27] in the fight against the pandemic. Data analysis can be of outstanding importance during disease outbreaks, mainly if fast decision-making is crucial to slow down the spread of the disease. The prediction of the course of COVID-19 pandemic in highly affected countries is considered a live-saving demand [28, 29] . Our results show that the LR of COVID-19 in Brazil rose since the beginning of pandemic and reached 0.070 (or 7.0%) on May 22. After that, the LR starts to decrease until it reaches 0.0468 (or 4.68%) on June 21. This decrease was due to a rapid growth in the number of daily new cases, mainly after June 1. In almost every country, the LR of COVID-19 tends to remain constant toward the epidemic peak (data not shown). Thus, this decrease of LR observed in Brazil could be indicative that an increase of daily new deaths might be observed in the next days, following the rapid increase of the number of daily new registered cases.It has been previously demonstrated that there is a correlation between LR and DDlag for many countries in which the COVID-19 pandemic is become controlled. Those countries are already experiencing the descendent phase of the curve for daily new cases and daily new deaths. DDlag has been shown to be an efficient, empiric parameter to evaluate the overall results of several factors that may affect the spread of COVID-19. As DDlag displayed a strong correlation with the LR, it can be used as a tool to evaluate the level of sub-notification, as well as the efficacy of measures taken in response to the epidemic [12] . This correlation is represented by Eq. 3 and can be used to estimate DDlag from LR and vice versa. Actually (June 21), the LR of COVID-19 in Brazil is 0.0468 (Fig. 1) . This LR value would correspond, second Eq. 3, to a DDlag of 14.1 days. This value of DDlag is compatible with, in average, those ones calculated for scenarios c (1750 deaths per day) and d (2000 deaths per day) ( Table 1 ). Figure 2 shows predictions for the course of COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil in four prospective scenarios based on the number of daily new deaths. Although the number of daily deaths is around 1200, while these lines are written (June 21), the rapid increase in the number of daily new cases on last weeks made the firstand more optimistic scenario (a)to be less probable, since the number of daily new cases today is already out of the fit curve (Fig. 2a, black circles) . Weibull distribution fits the actual data for daily new cases with similar precision in scenarios b and c (R 2 = 0.87), what prevents a precise prediction on which scenario is the most probable. However, DDlag value, estimated by applying LR in Eq. 3, points to a prospective scenario that lies between 1750 and 2000 daily new deaths (scenarios c and d, respectively).In this work, we based on the measures taken by the governments of countries that faced the COVID-19 pandemic on January or early February to estimate criteria for suggesting the easing of stay-at-home measures in Brazil. The countries that were selected for this sample already started to relax restriction measures, what could be monitored by the OxCGRT index [6] . The day in which the first decrease in the OxCGRT index was observed, in such countries, was used as a landmark for the starting date of relaxing restriction measures (see ""Material and methods""). Based on this, it was possible to determine, from Weibull fit curves in Fig. 2 , the date in which it would be registered less than 628 deaths per day (3 deaths per million habitants) and/or less than 1490 cases per day (20 cases per million habitants) of COVID-19 in Brazil. Table 1 displays the estimated dates in which Brazil would present less than 628 daily deaths and less than 1490 daily cases, as well as the total death toll at the end of COVID-19 pandemics, for each scenario. As shown, considering the criteria described above, Brazil would present conditions for start to ease restriction measures on July 5, in the most optimistic scenario (a). This prediction date may be extended up to August 29 as the epidemic scenario is changed to the most pessimistic one (d).As shown in Table 1 , the higher the number of daily new deaths at the turning point of the peak, the longer it will last for Brazil to register less than 3 deaths per million habitants per day and to safely relax the stay-at-home measures. Consequently, the higher will be the death toll at the end of pandemic. Measuring the correlation between t 0 values for the number of daily new deaths (open circles) and the overall death tall (Table 1) , it is possible to estimate that each additional day that Brazil takes to bend the daily new deaths curve adds more 1685 deaths to the overall death toll of COVID-19 in Brazil (R 2 = 0.9890). Many papers have been published on the importance of lockdown measure, but little effort has been dedicated to what are the best criteria to be taken into account to decide the right moment of relaxing quarantine, lockdown, and social isolation measures. There is no consensus on the right time to ease, or finish, the lockdown measures toward COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, each country responds in a particular way, taking into account many subjective criteria. Rawson and coworkers have used a Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model to evaluate two potential lockdown release strategies, as well as the best moment to apply them, in order to limit recurrent spread of the disease [30] . In that work, it has been suggested that the first relaxing measures should be taken 2 weeks after the end of the infection peak, what may occur even months after the maximum turning point of new deaths and new cases. In the present work, we did not use scientific or technical criteria to determine the conditions in which the relaxation of stay-at-home measures can safely begin. Criteria adopted here were merely based on the example of selected countries measures and, thus, may be carefully evaluated and, also, equalized with other criteria, before to be considered by health authorities and decision-makers.Weibull distribution showed to be very reliable for data analysis on COVID-19 epidemics, mainly when applied in daily new cases and deaths. Predictions based on daily data are especially efficient because they can be continuously revised, offering to governments and to health authorities the opportunity of re-conducting their decisions as new data become available. We believe that such predictions can be used by decision-makers in order to define strategies to fight COVID-19, both in the present days and in the near future. Still more, these results depict the primal importance of reinforcing the strict surveillance measures in Brazil, such as hardening lockdown measures, increasing the number of performed tests, and improving the quality of health services and work conditions of health professionals. These measures might be taken in order to flat the infection curve, i.e., the curves for daily new deaths and cases in view to mitigate the social and economic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil.Acknowledgments Thanks are due to Dr. Ricardo Portela for the critical reading of the manuscript and to Dr. Gilson Carvalho for valuable discussions of the theme.Author contributions The author has gained full consent from the responsible authorities at the institute/organization where the work has been carried out.Funding information This work was supported by the author's own resources.Conflict of interest The author declares that there is no conflict of interest.Consent to participate Not applicable.

b438f159c5ef3ee64d0256940c8e72159c415e59,Title: Prediction of non-canonical routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection in human placenta cells Short title: Mediators of SARS-CoV-2 placental infection,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1) . It was first notified at the end of 2019, in Wuhan, China, and become a worldwide pandemic (2) . At the beginning of July, six months later, COVID-19 infected over 12 million people and is the cause of approximately 557,000 deaths worldwide (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).Older age, laboratory abnormalities, and several comorbidities are associated with the more severe cases of COVID-19 (3) . For specific groups of COVID-19 patients, for example, pregnant women, the potential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains mostly unknown, and data are limited. However, considering previous works reporting coronaviruses infections (4), pregnant women are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to physiological changes in the immune, cardiorespiratory, and metabolic systems (5) .Although only a small number of maternal viruses infections are transmitted to the fetus, some may cause life-threatening diseases (6) . These viruses use cellular host entry mediators expressed by placenta cells, as described for the cytomegalovirus and the Zika virus (7, 8) , to infect these cells. The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak, associated with fetal brain damage, emphasizes the necessity of further characterization and understanding placental infection or intrauterine (vertical) transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the possible adverse fetal outcomes. The few studies on the subject have provided contradictory findings, with some reports suggesting no evidence of placental infection or vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (9) (10) (11) . Conversely, multiple lines of evidence have shown placental SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women diagnosed with moderate to severe COVID-19. Neonates born from mothers with COVID-19 presented a positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG (12, 13) . While the IgG can be transferred from mother to fetus across the placenta, the detection of IgM in newborns suggests a vertical transmission of the virus, since IgM cannot cross the placental barrier due to its high molecular mass (14) . Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA transmission was comprehensively confirmed by pathological and virological investigations. (15) Also, it was recently shown SARS-CoV-2 particles in syncytiotrophoblast with generalized inflammation, diffuse perivillous fibrin depositions, and tissue damage in an asymptomatic woman (16) . Remarkably, these placental alterations due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection lead to fetal distress and neonatal multi-organ failure. These results highlight the importance of exploring the expression profile of potential host mediators of the SARS-CoV-2 that may create a permissive microenvironment to placental infection and possible vertical transmission of the virus.In fact, like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 requires diverse host cellular factors for infection and replication. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the canonical receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) for viral attachment (17) . This process is followed by S protein priming by cellular transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that allows the fusion of the virus with host cellular membranes (17) . Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has demonstrated that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in multiple tissues affected by COVID-19, including airway epithelial cells, cornea, digestive and urogenital systems (18) . Few cells express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta (18, 19) , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to infect the placenta through the canonical cell entry mediators. Therefore, other host interacting proteins may play a role in the biological cycle of the virus and contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta. In this paper, we demonstrate, through transcriptomic (microarray and scRNA-Seq) analysis and in silico predictions of virus-host protein-protein interactions, that cells of the syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblast express high levels of potential non-canonical cell-entry mediators dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and cathepsin L (CTSL), despite low-levels of We first investigated the gene expression in placental tissues of classical host-virus interacting proteins described in the literature. The canonical entry receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were low expressed throughout gestation. CTSL, which is translated into a lysosomal cysteine proteinase that plays a role in intracellular protein catabolismpresented the highest level of expression in the placenta during the first, second, and third trimester. Similarly, DPP4, which is translated into an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein, was highly expressed throughout gestation ( Figure 1A ).Next, we analyzed the gene expression profile during gestation in placental tissues. We found 25 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the second trimester, and 687 DEGs in the third, when they were independently compared to the first trimester (Supplementary Table 1 ). All DEGs were divided into three clusters by the K-means clustering analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A) . Cluster 1 includes genes that increase expression during pregnancy, and these genes enriched terms related to blood vessels morphogenesis, complement cascade, extracellular matrix organization, and cellular response to nitrogen compounds. Cluster 2 encompasses genes that increase expression specifically in the third trimesters, which are related to female pregnancy, growth hormone signaling pathway, homeostasis, and steroid biosynthetic process. Cluster 3 includes genes that decrease expression during pregnancy. and these genes enriched terms related to cell division, sulfur compounds biosynthetic process, chromosomal segregation, PID MYC active pathway Table 1 ). Next, we selected the human proteins potentially interacting with SARS-CoV using the P-HIPSter database. We found 32 virushost interacting proteins of SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table 4 ), and nine virus-host interacting proteins of the ZIKV (Supplementary Table 5 ). We also found that, from these list of virus-host interacting proteins, 10 DEGs (DAAM1, FRMD3, STX3, HBD, PRKCZ, CTK3, PAICS, EVL, TREM2, and HBE1) are translated into proteins that interact with SARS-CoV proteins, and one with the ZIKV (Supplementary Figures 1F and 1G ).Among these 10 DEGs, six were up-regulated (DAAM1, FRMD3, STX3, HBD, PRKCZ, and CTK3) and four (PAICS, EVL, TREM2, and HBE1) were down-regulated in the third trimester ( Figure 1B) . The gene DAAM1, which is translated into an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein implicated in cell motility, adhesion, cytokinesis, and cell polarity -showed the highest level of fold change in the third trimester of gestation compared to the first (logFC= 1.43; Figure 1B ). The host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPI) predicted for these 10 DEGs presented a Likelihood Ratio (LR) > 100 (Supplementary Table 6 ), according to P-HIPSTer (21) . Noteworthy, PAICS transcript, which is translated into an enzyme that catalyzes the sixth and seventh steps of the novo purine biosynthesis, were predicted to interact with both SARS-CoV and ZIKV ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 7) . We observed a significant interaction of placental proteins predicted to interact with SARS-CoV-2 (based on the DEGs or not), and PAICS was also predicted to interact with other proteins in the PPI network with the highest degree (Figure 1C and   Supplementary Table 8) .We next used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the expression of the 10 DEGs translated into proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV in human placental cells ( Supplementary Figures 1H and 1I) . We selected the genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL, DPP4, PAICS, and DAAM1 for further investigations using scRNA-seq transcriptome data from cells of the syncytiotrophoblast (n=1144), villous cytotrophoblast (n=8244), and extravillous trophoblast (n=2170) of non-disease human placental tissues, considering the potential relevance of these genes for SARS-CoV infection and replication in the organ ( Figure 1D) . We noticed that the expression of the classical SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor genes (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was minimally expressed in these cells. In contrast, potential non-canonical cell entry mediator genes DPP4 and CTSL, as well as the genes for the predicted virus-host interaction proteins DAAM1, and PAICS were expressed at higher levels ( Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 2A) . We also looked for the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with DPP4, CTSL, DAAM1, and PAICS by using scRNA-Seq in these same cells (Figure 2 ). This analysis revealed that DPP4, CTSL, DAAM1, and PAICS are co-expressed at high-levels, while these genes are co-express at low levels with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figure 2) . Remarkably, we found only three cells co-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2. For this reason, we consider that DPP4, CTSL, DAAM1, and PAICS may represent candidates of an alternative route for SARS-CoV-2 infection in human placentas.We used The Human Protein Atlas to predict the subcellular location of proteins encoded by our candidates. DPP4 is predicted as intracellular, membrane, and secreted protein;CTSL is a protein located in the Golgi apparatus and additionally in vesicles; PAICS is a protein found in the cytosol while DAAM1 is located in the plasma membrane and cytosol ( Figure 1E) . Finally, we analyzed the gene expression profile of ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL, DPP4, DAAM1, and PAICS genes on publicly available scRNA-Seq datasets of lung, liver, and thymus fetal tissues. CTSL, DPP4, and DAAM1 were found as highly expressed in fetal cells compared to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in all tissues analyzed (Supplementary Figure 2) .Additional investigations may determine the generality and impact of these findings, including the confirmation of vertical transmission.women diagnosed with moderate to severe COVID-19 (15, 22) with findings supporting the possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (15, 23) . However, few placenta cells express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (18, 19) further demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can use CTSB and CTSL as well as TMPRSS2 for priming host cells (26, 27) . These data provide evidence that CTSL is a potentially promising treatment for COVID-19 by blocking coronavirus host cell entry and intracellular replication (28) . Secondly, we analyzed whether placental development and growth are associated with transcriptional changes in proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV. Among the transcripts translated into proteins predicted as interacting with SARS-CoV, DAAM1 increased with placental development and growth. DAAM1 was previously identified as a regulator of bacteria phagocytosis by regulating filopodia formation and phagocytic uptake in primary human macrophages (29) . We predicted that DAAM1 potentially interact with the viral protein encoded from open reading frame 8 (ORF8) and the hypothetical protein sars7a of SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV ORF8 shares the lowest homology with all SARS-CoV-2 proteins; however, it was previously demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 expression was able to selectively target MHC-I for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism in different cell types (30) .We found that PAICS transcript, which is also translated into a protein predicted as interacting with the Nsp3 of SARS-CoV, decreased its levels with placental development and growth. PAICS is an enzyme of de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, which was previously predicted as having a putative interaction with the human influenza A virus (IAV) nucleoprotein and was up-regulated during IAV infection (31) . The putative interaction of Nsp3 with PAICS is relevant. Nsp3 is one of the 16 non-structural proteins in the replicase ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (1, 32) , and binds to virus RNA and proteins, including the nucleocapsid protein (33) . Considering the low-levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 that we found in villous trophoblast cells, our results provide evidence of alternatives cell-entry mediators in the placenta. Moreover, the description of the potential interaction between host and SARS-CoV-2 may provide insights into the mechanisms of placental infection in women with COVID-19.transmission of viruses (34, 35) . Thus, we finally used single-cell analysis of the syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblasts -the fetal component of the placenta -that confirmed the low-levels of expression of the canonical entry receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes (18, 19) . Conversely, we found that these cells express high-levels of DPP4 and CTSL, two potential mediators of SARS-Cov-2 host cell entry (24, 27) that may contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 infection (15, 22, 23) . It is essential to highlight that our scRNA-Seq analysis showed that the non-canonical DPP4 and CTSL entry genes (24, 27) are highly co-expressed in syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblasts cells. The transcripts DAAM1 and PAICS, which are translated into proteins predicted as potentially interacting with SARS-CoV-2, were also highly co-expressed with DPP4 and CTSL. These results demonstrate that, although ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are poorly expressed in the placenta, other mediators that potentially interact with the virus are highly co-expressed in villous trophoblast cells and, therefore, may represent a valuable alternative route for infection and viral replication.Although our in-silico analyses are a starting point, they have limitations. We reanalyzed published placenta datasets with a limited number of samples (microarray = 12 individuals, and scRNA-seq = 5 individuals) and, consequently, validations in a large cohort of samples must be performed. The predicted interactions presented here should also be experimentally validated in infected cells or placenta to circumvent these limitations.Moreover, the analyses of single-cell data should be conducted for the entire period of gestation, considering that we only evaluated single-cell data from the first trimester of pregnancy. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta needs to be performed in a large cohort of pregnant women with COVID-19, including asymptomatics. Considering that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still debated, the follow-up of newborns from mothers with COVID-19 during pregnancy should be necessary since, if it occurs even in the non-asymptomatic, the long-term consequences are mostly unknown.In conclusion, despite low-levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, our analyses demonstrate that villous trophoblast cells express high levels of potential non-canonical cell-entry mediators DDP4 and CTSL. We also found changes in the expression of the DAAM1 and PAICS genes coding for proteins predicted to interact with SARS-CoV proteins during pregnancy. These results provide new insight into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host proteins and indicate that coronaviruses may use multiple mediators for virus infection and replication.We reanalyzed microarray data from villous trophoblast tissues of first (45-59 We used the Metascape tool (https://metascape.org) (37) to perform functional enrichment analysis of the genes lists generated in the clustering and differential expression analyses.SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mediators were selected for first screening using the human proteins already described in the COVID-19 Cell Atlas (https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/) and the literature (18, 24, 27, 38) . Next, we used gene expression data to generated a list of PPIs that potentially interact with human coronaviruses and the ZIKV from the Pathogen-Host Interactome Prediction using Structure Similarity (P-HIPSTer, http://phipster.org/) database (23) (Supplementary Table 4 and 5, respectively). SARS-CoV was included in the analysis considering the evolutionary relationship between the novel SARS-CoV-2 (38) , and ZIKV considering its impact on placental infection and fetal microcephaly (7, 34) .The HumanBase webtool (https://hb.flatironinstitute.org) (39) was used to generate the tissue-specific gene network of placental genes coding for proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV-2 based on P-HIPSTER or that we identified as either associated with COVID-19 or that we hypothesized may be associated with the disease, based on the literature (Supplementary Biorender was used to design cell images (https://app.biorender.com/).All data is available in the manuscript. The images were generated using COVID-19 Cell Atlas (https://www.covid19cellatlas.org)functionalities.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-13,8
356e1a7dc50f9d894acacac55af5f1d35ff7c882,Modelling and Forecasting of COVID-19 Spread using Wavelet-coupled Random Vector Functional Link Networks,"The coronavirus disease-2019 or simply COVID-19 eruption has not only disrupted the global healthcare networks but also it has demised the world economy. More than 690000 people died till date, and the total infected people are growing exponentially day by day as per reports. COVID-19 leads to a rigorous respiratory symptom, and it is linked with highly Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and death. Individuals can turn out to be ill with the infection for 1 to 14 days before symptoms develop. The most widely recognized indications of COVID-19 ailment are fever, exhaustion and dry hack. The malady can be all the more once in a while extreme and even deadly. Older individuals, just as individuals with underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may turn out to be progressively defenceless to extreme illness (Yang et al. 2020). Machine learning (ML) methods have been extensively implemented for diagnosis and prediction of the most common illness, commonly diabetes, hepatitis, cancer, tumours, Parkinson and many more. Hence, the ML models can be a good alternative for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach for early COVID-19 prediction. However, limited pieces of literature are available to our prior knowledge for COVID-19 prediction. The virus is novel, and we all have a little information about its characteristics. The authorities would like to know when this epidemic will come to an end and whether it's going to get worse. Forecasting is therefore very essential, even at the very least indications for consideration of multiple attributes over other societies and the public factors of health. In this case, the forecast using a single model is not enough. Therefore several prediction models need to be implemented so that the most reliable model can be chosen for the forecast. (Fong et al. 2020b ).A short time ago, Herlawati (2020) tried to estimate the spread pattern of COVID-19 using the popular support vector regression (SVR) model with three different kernel functions that include the linear, radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernels. Experimental results reveal that the SVR model with RBF kernel was able to predict the pattern of spread of the global epidemic accurately. Alquaness et al. Table 1 shows selected works on the prediction of COVID-19 using machine learning/ artificial intelligence (AI) models. There are limited data available on outbreaks of COVID-19 epidemics, making predictions widely uncertain. It was evident from the recent studies that the timing and location of the outbreak enabled the virus' fast transmission within an extremely mobile population (Roosa et al. 2020 ). In highly affected countries, in subsequent days of initial transmission of the virus, the governments enforced a lockdown and in hospitals, patients who satisfy the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are isolated immediately. Various machine learning models have been applied to provide both short term and long term forecast of reported cases to tackle the epidemic. These models prediction shows a high level of variations (Chakraborty & Ghosh 2020) . Since the COVID-19 time series data contain both nonlinear and non-stationary trends, it would be critical to make decisions based on a single model. This motivated us to propose an alternative hybridization-based forecasting system. Through incorporating the strengths of two different models, i.e., wavelets and RVFL, the proposed method eliminates the weaknesses of conventional techniques. To handle the nonlinearity and non-stationary trends in datasets, wavelets are very efficient model (Tarar et al. 2018; Hazarika et al. 2020 ). On the other hand, the RVFL is a powerful ML model that adapts the empirical risk minimization principle and shows a high generalization performance. Hence, the main contributions of this work are: Section 2 describes the related works. In Section 3, the proposed WCRVFL model is explained. The experimental study and datasets are explained in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 describes the conclusion of this work in brief.RVFL (Pao et al. 1994 , Zhang & Suganthan 2016 , Borah & Gupta 2019 ) is a special single hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) that was proposed by Pao et al. (1994) , where the output weights are chosen as an adaptable parameter (Tang et al. 2018) . The structure of the RVFL network is presented in Fig 1. Here, the input layer neurons have direct links to the output layer. In addition to the input layer nodes and the output node, there exists some special type of nodes known as the enhancement nodes (ENs) which composite the hidden layer of RVFL network. A suitable activation function (.) a maps the input data to the ENs. is the output target matrix. g denotes the hidden layer output.The RVFL model that has been used in this work solves the following optimization problem:is the augmentation of input and hidden features. The hidden layer output matrix The hidden layer weights are randomly generated. Only the output layer weight vector  is needed to be learned. Typically the above equation can be solved by using the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse (MPPI). Hence, after applying the MPPI, the required solution can be obtained as:Due to its multi-resolution and localization ability in both, time and frequency domain, wavelet analysis presents a more balanced way of decomposing signals. Wavelet analysis helps in localizing the several features of a signal in time. In wavelet transform, the analyzing functions known as wavelets adjust the time width to the respective frequencies in such a way that higher frequency will be narrow while the low-frequency components are wide (Tarar et al. 2018 ). Therefore it can be considered as a more powerful tool compared to Fourier transform (FT) for analyzing the time series data. WT can be majorly classified into two types: (a) Continuous WT and (b) Discrete WT.The CWT of a continuous-time signal ) (t x may be expressed as:where * indicates the complex conjugate and ) (t  indicates the mother wavelet function (Rajaee et al. 2010; Deo et al. 2017) . The dilation factor is represented by a while b is the temporal translation of ). (t  The inverse CWT can be used to reconstruct the signal as,The DWT of a discrete-time signal has the form: are the localization parameter and user-specified dilation step respectively. The original signal can be recreated using the inverse DWT as:Equation (7) can be rewritten in a simplified form as : There are several types of mother wavelets such as Daubechies (Db), Coiflet (Coif), Symlets (Sym), Haar etc. Because of its inherent capability in discovering the time localization information, Db achieves good results in several regression processes such as sediment transport (Tarar et al. 2018 ). On the other hand, the Coif is more symmetrical compared to Db wavelet. Moreover, Sym is the modified version of Db with increase symmetry. Hence the appropriate selection of mother wavelet is dependent on the characteristics and the type of application.This section expresses the proposed WCRVFL network. In the proposed WCRVFL, the time series data based on a daily number of COVID-19 infected people are decomposed using a 1-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (1D DWT). For decomposition, we have used 19 types of wavelets. They are db2, db3, db4, db5, db6, db7, db8, coif2, coif3, coif4, coif5, haar, sym2, sym3, sym4, sym5, sym6, sym7 and sym8. The decomposed data for INDIA dataset using db8, coif2, haar and sym5 are portrayed in All the experiments are performed in a Windows 7 OS computer with 8 GB RAM and 1 TB ROM enriched with i5 processor with a processing speed of 1GHz/second. The MATLAB-2019 software has been used for these experiments. The institutional licensed MATLAB-2019 software has been used for these experiments. The 10-fold cross-validation method is considered for optimal parameter selection. In 10-fold cross-validation, the dataset is split into 10 parts. One part is for training and remaining parts for testing. This process is repeated for 9 more times until all the parts are trained at least once. Moreover, the MATLAB wavelet toolbox was used for implementing the various wavelets. Let x be an input sample. The datasets are also normalized by considering The COVID-19 time series dataset is obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirussource-data. The dataset consists of the cumulative number of cases reported daily for different countries. In this work, we used the data for the top 5 worst-hit countries as per the report on 10 th July 2020. They are Brazil, India, Peru, Russia and the USA. Given the current day, the index is , d the number of cases for   d days is predicted by considering input from past  days, i.e., for 1   d to d days.Ninety days cumulative data starting from 11 th June 2020 to 10 th July 2020 is considered for modelling the COVID-19 spread in 5 countries. For this purpose, the first 60 days data is considered for training and the remaining 30 days for testing. The experimental results of the WCRVFL model are compared with conventional SVR and RVFL model and are exhibited in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively based on R 2 and RMSE. It is revealed from Table 2 and Table 3 that the proposed WCRVFL model shows the best performance in 4 and 4 cases respectively out of the total 5 cases based on R 2 and RMSE respectively. Further the original versus the predicted values over testing data are also portrayed in Table  4 daily for the best RVFL model and the best WCRVFL model. Further to visualize the predicted values over testing data, the original versus predicted data are shown in Fig. 4 for each country. One can say from Table 4 and Fig. 4 that the proposed WCRVFL model has a close relationship with the original data which reveals the efficiency of the WCRVFL model.December 2019 to 10 th July 2020Moreover, table 5 reveals the prediction errors using 9 performance evaluators for the WCRVFL models. Table 6 shows the average ranks based on various evaluators for the WCRVFL network. One can say from Table 5 and Table 6 that the DB8 wavelet shows the best results for 7 evaluators except for MD and LMSE where the best rank is observed in SYM5 and HAAR respectively. To validate the prediction performance of the proposed WCRVFL network, its prediction performance is compared with the conventional SVR and RVFL models. For comparison, we have used the best WCRVFL model for each country based on R 2 and RMSE. The results are shown in Table 7 and Table 8 based on R 2 and RMSE respectively. It is noticeable from Table 7 and Table 8 that the proposed WCRVFL model shows the best performance in 3 and 5 cases respectively out of the total 5 cases based on R 2 and RMSE respectively. Further a statistical analysis is carried out based on the average ranks of the reported models that are tabulated in Table 9 and Table 10 therefore the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, we can proceed with the post-hoc Nemenyi test to pairwise compare the models. According to Demsar (2006), the critical difference (CD) considering 10 . 0  p may be calculated as:It is revealed from the test that the average rank difference between the best-proposed model, i.e., WCRVFL sigmoid activation function with SVR ishence it can be concluded that WCRVFL shows significantly better performance compared to SVR based on R 2 . It can be also observed from Table  9 that WCRVFL shows the best performance in 3 out of 5 cases.Moreover, from therefore the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, we can proceed with the posthoc Nemenyi test to do a pairwise comparison of the models. It is noticeable from Table 10 that WCRVFL shows the best performance in 5 out of 5 cases. It is noticeable from the test that the average rank difference between WCRVFL sigmoid with SVR and RVFL RELU are 4 .3 which are greater than the CD. Hence one can say that WCRVFL shows significantly better performance compared to SVR and RVFL RELU models.Further, the 60 days ahead daily prediction values are plotted in Fig. 5 for the best RVFL model and the best WCRVFL model as a form of a line graph. The best models are chosen based on the best R 2 values obtained from Table 7 . It is distinct from the graph that the Brazil graph (RVFL model) crosses the USA graph (RVFL model) after 7 September which indicates that Brazil might cross the total number of infected people compared to the USA after 7 th September. Also, it is observable that the Brazil line (RVFL model) crosses the USA (WCRVFL model) line after 25 th August which suggests that Brazil might cross the total number of infected people compared to the USA after 25 th September. However, downfall in the line of RUSSIA (Using both RVFL and WCRVFL) and PERU (Using both RVFL and WCRVFL) is noticeable. The line for INDIA (Both RVFL and WCRVFL) shows an increase in the number of infected people on a daily basis. Furthermore, 60 days ahead of daily future prediction values that are obtained by both RVFL and WCRVFL models are tabulated in Table 11 . Additionally, the original data and the 60 days ahead forecast using the best RVFL model based on R 2 value are portrayed in Fig. 6 . The following implications can be obtained from Fig. 6 for different countries using the RVFL networks: a. Brazil: It is observed that the prediction curve grows exponentially which indicates that the number of infected people grows exponentially. b. India: Similar to the Brazil curve, the India curve also shows exponential growth. c. Peru: Growth can be noticed in the graph; however, it is not exponential. d. Russia: It is noticeable from the 60 days ahead prediction curve that the limb gradually decreases from mid-August 2020. e. USA: Similar to the Brazil curve the USA curve also shows exponential growth in the number of infected people.Also, the original and the 60 days ahead prediction line graphs for the best WCRVFL network are shown in Fig. 7 for Brazil, India, Peru, Russia and the USA respectively. The following implications can be drawn from these figures: a. Brazil: It is observed that the graph grows almost exponentially for both WCRVFL RELU Network and WCRVFL Sigmoid Network. b. India: An exponential growth can be observed in the prediction curve of India. c. Peru: In case of WCRVFL RELU as well as the WCRVFL Sigmoid network, the increase in the number of infected people can be observed. d. Russia: A gradually decreasing curve can be observed from the last days of July 2020 for both cases. e. USA: Similar to the Brazil curve, the USA curve also shows growth in the number of infected people if not exponential for both; WCRVFL RELU and WCRVFL Sigmoid networks.Further, to test proposed WCRVFL's applicability in application areas with time-series datasets, we have experimented on a real world time series dataset. The dataset, called ""POPULATION"", is originally a collection of the total population in India from 1961 to 2019, i.e., a total collection of 60 samples. Out of which, 70% of the total samples are used for training while the rest are used for testing. The dataset is obtained from https://data.worldbank.org/. The experimental results of WCRVFL model in time series prediction are tabulated in Table 12 . Further, the best WCRVFL model is compared with the conventional RVFL and SVR models which are shown in Table 13 . Moreover, the prediction performance plot is shown in Fig. 8 . It is noticeable that WCRVFL could achieve convincing prediction performance in timeseries prediction for the reported dataset.We studied the prediction ability of the RVFL network to model and forecast the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The non-stationarity of the time-series datasets is handled by using numerous types of mother wavelets. It is noticeable that the RVFL network that is embedded in the wavelet provides consistent prediction performance. The 60 days ahead prediction is also employed by using both, RVFL and the proposed WCRVFL. Overall it can be concluded that the wavelet-based hybrid models might be helpful for society so that early prevention can be taken. However, our research has limitations like the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof optimal number of nodes in the hidden layer, tuning the scaling of the uniform randomization range, accurate data availability etc. The RVFL network presently uses the only samples of the time-series data for prediction. A prospective future direction to add more attributes in the time series data so that maximum information can be gathered from the data, as well as the prediction performance, may be improved. In addition to that Lagrangian twin RVFL model can be coupled with wavelets and wavelet coupled ARIMA models are suggested for forecasting the COVID-19 spread worldwide.Authors have no conflict of interest.

5206e7056fe801d7a2d843fd0a41c093b986ffc0,A model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the first three-month surveillance data in Brazil,"The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2, challenges the capabilities of health care services, especially in low-and middle-income countries [1] . A major issue is to meet the diagnostic requirements of the suspected cases reported to the surveillance system [2] . The proportion of suspected cases being tested in each country is not systematically presented in most of the epidemiological reports [3] [4] [5] . However, with the increasing number of new suspected cases of the disease (COVID-19) worldwide, diagnosis has become a growing problem, mainly due to the lack or delay in the test results [6, 7] .Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are unspecific and include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral pneumonia [8] [9] [10] . Polymerase chain reaction by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, its limited availability and the strict laboratory requirements delay diagnosis, which represents an unprecedented challenge to control transmission and provide timely health care [11, 12] .The incorporation of predictive diagnostic models based on surveillance data could help identify patients who could need specific treatment and early isolation. Consequently, we aimed to describe the profile of COVID-19 patients and to obtain a multiple model to predict the diagnosis among suspected cases reported in Brazil, based on data routinely collected by the surveillance system.This observational study corresponded to the development and evaluation of diagnostic technologies nested in surveillance data obtained by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We studied reported cases that corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who had traveled to regions with community or local transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. We did not establish restrictions based on age or underlying conditions for this study.Records with inconsistent or illogical data were excluded.We included the patients reported between 11/01/2020 and 25/03/2020. All data were collected from Accepted Article the national surveillance information form, created on RedCap® platform, which included demographic, temporal, and easy to obtain clinical information such as symptoms, signs, comorbidities, travel history, and contact information. Another variable considered was the time since notification of the first case that was subsequently confirmed in the corresponding Federal Unit (FU). In the FU without notification and for its first confirmed case, this variable was zero.During the period of data collection analyzed, the ministry's recommendation was to test all suspected cases, according to the definition presented above [13] . SARS-CoV-2 infection was considered confirmed only by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR testing, following the WHO and CDC protocol result for pharyngeal swab specimens [12] . Because the study population refers to symptomatic cases, in this paper we use the terms SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 interchangeably.The reference definition of COVID-19 was a reported case with a positive RNA test. Because the target population was the suspected cases identified through the surveillance system, the COVID-19group was compared with the reported cases with negative RNA test (henceforth named other illness [OI] group).Demographic and clinical information was entered in an electronic database and then analyzed using The information from São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) was used to obtain and validate the predictive Accepted Article model. This choice was because these were the FUs with the largest number of confirmed cases and the earliest establishment of the surveillance system. Thus, we used a subset of 80% of randomly selected patients from SP and RJ (modeling dataset) to specify the multiple model. We selected the covariates by a non-automatic stepwise procedure using logistic regression. Age and days after notification of the first confirmed case (DNFCC) were used to create interaction terms with each of the other independent predictors. During modeling, a p-value of 0.15 was considered as a criterium to enter the variable and 0.20 to exclude it. After evaluating all variables, exclusions were made until obtaining a model including only covariates with p <0. 10 . To obtain a final predictive function we integrated the multiple model and variables that perfectly predicted the outcome.The predicted values were used to estimate the area under the ROC curve (AUC). We interpreted the AUC as an indicator of goodness of fit such that values between 0.9 and 0.99 are excellent, 0.8 -0.89 good, 0.7 -0.79 acceptable, and 0.51 -0.69 are poor [14] . We also plotted the observed COVID-19proportion by decile of predictions to illustrate the calibration of the model. Next, the model was applied to the 20% of patients from SP and RJ who were not included in the modeling dataset (validation dataset).We chose that sample distribution (80% and 20%) looking to have more than 100 events in the validation dataset [15] . Moreover, we applied the model to patients from FUs other than SP/RJ to evaluate the applicability in a very different scenario. We also calculated the overall accuracy to classify events of a predicted probability of ≥0.5 [16] .We presented some cut-off points of the predicted value based on optimized accuracy indicators (in SP/RJ patients). These cut-offs included the preset predicted value of 0.5; the highest value with a sensitivity >95%; the lowest with specificity >95%; the value with the highest overall accuracy; and the value with the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (based on the product thereof). Accuracy indicators of these selected cutoffs were described for both the SP/RJ patients (modeling + validation dataset) and those from the other FUs.Finally, by applying the sum of the predicted values and by using the chosen cut-off points, we calculated the probable number of COVID-19 cases in the total reported patients and among those who were reported as being hospitalized.This study followed Brazilian and International legislation for conducting human research. This research project was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee (Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa, CONEP) in Brazil, Register number (CAAE): 11946619.5.0000.5421Until March 25, 2020, the surveillance system had received 67,344 records of suspected cases, including 5674 with registered hospitalization. Of the total, 165 records were excluded because of inconsistent data. Overall, 5739 were tested by RT-PCR, of which 1468 were positive and 4271 negative.COVID-19 cases were older and more frequently men than OI patients (Table 1) . COVID-19 patients were reported a median 16 days after the first confirmed case, which was significantly later than OI patients were (median of seven days). Both age and time from the first confirmed case exhibited a gradient for COVID-19 frequency (Figures 1 and 2) . This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved The states of SP and RJ jointly had 683 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 864 with OI, of which 541 and 702were selected to the modeling dataset, respectively. During the modeling, patients with liver disease (n = 4) and those who reported not having had contact with a suspected case (n = 69) were not considered, as these categories perfectly predicted absence of COVID-19 and were significantly more frequent in the OI To obtain the final function, patients with a history of liver disease and those who denied having had any contact with a suspected case were considered with a predicted value equal to zero; otherwise, the predicted value was calculated by applying the model described in Table 2 (Table 4 ). Of them, between 2050 and 2196 were hospitalized in SP or RJ, and between 1657 and 2196 in the other FUs. All This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedThe growing number of cases suspected of COVID-19 is alarming [3] . Only a small proportion of cases have a laboratory study; therefore most cases are being left with an uncertain diagnosis, which limits establishing specific measures and estimating the burden of the disease. In this study, we identified a set of variables that may help differentiate COVID-19 cases from other diseases. The model obtained exhibited an excellent AUC in the SP/RJ dataset comparable to more complex tools, including imaging and laboratory tests [11, [17] [18] [19] . This is impressive, considering that it is based solely on variables collected by the surveillance system.An essential caveat in these models is that the predictors should not be interpreted individually.However, some associations are consistent with what is known about this coronavirus. For example, age was directly associated with the diagnosis, which could be explained by the increased pathogenicity in older people. Therefore, an overrepresentation of the elderly is expected among the confirmed patients.Another interesting finding is the relationship between the time since the notification of the first confirmed case and the probability of COVID-19. This association indicates the importance of contextualizing according to the timing of the epidemic. Furthermore, this demonstrates that these models should be continuously updated and adapted to the epidemiological situation.Most of the clinical manifestations included in the model were negatively associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. It does not mean that they cannot be presented by patients with COVID-19, but that they were more frequent in other diseases. This finding highlights why the circulation of other infectious agents could be a determinant of the predictors' discriminatory capacity, as has already been suggested for other conditions [20] .Moreover, it is expected that variables determining the notification (e.g., respiratory symptoms and international travel) and, therefore, inclusion in the study, tend to be negatively associated with the outcome due to collider-like phenomena [21] . For this reason, both causal inference interpretation, and extrapolation to the general population of the associations would be biased. Consequently, our model must be considered only for diagnostic prediction in the specific group of reported suspected patients.The claim not to have had contact with an exposed case perfectly predicted the absence of COVID-19.This finding should be interpreted with caution because it is very likely that as the epidemic progresses, this variable could lose discrimination capacity once the prevalence of infectious hosts, including those undetectable, increases in the community.Regarding external application, we observed that the model had a considerably lower AUC in FUs other than SP and RJ. This difference could occur due to the epidemiological context variability. For example, regional differences in the prevalence of respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 can Accepted Article reduce the specificity of the clinical predictors. Moreover, the chronology of the COVID-19 epidemic itself (which started later in most of UFs other than in SP and RJ [22] ) could affect its recognition as a public health priority and, therefore, the implementation and acceptability of its surveillance [23] . These factors could introduce heterogeneity of both the clinical profile of reported cases and the data recording quality, compromising the generalizability of the model performance. Despite this, the AUC in these other FUs can be considered acceptable, and although lower, the model proposed could also help guide the preliminary diagnosis in scenarios different than those obtained.We take some steps to avoid biases frequently identified in models for diagnosis of COVID-19 [24] .For example, we did not exclude patients based on manifestations or evidence of other infections. In this way, our model could be applied to all reported to the surveillance systems during the emergency of COVID-19. In addition, the reference standard test was the same for all patients (RT-PCR), and no predictor was part of the outcome definition. Moreover, quantitative predictors were modeled without dichotomized them, allowing us to consider the continuous gradients of association with the outcome.Applications of the proposed model include early case identification for specific treatment and isolation, as well as the rational use of laboratory tests. Furthermore, this model may predict the number of both total cases and hospitalizations attributed to this infection based on the surveillance data. This application is relevant because one of the challenges that this pandemic represents is the organization of healthcare resources. In this way, our results may help to model and forecast the availability of funds for patient care.This study obtained and validated a model function suitable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 during the early stage of the Brazilian epidemic. This tool was entirely based on data routinely collected.Therefore, it may help early identification and treatment of patients, establish preventive measures, and improve the accuracy of epidemiological surveillance of this disease.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-13,8
c1c7a4289dd6036a3b4c559b11434bd5a04599ce,COVID-19 mild cases determination from correlating COVID-line calls to reported cases,"COVID-19 Pandemic is impacting on World's health and economy with an unprecedented strength [1] [2] [3] . Among the major challenges in mitigating the pandemic effect is assessing the real number of infected people at any time [3] [4] [5] . This key information is not only useful for determining health policies, but also for estimating the level of immunity in society which provides a reference framework to decide the re-opening of economic and other activities. Although the natural method for obtaining this information including mild symptom cases 1 would be to test persons upon the minimal symptom, COVID-19 is a disease with a large fraction of mild cases and therefore its cost and logistics is usually beyond the affordable. In this work we address a novel method to estimate the total number of symptomatic infected people, including mild cases, by correlating COVID-line phone calls to lab-confirmed reported cases. The main idea is that, since this is a highly contagious disease, then calls coming from infected people are proportional to the number of lab-confirmed people in that area and time, whereas other calls correspond to a background proportional to the population in the area. By measuring number of calls in different scenarios, we can fit the proportionality coefficient and estimate the total number of infected people, even though a fraction of these will not reach the threshold to be derived to a laboratory diagnostic. The idea of distinguishing a signal in a large dataset of queries is present in many schemes such as Google Flu [6] and others [7] . However, the present method is not only considerably simpler and straightforward to be implemented in any country or region, but also is specially designed for a contagious disease with the particular feature of the mild cases such as the COVID-19. The algorithm is based on a few reasonable hypotheses, is useful in any sub-testing scenario -as is the case in most of the countries-, and the presented general framework can be used in tackling other diseases and/or catastrophes, beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic. The method, being statistical, does not allow to identify the mild cases, but to estimate their number. In the following paragraphs we present the details of the algorithm, and we apply it to a real case scenario in Buenos Aires Province (PBA for its acronym in Spanish).Along this work we model the number of calls to a COVID-line in a given district and during a given period of time by using a simple assumption of signal and background. We define signal to those calls due to real COVID-19 cases, and background to those calls due to similar symptoms and/or other causes but that do not correspond to real infections. It is key to clarify that the real COVID-19 cases that constitute the signal calls do not necessarily correspond to people whose symptoms will drive them to have a laboratory confirmation of their condition. The people who has symptoms to place the COVID-call, but that their symptoms and evolution does not reach the threshold to have a laboratory test confirmation is what we call infected with mild symptoms. As a matter of fact, we assume the compelling hypothesis that the number of signal calls is proportional to the number of lab-confirmed cases. On the other hand, we assume that the number of background calls is solely proportional to the district population. This assumption is reasonable as far as the studied populations have similar social behavior and there are not major changes in the social conditions -as for 1 Observe that our precise definition of mild case (see below) may not agree with others found in the literature.Within the above hypothesis, we model the number of call received in district j in a given period of time asWhere N (j) P is the population and N (j) I is the number of lab-confirmed infections at district j and at the given period of time. n (j) C is the number of calls for district j predicted by the fit and that should be as similar as possible to the real number of calls N (j) C . The number N (j) I corresponds to those cases whose record was opened in the studied period of time, regardless if the laboratory result was confirmed at some other time. Observe that proportionality coefficients θ = (θ P , θ I ) are independent of index j and should be fitted from the data.There is important information to be extracted once the number of calls for each COVID-19 lab-confirmed case, θ I , is fitted. Let f c be the fraction of people with symptoms that contacts the Health Care System through the COVID-line, and let κ be the average of times each one of these persons calls the COVID-line. With these two variables we can now estimate the total number of lab-confirmed plus mild cases. In fact, we can now assert that the number of calls from different persons for each lab-confirmed case is θ I /κ. Moreover, we can also estimate that for each mild calling the COVID-line, there exist other 1/f c mild cases which are not calling. Henceforth, we obtainwhere N I is the number of lab-confirmed cases in the studied district and period of time.The values for κ can be estimated by the telephone records or surveying on the COVID-line reported cases, whereas f c is usually within the information available from the Health Care Administration. In any case, the outcome in Eq. 2 has many sources of intractable systematic uncertainties, and therefore its value should be understood within the corresponding caution.Finally it is worth discussing a few details concerning the above ideas. First, observe that mild is not the same as asymptomatic. A mild case is defined as having enough symptoms to place a call to the Health Care System COVID-line, but less than the threshold required to be tested. Second, notice that, within this framework, the line dividing lab-confirmed and mild cases depends on the local Health Care System policies, since the division comes from the definition of the threshold needed to be tested. Therefore, the value of the factor accompanying N I in Eq. 2 depends on the local Health Care System policies for each region. At last, observe that the division between mild and asymptomatic cases, although independent of policies, is rather a smooth division since depends person by person on their perception of the symptoms. The number that comes out from Eq. 2 does not consider cases which are purely asymptomatic.In order to fit the parameters θ from the data we can use the method of maximum likelihood. We should maximize the likelihood L(θ) or equivalently minimize the χ 2 (θ) defined throughIn the above analyzed data for PBA we know from the records that from the total labconfirmed cases, 22% correspond to cases that entered into the Health Care System through the COVID-line. We use this to estimate that the ratio of calls from infected people corresponds to f c = 0.22. On the other hand we have determined through a simple survey that each confirmed person calling the COVID-line makes on average 1.5 calls (κ = 1.5 ± 0.1). Using this into Eq. 2 we obtain Total number of lab-confirmed plus mild @ PBA = (20 ± 2) N I .Where N I is the total reported cases in PBA. Observe that in deriving this result there may have been introduced additional systematic errors through the variables f c and κ which have not been taken into account and, in contrast to θ I , are not controlled by the goodness of fit. These systematic may consist, for instance, in infected who may have called the COVID-line, but finally entered the system through another path; or in a different ratio of mild than severe cases calling the COVID-line.The factor 20 ± 2 in Eq. 5 is compatible with results in other parts of the World on the ratio of total infected cases found through serology to reported cases. For instance, Germany has estimated 10 times more infected than those reported by lab-confirmation [9] , Spain 15 [10] and London 45 [11] . Observe, however, that these last numbers may include the asymptomatic cases, which are beyond the scope of this work and whose role in the COVID-19 Pandemic is still controversial [12] [13] [14] .",Argentina,abstract,2020-08-13,8
32a9562308ce25245dbb8a0d54c5493bc0573a1d,COVID-19 Epidemic in Argentina: Worsening of Behavioral Symptoms in Elderly Subjects With Dementia Living in the Community,"In Argentina, the quality of care that elderly subjects with dementia living in the community received has been deeply affected by COVID-19 epidemic. Our objective was to study to what extend mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 had affected behavioral symptoms in subjects with dementia after the first 8 weeks of quarantine. We invited family members to participate in a questionnaire survey. The sample consisted of family caregivers (n = 119) of persons with AD or related dementia living at home. We designed a visual analog scale to test the level of the burden of care of family members. Items inquired in the survey included type and setting (home or day care center) of rehabilitation services (physical/occupational/cognitive rehabilitation) and change in psychotropic medication and in behavioral symptoms that subjects with dementia experienced before and during the epidemic. Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the chi-square tests, p < 0.01 was considered significant. Results: The sample included older adults with dementia. Mean age: 81.16 (±7.03), 35% of the subjects had more than 85 years of age. Diagnosess were 67% Alzheimer´s dementia and 26% mixed Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Stages were 34.5% mild cases, 32% intermediate stage, and 33% severe cases as per Clinical dementia Rating score. In 67% of the sample, a family member was the main caregiver. Important findings were increased anxiety (43% of the sample), insomnia (28% of the subjects), depression (29%), worsening gait disturbance (41%), and increase use of psychotropics to control behavioral symptoms. When we compared the frequency of behavioral symptoms within each dementia group category, we found that anxiety, depression, and insomnia were more prevalent in subjects with mild dementia compared to subjects with severe dementia. We analyzed the type and pattern of use of rehabilitation services before and during the isolation period, and we observed that, as a rule, rehabilitation services had been discontinued in most subjects due to the quarantine. We concluded from our analysis that during COVID-19 epidemic there was a deterioration of behavioral symptoms in our population of elderly dementia subjects living in the community. Perhaps, our findings are related to a combination of social isolation, lack of outpatient rehabilitation services, and increased stress of family caregivers. It isThe World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemic on March 11 (1) . A few days later, and with the experience of how the epidemic was affecting countries in Europe and Asia, the Argentinian Government issued an executive order implementing a complete lockdown and isolation of travelers returning from the affected countries (2) . Non-essential business was closed, and people were asked to avoid unnecessary travel to maintain social distance and to limit family visits to elderly subjects (2) . At the time of writing this communication, quarantine in Buenos Aires had lasted 101 days, the number of deceased people in the entire country had reached 1,245, and the number of infected persons is 59,933 (3). Governments through the world were challenged to deal with both the direct impact of the disease on the health system and the economic, financial, and social consequences of the epidemic. Worldwide health authorities also need to design models of care of chronic conditions not related to COVID-19 in times of this epidemic (3).Alzheimer`s disease (AD) and related disorders subjects are especially vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 disease and the imposed quarantine (4, 5) . Based on frequent comorbidities and older age, they might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (5) (6) (7) . For example, in Italy, dementia was one of the most frequent comorbidities present in 12% of the deceased COVID-19 patients (8) . On the other hand, dementia subjects are also extremely vulnerable to the effects of enforced quarantine (9) . They depend strongly on community and social support systems for survival due to the dependence on activities of daily living (10). They may not learn properly the use personal protection elements, such as wearing facial masks, washing hands, and keeping social distance, and may forget to avoid leaving their home unnecessarily. They are probably be less flexible on coping with changing situations and during crisis, and they rely more on family members. However, during this epidemic, family members are trying to limit contact with elderly dementia subjects to decrease as much as possible the risk of coronavirus transmission. While during this epidemic virtual technology is playing a central role in preventing isolation in the general population, this vital resource is sometimes difficult to utilize for dementia subjects due to their difficulties to learn the use of this technology (9) (10) (11) (12) .As suggested by the Alzheimer`s International Society, support for subjects living with dementia and their caregivers is mandatory (11) . Access to care for family members and dementia subjects in order to deal with a new situation is critical (8) and mitigation strategies to reduce the immediate and long-term impact of this health crisis are needed (4) . For example, in Australia, the Health Department quickly realized the need for improved access to mental healthcare services for older people during COVID-19 times (13) . While during this epidemic virtual technology is playing a central role in preventing isolation, this vital resource is difficult to utilize on dementia subjects due to their difficulties to learn the use of this technology (9) (10) (11) (12) .To prepare a rational plan to mitigate the effects of the epidemic, it is necessary first to identify in our setting the most problematic situations that AD and related dementia subjects are facing. It is also important to determine if enforced isolation imposed specific issues related to the severity of the cognitive disease. We know that AD and related dementia neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, sleep difficulties, among others, are extremely frequent with a prevalence ranging from 60 to 80% and usually imposed more troubling on caregivers than the cognitive symptoms (14, 15) . Sleep disturbances are reported in at least 30% of subjects with AD. Multifactorial contributors are depression, anxiety, sedentarism, and adverse reactions from medications (17) . Standard nonpharmacologic proven strategies to improve these disrupting symptoms and commonly used by caregivers are maintaining a structured routine, reassuring responses, physical exercise, sleep hygiene, and distraction. Most of these strategies are difficult, almost impossible, to implement during the quarantine (16) .Our objective was to measure in our setting the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the well-being and behavioral symptoms of subjects at different stages of dementia living in the community after the first 8 weeks of enforced isolation.Family members of patients of the Aging and Memory Center of FLENI with AD and related disorders were invited to participate in our survey. Two physicians (MJR and GC) of the Aging and Memory Center provided information about study´s aim and distributed the questionnaire survey. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The survey sample consisted of family caregivers (n = 119) of persons with AD or related dementia living at home.The survey had two main sections. The first one included demographics of family members, paid caregivers, and dementia subjects, and the other was composed of questions regarding the challenges of care and management that subjects and relatives experienced during the first 8 weeks of the coronavirus quarantine in our setting. The survey was not intended to replace a medical office visit or to make a clinical diagnosis, and validated tests were not used. Our idea was to study with easy and quick to answer questions the psychological issues that might had occurred during quarantine. A series of questions were designed specifically to screen the onset or worsening of behavioral symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, and depression) or gait disturbances during the quarantine. We specifically asked caregivers the following two questions for each symptom inquired: ""Did your relative with dementia experience anxiety before the epidemic?"" and ""Do your relative with dementia experience anxiety during the epidemic?"" In order to study if there was a change in the prescription of psychotropics during quarantine, we asked caregivers specifically the following questions. ""During quarantine your relative needed the dose of the following medications to be increased or to be started?"" For each of the following medications, we asked one specific question. The list included: antipsychotics (quetiapine/risperidone/olanzapine), anxiolytics (clonazepam, alprazolam, diazepam), nonbenzodiazepines hypnotics (zolpidem), and antidepressants (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and trazodone). We did not record the exact dose of the psychotropics, but the reported change in the dose of the prescriptions.A series of questions were made to assess the type and setting of rehabilitation services that subjects where receiving before the epidemic. We inquired specifically if subjects did physical/occupational and cognitive rehabilitation and if it was home based/at a day care center or specialized outpatient center. We then asked if rehabilitation services had been discontinued during the epidemic. We also asked if family members continued or discontinued visiting subjects during the quarantine.Patients were seen and studied extensively by a doctor specialized in memory disorders before COVID-19 epidemic. Clinical diagnosis of cognitive disorder syndromes was made based on a detailed workup of history taking, medication review, physical examination, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological tests. Disease severity was based on Clinical Dementia Ration (CDR) (18) score and functionality scales. All subjects had a longitudinal follow up in the memory disorder clinic. Due to the unique feature of isolation and quarantine in long term care facilities, we decided to include in our sample only subjects living in the community and excluded those living at long-term care settings.We designed a visual analog scale to study the burden of care that family members or paid caregivers experienced before and during the epidemic. The question was: ""How much stress from 1 (low) to 3 (severe) do you feel by taking care of your family member with dementia before the quarantine and during quarantine?"" We assigned 1 point for low, 2 points for intermediate, and 3 points for severe burden of care. Our intention was to measure the amount of burnout that a family caregiver feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of stress. Based on the obtained score, the results were transformed into three categories: low, medium, and high. The next step was to understand the main concerns that family members were dealing with during quarantine in relation to the care of subjects with dementia. We created a list of six different hypothetical situations and asked family members to select the main concern from that list.This study was presented and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of our center. The participation of this survey was voluntary, and confidentiality of the dyad patient-family member was preserved through all research stages and after. A letter was mailed together with the questionnaire inviting family members to participate in the survey and informing them of the purpose of the research study.Statistical analyses were made using IBM SPSS 21 software package. The characteristics of people with AD or related dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages and means ± standard deviations). Chisquare tests, with p < 0.01 were used to test differences between family caregivers of persons in the mild stage and in severe stages of dementia based on CDR (18) score. Behavioral symptoms and covariates were analyzed with Spearman's rank-order correlations. The level of burden of the family caregiver before and during the COVID-19 epidemic was analyzed with pairedsamples t tests. To overcome some of the limitations imposed by conventional pretest-posttest self-report measures, the retrospective pretest-posttest design was utilized. We selected this method since it has been shown to reduce response-shift bias, p is convenient to implement and provides comparison data in the absence of ""pre"" data.Our work is based on the data of a questionnaire survey collected during the month of May of 2020, after approximately 8 weeks of complete lockdown due to quarantine in Argentina.Demographics and clinical characteristics of 119 subjects with AD and related dementia and their family members are shown in Table 1 .Baseline demographics were the following: Mean age of subjects with dementia was 81.16 ± 7.03 years (a third of the sample belonged to the eldest-old group of more than 85 years of age), approximately a third were male, and mean number of years of education was 13.26 ± 4.68. The most frequent diagnosis was AD, followed by mixed AD, and then by vascular dementia. The distribution of the staging of dementia was the following: 34% of the sample had mild dementia (CDR 1), 32% had moderate dementia, and 34% had severe dementia with a CDR score of 3.Our main result was the report by family members of new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing behavioral symptoms in 60.5% of subjects with dementia during the epidemic. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders were reported in 33, 12.8, and 14.7% of the sample, respectively. Increasing gait difficulties was reported in 40% of the sample. New onset of behavioral symptoms or exacerbation of pre-existing behavioral symptoms had a positive correlation with patient age and with the presence of anxiety reported before the epidemic (r = 0.228, p = 0.017 and r = 0.290, p = 0.002, Spearman, respectively) and a negative correlation with the global CDR score (r = -0.289, p = 0.002, Spearman) and with the following domains of CDR: memory (r = -0.202, p = 0.035, Spearman), community affairs (r = -0.236, p = 0.013, Spearman), and home and hobbies (r = -0.216, p = 0.024, Spearman).Family members reported an overall increased use of psychotropic medication during the epidemic with the following distribution: 20% increased for antipsychotics, 15% for benzodiazepines, 6% for hypnotics, and 10% for antidepressants.In Table 2 , we compared data according to the stages of severity of dementia. We found significant differences in increased behavioral symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and Increased gait problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, n (%)Increased or onset of COVID-19-related antipsychotics prescription, n (%)Increased or onset of COVID-19-related benzodiazepines prescription, n (%)Increased or onset of COVID-19-related hypnotics prescription, n (%)Increased or onset of COVID-19-related antidepressants prescription, n (%) depression in subjects with mild dementia compared to subjects with a more advanced stage of dementia. These results were showed in Figure 1 . For psychotropics, we observed a nonsignificant trend in increased prescription in the mild dementia group ( Table 2) . Walking difficulties didn´t differ significantly according to the disease severity. Before the epidemic, the most commonly prescribed type of rehabilitation was physical therapy (60% of the sample), followed by cognitive rehabilitation in 42%, and by occupational therapy in a lower percentage (25%) ( Table 1) . As expected, subjects with more severe dementia received home-based physical therapy ( Table 2) . There was a high rate of discontinuation of rehabilitation during the epidemic: 76% discontinued physical therapy, 91% occupational therapy, and 77% cognitive rehabilitation. There was no statistical difference in the rate of discontinuation based on the severity of dementia.In Table 1 , we showed the demographic characteristics of family members and paid caregivers. The mean age of the family members was 58.61 ± 13.60 years, 26% were older than 65 years of age, and 2% older than 85%. As expected, most family members caring for patients were female. The mean education of the family caregivers was 17.04 ± 5.15 years. Another aspect of care that we wanted to study was the discontinuation of family visits during the COVID-19 epidemic. We found that most family members continued to visit their loved ones during quarantine with a discontinuation rate of only 34%.Overall, we observed an increased burden of care of family members during the epidemic, independently of the dementia severity. 12% of the family members felt that the burden of care was severe before the epidemic, and this number increased to 42% during the epidemic. Thus, there was a significant difference in the burnout scores before (M = 1.69, SD = 0.67) and during (M = 2.27, SD = 0.72) the COVID-19 epidemic; t = -8,657, p < 0.001. When we analyzed the reasons for the increased family burnout, we found interesting differences. Relatives of severe dementia subjects were mainly concerned of the possibility of a sick leave of paid caregivers, whereas relatives of subjects with mild dementia were mainly concerned of the risk of COVID-19 transmission when assisting subjects in instrumental activities of daily living.Before the epidemic, 40% of the sample received care from a paid caregiver. More severe cases tended to receive care from a paid caregiver compared to milder cases. During the epidemic, only 23% of the sample discontinued this service.This is a report of a survey of the well-being and aspects of care of 119 subjects living with dementia in the community and their family caregivers in Argentina during the initial 8 weeks of mandatory isolation due to COVID-19 epidemic.Our sample was composed of elderly subjects with dementia, a third of those belonged to the very old group of elderly patients, and a third of the sample were men. As expected to this age group, the most frequent diagnosis was AD and followed by mixed AD. The severity of the dementia was evenly distributed, a third had mild disease, a third had intermediate disease, and a third had severe disease.Overall, we found worsening or new onset of behavioral symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia during the enforced quarantine in subjects with dementia. There was a positive correlation of these symptoms with advanced age and with the presence of anxiety before this epidemic and a negative correlation with the global CDR (18) score, community affairs, and hobbies domain of CDR scale. Other findings were that most family members continued family visits during the epidemic, only a small proportion canceled caregiver paid services, and most rehabilitation services were discontinued during the epidemic.Our findings are worrisome since behavioral and psychological symptoms associated to dementia are a main cause of deterioration of quality of life for patients and caregivers, institutionalization, disability, increased use of health resources and caregiver stress (15, 16) . Longitudinal studies of dementia subjects showed that these symptoms are highly prevalent and persistent over time and can occur at any point in the clinical course of the cognitive process (19, 20) . Nonpharmacologic management is consistently recommended in the literature to control these symptoms due, in part, of the modest efficacy and the potential of harm of pharmacologic therapy (16) . Caregiver training, keeping the patient active with a structured personalized routine, taking the patient for a walk-in neighborhood are all well-proven strategies to deal with anxiety and agitation in patients with dementia (16) . Unfortunately, during enforce isolation, some of these strategies were impossible to implement since Argentinian authorities recommended that high-risk subjects with comorbidities remain at home (2) . Most forms of rehabilitation interventions had been cancelled. Home-based interventions were probably cancelled because of fear of letting a health care professional enter patient's home and increasing the risk of spreading the epidemic. Outpatient rehabilitation services had been cancelled as a direct effect of quarantine to avoid unnecessary travel. Evidence from small trials in dementia showed that cognitive training and rehabilitation could improve cognition and decreased psychological symptoms. A recent review of reviews showed that exercise improved performance of daily activities in dementia (21) . In our study, most interventions were suspended, and there is probably a relationship with the negative psychological issues found during quarantine and the cancellation of rehabilitation services.Another main finding of our research was that neuropsychiatric symptoms during quarantine were more frequent in subjects with mild dementia than in advanced dementia cases. One possible explanation for this could be that comparatively, mild dementia subjects might have suffered more radical modification in their lifestyle habits during quarantine than subjects with severe dementia who usually are more homebound and less active. Anxiety is reported in the literature to be strongly related to impairment of activities of daily living and dependence. In our sample, anxiety was the most frequently behavioral symptom experienced by dementia subjects during quarantine, and it was most frequently suffered by subjects with mild dementia. It is possible that, during quarantine, these subjects had more awareness of epidemic and risks of getting sick and that this knowledge induced more anxiety.Sleep disturbances are frequent in AD patients and are related to age changes in sleep patterns, medication effects, comorbidity with anxiety, depression, and to the neurodegenerative disease by itself (18) . Sleep disorders are disruptive to caregivers and increase the rate of institutionalization and caregiver burnout (22, 23) . Strategies to improve sleep quality include sleep hygiene, physical activity during the day, and keeping a structured daily routine (22, 23) . These strategies were all compromised during this lockdown period, and sleep difficulties were overall frequent, with even higher prevalence in subjects with mild dementia. Specially in this population, sedentary behavior during quarantine could had impacted on the quality of sleep of subjects with mild dementia Psychotropic medication use increased during quarantine, independently of the dementia severity. Specifically use of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, and antidepressants were more frequently prescribed. The first three medications are included in the Beer´s list of potentially inappropriate medication in elderly subjects with dementia (24) . These medications have the potential for cognitive decline and increase the risk of falling and confusional state (24) . Also, antipsychotics in this vulnerable group increased the risk of worse cardiovascular outcomes and are not currently recommended (25) . This increased in use of potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly could cause in the future a deleterious effect on the health status of the subjects in our sample. A medication reconciliation plan once the quarantine ends with an active deprescribing strategy is one possible strategy to mitigate this increased risk.Another main finding of our study is that there was a deterioration of the quality of walking during the quarantine. Gait impairment is frequent in dementia patients, especially in frail elderly subjects with advanced dementia, and is directly related to the risk of falling and quality of life of the subjects (26, 27) . The performance of functional capacities depends on the ability to ambulate (27) . Walking deterioration during quarantine is probably multifactorial, including discontinuation of physical and cognitive rehabilitation, deconditioning related to staying at home, and increased use of psychotropics as described above.Probably, one of the most important learnings of this epidemic is the inclusion of technology for the evaluation and monitoring of our patients at a distance, even in older adults. While technology now is being used to socialize and give emotional support and guidance to caregivers, cognitive and physical exercise can be delivered via internet (28) . It is true than some individuals may struggle to use this technology (29) , by contrast, most caregivers usually can successfully use this resource. A recent published randomized trial of a specialized dementia care program delivered this way to the dyad patientcaregiver showed improved quality of life, decreased caregiver burn out and depression in those assigned to the active intervention (30) .Our study's main limitations are the relatively small size of the sample and the lack of prospectively longitudinal follow-up. Another pitfall is the lack of use of validated instruments to measure caregiver burnout and behavioral and psychological symptoms. We will continue to follow this cohort of subjects to study the health consequences and the real impact after the isolation period, and we will continue our research using validated scales to measure these symptoms.Our findings, in summary, showed the negative consequences of quarantine in this sample of elderly patients. Individuals with cognitive disorders are especially vulnerable during these times of isolation and epidemic, their care needs are not met, and social engagement is decreased. Caregivers and patients need more medical attention, support groups, and virtual modalities to deal with worsened behavioral symptoms, caregiver stress and burnout, walking abnormalities, and increased use of psychotropics. In general, most office consults had been cancelled, and caregiver have less contact and guidance with specialized medical teams than before COVID-19. Physical social distance required during the epidemic suspended interventions that subjects with dementia constantly need due to the chronic nature of cognitive decline. Family member's awareness of the potential problems and a mitigation plan of action may help families deal with the negative impact of this natural crisis. Solutions will have to be creative, patient-centered, and flexible to deal with the new changing scenario. More medical counseling, guidance, and presence are needed urgently to help this population deal with new serious health challenges arose during the epidemic. Telehealth visits and telemedicine are a priority, and it must be implemented on a regular basis to provide frequent weekly medical counsel on specific new health issues related to this quarantine. Rehabilitation services also will have to adapt to the new scenario, with reduced occupancy of patients in the same area, among other strategies (31) . It is necessary to urgently develop a plan of action to help dementia subjects and family members deal with the increased stress that his epidemic imposed on them.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by FLENI.

2b211a5df1739e20faec56e3e4001f12f4d058ff,Journal Pre-proof Light-based technologies for management of COVID-19 pandemic crisis Light-based technologies for management of COVID-19 pandemic crisis,"UV-C is directly absorbed by pyrimidine bases causing their dimerization, which leads to viral inactivation via DNA or RNA damage [30] . Thymine is the main chromophore in DNA while uracil is its counterpart in RNA. Upon UV-C exposure, thymine and uracil form cyclobutane-dimers and pyrimidine-protein cross-links [30] . It must be stressed that UV-C usage must be limited to inanimate objects since it is highly dangerous to human skin. The viral protein coat has been shown to protect nucleic acids from UV-C radiation, by shielding the RNA, quenching the excited states of RNA, and/or by surrounding the bases with a hydrophobic environment and limiting the mobility of the individual bases. This results in a reduction of the overall rate of photoreactions, which allows the formation of noncyclobutane-type dipyrimidines and uridine hydrates. Viral coating proteins themselves may suffer UV photodamage and become cross-linked to RNA.The International Ultraviolet Association (IUVA) recently released a fact sheet detailing the efficacy of UV on SARS-CoV-2 [31] in which they reviewed all the appropriate requirements for the safety of UV-C disinfection devices and discussed the corresponding performance standards and validation protocols. Coronaviruses display a wide range of UV-C LD 90 (UV-C dose necessary to inactivate 90% of a microbial population) values, from 7 to 241 J/m 2 so one might assume that the UV-C susceptibility of the novel SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus probably lies within this range [32] . Therefore, based on previous studies with SARS-CoV-1 and other RNA-based coronaviruses, UV-C light can be used to effectively inactivate such pathogens present in the air, liquids and over several surfaces [33, 34] .UV-C lamps have long been used in hospital and industrial settings for decontamination purposes. In the context of a mitigation approach to infection spreading, UV-C can be particularly helpful in the inactivation of virus-containing aerosols and surfaces. effect of UV-C seems to be strongly dependent on the relative humidity of the air, with UV-C effectiveness against influenza virus decreasing with increasing relative humidity [36] .The potential of viral spreading via contaminated surfaces depends on the ability of the virus to maintain infectivity in the environment, which in turn is influenced by several biological, physical, and chemical factors, including the type of virus, temperature, relative humidity, and type of surface [37] . Importantly, single-stranded nucleic acid (ssRNA and ssDNA) viruses were more susceptible to UV inactivation than viruses with double-stranded nucleic acid (dsRNA and dsDNA). Also, the UV dose necessary to achieve the same level of virus inactivation at 85 % relative humidity (RH) was higher than that at 55 % RH [37].In a recent study, Fischer et al showed that UV-C light can inactivate more than 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles deposited over the filtering material of N95 masks and stainless steel surface [38] . As expected, inactivation kinetics over stainless steel was much faster (i.e., more than 99.9% for (0.33 J/cm 2 ). However, after sufficient exposure (1.98 J/cm 2 ) UV-C could promote germicidal efficacy levels that were similar to those promoted by ethanol, dry heat or vaporized hydrogen peroxide. Older studies have hypothesized that the necessary dose to inactivate 90 % of viruses present in N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) material would be about 30 times higher than over the surface of non-porous materials [39] . This was an interesting estimation, but we should keep in mind that UV-C emission spectrum and irradiance of different UV-C equipment as well as material composition are widely variable [40] . Therefore, such estimatives cannot be used as a robust procedure and experimental demonstrations must always be presented. Indeed, a recent in silico study demonstrated that for effective and fast decontamination one should consider the FFR shape besides the optical properties of the FFR model, which has to be determined at the UV-C specific wavelength [41] . Even though UV does not seem to affect the filtrating capacity of FFRs, it is important to note that high UV-C doses can lead to reduced tensile strength of its materials [42, 43] .It must be remarked that UV-C light at 254 nm is harmful to the eyes and skin and, therefore, it is recommended to use it in setups that avoid direct human exposure. Although, far-UV-C (207-222 nm) has been proposed as a disinfection technology that seems to be safer to human exposure [46] . This has been claimed because far-UV-C range is strongly absorbed by amino acid residues and, therefore, is further blocked by the acellular stratum corneum of the skin and the cornea of the eye, leading to lower levels of UV-C light reaching the cellular layers of eyes and skin. However, as far as our knowledge goes, robust studies showing the actual safety of far-UV-C towards animal tissues in short and long terms have not been strongly established and degradation of proteins can also lead to serious eye and skin damages. Thus, we can only recommend UV-C application to inanimate objects. Additionally, far-UV-C technology is not broadly available in the market yet and the cost is far higher than common LP-Hg lamps. On the other hand, UV-C LED technology is limited to very compact applications. The shortest wavelengths available are around 255 nm, with the price per Watt being up to 1,000 times higher than that of LP-Hg lamps, while displaying an energy efficiency (< 1 %) far lower than that of LP-Hg lamps (25-40 %) at 254 nm.Visible light can exert antiviral effects via photodynamic mechanisms that are initiated upon absorption of light by exogenous photosensitizer compounds, such as phenothiazinium salts, porphyrins, nanoparticles, and others [47] [48] [49] [50] . The inactivation of microorganisms and viruses by visible light is based on the generation of lethal oxidant species via photosensitized oxidation reactions, which usually require three components: the chromophore, termed the photosensitizer (PS), light, and oxygen, even though some PS may also work through alternative reactions in the absence of oxygen [51] . After light absorption, excited oxygen states are quickly formed, initially in the singlet, and subsequently in the triplet states (i.e., considering the photocycle of organic molecules). These species can release the excitation energy in the form of light (e.g., fluorescence and phosphorescence) or heat (non-radiative decay) emission. Since excited states are intrinsically more reactive than ground states, energy and electron transfer reactions can occur. There are two main mechanisms of photosensitized oxidation: Type I reactions depend on the encounter of the excited species with biological substrates. These reactions usually occur through electron or hydrogen abstraction, leading to radical chain reactions; Type II reactions rely on energy transfer reaction from the PS triplet state to molecular oxygen, generating singlet oxygen Figure 1 ) [52] . Spacially, type I reactions require the PS to be within a subnanometer J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f distance to the virus, whereas type II reactions allow singlet oxygen diffusion to more than 100 nm [51] .Light energy is thus converted into oxidation potential that can damage biomolecules.Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is based on this process and it has been used to treat localized microbial infections caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites [53].Among the many pathogens that can be targeted by aPDT, viruses are perhaps the most vulnerable, as they depend on entering a host cell for survival and replication and can be inactivated by damaging the capsid or envelope molecules (lipids, carbohydrates, proteins) or internal molecules (nucleic acids) ( Figure 1 ). Thus, many viruses can be treated via aPDT, including papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV)[54-56]. Additionally, the disinfection of biological fluids (plasma and blood products) by photoantimicrobials has been performed for decades and is a well-regarded technological application of these compounds. For instance, extracorporeal photoinactivation of coronaviruses and other clinically relevant pathogens using methylene blue (MB)-mediated aPDT has been reported [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] .It is possible that photosensitized oxidation can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and, consequently, play a role in mitigating the ongoing pandemic; however, there is no data available on the photodynamic inactivation of this virus. Thus, here we sought to find and discuss scientific literature that could help predict whether COVID-19 is more or less susceptible to oxidant species generated during aPDT.While all types of viruses can be neutralized by aPDT, the inactivation efficiency depends on both the PS and the virus [63, 64] . As a rule of the thumb, RNA-type phages are more easily photoinactivated than their DNA-type counterparts, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2, which is an enveloped RNA-type virus, can be easily neutralized by aPDT [64, 65] . Guanine bases are the major targets for oxidation by photosensitizing agents in both RNA and DNA [66] . The formation of RNA-protein crosslinks may also be an important lesion involved in virus inactivation via aPDT [67] .Enveloped viruses are more prone to aPDT neutralization than those without an envelope, due to the role of PS in damaging envelope components [68, 69] . Initial studies on viral J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof inactivation by aPDT demonstrated the importance of the PS reaching specific reaction sites, so-called ""marked targets"", for efficient viral inactivation [70] . Other reports have confirmed the importance of PS binding on efficient virus inactivation via aPDT, and the PS membrane partition coefficients can be used as a predictor of its virus inactivation efficacy [71, 72] .Transmission electron microscopy data has revealed that low PS concentrations degrade envelope surface glycoproteins blocking virus internalization, while higher PS concentrations can destroy lipid membranes [73] . These results can be interpreted in terms of the current mechanistic understanding of photosensitized oxidation, specifically the important role of direct-contact reactions. Irreversible membrane damage occurs with the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an unsaturated fatty acid by direct reaction with the triplet excited state of the PS. Subsequent formation of peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals leads to the build-up of truncated lipid aldehydes, which are ultimately responsible for opening membrane pores [74] .The fact that irreversible damage occurs due to contact-dependent reactions, indicates that the damage can be confined within the nanometer location site of the PS [75] .In terms of the application of aPDT to treat COVID-19 patients, it is encouraging to note that this technique is already used to treat several respiratory diseases [76] . PDT has been used for decades to treat lung cancers and its successful application in the treatment of laryngeal papillomas has also been reported [77] . Considering that: 1) SARS-CoV2 is an enveloped RNA virus, 2) aPDT is efficient at neutralizing such viruses, and 3) light is already used to treat lung and airway-related infections, we propose that aPDT is a good candidate for treating COVID-19 or as an adjunct to disinfect biological fluids. Alternatively, photosensitizers could also be used to decontaminate liquids and surfaces or be incorporated into polymeric matrices such as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof plastics, fabrics, paper, and paints to produce photoantimicrobial materials [53, 58, 81] .Allotropes of carbon such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene can also show lightactivated antimicrobial effects, including the inactivation of viruses [69, 82, 83] .Visible blue light exhibits microbicidal effects in the wavelength range of 405-470 nm [25, [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] . High-intensity narrow-spectrum light at 405 nm has been used for continuous . Since endogenous photoreceptors appear to be absent in viruses, the mechanisms by which aBL affects these pathogens remains unclear. However, it is currently known that: 1) the use of exogenous photosensitizers improves the efficiency of inactivation by blue light, and 2) the inactivation is more pronounced when viral particles are present in body fluids, e.g., saliva, feces, and blood plasma, which contain photosensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa wound infections [99, 100] . Oral anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and P. nigrescens) were also inhibited or completely eradicated under blue light irradiation [101, 102] .In a recent bioinformatics study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported to be dependent on porphyrin, which it captures from human hemoglobin, resulting in altered heme metabolism [103] . However, the in silico methods used to obtain such results have been questioned by a commentary publication, putting into doubt wheter SARS-CoV-2 actually interacts with heme metabolism and accumulates porphyrins [103] . If this thesis is experimentally proven to be correct, aBL might be able to kill SARS-CoV-2 by photoexcitation of its acquired porphyrins. Thus, experimental studies are required to verify the potential of aBL to prevent and control COVID-19.Photobiomodulation (PBM) employs low levels of red or near-infrared (NIR) light to treat and heal wounds and injuries, reduce pain and inflammation, regenerate damaged tissue, and protect tissue at risk of dying [104] . Instead of directly targeting viruses, PBM mainly acts on the host cells, which absorb light in the red and near-infrared spectral region [104] . Literature indicates that photons are absorbed by multiple cellular chromophores, including mitochondrial enzymes, to trigger the biological effects of PBM [104] [105] [106] . Cytochrome c oxidase (i.e., unit IV in the mitochondrial respiratory chain) appears to play a main role in this process [104] . Other molecular chromophores include light and heat-sensitive ion channels (transient receptor potential) that, upon light activation, lead to changes in calcium concentrations. Nanostructured water (interfacial water) is also likely to act as a chromophore. Upon irradiation, the mitochondrial membrane potential is raised and oxygen consumption and ATP generation are increased. Subsequent activation of signaling pathways and transcription factors leads to fairly long-lasting effects even after relatively brief exposure of the tissue to light [107] .In the early 1900s, Finsen reported that patients exposed to red light exhibited significantly better recovery from smallpox infections than unexposed counterparts [21] . Since then, PBM J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof has been used in the treatment of acute lung injury, pulmonary inflammation, and models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to its ability to substantially reduce systemic inflammation while preserving lung function. [108] [109] [110] . There are currently 90 published papers on PBM concerning ""acute lung injury"" [110] OR ""pulmonary inflammation"" [111] OR ""lung inflammation"" [109] OR ""ARDS"" [112] OR ""lung oxidative stress"" [113] OR ""asthma"" [114] many involving small animal models where it can be argued that light penetrates more easily than in humans. Because COVID-19 involves a ""cytokine storm"", PBM delivered to the torso (chest and back) might not only allow some light to reach the lungs but might also reduce the systemic inflammation responsible for COVID-19 sepsislike syndrome [115] and disseminated intravascular coagulation [116] that can be deadly [117] . Moreover, PBM is more effective on hypoxic cells [118] , suggesting it could be effective for COVID-19 infection, which seems to be characterized by severe hypoxia [119] .Nevertheless, so far there are no experimental data supporting the influence of PBM on COVID-19. Therefore, clinical studies have to be performed to understand whether PBM therapy may actually reduce the cytokine storm impacts for COVID-19 patients.Hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation or under high-oxygen continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment could be placed on an LED pad. These do not generate unacceptable levels of heat, so the high fever experienced by these patients should not be a problem. LED-based PBM devices similar to these have been approved by the FDA for general health and wellness applications, and there are no reported adverse effects [120] .However, PBM is not recommended to be used over cancerous lesions since the effects on tumor cells are not fully understood yet [121] .Ultrashort pulse lasers (USPLs) emitting visible to near-infrared light have been used to inactivate a broad spectrum of viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, M13 bacteriophage, tobacco mosaic virus, and murine cytomegalovirus) with no damage to human or murine cells [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] . Regardless of wavelength, ultrafast laser irradiation at low mean irradiance levels (≤ 1 W/cm 2 ) does not promote ionization effects that could impair host cells. This irradiation does not appear to destroy either bovine serum albumin or single-stranded DNA, nor cause adverse effects like those produced by toxic or carcinogenic chemicals. Previous works suggest that the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f antimicrobial effect of USPLs at low mean irradiance is exerted via impulsive stimulated Raman scattering, whereby high-frequency resonance vibrations provoke vibrations of sufficient strength to disintegrate the capsid into subunits through the breaking of weak links (e.g., hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts) in non-enveloped viruses [126] . For enveloped virus, USPLs promote vibrations on the proteins of the capsid. These excitations break the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts causing partial unfolding of the proteins.Since the concentration of confined proteins is very high within the capsid of a virus, they can assemble with other neighboring proteins, leading to the aggregation of proteins [125] . In contrast, an intense laser pulse could generate shock wave-like vibrations upon impact with the virus to promote viral inactivation [126] . Potential use of USPLs encompasses the inactivation of pathogens in pharmaceuticals, blood products and uncooked foods as well as chemical-free whole inactivated virus vaccine preparation [127, 128] . Laser treatment resulted in 1-log, 2-log, and 3-log reductions in hepatitis A, human immunodeficiency, and murine cytomegalovirus, respectively, in human plasma with no changes in the structure of fibrinogen [127] . Further, in mice USPL-induced inactivation of H1N1 influenza virus was more effective than formalin and did not cause damage to viral surface proteins or resulted in the production of carbonyl groups in proteins [128] .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fAs we presented in this review, light-based technologies have unique features that could be useful to face the COVID-19 pandemic, but could also present pitfalls that deserve to be highlighted. Thus, we compiled at Table 1 their advantages and disadvantages.In summary, we have described how light-based strategies can be used to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission through air, water, and surfaces as well as potential therapeutic applications that can reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. From our perspective, light provides several practical answers to the new logistical and therapeutic challenges brought by COVID- 19 . Therefore, we suggest that the death toll and quarantine extent can be significantly mitigated if at least part of these strategies are encouraged and implemented by health systems. Given the urgent demand raised by the current uncontrolled pandemic we must be ready to use all the available armamentarium to fight COVID-19.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

e2c53ae22cba79015d63a6a28357a865c2d069d5,"Epidemic trends, public health response and health system capacity: the Chilean experience in four months of the COVID-19 pandemic","In Chile, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on 3 March, almost two months after the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was officially declared by China CDC as the causal agent of the outbreak initiated on Wuhan on 17 November 2019 (1) .The responses of countries to the pandemic range over a diversity of strategies (2) (3) (4) (5) and the current evidence on those strategies still relies mostly on modelling studies based on developing knowledge and available public data (6) . From the experience of countries with large-scale community transmission such as China, Italy or Spain, it has been learned that COVID-19 requires unprecedented mobilization of health systems (7) . The demand on health care systems, especially intensive care units (ICU), coming from large numbers of people becoming ill simultaneously has stressed the health systems.The threat from COVID-19 is dependent on the number of new cases occurring simultaneously in a given time and the capacity of a country's health care system to respond to the increasing demand for health care (7) . According to the World Health Organization, a comprehensive national response should include public health measures that break chains of person-to-person transmission (identification, isolation, testing, and clinical care for all cases; tracing and quarantine of all contacts), as well as other public health and social measures involving all sectors to suppress or stop community spread of COVID-19 (actions by individuals, institutions, communities, local and national governments) (8) . The prompt decisionmaking at the national level regarding public health actions and the involvement of all sectors in order to ensure that every sector takes ownership of and participates in the response are key to success (9) . Moreover, the capacity for the health care system to effectively respond to the demand will depend on the available resources, particularly hospital beds, intensive care units (ICU) capacity and specialized human resources.In Chile, during the four month-period after the first case was officially reported, several public health measures have been undertaken to both attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to strengthen the health care system response capacity.The objective of this study is to report the surveillance of COVID-19 pandemic and to analyse the response to public health interventions implemented during the first 120 days of the pandemic, from 3 March to 30 June 2020.We conducted an observational ecological study based on official daily public reports from the Ministry of Health of Chile, including new confirmed cases, severe cases requiring admission to ICU, deaths attributable to COVID-19, and the number of new diagnostic test (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 detection both at the national and subnational levels (regions) (10) .To monitor the evolving situation of the pandemic five main indicators were used: 1) estimates of the effective reproductive number R e ; 2) estimates of the underreporting of cases; 3) estimates of the burden of ICU beds occupation; 4) estimates of the corrected (delay-adjusted) case fatality ratio; and 5) number of diagnostic RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 performed.We calculated Re (t) using the method developed by Cori et al. (11) . We considered the last 2 weeks (14 days) and a serial interval τ = 5 days (10) with usual variability between 3 and 7 days (12) (13) (14) .Underreporting of cases was estimated according to the method proposed by Russell et al. (15, 16) . The crude fatality ratio (quotient between the number of deaths and the number of total cases at time t) was corrected for the lag between diagnosis and death, on average about 13 days; however, the lag period can be shorter or longer than average, which is determined by the probability distribution of dying at a given time after diagnosis. An adapted version of the R code provided by Russell et al. (15, 16) was used to estimate the corrected case-fatality ratio (Lc). According to the same authors the underreport correction was estimated from the difference between the corrected fatality ratio and a reference value that was 1.38% (16) .We estimated the burden of critical beds based on the index proposed by González et al. (17) , which we modified to:, where ICU is the reported number of ICUs in Chile (18) and ICUr is the daily number of occupied critical beds reported by the Ministry of Health. I ICU > 1 means that there is an overload. This number of beds includes both public and private hospital providers. Since April 9, the Ministry of Health is reporting the number of diagnostic test (RT-PCR) performed for each country region. These data not always correspond to the exact number of samples per region since exams are sent for analysis elsewhere when their number exceeds the region's PCR testing capacity. In spite of this limitation, we consider the available data useful as the best proxy for the diagnostic effort at subnational level.The diagnostic effort for each region was estimated as the ratio between the average daily PCR between 7 and 20 May (last 14 days), divided by the total population of the region. Thus, this value represents the average daily amount of PCR per 100,000 inhabitants in the region (PCR rate per 100,000 inhabitants). We also calculated the average number of new cases per day per region, for the same period (C*). The ratio between these values, Dc = C*/(PCR rate), indicates the daily average increase of new COVID-19 cases for each point of increase in diagnostic effort rate (per 1,000,000 inhabitants). In addition, we calculated the number of PCR tests per confirmed case, for the whole country and each region.Since our study is based on secondary data from the Chilean Ministry of Health's official daily public reports it did not required approval from an Ethics Committee.As of 30 June, a total of 261,215 cases had been reported with a cumulative incidence of 1608.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, distributed similarly among males and females (man/woman ratio = 1,074 In Chile, the COVID-19 pandemic began on 3 March with the detection of the first imported case. From that moment on, it presented a rapid exponential increase. The main public health interventions were case isolation and contact tracing, jointly implemented with successive social distancing interventions such as closure of schools and universities country-wide ( (27 March) . Subsequently, there was an increase at a lower rate and stabilization at around 400 confirmed cases per day from 9 April to 1 May. A marked increase in the epidemic curve was evident since 2 May, with a rapid increase particularly due to a growing outbreak on poor and densely populated areas of Santiago, with a peak on mid-June ( Figure 1 ).However, based on the case fatality adjusted for delay, a significant underreport of new cases was estimated ( Figure 2 ). We estimated that nearly 50% (CI 95%: 43% -56%) of the symptomatic cases would have been detected at 30 June, day 120 of the outbreak, with an important decline starting in early April, scenario, but with a critical increase since the first days of May. Likewise, the occupation of ICU beds, which was initially above the expected values but below saturation threshold, by the end of May the demand of critical beds reached 1,000 ICU occupied and 2,497 by the end of June (I ICU = 1.49).COVID-19 has become a pandemic compromising many countries and leading to dramatic scenarios, such as in Italy, Spain and the United States. However, some countries, including South Korea, China, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved relative control of the pandemic, probably associated with the surveillance response and early public health interventions based on their previous experience with SARS in 2002-2003 (19) . China opted for an early lockdown with severe restrictions on domestic and international travel, disinfection of buildings and extensive testing, associated with a large increase in the health system capacity (2, 20) . South Korea implemented an active strategy of free and massive screening for symptomatic people, case contacts and travellers; schools were closed, remote work was recommended, and large gatherings were prohibited (21) . The use of masks, disinfectants and thermal detection in buildings were widespread. There have been no blockages or restrictions on movement, and people under quarantine were monitored by the government and the police through smartphone apps, with offenders punished. Private suggesting that the testing capacity of the country reached its roof at that point and was not able to expand at the rate of the epidemic spread.The reproductive number (R e (t)) progressively decreased, stabilising at values close to 1.0 between 13 and 27 April, with a significant increase after this date, stabilizing around 1.3 to 1.4 at the end of May, but decreasing to values lower than 1.0 from 20 June to the last day covered in our study (30 June) ( Figure 3 ).Despite the initial decrease in the speed of the spread of COVID-19 in the country, eight regions had acceleration with respect to the previous week, and nine regions had a reproductive number higher than one (Table 1) .Up to 30 June, a total of 1,120,177 PCR tests have been performed for COVID-19, with a rate of 3.97 tests per confirmed case. The diagnostic effort is highly variable between regions. In the Metropolitan region for each point of increase in PCR rate the number of daily cases increases significantly ( Table 2) .The burden on critical beds in the first 50 days of the pandemic remained at values that were tolerable at the country level, but with a heterogeneous distribution at the regional level. However, after the rapid increment of cases, at 30 June the situation had reached very critical levels with high demand and occupation of ICU beds, almost doubling the pre-pandemic capacity of ICU beds (1,200 ICU beds; 6.2 beds/100,000 inhabitant).When comparing the trajectory of the Chilean epidemic with initially modelled scenarios, after an accelerated starting period the epidemic trajectory evolved according to a more favourable public about the risks and precautions associated with COVID-19 has also been important (2) .A key issue for epidemiologists is to help policy makers decide the main goals of mitigation, for example, minimizing associated morbidity and mortality, avoiding an epidemic peak that saturates health care services, keeping the effects on the economy within manageable levels, and flattening the epidemic curve gaining time for the discovery of therapeutic drugs or a vaccine. Epidemiological interventions should be aimed at: a) preventing susceptible population from viral exposure, with policies to reduce human mobility, increase social distancing or incentivize individual hygienic measures (23); b) identifying exposed contacts and prevent recurrent exposure from infected patients with case and contact management sector companies were actively involved in the dissemination and collection of virus-related information, including data on confirmed COVID-19 patients, along with nationality, gender and age of the patients, places visited by patients, and close contact tracing (21) . In Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, surveillance systems were used to identify potential cases and their contacts, diagnostic tests were developed from the outset, and laboratory testing capacity was increased (22) . Different strategies were used to control travellers entering these locations, from partial entry restrictions to mandatory 14-day quarantine of non-local visitors. Taiwan worked actively on the case identification and authorities tracked down infected people and mapped cases while residents' 14-day travel history was integrated with their health insurance card details; educating the (test-trace-isolate) and; c) actions to identify carriers of the virus, trough passive and active screening strategies (23) . Among these measures, isolating symptomatic individuals and tracing and quarantining their contacts are the most essential ones to stop the transmission chain (24) . It has been proposed that in a disease with an R 0 = 2.5, at least 70% of the contacts should be traced at the beginning of the epidemic in order to control an outbreak (23) .quantity of active infected that has risen 8.9 times between the 1 May and 14 June (from 7,756 to 69,134). A key feature of this period was the delayed response from the authorities to implement larger-scale lockdowns after the rapid spread of cases in the poorest neighborhoods of Santiago, with high rates of household overcrowding and poverty. An increase in the occupation of ICU followed, currently being 89% nationally (95% in the Metropolitan Region) with 2,044 COVID patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (30) and a significant elevation in the number of deaths, reaching 5,688 by 30 June. Later in this phase large-scale lockdowns were implemented in Santiago, that included at least five million people in the Metropolitan Region, with a recent decrease in the reproductive number, the daily cases, the load of active infected individuals and the percent of positive tests (24.2%). Some considerations make the analysis more complex. First, there is a clear underreporting of cases that can be estimated to be close to 50% at the end of the analysed period. This questions the real value of Re and the effectiveness of case tracing efforts and contacts isolation. The relationship between the number of reported cases and PCR rate is still high (51.1) in average, indicating that for each point of increase in the number of PCR rate per 100,000 inhabitants, a total of 235 cases are expected to be added each week. Second, when comparing the number of PCR tests per confirmed case, the ratio observed in Chile (3.97) is much lower than the ones reported in countries such as Vietnam (671.9) or Taiwan (134.7), but close to those informed in some Latin American countries such as Argentina (12.1) and Peru (9.5) (31). A lower ratio of PCR test per confirmed case suggest that the diagnostic efforts are insufficient. Moreover, there are important differences in the diagnostic efforts made across regions of the country. Even when PCR exams are reported according to the region where the laboratory that performed the exam is located and not according to provenance of samples, this heterogeneity across regions could suggest important differences in terms of the capacity to early identify and isolate cases.The effective reproductive number was decreasing progressively to values close to 1.0, but after 1 May there was an important increase in its value stabilizing between 1.3 and 1.4 on mid-May but decreasing recently to values lower than one from mid-June. The estimation of Re is sensitive to both the method used and the serial interval. We accounted for this by using serial interval values between 3 and 7, based on the usual extreme values reported in the literature, to estimate the credibility intervals of the R e (t) (13, 32, 33) .In order to analyse and monitor the epidemic of COVID-19, we first considered three thresholds of ICU beds occupation: 500 ICU beds, approximately 50% of the initial availability, and 2,000 ICU as an estimate of the maximum possible capacity. On 30 June, the Chilean government informed 2,075 ICU beds occupied, which is close to saturation level. The burden of ICU bed occupancy is well represented by the load index that is 1.49 at that date.In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile showed a first phase of accelerated onset, followed by partially successful initial contention efforts that led to a full epidemic growth after first measures where relaxed and a delayed response to reinstall mitigation interventions occurred. The epidemic had a great increase in mid-June and in the last days is decreasing, but with high number of daily cases. Although our study is ecological and caution is needed when analysing the results, our findings In the four month analysed period, based on the public health interventions implemented in Chile, we identified four phases in the country's response to the early epidemic: first phase, between 13 and 15 March; second phase, between 16 and 26 March; third phase, between 26 March and 1 May; and fourth after 1 May.During the first phase, the effort was focused on the detection and traceability of imported cases and on educating the population on hygiene and social distancing measures. The number of total cases reached 75 on 15 March. The following day (16 March) , the government decreed the closure of schools, and universities voluntarily suspended face-to-face activities. At this time the initial estimates of R e (t) were high; however, with very few and sporadic cases, it was not possible yet to estimate a categorical value of the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) since the best estimate of it is obtained by reaching the breakdown of the epidemic curve associated with control and/or mitigation measures (25) .The second stage (16 to 26 March) began with the closure of schools and universities. In this stage a state of national catastrophe was decreed (19 March) which allowed the government to impose a partial lockdown of Santiago Metropolitan Region (quarantine for small-areas within the city, called ""dynamic quarantines"") and a national overnight curfew (10 pm to 5 am). Several measures were taken, including restrictions for public gatherings, quarantine of older adults, 14 days-quarantine for travellers coming from countries with high COVID-19 incidence, quarantine of contacts of COVID-19 cases, restrictions for international traveling (air, land or water transport) and some domestic travels. A clear break in the epidemic curve was observed on 27 March (24 days after the first case of COVID-19), making possible to estimate the basic reproductive number: R 0 = 2.38 (95% CI: 1.72-3.52). Beyond the known limitations of ecological studies (26) and specifically of the complexities in the calculation of the basic reproduction number (27) , the apparent break in the viral transmission, however, cannot be associated to the dynamic quarantines since this strategy only started one day prior to the break of the epidemic curve.The third phase (26 March to 1 May) began with the lockdown of the cities of Temuco, Chillán and Osorno which followed the small-area lockdowns of Santiago Metropolitan Region. At this stage it could be observed a progressive decrease in R e (t) values to close to 1.0 similar to the experience of other countries (28) . In this phase, a series of dynamic quarantines were established or lifted according to the number of new cases, the speed of spread of the disease, the density of cases/km 2 , and the age profile and social vulnerability of the involved population. The compliance with quarantines was verified, controlling the entry and exit of quarantined areas in sanitary cords. In general terms, a relative but fragile stabilization was achieved in the number of daily cases in ranges that allow an adequate response from the health care system, with case fatality rates converging to those estimates reported in the international literature (15, 5) . Early evidence suggests that this small-area lockdowns were effective in reducing human mobility and the effective reproductive number at this stage (29) . Although the effective reproductive number was 1.06, the number of actively infectious individuals was close to 5,000 which could generate a maximal of 5,300 new cases in a serial period (5 days) with the subsequently increasing load for the health care system gradually.The fourth phase (after 1 May) was characterized by a marked exponential increase in the number of cases with a the pandemic, suffering large outbreaks in the context of highly unequal urban areas such as Santiago.All authors contributed to the study design, the analysis of the results, the discussion and the manuscript writing; MC, CC and AC contributed to the statistical analysis.Funding.

However, when the pandemic was relatively controlled, three challenges may have constituted short-term risks for the country that unfolded in a failure to adequately manage the outbreak: i) the load of actively infected diagnosed patients was high with important numbers of underreported cases; ii) a diagnostic effort that was limited and heterogeneous across regions; ii) a limited reserve of ICU beds. In this context, political decisions leading to de-escalate public health interventions may have triggered an accelerated rebound in cases with a rapid high stress, near saturation level, of the health care system.

f11f466ccf68b471c48dc68d5bea584794613087,Epidemiology and Infection Risk clusters of COVID-19 transmission in northeastern Brazil: prospective space-time modelling,"The world has been facing an international public health emergency caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] . The disease was firstly reported in the city of Wuhan (China) at the end of December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020 [2] . There were more than 17 million cases and over 650 000 deaths by COVID-19 confirmed worldwide [1] . Notably, the pandemic has been challenging for health systems and governments, as the extent of the social and economic impacts of the pandemic is still uncertain [3] .Following the disease's dynamics and the exponential growth of the number of cases, several studies have been reported [2] [3] [4] [5] . Particularly, those that perform temporal and spatial analyses of COVID-19 have demonstrated the impact of morbidity, mortality and global geographical dissemination of the disease in the world. The use of aggregate spatial data allows to map the patterns of the rapid progression of the disease and to support decision-making in the allocation of resources for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in priority areas [3] [4] [5] [6] .In this context, a study that used spatial analysis techniques, conducted in China, found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was spatially dependent and spread mainly from Hubei province, in Central China, to the surrounding areas [7] . Additionally, the spatial distribution of cases and mortality by COVID-19 is heterogeneous across regions, especially in those with socioeconomic disparities [8, 9] .This uneven geographic distribution has been observed in several regions of the United States. The disease has disproportionately affected populations in situations of social vulnerability, as observed in poorer communities from Chicago and New York. The inadequate effects of COVID-19 reflect the social inequities that existed prior to the current health crisis [9] .Recently, Brazil has become the epicentre of the epidemic in Latin America and ranks second in the world in the total number of cases (behind only the USA) [10] . COVID-19's first case was confirmed on 26 February 2020 and the country currently has more than half a million cases and about 30 000 deaths. Among Brazilian regions, the Northeast ranks second with the highest number of cases [11] . Additionally, Brazil is still marked by great social and human development inequalities, especially in the Northeast region [12] . This highlights the need for scientific research on the epidemiology and spatial distribution of COVID-19 in the municipalities of this region.Notably, studies of spatial and temporal patterns help to elucidate the mechanisms of disease spread in the population and to identify factors associated with heterogeneous geographic distribution [3, 6] . Similarly, prospective space-time analysis is required to monitor outbreaks, as it allows the detection of active, emerging clusters and the relative risk (RR) for each affected site during the epidemic [13] . Therefore, considering the current situation of COVID-19 in the regions of the country, the study aimed to analyse the trend and spatial-temporal clusters of transmission risk of COVID-19 in northeastern Brazil, defining priority areas for surveillance actions and more effective disease control in the states.We conducted an ecological study with techniques of spatial analysis and temporal trend. All confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Northeast region of Brazil were included, from 7 March to 22 May 2020 (divided into 12 epidemiological weeks). The units of analysis were the nine states (federative unit) in the region and its 1794 municipalities. Data were collected daily regarding the municipality of residence of confirmed cases of COVID-19. We excluded 1519 cases with no data of county location [14] .Brazil occupies a territorial area of 8.51 million km 2 , which is equivalent to almost 50% of South America territory and has a total population of 210.1 million inhabitants [15] . It is the country with the fifth largest territorial area on the planet and the sixth largest population, with a demographic density of 24.47 inhabitants per km 2 [15, 16] . The Northeast region (latitude: 01°0 2 ′ 30 ′′ N/18°20 ′ 07 ′′ S; longitude: 34°47 ′ 30 ′′ E/48°45 ′ 24 ′′ W) is one of the five Brazilian regions and the one with the largest number of federative units (nine) (Fig. 1) . This region has the third largest territorial area in Brazil (155 291 744 km 2 ) and a population of 57 071 654 inhabitants, which corresponds to about 30% of the Brazilian population. The highest population density occurs in the coastal strip, where most state capitals are located [16] . The Northeast region of Brazil also presents the lowest human development index in Brazil (HDI = 0.663) [17] .The variables analysed in this study were:(a) New cases of COVID-19 in the 1794 municipalities of Northeast region of Brazil. The calculation was based on subtracting the previous day's count (n t ) from the previous day (n t−1 );(b) Weekly incidence rates for states, metropolitan (MA) and inland areas were calculated per 100 000 inhabitants. For the calculation, we used the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per week in each state, in the metropolitan and inland areas, as the numerator and the corresponding populations as the denominator; (c) COVID-19 incidence rates of municipalities were calculated per 100 000 inhabitants. For the calculation, the number of accumulated cases of COVID-19 in each municipality was used as the numerator and the corresponding current population as the denominator.To assess the weekly time trend of cases by COVID-19, we performed data analysis using the segmented log-linear regression model. The incidence rates of COVID-19 were considered dependent variables and the epidemiological weeks were the independent variables. The Monte Carlo permutation test was used to select the best model for inflection points, applying 999 permutations and considering the highest residue determination coefficient (R 2 ). To describe and quantify the time trends, we calculated the weekly percentage increments (adapted from annual percent changes; APC) [18] and their respective confidence intervals (95% CI). Once more than one significant inflection was detected during the study period, and the average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) were calculated. Time trends were considered statistically significant when APCs had a P-value <0.05 and their 95% CI did not include a zero value. A positive and significant APC value indicates an increasing trend; a negative and significant APC indicates a decreasing trend and non-significant trends are described stable, regardless of APC values [19] .The raw data rates were smoothed by the local empirical Bayesian estimator [20] to minimise the instability caused by the random fluctuation of the cases. Rate smoothing was done by applying weighted averages, resulting in a second adjusted rate. The crude and smoothed incidence rates were represented in thematic maps stratified into five categories of equal intervals: (a) 0 (without a record of cases or not specified), (b) 0.1-100, (c) 100-200, (d) 200-300 and (e) ⩾300.To verify whether the spatial distribution of COVID-19 occurs randomly in space, we performed spatial autocorrelation analysis of crude incidence rates by calculating the univariate global Moran index. For that, we elaborated a spatial proximity matrix obtained by the contiguity criterion, with a significance level of 5%. This index ranges from −1 to +1 so that values close to zero indicate spatial randomness; values between 0 and +1 indicate positive spatial autocorrelation and, between −1 and 0, negative spatial autocorrelation [21] .The global Moran autocorrelation coefficient is based on the cross products of the deviations from the mean being calculated for the observations as follows:where ω ij is a contiguity matrix element (ω), γ i is the incidence rate of municipality i, γ j is the incidence rate of municipality j, y is the mean of the sample and the symbol n represents the total number of municipalities [22] .The local Moran index (or local index of spatial association; LISA) [13] was used to compare the value of each municipality with the surrounding municipalities and to verify the spatial dependence between them. In addition, to assess the local spatial grouping and to verify that the process stationarity hypothesis occurs locally, we obtained a measure of the association for each unit using the following equation [23] :where Z i = y i − y; Z j = y j − y; ω ij is the contiguous matrix element ω; y i is the incidence rate of municipality i; y j is the incidence rate of municipality j; y is the sample mean and the symbol n represents the total number of cities [22] . Subsequently, a scattering diagram was obtained with the following spatial quadrants: Q1 (high/high) and Q2 (low/low), which indicate municipalities with values similar to those of the surrounding ones, and represent areas of agreement with positive spatial association aggregates; Q3 (high/low) and Q4 (low/high) indicate municipalities with differing values and which represent transition areas with aggregates of negative spatial association [22] . The significant results were visually expressed on Moran maps.The prospective space-time scan statistic was performed to identify high-risk space-time clusters for transmission of COVID-19, using the Poisson probability distribution model [13, 24] . This analysis allows us to evaluate potential clusters that are still occurring at the end of the study period. We consider as active spacetime clusters (present), those that are still occurring, that is, in activity [6] . Our null hypothesis (H0) is that the expected number of COVID-19 cases in each area is proportional to the size of its population and indicates a constant risk of infection. Although the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the number of observed cases exceeds the expected number of cases derived from the null model [6] .We built the cluster analysis model with the following conditions: minimum aggregation time of 2 days, minimum of five cases, without overlapping of clusters, circular clusters, the maximum size of the spatial cluster of 10% of the population at risk and maximum size of the temporal cluster of 50% of the study period [6] . The primary cluster and secondary clusters were detected using the log-likelihood ratio test and represented on maps [11] . We also calculated the RRs of the occurrence of COVID-19, considering each municipality and agglomerates in relation to the surrounding areas. Results with P-value <0.05 using 999 Monte Carlo simulations were considered significant. for the spatial analysis [27] ; SaTScan™ 9.6 (Harvard Medical School, Boston and Information Management Service Inc., Silver Spring, MD, EUA) for spatiotemporal scanning and cluster analysis [28] .This study used public-domain aggregate secondary data and followed national and international ethical recommendations, as well as the rules of the Helsinki Convention.During the first 11 weeks, after the diagnosis of the first case, 113 951 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the states of the Northeast region of Brazil. As a result, the average incidence rate in that period was 199.73 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. In absolute percentage values, the state of Ceará had the highest number of registered cases of COVID-19, corresponding to 29.40% of the total cases and is considered as the epicentre of the epidemic in the Northeast region. Next are the states of Pernambuco (22.57%) and Maranhão (16.47%). The state of Piauí had the lowest proportion of cases (2.86%).We carried out the time trend analysis according to the number of cases diagnosed per week (Table 1 ). In Figure 2A -J we present the weekly trends following the incidence rates in the region, by state, and by the metropolitan and countryside areas of the states. We observed an increasing trend in the crude incidence Epidemiology and Infection rate of the Northeast region of Brazil population, which presented an AAPC of 76.8 (95% CI 64.1 to 90.5; P-value <0.01; Fig. 2A) . Similarly, increasing trends were observed in all states. However, the highest growth rates were observed in the states of Alagoas (AAPC, 134.1; 95% CI 91.2 to 186.7; P-value <0.01; Fig. 2B ) and Sergipe (AAPC, 128.5; 95% CI 89 to 176.2; P-value <0.01; Fig. 2J ). Although the state of Ceará had the highest percentage of cases in the region, the AAPC was the lowest recorded in the study period (AAPC, 61.0; 95% CI 46.7 to 76.8; P-value <0.01; Table 1 ). Importantly, the largest AAPCs were recorded in the countryside when compared to AAPCs in metropolitan areas of all nine states.Subsequently, to identify areas with a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases, we assessed the spatial distribution of the disease among Northeast region of Brazil municipalities (Fig. 3A-D) . We observed that cases of COVID-19 were widely distributed in the region, with records in 76.76% (n = 1378) of the municipalities (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, the cities with the highest numbers of confirmed cases were Fortaleza (capital of CE; n = 19 270) and Recife (capital of PE; n = 12 523). On the other hand, Salvador (state of BA) is the most populous capital of the Northeast region of Brazil, however, it presented less than half the number of cases (n = 7118) than Fortaleza. The state capitals were responsible for 57 959 cases, equivalent to 50.86% of all cases. We also identified that 23.17% of the municipalities (n = 416) did not register cases of the disease. However, when considering smoothed rates, this percentage was reduced to 0.61% (n = 11; Fig. 3B ). Even with spatial smoothing techniques, the highest incidence rates (areas of greatest risk of COVID-19) were concentrated in the coastal strip of the Northeast region of Brazil, where the metropolitan areas of the states are located. Similarly, significant spatial autocorrelation (high/high; I = 0.373; P = 0.001; Fig. 3C ) was reported in the metropolitan areas and 178 municipalities considered a priority, especially in the states of CE and MA.Next, we performed the prospective space-time scan statistics (Table 2 ) and identified 11 spatiotemporal clusters of COVID-19 cases (Fig. 3D) . The primary cluster (cluster number 1) included 70 municipalities, all from the state of Ceará, and the largest number of cases (22 007), in the period from 4 to 22 May. The crude incidence rate in this cluster was 240.98 cases per 100 000 inhabitants and an RR of 9.64. Of the total clusters identified, five were in the state of Bahia, where the cluster with the highest RR was reported (cluster 10; RR = 19.46).This study analysed the incidence and spatial distribution, and identified the occurrence of risk clusters for SARS-CoV-2 infection in municipalities from northeast Brazil. We reported herein that COVID-19 is a serious public health problem in the Northeast region of Brazil, which lead the ranking of higher incidence and mortality rates of Brazil [11] . In fact, several studies have been investigating the spatial dynamics of the disease, but few of them have applied the integration of methods of time trends, spatial clusters and prospective spatiotemporal clusters to analyse the COVID-19 pandemic [4, 8, 13, 29] . Taken together, our results demonstrate the exponential growth of COVID-19 in the Northeast region of Brazil and the rapid spread of cases from metropolitan areas to countryside municipalities.We observed an increasing temporal trend in all states of the Northeast region of Brazil. Importantly, the highest growth rates were observed in the states of Alagoas and Sergipe, whose AAPCs were even higher than those observed in the Northeast region. Conversely, we notice a centripetal dispersion of the COVID-19 cases on the states. Data from our study demonstrated either an expansion process of the disease towards countryside municipalities, given that AAPCs of the countryside from almost all states (except for Bahia state) were superior when compared to AAPCs of entire region/states or metropolitan areas. These findings warn of the severity of dispersing cases and the projection of collapse in public health systems. Most municipalities in the interior of the states do not have hospitals with exclusive clinical assistance for COVID-19. Expanding cases and increasing demand for clinical care, many patients in these municipalities will be referred to hospitals in metropolitan regions, which are already in a state of overcrowding.The spatial distribution of COVID-19 revealed a wide distribution of the disease in all states, except in Bahia state, herein we observed low incidence rates or absence of cases in countryside municipalities. Interestingly, when we analysed the smoothed rates, a dispersion in this area was also evidenced, since this statistical method considers the proximity of neighbours with confirmed cases. Our results showed clustering of highest incidence rates located in the Salvador metropolitan area like other Brazilian regions. The state of Bahia (and the capital Salvador) is the most populated areas in the Northeast region. However, we observed a distinct epidemiological panorama, with lower incidence and time trend (AAPCs) less than other states and metropolitan areas. We hypothesised that measures to combat the disease were implemented early in the pandemic, such as the blockade of state highways, which may have reduced the spread of the disease among countryside municipalities. It may also indicate diagnosis failures due to low population testing. However, we emphasise that further studies are required to understand the dynamics of the disease in the state of Bahia [30] .Tourism, economic networks and social mobility are important factors to better understanding of the disease progression in different territories [31] . In Wuhan, China, social mobility was associated with high transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and social distancing policies were effective at controlling the epidemic [32] . Thus, we recommend the strengthening of these measures considering the increasing trends of COVID-19 in the Northeast region. This region is the most-searched travel destination of Brazil, especially Ceará state. Additionally, Fortaleza (capital of Ceará state) is the nearest city from Europe and has heavy air traffic (national and international), which probably explains the highest incidence of COVID-19 in the Northeast region of Brazil.The spatiotemporal analysis enabled us to visualise the heterogeneous distribution of COVID-19 and identify spatial dependence and priority areas. Studies using these techniques supported the understanding of disease dissemination towards neighbouring areas in China [4, 7, 29, 33] . Besides, detection of high-risk spatiotemporal clusters can guide the decision making related to the implementation of more strict policies [6] . Furthermore, spatial modelling can assist and guide the implementation of control measures to reduce or prevent the spread of the virus [4, 7, 33]. We also highlight the limitations of the study, which include the use of secondary data reported by health departments. In some records (n = 1519) we did not find information on the location of the cases. In addition, states have adopted testing policies with different criteria since the beginning of virus circulation in the country. We also point out that massive testing policies have not been implemented in Brazil, with symptomatic cases and/or those seeking health services being strictly notified. This may indicate, therefore, that the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil is underreported. Despite the limitations found here, the analyses were not compromised, and our findings bring relevant data and support for decision-making and the formulation of new public policies to face the epidemic in Brazil.We emphasise that the incorporation of geostatistics techniques was able to highlight areas of risk for the occurrence of COVID-19. Additionally, we identified priority regions in Northeast region of Brazil to mitigate the impacts on health and the economy, as well as to assist in the allocation of resources and mobility restriction measures. However, for health monitoring of COVID-19, new studies are required, which may include prospective spatiotemporal modelling, addressing different socio-demographic strata and analysing socioeconomic indicators of the regions.Altogether, our results showed that the epidemic of COVID-19 is growing exponentially in all states of the Northeast region, with priority clusters mainly in the states of Ceará and Maranhão. The results also demonstrate the dispersion of cases to countryside municipalities of the states. COVID-19 represents a serious public health problem, and its impact may be greater, considering the interiorisation process and its growing expansion to more vulnerable areas and without exclusive clinical care for the disease. The dynamics of transmission and the repercussions of COVID-19 in the Northeast region have not yet been fully elucidated and require further studies.The data that support the findings of this study will be available on request and permission of via e-mail from the corresponding author.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-24,8
bc8028e2943741231cba22ffc4a31b5f0625b01d,SARS-CoV-2 infection causes pulmonary shunt by vasodilatation,"Shunt mechanism by vasodilatation, instead, could explain decubitus dependence in oxygenation by blood redistribution as observed in these patients, and moreover, would be more sensible to oxygen supplementation than dead spaces. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes an intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD), determining a shunt mechanism by vasodilatation. We performed contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography to search IPVD shunt in patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Ten patients were recruited; one patient was excluded due to low quality of echocardiographic image, and nine patients were included. IPVD was found in seven (78%) patients, with different grades, including patient with normal compliance and the one without invasive ventilation.We demonstrated that shunt by IPVD is present among patients with COVID-19, and this mechanism is probably implicated in significant hypoxemia observed. were suggested. 1 Classical ARDS presents a widespread occlusion of the pulmonary microvasculature. 2 An autopsy study including patients with COVID-19 has suggested the presence of microthrombosis, which would lead to an increase in dead spaces, contributing to worsening the hypoxemia. 3 Noteworthy, dead spaces would not be sensible to an increase/reduction in oxygen supplementation; instead, shunt mechanism by vasodilatation could explain decubitus dependence in oxygenation by blood redistribution as observed in these patients. Also, the exactly mechanism of hypoxemic patients without dyspnea and preserved compliance continues to need more explanation as well.Computed tomography findings show an enlargement of pulmonary vessels 4 possibly caused by vasodilatation, responsible, at least partially, for the important hypoxia, possibly due to vascular shunt mechanism. Considering that vasodilatation prevails, blood flow would not be homogeneously oxygenated, as observed in other pathologies, like hepatopulmonary syndrome in cirrhosis.We have hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes an important intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD), with a shunt mechanism.2 | METHODSWe have performed an observational study in serially enrolled patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) of Rio de Janeiro hospital, from 24 to 27 April 2020. Liver cirrhosis was excluded by clinical exam, laboratory/image. Clinical, laboratory and mechanical ventilation parameters were collected.Duration of disease was obtained from clinical history, by the first symptom presented. Static pulmonary compliance was calculated using the following formula: tidal volume/plateau pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure. Ten patients were recruited. One patient was excluded due to low quality of echocardiographic image. Eight patients were in invasive ventilation and the one without it was in oxygen supplementation, with 15 L/minute. Among the patients included, seven (78%) presented IPVD, including the one without invasive ventilation. Basal characteristics and IPVD grade are displayed on Table 1 .We have shown that patients with COVID-19 present shunt by IPVD.Although our study was performed only to investigate the presence of a shunt mechanism by IPVD, we could suggest that this mechanism may contribute to hypoxemia along different disease stages. Despite the fact that our study was performed in ICU hospitalized patients, it is possible that this mechanism may be present since the beginning of the disease, contributing to the initial hypoxemia. Noteworthy, cir- Our study has some limitations: first, we performed it in a small number of patients, however, they were consecutively included and we were surprised with the high prevalence of IPVD; second, we did not perform any correlation between IPVD grade and hypoxia, since it was not our aim and also, it should be done in a larger number of patients in different disease phases. Even with oxygen parameters, patients with ICU in mechanical ventilation have many confounding factors that should be adequately controlled in a larger number of patients by a multivariate analysis. Nevertheless, the one patient without mechanical ventilation in our study presented IPVD grade III, suggesting that the mechanism could be present since the beginning of the hypoxemic phase of the disease. Larger studies including different disease stages should be urgently performed. Another question raised with our findings was: why would these patients present this vasodilatation?According to our hypothesis, since SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-2) localized in pneumocytes, the viral endocytosis reduces ACE-2 availability on cell surface. Since ACE-2 is responsible for metabolization of angiotensin-II (AT-2) 6 one should expect a rise on AT-2 levels that has low vasoconstrictor potential on pulmonary vessels. 7 According to general enzymatic kinetics, high AT-2 levels elicited by ACE-2 reduction would downregulate ACE, an enzyme that converts AT-1 to AT-2 and is also responsible for bradykinin degradation, an inflammatory mediator with strong vasodilatation role that could probably be implicated on observed IPVD in these patients ( Figure 1 ). Interestingly, recent evidence describe pulmonary vascular angiogenesis in patients with COVID-19, 3 and bradykinin is also a recognized mediator in vascular permeability and angiogenesis. 8 We believe that our study brings to light a novel pathophysiological process about COVID-19 disease and largest studies including bradykinin determination must be performed. Treatment options, as bradykinin inhibition, should be considered as soon as more evidence emerge.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-02,8
cc75f9da3065918856c8208f81e650649fe4d828,Strategic use of obturator prostheses for the rehabilitation of oral cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,"From the initial identification of the novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) passing through the World Health Organization (WHO) recognition as a pandemic to the current chaotic world scenario, specialists discuss criteria for prioritizing surgical treatment for head and neck aggressive malignant tumors [1] [2] [3] . Several head and neck surgery services have prioritized less complex surgical procedures, avoiding longer surgical time for tumor resections and microsurgical reconstructions aiming to reduce the exposure of the patients and team members to the risk of contagion [4] . These decisions were also based on the need for reducing the period of hospitalization and on the fact that microsurgical reconstructions often require long-standing patient monitoring in intensive care units, which may not be currently available due to the pandemic.In this scenario, when the medical teams consider the surgical procedure unavoidable (weighing the risks of contamination of the patient/team and prognosis of the oncological disease), the multidisciplinary teams must be involved to allow the best possible results. This includes the role of the maxillofacial prosthodontist for the rehabilitation of surgically treated patients with maxillary cancers by the means of filling obturator prostheses that are considered an optimal scientificbased strategy to reduce hospital stay with excellent pain control, reestablishment of oral function (speech, swallowing, mastication, and facial esthetics), and the improvement of psychological and quality of life outcomes for the patients following intraoral cancer resection (Fig. 1) [5] [6] [7] .The strategic use of obturator prostheses for the rehabilitation of oral cancer patients has the potential to reduce the professional burden of head and neck surgical oncology staff * Thais Bianca Brandão thais.brandao@hc.fm.usp.br member during the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential benefits include a reduction in the number of patients' visits by the surgeons because of improved control of pain and oral infections and decreased risk of bacteremia. Also, the reestablishment of oral function immediately following wide surgical resections will help the patient's nutritional status and weight maintenance. In addition, the protocol allows for a prompt surgical recover and hospital discharge. Our team observed a similar number of obturators for oral cancer patients when comparing this same period of time (March to June) between the years 2019 and 2020, 8 versus 6, respectively; however, the number of microsurgical reconstructions dropped from 7 to 0 cases in this same period of time between 2019 and 2020. This may be considered an additional evidence for the fact that the use of obturator prostheses for oral cancer patients improves not only the overall quality of life of patients but also the professional workflow of head and neck surgical oncology teams.In addition, the protocol proposed in this commentary allows for a prompt surgical recovery and hospital discharge. Our team confirmed a similar number of delivered obturators for oral cancer patients between March and June of 2019 and 2020, 8 versus 6, respectively. However, the number of microsurgical reconstructions dropped from 7 to 0 cases in this same period of time. This may be considered an additional evidence that the use of obturator prostheses for oral cancer patients improves not only the overall quality of life of patients but also the professional workflow of the head and neck surgical oncology teams.In our center, the prosthodontic rehabilitation of oral cancer patients is divided into three phases, as follows:1. Immediate surgical obturation: impressions by using arbitrary extended trays and altered casts are obtained before surgery, and the prosthesis is placed during surgical procedure and packed by using circum-zygomatic wires, when necessary 2. Delayed surgical obturation: impressions of the defect are generally performed at ≈ 7 days after surgery and prosthesis is fabricated with an obturator by using a non-altered working cast 3. Definitive obturation: involves definitive prostheses after 3 to 4 months post surgically or 6 to 12 months after radiotherapy Table 1 and Fig. 2 summarize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the workflow of the fabrication of obturator prostheses for the rehabilitation of oral cancer patients.Following the guidelines to avoid unnecessary consultations, molding for the fabrication of the surgical obturator prosthesis must be performed at the same time of hospitalization, followed by intraoperative installation. In order to reduce follow-up for necessary adjustments, a reline or an impression and installation of a new prosthesis (interim obturator) must be performed on the day of hospital discharge-reducing the ideal time of this phase transition from 7 days to approximately 3 days [10] . Obviously, this is a desirable outcome during the pandemic of COVID-19. In addition, such procedure will Fig. 1 Step-by-step procedure for fabricating immediate obturator. a Initial clinical aspect.

No escape of fluids was observed and speech was restored satisfactorily ensure a longer period of time until the need for a replacement or relining of the prosthesis. Also, with these protective measures, telephone calls, and, mainly, video calls are considered reliable strategies for patients' guidance and functional assessments [11] . When consultation is unavoidable, breaks in appointments are allowed for proper time of environment disinfection between patients. Of importance is the education of the patient to arrive at the scheduled time, minimizing long waiting. Whenever possible, the patient's family member or carer should not enter the dental office.The COVID-19 pandemic presented time-sensitive challenges and urgent issues that require developing new and rapid solutions as alternatives to routine standard evidence-based protocols which require substantial time and interactions At least 7 days before surgery/dental clinic 1 day before surgery/surgical admission at the hospital Installation of surgical obturator prosthesis During the surgery/operative room During the surgery/operative room New impression and installation of interim obturator prosthesis 7 days after the surgery/dental clinic 3 days after the surgery or at the day of hospital discharge/surgical admission at the hospital First control consultation of interim obturator prosthesis 14 days after the surgery/dental clinic 10 days after the surgery/video or telephone calls Second control consultation of interim obturator prosthesis 21 days after the surgery/dental clinic 23 days after the surgery/dental clinic Fig. 2 Traditional versus COVID-19 workflow for obturator prostheses. Note the differences in the sequence for fabricating obturator prostheses between both scenarios. In the COVID-19 pandemic, a symbiosis between phases 1 and 2 of the traditional prosthetic treatment for patients subjected to maxillectomies is suggested whereas the impression will be conducted when the patient is admitted to the hospital for surgery preparation, and prosthesis will be installed at surgical procedure without packing, and it will be relined before patient's discharge. Such workflow will provide a short hospitalization period and delay the return of the patient to dental ambulatory because the bulb part of the obturator prosthesis may improve the restoration of oral functioning (speech and swallowing, for example) for a prolonged period. Besides, this strategy may turn available hospital rooms, reduce PPE intake and the demand for health professionals similar to other rehabilitation approaches [8] . The present figure also illustrates the hospitalization burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which tertiary hospitals had to implement new strategies of care in order to reduce the PPE intake and hospital resources, support the high demand for IUC beds, and also to prevent COVID-19 dissemination and infection of patients and health professionals [8, 9] . Observe that the proposed workflow for obturator prostheses is not inserted in the well-known situations for COVID-19 contagion (Δ) and screening moments, reducing the risk of health professional infection between provider and patient. Therefore, the dissemination of this information to health care professionals worldwide can help prevent COVID-19 dissemination. Dentists can be exposed to all common routes for COVID-19 infection on a single dental appointment (aerosols and droplets, contact with materials, dental sharp instruments, or contaminated surfaces) [2] , even when a procedure is finished, due to the long period that pathogenic microorganisms remain suspended in the air [12, 13] . Facing a pandemic scenario, maxillofacial rehabilitation specialists involved in supportive care in cancer must adapt dental practice to allow for continuation of care of patients infected with COVID-19 who require prosthodontic appliances. Alternative and improved protocols such as the one described above could help patients with complex cases to quickly return to normal function, without the need to delay surgery of complex cancer cases. By strategically altering the prosthodontic rehabilitation protocol, patients can receive necessary cancer care and avoid the need to go through long hospitalization, frequent follow-up visits for obturator adjustments, and still maintain adequate oral function and trauma control [14] . As an integral part of the described protocol, proper COVID-19 professional protective equipment (PPE) use (disposable working cap, isolation gown, goggles or face shield, disposable N95 mask, and disposable gloves, among others) is a must. Hand-washing techniques (water and soap or ≈ 70% alcohol gel) must be consistent with World Health Organization protocols designed for health care workers [2] .To facilitate the visualization of the protocol described in the commentary, we present a workflow suggestion based on our experience developed in three different cancer care Fig. 3 Scheme summarizing all information presented herein to deliver obturators for patients with maxillectomy defects for three main situations: (1) before surgical procedure (phase 1 of the prosthetic treatment), (2) when dentists are requested after the surgical removal of the tumor and/or after hospital discharge (phase 2). *The door of the hospital room should be closed with low pressure inside in cases of COVID-19 suspicion or confirmation. If a low-pressure hospital room is not possible, one way to provide airflow should be provided (the door or window should be opened), minding to not put other individuals in risk of infection. Otherwise, the procedure should be performed in a better moment. **If possible, the patient's family member or carer should not enter the hospital room. ***Patients with advanced tumor stages may be subjected to neck dissection with protective tracheostomy in complementation to solid tumor removal. They often develop cough and a considerable quantity of secretive content, which can be a significant infection route. Therefore, their tracheal cannula should be covered with a disposable surgical mask. Professionals should sanitize their hands with water and soap or alcohol gel (1) before patient examination, (2) before dental procedures, (3) after touching the patient, (4) after touching equipment without disinfection, and (5) after touching the oral mucosa or body fluids [14] . reference centers covering from public to private facilities in São Paulo, Brazil (Fig. 3) .Data availability Not applicable.Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Code availability Not applicable.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-28,8

On March 11, 2020 , the world health organization (WHO) officially declares this disease as a pandemic, with an exponential increase in the number of cases, with social and economic implications 2, 3 . Clinical predictors of mortality have been described in patients with underlying cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypothyroidism 4, 5 . There is a growing interest in the study of clinical factors of severity and predictors of mortality that guide us to which patient special attention should be paid and thus optimize to the maximum the health systems of these patients at risk, however, the history of brain disease vascular is poorly studied 6 A search for randomized clinical trials is performed in the following databases: PUBMED The search strategy was as below:(""Stroke"" OR ""cerebral ischemia"" OR ""ischemic stroke"" OR ""'cerebrovascular disease') AND ("" SARS-COV2 infection ""OR"" coronavirus ""OR"" COVID19 ""OR"" novel coronavirus "") AND ("" mortality ""OR"" dead"") NOT (""aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage"" OR ""Arteriovenous malformation bleeding"" OR"" traumatic brain injury ""OR"" traumatic ischemia "")After applying the search strategy in databases and removing duplicates and extracting full text of potentially eligible studies, it is carried out independently, the studies included in the meta-analysis are chosen, disagreements were resolved by consensus. Case series, prospective and retrospective observational studies evaluating mortality from COVID19including patients with a clinical history of cerebrovascular disease were included.The outline followed was according to the recommendations of meta-analysis and systematic reviews of the PRISMA statement, for the presentation of systematic reviews, meta-analyzes, and the Cochrane manual of systematic reviews and meta-analyzes. The quality of the included studies was assessed through the Newcasttle Ottawa Scale (NOS), according to their score in low quality (less than 4 points), Moderate-High (5 points), High (6 and 7 points). 8 The risk of bias assessment was performed using the ROBINS-I scale that evaluates the risk of bias in ""Low risk"", ""Moderate risk"", ""High risk"", ""Critical risk"". in the domains ""selection"", ""intervention"", ""missing data"", ""confusion"", ""measurement of results"", ""report"" and an overall evaluation expressed in ""global risk of bias"". 9The following data were extracted: COVID 19 patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease and mortality. Authors were contacted for missing data. Statistical analysis was performed using relative risk using the Mantel-Haenszel methodology for dichotomous variables with a randomized effect analysis model calculated using Review Manager 5.3software. Heterogeneity was assessed by calculating I 2 , with high heterogeneity of the studies included in the analysis being above 60%.The selection process of the studies was based on the PRISMA foundations as shown in Figure 1 . After carrying out the systematic search for information following our strategy, 213 bibliographic citations were identified, of which 30 were considered potentially eligible based on title or abstract, or both, and the full texts were obtained. After a full-text review, 20 studies were deemed eligible, 13 were not included as these were not meeting inclusion criteria ( Figure-1) , and a total seven articles met the inclusion criteria for the review. Table   1 summarizes the characteristics of the included studies. (Supplementary material) The quality of included studies was assessed and it was found that three of the included studies obtained a score of five, considering that 42.28% of the included studies were of moderate quality, three studies (42.28%) were of moderate high quality obtaining a score of 6/7 and the one study obtained a score of 7/7, considering it the only included study of high quality (see Table 2 ). The risk of bias was evaluated for the different studies chosen using the ROBINS- however, mortality didn´t show a significant result. 17 In this review, the search strategy and the inclusion criteria were ""COVID19"" AND ""Stroke"" connectors, however the outcomes were not included. We did not include certain type of studies such as series of cases in our analysis to try to avoid bias in the quality of the design. 18 As limitations we found the small number of patients with a history of CVD, mainly in studies carried out in Wuhan, China. The type of included studies is a persistent limitation because they are all retrospective observational, therefore no clinical conclusions or factors can be drawn to establish this as a risk factor, lack of follow-up more than 30 days, evaluation of characteristics were not evaluated fundamental as is the cognitive and functional prognosis, however, due to the world situation given by this virus, there is a limitation of health J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f resources, which include human talent, so establishing possible risk factors is important in the situation of Pandemic, since, it helps to optimize health resources. These findings could provide a basis for future risk scales in the care of patients with COVID19 in intensive care units or emergency services.We considered that there is an important participation of the hemostatic system and disseminated intravascular coagulation that is present in sepsis and in patients affected by COVID19. Coronavirus produces endothelial damage, leading to an increase in mortality in patients with previous endothelial damage, which includes diabetics, cardiac patients, and with a history of cerebrovascular disease . 19.20The history of cerebrovascular disease is associated with a 2.78-fold increased risk of mortality compared to patients with other comorbidities or without underlying pathologies.However, prospective studies are needed, confirming cerebrovascular disease as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality.This systematic review gives an overview of the available literature on the role history stroke in the risk of mortality in COVID19 patients. This study only provides evidence 3b.Our study has some limitations. Most studies focused largely on an experimental level. All articles included in this review are peer-reviewed. There is a possibility of publication bias. ",Colombia,first author,2020-08-25,8
f81d18a6f44893dfcfcd98ab9897f0f5d577a6ed,Children's Anxiety and Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Study Using the Children's Anxiety Questionnaire and the Numerical Rating Scale,"Coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses. A novel form of the coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2-causes COVID-19, which was first reported in China, and has caused a global pandemic [1] . The spread of COVID-19 infection requires continually improving knowledge about its epidemiology [2] . In Brazil, SARS-CoV-2 has greatly influenced children nationwide; events such as school closures have affected daily life [1] . However, groups have expressed the importance of maintaining the educational opportunities of children, despite the COVID-19Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 5757 2 of 13 pandemic [3] . It is important that children have access to peers to maintain social and cognitive development. Additionally, the lack of access to such services can be particularly harmful for vulnerable children and/or families; notably, there has been an increase in physical, emotional, and sexual violence against children reported during the COVID-19 pandemic [4] .The COVID-19 symptoms in children are milder than in adults; children have a better prognosis, and deaths are extremely rare [5] . A systematic review reported that children with COVID-19 often recovered within 1-2 weeks after disease onset. At that time, no cases of death from COVID-19 had been reported in the age range of 0 to 9 years, and only one death in the age range of 10 to 19 years [2] . Although most children appear to experience less severe physical illness and have much lower mortality rates than other age groups from COVID-19 infection, they remain at substantial risk for negative outcomes given the widespread economic and societal disruption resulting from the pandemic [6] . The consequences of COVID-19 on children are vast in terms of their health, safety, and well-being [7] .The influence of changes in the daily lives of children should not be underestimated. Other family members' health and emotional states will affect children, and negative influences from the environment could greatly impact their health. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to isolation and restrictions, which are significantly disrupting for children; they are not well understood, and have been shown to be both confusing and frightening [7] .Studies have consistently concluded that quarantine was an important public health measure to reduce the number of people infected and the number of deaths [8] . However, the social distancing that has been imposed on children has caused massive upheaval [7] . Children have received home schooling under the guidance of their parents or carers, whose attention was divided among taking care of the children, the home, and the home office.Most publications about people´s anxiety levels in conjunction with COVID-19 have focussed on adults; attention should also be paid to children's situations. An increase in the prevalence of depression, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorders, and feelings of anger and frustration was observed in a population from the city of Wuhan, China [9] . A population-based study in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that 14% had anxiety [10] . The majority of the respondents in a Chinese study during COVID-19 were women, and 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety [11] . Children´s development has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic; their health is influenced by their experiences, as well as that of the adults around them [12] . The World Health Organisation has presented recommendations for facing the psychological and mental consequences of the pandemic, which is essential for children. They must also have opportunities to express their fears and doubts in their own ways. It was therefore important to measure the experiences of children at the height of the pandemic of the century.It was necessary to listen to how children described their experiences, anxiety levels, and perspectives during the COVID-19 pandemic [13] .The present study highlights children´s perspectives by using a questionnaire adapted for children. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety among Brazilian schoolchildren and study the anxiety factors associated with social distancing during the global COVID-19 pandemic.A cross-sectional study using non-probability and convenience sampling methods was conducted between 25 April and 25 May 2020 in Brazil. We used an online survey to collect information (https://forms.gle/qhkt4hxqBUntZ4pc6).The study sample consisted of Brazilian children between 6 and 12 years of age and their guardians, all of whom were social distancing. Guardians under 18 years of age were excluded from this study.The Children´s Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ, scores range from 4 to 12) and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS, scores range 0 to 10) were used to measure anxiety in the children. The authors of the CAQ, a Swedish instrument, aimed to develop a questionnaire that would be easy to administer, had solid psychometric measures, and could be used to assess self-reported anxiety in young children [14, 15] . It is based on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [16] . The CAQ contains four items with four images of facial expressions, with three response options, each representative of a different level of emotional intensity [14, 15] . The children give their responses based on the four facial expressions, one at a time, and then choose between three steps (i.e., a little (1), some (2) , and a lot (3)). The faces of Happy/Content and Calm/Relaxed are measured as 3-2-1, and the faces of Tense/Nervous and Worried/Afraid are measured as 1-2-3. The range for this instrument is 4 to 12 points, with 4 points signifying no anxiety and 12 points signifying the highest level of anxiety. Recently, the CAQ in Brazilian Portuguese was validated, as demonstrated by satisfactory results among professionals and children; however, these data are unpublished. The CAQ has previously shown construct validity in conjunction with out-patient surgery [14, 17] .The NRS is an 11-point scale that is scored from 0 to 10. In the past few decades, the NRS has been validated for the evaluation of pain intensity in children [18] and assessing unpleasantness. However, there are no agreed upon NRS anchors for measuring unpleasantness in children [19] . In this study, anxiety was assessed using the NRS, wherein 0 was equivalent to 'calm', and 10 meant 'very anxious'. Mild anxiety is expressed with scores of 1, and 2; moderate anxiety: 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; and intense anxiety 8, 9, and 10 [20] . The NRS is easy to administer, and there is good evidence for its construct validity [19] . Similar forms of self-reports have previously been validated for use in school-aged children who have undergone care in hospitals [21, 22] .An online survey using the Google Forms platform was distributed by three researchers through social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and personal contacts (WhatsApp) that expanded through snowballing. A brief written description of the study and its objectives was sent to guardians. We instructed the guardians and children about how to participate and guided the guardians on how to fill in their data and conduct the interview with their children.The online survey evaluated the sociodemographic profiles and current conditions regarding the social distancing and isolation of the children and their guardians. The guardians used the CAQ and the NRS following the survey instructions; the survey had a total of 25 questions.The quantitative variables measured for children were: gender; age; if they were on vacation; if they were home schooling; social distancing with the father, mother, both, or others; if the parents had an essential job; if they had a chronic disease or disability; how many people were in the same house; suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in the house; for how long the children had been social distancing; and the size of their home. The quantitative variables for guardians were: relationship with the children (mother, father, and others), schooling (elementary school, high school, college, or postgraduate degree); income reduced during the pandemic (yes or no); and guardians were asked about how much they thought their children understood the pandemic (a lot, some, a little, or nothing).To test the normal distribution of the data, the Shapiro-Wilk test was used. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney-U test for unpaired data that were not normally distributed. For multiple-group comparisons, the Kruskal-Wallis tests, followed by Dunn's tests, were performed. The scores were handled as ordinal data, and thus, the Spearman´s rho correlation coefficients were calculated between the CAQ and NRS scores. The chi-square test, as a two-tailed test (n > 30), and Fisher´s exact test were employed to compare proportions in the different groups. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated to test the association between the outcome variables, such as the dependent variable (NRS or CAQ), as binary categories defined (</>): for the CAQ, a score higher/lower than the mean value plus a standard deviation, the cut-off value was set at the level [low < 9 or high ≥ 9]); scores of 9 and higher than 9 indicated intense anxiety. For the NRS, the cut-off value was set at the level [low ≤ 7 or high > 7]; thus, scores of 8 or higher indicated intense anxiety.A logistic regression was performed to test associations between the dependent variable (i.e., high (≥9) or low anxiety scores of the CAQ and (>7) NRS, respectively) and the independent variables. For all tests, the level of statistical significance was set at 5%. For the statistical analyses, we used IBM SPSS Statistics for MacBook, version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA).This research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Brazil (CAAE: 30547320.0.0000.0008 and Opinion N • 4.128.847) and complied with resolution No. 510/2016, which establishes the guidelines and regulatory rules for research involving humans. The guardians and children agreed to participate in the research through an electronic record/register.Of the 289 children and their guardians who were included in this study, 54.3% (n = 157) were girls, and 45.7% (n = 132) were boys, with a median age of 9 years (interquartile range = 4). Most of them (45.7%, n = 132) were social distancing with both parents; 27% (n = 77) were with their mothers; 8% (n = 24) were with their fathers, and 19% (n = 56) were with someone else. Few children had a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (1.7%, n = 5 and 5.9%, n = 17, respectively). Over half of the children were on vacation (53%, n = 153), and 90% (n = 261) of the children were being home schooled; they did not attend physically. Nearly sixty percent (58%, n = 168) of the guardians reported that their children understood the actual pandemic situation relatively well.Among the guardians, 257 (88.9%) were mothers, 11 (4%) were fathers, and 20 (7%) had another type of relationship with the children. They had a mean age of 38.97 (±6.54) years. Of the guardians, 46.4% (n = 134) had completed postgraduate studies, 31.1% (n = 90) had graduated from university, 16.3% (n = 47) had finished high school, and 6.2% (n = 18) had completed elementary school. On average, roughly four people (±1.38) were living at home, the house size was 212.02 m 2 (±SD 402.85), and the hours spent social distancing was 22/day (±7.71). Over half (53%, n = 153) said their normal income had decreased, and 18% (n = 51) replied that the mother or father had maintained an essential job.According to the descriptive analyses, the girls scored higher on CAQ than the boys did (p = 0.047, median test); however, these differences were not found for the NRS (p = 0.929). Children who were maintaining social distance with both their parents had lower scores on the CAQ than those who were isolated with a person other than their parents (p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in the scores of CAQ or NRS in terms of whether the child was on vacation, was being home schooled, or had an immediate connection to someone with a COVID-19 diagnosis, the level of the child's comprehension, or a decrease in household income.There were no statistical differences between the prevalence of anxiety, for CAQ (p = 0.879), or for NRS by the age of the children (p = 0.408) ( Table 1) . Table 2 shows the prevalence of anxiety according to both scales by the associated variables. According to CAQ (CAQ ≥ 9), the prevalence of anxiety was 19.4% (n = 56). For girls, the prevalence was 21% (n = 33) and, for boys, 17.4% (n= 23), without statistical difference. The prevalence of anxiety according to NRS (NRS > 7) was 21.8% (n = 63), and there were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence between the girls 22.3% (n = 35) and boys 21.2% (n = 28) ( Table 2 ). According to the CAQ scores, the prevalence of anxiety was higher among the children with parents with essential jobs, 31.4% (n = 16) vs. 16 .8% (n = 40), and when keeping social distance without parents (35.7%, n = 20). This was followed by social distancing only with the mother (20.8%, n = 16). Lower scores were found among children who were staying only with their fathers or with both guardians. There were no statistically significant differences for NRS and the studied variables, but the prevalence of anxiety was highest among the children who maintained social distance with someone other than the parents (28.6%, n = 16).Regarding the age of the guardians (Figure 1) , there was an inverse association between the age of the caregiver and the children's scores on the CAQ (p = 0.002). This association did not reach statistical significance for the NRS scores (p = 0.078). Furthermore, the correlation between the CAQ and NRS scores was weak but significant (r = 0.461; p < 0.001).the prevalence of anxiety was highest among the children who maintained social distance with someone other than the parents (28.6%, n = 16).Regarding the age of the guardians (Figure 1) , there was an inverse association between the age of the caregiver and the children's scores on the CAQ (p = 0.002). This association did not reach statistical significance for the NRS scores (p = 0.078). Furthermore, the correlation between the CAQ and NRS scores was weak but significant (r = 0.461; p < 0.001). As shown in Table 3 , children with guardians who had a higher educational level exhibited more comprehension of the pandemic than did children whose guardians received less education. Among the six children with no comprehension of the situation, three were cared for by guardians with the lowest level of education. Figure 2 shows the respective CAQ and NRS scores of the children and their perceived comprehension of the pandemic categorised as a lot, some, a little, and nothing. There was no association between the children's perceived comprehension of the situation and their scores on CAQ (p = 0.416) or NRS (p = 0.283). The children who understood the pandemic situation did not exhibit more anxiety than those who did not understand it at all (Figure 2 ). As shown in Table 3 , children with guardians who had a higher educational level exhibited more comprehension of the pandemic than did children whose guardians received less education. Among the six children with no comprehension of the situation, three were cared for by guardians with the lowest level of education. We found that age distribution differed between the education level groups (p = 0.002). Post hoc analysis showed that the difference was between high school and postgraduate; postgraduates were older than those who had only finished high school (p = 0.001). Table 3 shows the association between CAQ scores and the independent variables included in the study. Higher levels of anxiety (CAQ ≥ 9) were associated with social distancing, the number of persons at home, guardians' age, and education level of the guardians. Children keeping social distance without their parents had higher levels of anxiety than children with both parents at home (p = 0.029). The greater the number of persons at home, the greater the anxiety score (p = 0.024). Regarding the guardians' education level, children whose guardians had a postgraduate (p = 0.019) or university education level (p = 0.024) had lower anxiety scores on the CAQ than those whose guardians had only elementary school (reference category). In line with the descriptive analyses, a positive statistical significance was found for the interaction between the guardians' age and education level (p = 0.022). Children whose guardians were among the youngest and with the lowest levels of education among the participants had higher CAQ scores than children whose guardians were older and more educated (for postgraduate B = 0.996, for university graduate B = 0.995, p < 0.05; Table 4 ). We found that age distribution differed between the education level groups (p = 0.002). Post hoc analysis showed that the difference was between high school and postgraduate; postgraduates were older than those who had only finished high school (p = 0.001). Table 3 shows the association between CAQ scores and the independent variables included in the study. Higher levels of anxiety (CAQ ≥ 9) were associated with social distancing, the number of persons at home, guardians' age, and education level of the guardians. Children keeping social distance without their parents had higher levels of anxiety than children with both parents at home (p = 0.029). The greater the number of persons at home, the greater the anxiety score (p = 0.024). Regarding the guardians' education level, children whose guardians had a postgraduate (p = 0.019) or university education level (p = 0.024) had lower anxiety scores on the CAQ than those whose guardians had only elementary school (reference category). In line with the descriptive analyses, a positive statistical significance was found for the interaction between the guardians' age and education level (p = 0.022). Children whose guardians were among the youngest and with the lowest levels of education among the participants had higher CAQ scores than children whose guardians were older and more educated (for postgraduate B = 0.996, for university graduate B = 0.995, p < 0.05; Table 4 ). Table 5 shows the results of the binary logistic regression for NRS and the independent variables included in the study. No association was found between the NRS scores and the studied variables. Independent of the selected cut-off value of NRS > 6, > 7, or ≥ 9, there was no association between the NRS scores and the covariates, or when using logistic regression or multinomial regression analyses. Multinomial regression analysis revealed that when the dependent variable was set as a group of anxiety (mild, moderate, and intense), unlike the CAQ score, none of the variables was guardians for the anxiety reported with the NRS scores, except for confirmed COVID-19 cases at home, which was guardians for a difference between mild and moderate anxiety (data not shown).The present study assessed children's anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to assist healthcare professionals in understanding children´s reports of anxiety. Comprehending children's emotions was quite challenging, because the situations they experienced may not have characteristics in common with any previous event in their lives. Thus, giving them a voice was an essential strategy.In the present study, the prevalence of anxiety among children was between 19.4% (n = 56), using the CAQ, and 21.8% (n = 63), using the NRS. Compared to previous research, this study found a high prevalence of anxiety. The worldwide prevalence of any anxiety disorder among children according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) was shown to be 6.5% [23] . In Brazilian preadolescents (aged 11-12 years), the prevalence of anxiety was 6.2% according to the ICD-10 classification [24] . In the United States, a study that analysed data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), reported that the prevalence of anxiety was 7.1% among children aged 3-17 years (6.6% in children aged 6-11 years and 10.5% in children aged 12-17) [25] . However, the criteria for DSM and ICD were not used in our study.Previous research suggested an association between seropositivity for coronaviruses and a history of mood disorders [26] . It is also thought that the severity of a stress reaction is related to the degree of exposure to a disaster. For example, earthquakes that damaged houses and family members were associated with more severe fear, anxiety, depression, or physical symptoms. Young schoolchildren and girls were especially vulnerable [27] . Another study demonstrated that these anxiety symptoms were more often associated with girls [28] . In our study, greater levels of anxiety were also exhibited by girls than boys.Our data collection was based on children's self-reports of anxiety. It is important to use validated instruments that can gauge what they are intended to measure. The CAQ is a newly developed instrument that needs further validation. For example, the appropriate cut-off score has not been confirmed. However, the CAQ has been used in a couple of studies [14, 17] .As for the children's characterisation, the mean age group was approximately 8.8 years, with a slight increase in girls. Among their guardians, most had university and postgraduate levels of education. According to the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), the level of education of the Brazilian population over 25 years old was distributed as follows: 6.4% had no schooling, 40.2% had incomplete or complete elementary school, 31.9% had incomplete or complete high school, 4.0% were incomplete graduate, and 17.4% were complete graduate [29] . The possibility of selection bias should be considered because of the exclusion of digital illiterates who were not involved in this study. This has been reported previously [30] . However, the use of digital environments for data collection was the most suitable for the current pandemic, and internet research was safer and more convenient for participants.The present study shows that guardians´education levels affect their children's perceived comprehension of the situation but not their anxiety levels. However, the guardians´age in combination with their education level directly affect their children's anxiety level. Guardians with higher education could probably offer more support to their children in several ways. They could invite their children to speak about COVID-19, could listen with the aim of understanding what their children knew, and explain misunderstandings. These parents may be providing further information about the prevention of virus contagion. They could be creating a safe environment where emotions can be freely expressed so that they can pay attention to their children's anxiety levels and filling evenings/after-dinner time with pleasant activities [31] . The lowest education level in parents corresponds to the highest prevalence of obese school children (aged 8 to 9 years) [32] , and an association has been found between parental education and parent-reported child mental health (for children aged 4 to 11 years old) [33] .Children have the right to understand what is happening around them as it can affect them. COVID-19 is a global threat, which children can hear about even as it affects them and their loved ones. The rights of children [34] continue to matter even during COVID-19, including the articles of the child convention in terms of development, democratic rights education, protection, right to one's own family, and right to support. Children's perceived comprehension can be a positive aspect during the pandemic. According to UNICEF, children might find it difficult to understand what they are seeing online or on TV, and they are vulnerable to anxiety, stress, and sadness. The guideline 'How to talk to your child about COVID-19 recommends that parents ask their children open questions and that they listen to the answers. Other recommendations include that parents be honest and use age-appropriate language, watch their children's reactions, show sensitivity to their anxiety levels, and close conversations with care [35] .Play is an essential part of children's physical and social development; however, during isolation and social distancing, the world is relying on technology to learn, live, and stay connected [36] . The most important thing for children is to have adults around them to meet their needs and to help them feel secure, calm, and supported in their own sense of control [37] . Children feel better when they can communicate their feelings in a supportive environment. Adults need to be authentic about the uncertainty and psychological challenges of the pandemic, without overwhelming children with their own fears. This honesty should encompass a coherent explanation for what the children are observing and grant permission for children to safely talk about their feelings [38] .The majority of the guardians in this study were older (mean age: 38.97 years); however, we found that the younger the guardians were, the higher the anxiety levels exhibited by the children. It may be a question of the resilience of the guardians; perhaps, it was a question of the stability of their professions and finances when exhibiting worries to the child. Another factor to consider was that young guardians in this socioeconomic group had fewer children; it was possible that these children did not have other children to play together with. Neither possibility was investigated in this study. These findings were in line with previous studies of how the age of parents, especially the mother, affect the mental health of children, among other health conditions and outcomes. Remmerswaal and Muris [39] found during the previous swine flu that children aged 7-12 years had a significant relationship between their level of fear and their parents' level of fear. In another study, children whose mothers had a high level of education, compared to children with uneducated mothers, showed a reduced risk of suffering from emotional difficulties [40] . Similar results have also been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic; a correlation was found between mothers' state of anxiety scores and the trait anxiety scores of their children (ages 9 to 12 years old) [41] .Children who were keeping social distance with both their mother and father had lower CAQ scores than those who were isolated with a person other than their parents. This finding confirmed the important role of parents in children's lives, perhaps especially in this pandemic. A study conducted in China reported the presence of psychological difficulties in children during the COVID-19 pandemic, with fear, clinging, inattention, and irritability as the most severe symptoms for younger children [42] . Parents and other family members are encouraged to increase their communication with children to address their fears and concerns, play games, engage in physical activity, and use music therapy in the form of singing to reduce the worry, fear, and stress that children may feel [43] . Another interesting result in the present study showed the opposite: parents who kept their jobs had children who experienced more anxiety. This result highlights children´s insecurity when their parents are not with them during the crisis. The serious implications of this finding and experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for effective strategies to strengthen families and help them protect the children [44] . Parents' presence is important for children, and children need to feel safe within their families. If children lack emotion-focused conversations with their parents, it can lead to anxiety about the emotional state of their parents [32] .The significance of the correlations between children´s anxiety levels and other factors was only shown in CAQ scores, not in the NRS scores. The CAQ considers different feelings/domains in measuring a child's anxiety than the NRS. The focus of the CAQ on anxiety-compared to the NRS, which only has one item on anxiety-may explain this difference; however, further studies are needed to investigate the causes of this difference. However, the prevalence of anxiety found in this group was similar between the CAQ and NRS. Minimising children's anxiety may depend on addressing children's restriction from engaging in their regular activities.Other aspects of the pandemic will appear with time. Intensive research to find a vaccination will provide new research questions among children. The experience of benefits and risks with vaccination, and accessibility to vaccination will prompt repeating this study on children´s reported anxiety.This study had several limitations. First, the data collection occurred online; this excluded participants without the computer skills necessary to access the survey, and probably there was a selection bias arising from the social media interpersonal connections through which the survey was circulated. Second, we guided participants on how to use the CAQ and NRS with their children, but we are unsure if they filled in the instruments according to our recommendations. Third, we did not investigate how many children were in the same house; we did not exclude guardians who participated twice, since they had two children. Finally, the questionnaire did not capture how well the children actually comprehended the situation, but the adults' opinion on this. There was no objective measurement of the children's understanding; the adult respondents were asked their subjective opinion of the extent to which the children understood the pandemic, taking age into consideration. Therefore, caution should be taken in generalising the results to the Brazilian population.The prevalence of anxiety among the children during the COVID-19 pandemic in this group was 19.4% (n = 56), according to the CAQ, and 21.8% (n = 63), according to the NRS. These results are higher than the prevalence reported for children under normal conditions (6.5%). Higher levels of anxiety were associated with social distancing without parents, a higher number of persons living at home, and a low education level reported for the parent or guardian. The highest levels of anxiety were found among children with both young and less educated guardians. These findings suggest the necessity of implementing public health actions targeting these parents and their children at the population level.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-09,8
eaebf9b6138b50bfb3cb3dd33fe8559fd1f7adc9,Telerehabilitation for people with breast cancer through the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile,"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID- 19) was declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March [1] , and to date (June 2020) there are around 9.5 million confirmed cases in the world [2] . As of June 2020, this disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been responsible for around 480,000 global deaths [2] .In Chile, the first reported case of COVID-19 was on 3 March, 2020. By 25 June, there were more than 250,000 confirmed cases [3] . The virus has so far been concentrated in the metropolitan area, accounting for more than 80% of confirmed cases [3] . Full lockdown of the metropolitan area was implemented on 15 May and was in force until June 26, with the possibility of a further 7 days of extension.The pandemic has required a change in the day-to-day functioning of healthcare systems, both in Chile and throughout the world. The number of face-to-face outpatient appointments has been reduced due to the growing spread of the virus, which affects people with chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer, among others. In the case of people with cancer, medical and rehabilitative care has been changed, from suspending their treatment to changes in care protocols [4, 5] .The aim of this article is to describe a model of physical therapy using telerehabilitation for people with breast cancer (BC) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile.It has been mentioned that people with cancer are at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, it seems that the risk of infection and complications associated with the virus apply only to immunosuppressed persons-this means those undergoing active treatment or people with certain types of tumours (haematologic and lung cancers). Moreover, emerging research indicates that hypertension and diabetes are conditions that increase the risk of infections and complications [7] .Telehealth, telemedicine and telerehabilitation are not new concepts. There are reports which indicate that telerehabilitation may have begun in the 1950s [8] , with the popularity of telehealth as it is known today beginning to grow in the 1970s [9] . In this paper, we will use the concepts outlined in the practical guide to telerehabilitation by the Chilean Physical Therapy Board (Colegio de Kinesiólogos de Chile) [10] . In other words, telehealth as a global concept, telemedicine as a medical occupation and telerehabilitation as being within the remit of a physical therapist. The different models of telehealth can be found in Table 1 .The research on models of telerehabilitation for people with BC is scarce. In general, the available evidence is positive regarding early detection of lymphedema, improving the quality of life, reducing pain and fatigue and improving muscular strength in survivors of BC [11, 12] . It also increases adherence, motivation and appears to be a cost-effective intervention [13, 14] . Recent reports outline that the current health crisis presents an opportunity to progress towards telerehabilitation [11] [12] [13] . Consultation between the professional and the patient carried out in real time. Consultation carried out from afar, but at the same time.The consultation is not carried out in real time, that is to say, the professional and the patient do not meet at the same time.Combination of synchronous and asynchronous consultations.Teleconsultation Classic consultation between the professional and patient. Teleconsultation has the feature of being carried out from afar utilising available technology.Referral between different types of professional via an electronic system, subsequently the patient receives a teleconsultation from another specialist.Monitoring the patient through a device. In this type of care information is transmitted direct to the professional.The Complejo Asistencial Dr Sótero del Rio is the public referral hospital for the entire southeast side of the metropolitan area. It primarily accommodates the population in the lower 50% by socioeconomic classification (the population with the lowest income and highest vulnerability). It benefits from a Breast Pathology Unit, where every patient over the age of 18 and diagnosed with breast cancer receives breast and axillary surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone and biological therapy [15] [16] [17] . All medical treatment, including physical therapy, is free for patients, as it appears on the list of specific allowances in the Explicit Health Guarantees for breast cancer [18] .Since 2015, we implemented an early and prospective physical therapy model. This model focuses on decreasing the side effects of breast cancer surgery, which can include lymphedema, axillary web syndrome, limited movement in the upper limbs and reduced muscle strength [17] . However, given the health risk, face-to-face out-patient appointments have been restricted, and telerehabilitation has been adopted.The model of telerehabilitation for people with breast cancer in the Complejo Asistencial Dr Sótero del Río has been in place since April 2020, as a hybrid-or mixed-model type (Table 1 ) and, as with face-to-face sessions, is free of charge for the patients. To join the telerehabilitation program, an initial assessment is required, as shown in Figure 1 . Medical emergencies, exacerbation or functional disorders are evaluated, and the arrangements for future remote consultations (therapist -patient agreement) are established. This first meeting is carried out by telephone and lasts approximately 20 minutes. Following the patient's agreement to future checks and receipt of their verbal consent, the next steps are determined according to individual needs ( Figure 2 ). This may be a phone call, an individual video call via a mobile device (computer or smartphone), or a group video call, depending on the availability and convenience of the individual's devices. Follow-up checks last on average 50 minutes. The frequency of these checks will depend on the risk posed by visiting the health centre (Table 2 ). People who have undergone axillary dissection surgery or who have a limited range of movement in their upper limbs (resulting from axillary web syndrome or otherwise) should attend a face-to-face check in addition to asynchronous education, whereby a functional mobility assessment tool is used on the patient's shoulder and their physical therapy treatment is started. This will then be supervised remotely every 15 days.All checks are carried out synchronously with the patient, though information is submitted via a web page without the therapists' direct supervision (link: www.oncoactivate.cl). This information is communicated asynchronously during the program [19] . The transition from the face-to-face model to telerehabilitation has been progressive and in line with the increasing number of infections in the country.People recommended for breast cancer surgery are referred for physical therapy, with teleconsultation from the Breast Pathology Unit. A synchronous consultation is scheduled with the patient for pre-operative assessment and education. During the assessment, functional mobility of the patient's shoulder is observed and recommendations regarding physical functionality will be given for the pre-and postoperative period. The patient is given a therapeutic exercise plan with particular emphasis on the upper limbs and receives counselling on the benefits of physical activity and general self-care.People on the lymphedema prevention program are monitored remotely every 3 months. On the initial evaluation, a verbal questionnaire is conducted regarding signs and symptoms associated with secondary alterations to the medical treatment, with particular emphasis on screening for lymphedema (heavy feeling in the arm ipsilateral to the surgery, increase in arm volume, skin quality, etc.). They are given, and analyse, a therapeutic exercise plan with particular emphasis on exercises that favour venous and lymphatic return from the upper limbs, and receive counselling on the benefits of physical activity and general self-care. Also, the patient is educated about how to measure the girth of upper limbs to obtain their volumes. Obtaining the volume is carried out by measuring the perimeters of the arm, measured using a tape measure at certain anatomical points. We suggest using the Cleveland Clinic webpage: Breast Cancer -Arm Volume Calculator which advises using six anatomical points [20] . This webpage is free-to-use and, using a mathematical calculation, it gives the difference in volume between the arms. If the person has more than 10% or 200 ml difference in volume between the affected arm and the other arm, the condition lymphedema is considered as present. The patient is recommended to carry out asynchronous self-assessments once a month without the supervision of the therapist and inform them of any changes.People with lymphedema are examined once a month with the aim of keeping their lymphedema stable. The sessions consist of assessing the lymphedema (presence of fibrosis, changes in volume and subjective sensation of symptoms: heaviness, skin colour and consistency, among others), patients are educated and/or supervised on manual lymphatic self-drainage, therapeutic exercise is supervised to promote lymphatic and venous return of the upper limbs. Instruction is given on how to measure the girth of upper limbs to obtain the volumes with the same protocol as in the prevention of lymphedema. Also, advice is given on the correct use of compression treatments and skin care. Likewise, with all follow-up care, advice is given on the promotion of physical activity and general self-care.COVID-19 arrived in Chile in March 2020, nevertheless, our tele-rehabilitation model began to be rolled out widely in April of the same year. The Dr. Sótero del Río Health Care Complex uses a digital platform which permits remote access to the patient's clinical file. If we consider the care delivered since April until 22 June, 226 care events have been recorded of which 63% correspond to tele-rehabilitation. Of this care, 8 instances correspond to pre-operative checks (7 via tele-rehabilitation, that is to say 88%), 26 to follow-up appointments for Axillary Web Syndrome (5 by tele-rehabilitation, 19%) 72 for people with lymphedema (51 by tele-rehabilitation, 71%), 107 for prevention of lymphedema (74 by tele-rehabilitation, 69%) and 13 for other consultation reasons such as painful conditions, assessments etc (5 by tele-rehabilitation, 38%). The demographic characteristics of the 118 people that have received tele-rehabilitation can be found in Table 3 . Regarding the number of instances of care provision for these people, 95 (80%) only received it on 1 occasion, 22 (19%) on 2 instances and 1 person (1%) on 3 instances.The tele-rehabilitation program at the Dr. Sótero del Río Health Care Complex has had a high level of acceptance and satisfaction, both by the patients and the physiotherapists, since during pandemic face-to-face checks involve an infection risk both for the service user and the health professional. Patients value the continuation of their sessions and having therapists willing to help and resolve doubts in case of needing to investigate any change in their condition. We can pick out six variables which present as facilitating factors to implement this model of tele-rehabilitation: 1) Having an electronic medical record system which allows legal record-keeping and to establish concrete rehabilitation objectives. 2) To have a multidisciplinary team which maintains good communication.3) The growth in use of technology in the country (wide internet access and smartphones). 4) Obligatory quarantine, in many cases it enables the company of a family member to assist the patient to manage the technology. 5) Creation of a webpage with facilitates asynchronous contact with the person. 6) High levels of commitment and motivation of therapists/patients to participate in this new model.The barriers to implementing the telerehabilitation model relate to the difficulty in coordinating the synchronous therapist -patient checkups, and the inability to perform a complete physical examination, which for physiotherapists is essential, especially as palpation is prevented, for which they now rely on the patient's perception.Everyone who participated in the telerehabilitation program has done so of their own free will and fully aware of their decision. The benefits of having therapy from their houses and the risks involved in attending face-to-face checks, given the health crisis, were explained to them. There is a moral obligation to protect lives, both one's own and of others, therefore, only in those cases where not assisting in person would involve a greater risk than the risk of infection from COVID-19 were they offered face-to-face therapy, taking every possible protective measure both for the patient and the healthcare staff.Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, many people with chronic conditions have seen their face-to-face health checks changed or suspended to reduce the risk of infection from the virus. However, in many cases, this means a deterioration in the person's condition, which could be reduced by introducing telehealth as a tool in this time of crisis. Specifically, in breast cancer, the early intervention and forwardfacing models of physical therapy have proven to be effective in the reduction of post-operative breast complications, and the experience in a Chilean hospital shows that it is possible to implement this model in the case of telerehabilitation.",Chile,first author,2020-08-05,8
ac5f5d3cf911e4e0277faf15213bc63a6014e86b,Psychosocial factors associated with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. 1 It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency of international concern. 2 3 With more than five million cases and 340 000 deaths confirmed worldwide in mid-May 2020, COVID-19 is likely the worst public health catastrophe in a century, with severe negative sociopolitical and humanitarian repercussions throughout the world. 4 In Colombia, the first confirmed case was identified on 6 March 2020. Despite the daily increase in morbidity and mortality rates, thereWhat is already known about this subject? ► There is an association between anxiety, fear, and stress. ► Anxiety and fear appear early in pandemics. ► Physicians can suffer short-term and longterm psychological consequences during and after pandemics.What are the new findings? ► A high rate of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was found in general practitioners who took care of all types of patients in the current pandemic, even when there was no overload on institutional capacity. ► Social discrimination and work-related stress were associated with a greater presence of symptoms of GAD in general practitioners. ► In general practitioners, feeling protected by the state or employer, being satisfied with their job as a physician, and receiving reliable government information were associated with a lower presence of symptoms of GAD.How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice? ► These results provide necessary statistical information to promote wellness and to prevent psychological distress in healthcare workers during public health crises and pandemics. ► Our findings highlight the importance of early screening and ensure the availability of mental health services for healthcare providers during times of public health emergencies. ► In addition, these results seek to sensitize occupational health entities to the need to implement interventions aimed at combating and reducing the presence of factors associated with increased anxiety.is currently no overflow in the healthcare system's capacity. More than 20 200 cases and 705 deaths were confirmed after 2.5 months of the pandemic, the country being under various degrees of quarantine, including 169 cases and 4 deaths in health professionals. 5 It has been noted that physicians who take care of patients during epidemics or pandemics may be more likely to experience fear, anxiety, stress, or depression. [6] [7] [8] [9] The following factors can contribute to this mental health deterioration: excessive working hours, disadvantageous employment contracts, insufficient personal protective equipment, and exposure to the virus, with risks to their health or those of their families. 2 6 In this regard, studies on health professionals in Latin America are scarce. No psychosocial assessments were identified in Colombian general practitioners in times of epidemics.The objective of this study was to identify the frequency of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and to estimate associations with particular psychosocial and demographic factors.This is a cross-sectional study that is part of the research project Dinámicas Psicosociales en Universitarios (DISEU), which belongs to the Colectivos Universitarios research line. Scientific, technical, and administrative standards for health research, as established in resolution 8430-1993 of the Republic of Colombia, were considered. 10 No compensation was offered for participation. In 2018, it was reported that 65 939 general practitioners were working in Colombia. 11 Using the online Netquest calculator, it was estimated that 385 subjects should be included in the study, with a sample size with heterogeneity of 50%, a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5%.In the first 5 days of April 2020, an open invitation to fill out an online form was sent through WhatsApp, Facebook, and email to general practitioners who worked in Colombia during March of that year. They had to apply their responses to the 24-30 March period, when the country was in a health emergency, in the initial phase of containment, with little community compliance to the government measures and under the strong presence of catastrophic information from Europe and Asia.Once the reception of forms from the electronic platform Google Forms was finished, the database automatically generated in Microsoft Excel was downloaded. The information regarding the subject's email was deleted to preserve anonymity. Forms from subjects who claimed to be general practitioners who treated patients of any sex, age, or type of pathology or health condition were evaluated. They worked in private or public health centers, outpatient or inpatient, of any level of complexity. To leave the form incomplete was determined as the only exclusion criteria.The form consisted of two parts. The first part requested age, gender, city of work, and 25 yes or no questions about fears and perceptions concerning medical work during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second part contained three scales. Initially, in the 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), composed of seven items, total score of 0-21, 10 or more points indicate the presence of symptoms of GAD, specifically moderate and severe symptoms. In the original study, this cut-off point optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%) for the diagnosis of GAD. This tool has good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. 12 13 Next, the questionnaire on psychosomatic problems, also called the Work-related Stress Test, is derived from a wide range of tools that explore burnout syndrome in various work activities. It consists of 12 questions about somatizations, each one with six Likert-type answer options, to assign from 1 to 6 points. The higher the score of each item or a total score of the scale, the worse the evaluation. Work-related stress is established with a score equal to or greater than 25. No studies reporting psychometric evaluations were identified. 14 Finally, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). It consists of seven questions, each one assessed with five Likert-type answer options. For the present report, the three lowest scores were considered as a negative response; the two highest scores were considered as a positive response. Reliability values, such as internal consistency, α Cronbach=0.82 and test-retest reliability, interclass correlation coefficient=0.72, were acceptable. 15When completing the five projected days for the reception of the forms, 548 forms were obtained, of which 17 (3.1%) were incomplete and were excluded. This is a reanalysis of data from the DISEU-arm COVID-19 project, conducted with EPI-INFO 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, 2008). GAD-7 was used to identify the presence of symptoms of GAD. According to the obtained result, the subjects were divided into two groups: with and without symptoms of GAD. Quantitative variables are presented as averages and SD. Qualitative variables are presented in absolute and relative frequencies and 95% CIs. The differences between the quantitative variables were evaluated with U of Mann-Whitney or analysis of variance, the qualitative variables with χ 2 test or Fisher test. Logistic regression was performed to estimate crude OR and 95% CI between symptoms of GAD and gender, fears and perceptions concerning medical work during the COVID-19 pandemic, and symptoms regarding fear of COVID-19. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the total score of GAD-7 and the items and total score of the questionnaire on psychosomatic problems was calculated. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.The study was conducted in 531 subjects, 37.9% above the calculated sample size. Of the general practitioners, 47.9% were over the age of 30 years old and 59.5% were female. Of a total of 209 (39.3%) (95% CI 35.2% to 43.6%) with symptoms of GAD and 322 (60.6%) (95% CI 56.3% to 64.8%) without symptoms of GAD, the group with symptoms of GAD had a lower mean age and included a higher proportion of female gender (table 1) .Subjects with symptoms of GAD most often reported fear of having presented symptoms of COVID-19, fear of taking the virus home, disappointment at work, feeling anguished about going to work the next day and considering quitting their job to protect family members, compared with those without symptoms of GAD (p<0.05). Half of the group with symptoms of GAD and 30% of the group without symptoms of GAD reported experiencing social discrimination for working as a general practitioner (p<0.05) (table 2) .Item scores and total score of the questionnaire on psychosomatic problems were higher in general practitioners with symptoms of GAD (p<0.001). Work-related stress was identified in 64.4% of all the subjects, in 95.2% of the subjects with symptoms of GAD and in 44.5% of those without symptoms of GAD (p<0.01) (table 3) . Subjects with symptoms of GAD had a greater presence of symptoms regarding fear of COVID-19. The most commonly reported symptoms regarding fear of COVID-19 were being afraid of losing life because of COVID-19 by 98% of the subjects with symptoms of GAD and feeling the heart race or palpitate when thinking about getting COVID-19 by 81.3% of the subjects without symptoms of GAD (table 4) .Several psychosocial and demographic factors, especially symptoms regarding fear of COVID-19, as well as female gender, were associated with a greater presence of symptoms of GAD. Feeling protected by the state or employer, being satisfied working as a physician and considering COVID-19 testing capabilities and governmental measures to be sufficient were associated with a lower presence of symptoms of GAD (table 5) . Positive and moderate correlation coefficients were observed between all the items and the total score of the questionnaire on psychosomatic problems with the total score of GAD-7 (table 6) .Anxiety is an adaptive emotional and behavioral response to threatening stimuli and is essential for survival. 12 Symptoms of GAD were found in 4 out of 10 subjects, similar to that reported by Lai et al and higher than that reported by Lu et al in doctors and health professionals, respectively, during the current pandemic. 2 16 In a study using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21, anxiety was found in 39.5% of 152 physicians in India, on the same dates the present study was conducted. 17 Lower frequencies have been reported by other authors, 13.0% in Wuhan and 10.8% in Singapore in physicians and nurses, also in the middle of COVID-19. 6 18 Several factors can explain the differences, especially cultural patterns and psychosocial, environmental, and work influences. Also, the evolution of the infectious event in terms of morbimortality and impact on society, is important. 17 Fear and negative perceptions concerning medical work during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly higher among general practitioners with symptoms of GAD. Among these, more than 90% reported fear of catching the virus at work and fear of taking the virus home. Lu et al indicate that the concern about being infected is a contributing factor to psychological pressure on medical personnel. 2 Fear of infection has a negative psychological effect on health professionals who take care of patients during epidemics. 7 19 20 In the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, health workers expressed fear and guilt about exposing their family to the infection and felt conflicted between their roles as healthcare providers and parents. 19 In this study, half of the professionals who reported anxiety symptoms also experienced social discrimination for working as a general practitioner. Lee et al reported that experiencing discrimination was associated with anxiety disorders and depression. 21 During the current pandemic, stigma and social discrimination have been generated against people who may have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 22 In the 2003 SARS epidemic, healthcare professionals reported feeling stigmatized and also reported avoiding identifying themselves as hospital workers. 19 23 Social discrimination can represent an obstacle in the search for psychological help, a disturbance in social cohesion, increased isolation, and a reduction in the ability to adopt healthy behaviors. 22 24 Anxiety is closely related to psychological stress and work-related stress. 25 A significantly greater presence of work-related stress was observed among professionals with symptoms of GAD. A similar finding was also reported by Chua et al. 8 Work-related stress is one of the most important factors in the development of burnout syndrome. 26 The overload on institutional capacity, long work hours, the limited availability of efficient protocols, the lack of personal protective equipment, diagnostic tests, or other hospital supplies are challenges for health systems that can contribute to burnout syndrome in times of epidemics. 27 Professional burnout is also associated with poor job performance and acute and chronic health problems. 28 Anxiety is accompanied by feelings of anguish, social isolation, depression, panic, irritation, inability to concentrate, sleep disturbances, and a reduction in professional commitment. 24 29 30 Anxious states are also related to physical manifestations, as a consequence of hormonal influences and somatovegetative mechanisms. 31 All these were identified in the group of general practitioners evaluated. It has been asserted that individuals with somatic symptoms seem to be more aware of the possibility of getting sick. 32 Stress can reduce the capacity of the immune system, predisposing to a greater opportunity to acquire the infection. 31 In the 2003 SARS outbreak, Maunder et al reported that in patients and workers of a university hospital, the anxiety peaks coincided with the presence of feverish sensation. 19 We observed that fear of having presented symptoms of COVID-19 was associated with twice the presence of symptoms of GAD. We found that several of the COVID-19 fear symptoms were significantly more frequent and associated with symptoms of GAD. From the early stages of epidemics, fear and anxiety are present, as unconscious physiological mechanisms of survival and defense of the individual in the face of the aggressions of infectious agents. 33 Later, they can become pathological, affecting general well-being, the ability to act rationally, and decision-making. 15 24 34 It was found that the female gender, compared with the male, was associated with twice the presence of symptoms of GAD in the initial phase of containment. Zhang et al, in a cross-sectional study during the mitigation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, concluded that the female gender was associated with increased anxiety, depression, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. 6 Lai et al observed a 69% increase in the presence of anxiety in women. 16 In general, Gong et al have indicated that women have OR=1.81 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.38) and OR=1.57 (95% CI 1.21 to 2.03) for anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. 35 Our results indicate that general practitioners' perception of being protected by the state or employer was associated with 43% less presence of symptoms of GAD. At the same time, in China, Chua et al reported that feeling confident about infection control was associated with a lower level of stress and fewer negative psychological effects. Awareness of the importance of hygiene was reported as a positive psychological effect. 8 Fortunately, 90% of the physicians studied, with no differences according to the presence of symptoms of GAD, complied with a disinfection protocol when they got home.This study has the limitations of cross-sectional studies, establishing statistical association and non-causality. Although a larger number of subjects were included than the sample size, there may be an underestimate or overestimate in the results. FCV-19S was used, not yet validated in Spanish, and low reliability was obtained. No study was found that estimated the reliability of the questionnaire on psychosomatic. There were no questions about the availability and use of personal protective equipment, care for patients proven to have COVID-19, or the pre-existence of personal or family anxiety traits. The strength of this study is to be among the first to address mental health aspects of Colombian general practitioners in times of pandemics, carried out using the GAD-7, an international scale of adequate reliability. The virtual strategy to call and receive the information allowed the participation of a good number of professionals from different Colombian geographical regions but limited reaching a representative sample and being able to demonstrate compliance with the inclusion criteria, generating some biases.During and after epidemics, a greater presence of psychiatric disorders has been observed, with an impact on attention, understanding, decision-making, and general wellbeing. 17 36 37 In conclusion, symptoms of GAD were identified in 4 out of 10 Colombian general practitioners. Psychosocial and demographic factors were associated with symptoms of GAD. These findings bring to understanding the need for early mental health screening in healthcare providers during times of public health emergencies and highlight the importance of timely psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions in these individuals. Future research on this regard should focus on assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions in the presence of anxiety symptoms. It is recommended that government and healthcare entities deploy multidisciplinary teams of mental health providers capable of implementing programs that benefit adjustment, prevent mental illness, and promote recovery in healthcare providers during social and public health crises, especially when routine capacity has been overwhelmed. 6-8 16 24 ",Colombia,first author,2020-08-03,8

The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Guan et al., 2020) . Since then, the spread of the COVID-19 has been challenging governments to create public policies to minimize the load of COVID-19 cases on health care systems (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020) , often described as ""flattening the curve"".Although most of the mitigation strategies to slow transmission of the COVID-19 are recommended for all countries, regions, cities, and communities (e.g., reduce social contacts), it is crucial to examine areas with community attributes that may require enhanced public policies. These attributes include demographic variation, economic aspects, transportation infrastructure, health condition of the population (e.g. rates of co-morbidities), and characteristic of the health care system (CDC, 2020) . For example, while the Chines government reports that control intervention measures in China may have reduced new cases by approximately 90%, Italy and Iran have not achieved this success (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) .According to the Brazilian Health Agency (Ministério da Saúde, 2020), Brazil has been facing the impacts of the COVID-19 since February 2020, when the first case was reported in the city of São Paulo. As of March 30, 2020, COVID-19 in Brazil has resulted in 4256 confirmed cases and 136 deaths (Ministério da Saúde, 2020) and is present in all Brazilian states. Currently, the Brazilian Government has implemented mitigation strategies to slow the transmission of COVID-19 by restricting social contacts in several municipalities. If COVID-19 infection rates in Brazil parallel those observed in China, a 0.20 proportion of the population (Guan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) , the largest country in South America (200 million inhabitants in 8,515,767 km 2 ) would be expected to see 10 million cases. Given the potential undocumented cases due to limited testing, the infection rate may be a low estimate and situation in Brazil could be far greater (Li et al., 2020) .Our study estimates which Brazilian municipalities will exceed their health care capacity under five different mitigation strategies that vary their approach and local outcomes based on municipalities' community attributes. The various attributes are implemented in a hierarchical framework and the importance of each aspect is assessed by expert opinion and combined in a multicriteria decision model. The model is applied along with existing infection and hospitalization rates to identify health care capacity exceedances. Understanding the variation of this risk over space is essential to identify priority areas, to monitor conditions on the ground, to calculate temporal changes, to compare populations, and to communicate to potentially affected people and governmental agencies.This study was conducted in five stages. First, we established the conceptual model composed by all the criteria related to the aim of our study. In the second stage, we used Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to consolidate a geodatabase encompassing all the criteria at the municipality scale. In the third stage, we used a decision-making approach to assign weights for each criterion. In the fourth stage, we integrated the weights into the infection rate functions to estimate the risk of each municipality health care system to exceed capacity because of COVID-19. Finally, in the fifth stage, we examined the risk variation by implementing various control intervention scenarios.The hierarchical network characterizes the conceptual model, which is the cascading structure of criteria and measurable attributes needed for most multi-criteria models. We established the hierarchical network using five primary community attributes (criteria), including land use, socioeconomics, population, health conditions, and health care system. Each primary criterion decomposes into quantifiable sub-criteria. Fig. 1 presents the complete hierarchical network. Note that this hierarchical network does not capture all the complex interactions related to the risk of exceeding health care capacity because of COVID-19 infections; however, the variables represented by each criterion are those currently available. We highlight that our analysis was conducted at a fine spatial scalemunicipality level. Data at municipal scale in Brazil are limited; however, it is important to analyze this scale because the health care system varies by local capacity. The 5572 municipalities are the smallest regions considered by the Brazilian political system.We provide a description of each attribute by theme in Table 1 .Currently, it is unclear the mechanistic relationships between community attributes and the rate of COVID-19 infections. We developed a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model to implement expert judgment to relate community attributes to the spread of infections (i.e. ranking of how each community attribute may influence disease spread or control at the municipal level). We applied the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) developed by Saaty (1980) and frequently used in environmental and health studies (Fontana et al., 2013; Greening and Bernow, 2004; Requia et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2002) . AHP is considered one of the best approaches for MCDM, because its flexibility enables decisions combining judgment and personal values in a pairwise comparison between criteria. In addition, it can be used to decompose a complex decision-making problem into simple sub problems (hierarchy network). It is a process for identifying, understanding, and assessing the interactions of a system as a whole by providing a scale for measuring intangibles and a method for establishing priorities (Saaty, 1980) . We used AHP to assign the weights in a stratified approach by obeying each level of the hierarchy defined in Stage 1. A total of 16 specialists in public health and stakeholders in the decision-making to reduce environmental health risks established the pair-wise comparison weights, which were on a scale from 1 to 9 developed by Saaty (1980) . A value of one indicates equal importance. The reminder of the weights indicate greater importance of one criteria relative to the other, which include moderate importance (3); strong importance (5); very strong importance (7); extreme importance (9), and 2, 4, 6 and 8 representing intermediate values. The inverse comparison in the matrix is represented by one over the value. After assignment, we modeled the pair-wise comparison importance values using matrix A shown in Eq. (1). where a ij = α; a ji = 1 α ; a is a joint comparison; and α is the assigned importance value. We calculated the matrix (A) by the auto value V i , as shown in Eq. (2).Normalization of the Eq.(2) generates the vector W, which is the priorities vector (it represents the relative importance attributed for each criteria). We calculated W using Eq. (3):The multiplication of the matrix (A) by the value for each weighing W = (W 1 , W 2 , …, W n ) generates the value Aw, which is represented by the Eq. (4). The relation Aw = nW cannot be calculated directly. Instead, Saaty (1980) suggests the use of Eq. (5):Based on Eq. (5), we calculated the vector of priorities as shown in Eq. (6).The individual judgments were aggregated by calculating the geometric mean of all vectors of priorities (Aw). This is a common approach in AHP. We applied the geometric mean in order to obtain the central tendency of all judgments. Saaty (1980) proposed a validation method for assigning weights using Inconsistency Rate (IR) values, which are calculated based on properties of reciprocal matrices. According to the author, IR should not exceed 0.10. Values lower than 0.10 indicate rational logic in the judgment process.Finally, in order to establish a global value of each criterion, we used Eq. (7):where V(a) is the global value; W j is the importance relative to the criteria j; V j is the level of preference of the alternative for criterion j, which P n j¼1 W j ¼ 1 v j ðaÞ; and 0 b W j b 1 (j = 1, …,n).First, we standardized all the sub-criteria consolidated in the second stage (described in the Section 2.3) to a scale of 0-1, where 0 represents the lowest risk of the health care system to be exceeded because of COVID-19, and 1 the highest risk. We used the following equation for the standardization of each observation (municipality m) of each variable (y).Using the standardized variables, the final risk for each municipality x was estimated based on the weights (V) assigned to each criterion by obeying each level of the hierarchy that was established, as described in the following manner:AirportBusiness activities Risk mPopulationHealth conditionsb10 years old Risk mHealth conditions 10−19 years old Risk m ¼ Heart disease 10−19 years m x V heart disease 10−19 years À Á þ Lung disease 10−10 years m x V lung disease 10−19 years À Á Note that we applied an inverse function (1/x) for those criteria where 0 represented the highest risk and 1 the lowest risk. The criteria rural areas (Eq. (9)), income (Eq. (13)), agricultural sector (Eq. (12)), mining sector (Eq. (12)), number of hospital beds (Eq. (20)), and number of staff (Eq. (21)) present this concept. For example, the higher number of hospital beds (values close to 1) is the least risk that the health care system would be exceeded by the COVID-19.Lastly, we integrated an infection rate in the model to estimate the Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC) to determine the Brazilian municipalities that will exceed bed capacity and those that should have enough supply, which is shown in Eq. (24). Here, the FINAL RISK m calculated by Eq. (23) was defined as a ""penalty"", where values close to 1 have minimal effect on HBC and values close to 0 have a greater effect on the availability of beds in each municipal district.where TB is the total beds available in each municipality m; BA is the percentage of beds that are available, which according to the Brazilian Health Agency, it is 70% (30% on average of the hospital beds are already occupied); Pop represents the total population in each municipal district m; IR is the infection rate (percentage of the population infected with the COVID-19), which we based on current studies at 0.20% overall (Guan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) ; and PC is the percentage of the infected population that will require hospitalization, which according to initial studies on COVID-19 is about 8% (China CDC, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).A baseline HBC scenario was assessed as a standard 0.20% infection rate for all municipalities in Brazil. We modeled 5 scenarios to examine HBC variation due to differences in the response to control intervention scenarios at the municipal scale in Brazil. Each scenario represents a different control intervention, including the creation of public policies related to social contacts and expansion of the health care system. With the scenarios, Brazil's overall infection rate does not change; however, the infection rates within municipalities are relocated based on the community attributes and the FINAL RISK calculation.Scenario I included a 50% reduction in social contacts. Airport, port, interstate bus terminal, educational institutions, business activities, and population were defined as a proxy of social contact. The variables representing these criteria in the geodatabase were reduced by 50%, and then we repeated the steps described by Eqs. (9)-(24). Note that, in this scenario, the penalty of the FINAL RISK on HBC was reduced by 50%, increasing the availability of beds in each municipal district due to a flattening of the demand. Scenarios II and III, included a reduction of 75 and 100% of the social contacts, respectively. Scenario III is the most aggressive, where we try to simulate a quarantine that locks down the whole municipal district. Scenarios IV and V, the control intervention is an increase in resources in the health care system. We modeled an increase of 25% (Scenario IV) and 50% (Scenario V) resources in the health care system, which included the number of hospital beds and number of staff. Table 2 presents the weights attributed to each criterion. Health care system was identified as the most important primary criteria (weight = 0.42), with number of hospital beds given a weight of 0.63, and number of staff a weight of 0.37. Since most Brazilians depend on the public health care system, private hospitals were prioritized with the highest weight for both number of beds and number of staff criteria. Health conditions, socioeconomic, population, and land use were assigned weights of 0.23, 0.15, 0.11, and 0.09, respectively ( Table 2 ).The weights attributed by the specialists in public health in our study are in agreement with the studies on COVID-19. Kraemer et al. (2020) have shown that human mobility data explain a substantial part of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in China. Control measures based on mobility can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which include travel restrictions (Chinazzi et al., 2020) and social distancing (Buckee et al., 2020) .In Table 3 , we present the descriptive statistics for the Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC), which in our study was defined as the Brazilian municipalities that will exceed beds (negative values) and those that should have sufficient beds (positive values) because of the patients infected with the COVID-19. For the baseline scenario, we estimated a mean HBC value of −16.73, indicating that, on average, each Brazilian municipality will have a deficit of approximately 17 beds during the period of infection. In contrast, the average value was positive for all mitigation scenarios. For example, if there is a 50% increase in the number of hospital beds and of nurses, doctors, etc. (scenario V), there will be an oversupply of 27 beds across all the municipal districts in Brazil. If we introduce the most aggressive scenario (scenario III), there will be an oversupply of about 46 beds.We illustrate the spatial distribution of HBC in Fig. 2 , including the baseline scenario and the five intervention control scenarios. The north and northeast are the Brazilian regions with the highest number of municipalities that will exceed bed capacity due to the COVID-19 when we consider the baseline scenario. Among the 5572 municipalities, 69% (3338) will not have enough hospital beds to receive the infected patients with the COVID-19. Among those 69% of the municipalities that will exceed hospital bed capacity, 52% (1962) municipalities are in the north and northeast. If we account for the five intervention control scenarios, the number of municipalities that will exceed bed capacity decreases to 2702 (scenario I), 2317 (scenario II), 2119 (scenario III), 2259 (scenario IV), and 2205 (scenario V).Currently, limited studies examine the risk of health care capacity, especially in Brazil. A recent report developed by the Brazilian Institute for Health Policy Studies (IEPS) has shown that 30% of the health regions in Brazil are vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 due to a deficit of hospital beds (Rache et al., 2020) . In our study, this vulnerability was estimated to be 69% of the municipalities. This difference may be explained by spatial scale. While we accounted for the municipal districts, Rache et al. (2020) considered health regions (coarser scale compared with our spatial scale). We argue the finer spatial scale is important because of the challenges that would be faced in moving patients between municipal regions (e.g. impact on resources and increased exposures).Our findings indicate that limitations on social contacts (scenarios I-III) and the investment on health care system (scenarios IV-V) should have a reasonable effect on reducing the number of municipalities that may run out of beds. We suggest that a larger reduction may be achieved by combining interventions related to social contacts, behavioral changes, and public health. The combination of these interventions has been suggested by initial studies on COVID-19. For example, Chinazzi et al. (2020) report that travel limitations of up to 90% of the traffic in China have a modest effect on reduction in the disease transmissibility. Emanuel et al. (2020) discuss looked at how medical resources can be allocated faily during a COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that there are data that can be used to project resource demands. Given the challenging on modeling allocation of medical resources in the time of COVID-19, Emanuel et al. (2020) suggest the importance of some points that need to be considered, including the ethical values for rationing health resources and maximizing benefits. Our study may support these points considering that we used a multicriteira framework that can be easily adapted, depending on the local needs across cases.We recognize our study has some limitations. While we used a robust approach to assign weights to criteria that explain the spatial distribution of COVID-19, we did not account for temporal variation when we integrated the infection rate in the model to estimate the Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC)described in Eq. (24). In other words, we assumed uniform infection rates over time (e.g., without incubation period, delay onset-to-confirmation), which does not capture all the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Due to the lack of a temporal parameter in our model, we partially used the classical infection disease model -SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed). Our research is also limited with the hierarchical network composed by criteria to represent the risk of the Brazilian health care system to exceed capacity by an influx of infected patients. As we mentioned previously, the variables represented by each criterion do not represent all the complex interactions related to the spread of the COVID-19. Those variables included were the most comprehensive list we could generate from the available data. An important criterion that should be considered in further studies relates to scenarios where not only do the numbers of sick patients increase rapidly, but also the number of sick health care workers. If workers do not have adequate clean Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including N95 masks on COVID units or surgical masks on non-COVID units, they may get ill or, if they have COVID and are not symptomatic may inadvertently spread the disease. Thus, PPE becomes an essential part of protecting health care workers and patients and assuring that not only beds are available but healthy health care workers who know how to and have the equipment to care for these patients. Lastly, we assume the control strategies do not affect Brazil's infection rate, which was used because the findings are unclear if control strategies affect the long-term infection rate or modify the rates by region.Our study provides a description of a potential multi-criteria decision-making approach to support the implementation of mitigation strategies to control the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic. The flexibility of our approach can guide the design of alternative interventions. In particular, our spatial estimates of the Brazilian municipalities that exceed bed capacity and those that can handle the patients infected with the COVID-19 provide an understanding of the future epidemiological situation in Brazil. We highlight that bed capacity is a starting point in terms of outcomes. In addition to bed capacity, as we mentioned above, there is also ventilator capacity, mask or mask recycling capacity and health care worker capacity, which should be considered in additional studies. We suggest that our study can guide these next investigations. Our estimates can also be used to provide support for the creation of effective health public policies for national, regional, and local intervention, since beds can be created and tents can be set up.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

778579b3772ab4b45ff2cffa08909b31425306e9,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Minas Gerais, Brazil: insights from epidemiological data and SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing","The World Health Organization (WHO) office in China was informed about a cluster of new cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan (Hubei province), in late December 2019 [1] . Shortly afterwards, a new type of coronavirus, now termed SARS-CoV-2, was isolated and identified by Chinese authorities, with its genetic sequence shared with the international community on 10 January 2020 [2] [3] [4] [5] . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was similar to other (epidemic) betacoronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4, 5] , and was clearly related to coronaviruses isolated from bats and Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) indicative of a zoonotic origin [2, [5] [6] [7] .To date, more than 10.7 million cases of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, have been reported globally [8, 9] . On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared a pandemic, prompting a dramatic increase in international concern and response [10] . On 26 February 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in São Paulo (SP) state, Brazil [11] . Two months later (28 April 2020), 61,888 cases and 4,205 deaths attributed to COVID-19 had been reported in Brazil [12] . Initial phylogenetic analysis using the first two SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes isolated in São Paulo from travellers returning from Italy revealed two independent introductions into the country relative to the data set available at that time [13] .The state of Minas Gerais (MG) is the second largest Brazilian state in terms of population size, estimated at approximately 21 million people [14] . Due to its large population size and strong connections to active neighbouring states such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the state of MG is likely to be highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.Genetic analyses and surveillance allow the characterization of circulating viral lineages, the inference of introduction events and the reconstruction of transmission patterns [15] . Together with epidemiological data they constitute powerful tools to assist public health initiatives and preparedness. Herein, we present a summary of epidemiological data and the generation and analysis of 40 new SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from clinical samples of confirmed cases from MG. Our aim was to provide a preliminary epidemiological overview of SARS-CoV-2 circulation and introduction events into Minas Gerais.Anonymised samples processed in this study were sent to the Central Public Health Laboratory/Octávio Magalhães Institute (IOM) of the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (FUNED), which belongs to public laboratories network from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (BMoH). They were previously obtained by the local health services for the routine diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. The availability of these samples for research purposes during outbreaks of international concern is allowed under the terms of the 510/2016 Resolution of the National Ethical Committee for Research -Brazilian Ministry of Health (CONEP -Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa, Ministério da Saúde): this authorizes the use of clinical samples collected in the Brazilian Central Public Health Laboratories to accelerate knowledge building and contribute to surveillance and outbreak response. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais with approval No. 32912820.6.1001.5149.Samples used in this study were from residual anonymised clinical samples, with no or minimal risk to patients, provided for research and surveillance purposes as described above. Swab samples collected from COVID-19 suspected cases were collected throughout the state of MG and sent to IOM-FUNED facilities. At the IOM-FUNED facilities they were submitted to total RNA extraction with an automated protocol on the QIAsymphony platform using the DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The molecular diagnosis was performed on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Thermofisher Scientific), using a RT-qPCR singleplex kit for the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and RNAdependent RNA polymerase genes developed by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, following the manufacturer's recommendations. We selected 48 samples with RT-qPCR positive results, collected up to 3 April 2020 from patients residing in different municipalities of the state of MG and presenting with symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, dyspnea, sore throat and/or vomiting. Samples were selected based on cycle threshold (Ct) values ≤ 32. Associated epidemiological data, such as symptoms, travel history and municipality of residency, were collected from medical records accompanying the collected samples provided by IOM/FUNED.For cDNA synthesis, the SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. The generated cDNA was subjected to multiplex PCR sequencing using Q5 High Fidelity Hot-Start DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and a set of specific primers designed by the ARTIC Network (https://github.com/articnetwork/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/ nCoV-2019/V1) for sequencing the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome [16] . PCR conditions have been previously reported in [16] . All experiments were performed in biosafety level-2 cabinet.Amplified PCR products were purified using the 1x AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) following previously a published protocol [17] . Purified PCR products were quantified using the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Of the 48 samples, only 40 contained sufficient DNA (≥ 2ng/µL) to proceed to library preparation. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Oxford Nanopore Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109) following previously a published protocol [17] . Before pooling all samples, each sample was barcoded using the Native Barcoding Expansion kits (NBD104 and EXP-NBD114). After barcoding adaptor ligation, sequencing libraries were loaded on a flow cell (FLO-MIN106) for subsequent MinION sequencing, programmed to run for six hours. Reads were basecalled using Guppy and barcode demultiplexing was performed using qcat. Consensus sequences were generated by de novo assembling using Genome Detective and Coronavirus Typing Tool [18, 19] .Public SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences available up to 15 April 2020 were retrieved from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT (FF-NS-2 algorithm) employing default parameters [20] . The alignment was manually curated to remove artefacts at the terminal regions and within the alignment using Aliview [21] . Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences was performed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in IQ-TREE (version 1.6.10), employing the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as indicated by the Model Finder application implemented in IQ-TREE [22] . The statistical robustness of individual nodes was determined using 1000 bootstrap replicates.Lineage assessment was conducted using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages tool available at https://github.com/hCoV-2019/ pangolin [23] . Four data sets of complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were generated. Data set 1 (n = 3,102) comprised the data reported in this study (n = 40) plus publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (n = 3,062) from GISAID. Subsequently, to investigate the evolutionary behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 within the three different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B and B.1), Bayesian molecular clock analysis was conducted on three smaller subsets of data for each of the three lineages identified in the ML phylogeny and containing isolates from MG (data set 2 for subset A n = 100; data set 3 for subset B n = 84; data set 4 for subset B.1 n = 169). ML trees from these three data subsets were inspected in TempEst v1.5.3 for the presence of a temporal (i.e. molecular clock) signal [24] . Linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distances against sampling dates indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences evolve in a relatively-strong clock-like manner (r = 0·43; r = 0·47; r = 0·40 from subset A; B and B.1, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S18 ). For more detailed Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis we employed the BEAST 1.10.4 program [25] . For this analysis we employed the strict molecular clock model, the HKY+Γ4 codon partitioned (CP)1 + 2,3 nucleotide substitution model and the exponential growth coalescent model [26] . We computed MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) triplicate runs of 100 million states each, sampling every 10.000 steps for each data set. Convergence of MCMC chains was checked using Tracer v.1.7.1 [27] . Maximum clade credibility trees were summarized from the MCMC samples using TreeAnnotator after discarding 10% as burn-in.Data used in the epidemiological analysis were retrieved from https://github.com/wcota/covid19br [28] .After the WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020, the Brazilian government declared a Public Health Emergency of National Importance on 3 February 2020, enabling the introduction of measures to prevent and control virus spread [29] . Twenty-three days later, the first confirmed case in Brazil was reported in the city of São Paulo, related to a traveller returning from Lombardy, Italy ( Figure 1 ) [11] . By the 28th April 2020, more than 61,888 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Brazil, 1,578 of which were from MG ( Figure 2A ) [30] . Over this period, MG registered 71 COVID-19-related deaths and the capital city, Belo Horizonte, with an estimated population of 2.5 million people, reported 555 cases [30, 31] . Figure 2A shows MG's epidemic (reported cases) curve compared to those of two other neighbouring states, São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ). Temporal trends reveal a growth in the number of cases in MG, although with SP accounting for the largest number of cases and deaths (24,041 cases; 2,049 deaths) by COVID-19 up to 28th April 2020.Epidemiological analyses using cases and mortality time series data from three Brazilian states Without access to the total number of tests in time and in each state, we obtained a crude estimate of the case fatality ratio (CFR) for MG, SP and RJ as the ratio between the number of reported deaths and cases [32] . Accordingly, CFR was found to increase with time in all states (Supplementary Figure S2 ), with means from date of first reported case up to the 28 April in each state as 2.67% for MG, 5.39% for RJ and 6.0% for SP. Although all such comparisons should be made with caution, the CFR in SP and RJ was consistently higher than reported in other localities; for example, 2.6% (95% CI 0·89-6·7) for the Diamond Princess cruise ship [33] , and 3.67% (95% CI 3.56-3.80) and 1.2% (95% CI 0.3-2.7) and 1.4% (95% CI 0.9-2.1) for different Chinese regions [33] [34] [35] .We used the mortality time series (MTS) from MG, SP and RJ to project the (unobserved total) cumulative number of infections, making two main simplifying assumptions: first, that the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 would be similar in the Brazilian states to that reported elsewhere; and second, that the number of cumulative deaths in each state were well reported. We utilised the IFR estimated by Verity and colleagues (0.66%, CI 95% 0.39-1.33% [34] ), for its general use in the modelling literature [36] . The cumulative number of infections in time was is the number of reported cases in time. We found that the observation rate decreased in time for all states, a likely outcome of epidemic growth superseding tracing and testing efforts as the epidemic progressed (Supplementary Figure S1 ). By 28 April 2020, the last time point analysed, RJ and SP had similar observation rates at 7.6% and 7.74% (respectively), while in MG, where the epidemic started later, the observation rate was 15.3% (i.e. 1 reported case in 7 infections).To compare transmission potential, we used reported cases (CTS) and mortality time series (MTS) from MG, SP and RJ states to estimate the (effective) reproduction number, R . For this, we performed maximum likelihood estimation of the (CTS and MTS) epidemic growth r using a phenomenological model, and two theoretical formulations on how r relates to R -one based on the SEIR epidemiological framework by Wallinga and colleagues [37] , and another on the distribution of the serial interval [36] Using geographic information from reported data in each state ( Figure 2C ), we found cases and deaths to be disproportionally reported in capital cities for the RJ and SP states but not for MG (Supplementary Figures  S13-14) . Typically, incidence (cases, deaths) are normalized per 100K individuals, taking into account the total population size of each state. Because of the very different spatial dispersion of cases and deaths in MG when compared to SP and RJ, we also calculated the effective population size; that is, the sum of the population sizes of all municipalities with reports. When using reported cases, we found that the effective population sizes were ∼100%, ∼100% and 64% of the total population sizes of RJ, SP and MG, respectively. When using reported deaths, the effective population sizes were ∼95%, ∼92%, and 35% of the total population sizes of RJ, SP and MG, respectively. Overall these numbers suggest that in MG cases and deaths have been reported only in a subset of the overall population, while in the other states SARS-CoV-2 appears widely dispersed. Incidence of reported cases per 100K using the effective population size was ∼60 in SP, ∼51 in RJ and ∼7.85 in MG (Supplementary Figure   Figure 1 .

Codes in parentheses refer to the identification code (CV#) of the isolates from the cases described in this study. S7), while incidence of deaths per 100K was ∼5.56 in SP, ∼4.69 in RJ and ∼0.94 in MG (Supplementary Figure S12 ).In MG, samples from (clinically) suspected cases were screened at the Central Public Health Laboratory/Octávio Magalhães Institute (IOM) of the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (FUNED), which belongs to the public laboratories network of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH). By 3rd April 2020, IOM/FUNED had performed 3,303 RT-qPCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 on swab samples from suspected cases. We used Nanopore sequencing to generate complete genomes from 40 COVID-19 patients in 15 different municipalities in MG (Table 1) .Of the 40 samples, 17 (42.5%) were from the state's capital (Belo Horizonte), while the other municipalities were represented by one or a maximum of three samples. These samples were from 17 females and 23 males, with collection dates ranging from 4 March 2020 to 26 March 2020 ( Table 1 ). The median age of the patients was 35 years (ranging from 19-79 years old). The first sample that tested positive by RT-qPCR at IOM/FUNED was collected on 4th March 2020 (Table 1 and Figure 1 ). Selected samples had cycle threshold (Ct) values that ranged from 16.41 to 31.86 (median=22.945). We found no demographic variables (age, gender) to be statistically correlated with sample Ct (Supplementary Figure S17 ). The new sequences had a median genome coverage of 82.5% related to the reference genome NC_045512.3 (S1 Table) . All sequences generated in this study have been submitted to the GISAID following WHO guidelines [38] . Of the 17 (42.5%, n=40) sequenced cases with available travel history information, 14 (82.35%, n=17) reported international travel while three reported domestic travel (Table 1) . Two among the later visited the city of São Paulo and one the city of Rio de Janeiro. Of the international travel-related cases, seven (50%) were linked to travel to European countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, England, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, and Hungary), while six reported travel to countries in the Americas (USA, Colombia, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Panama, Chile, and Peru). One case reported travel to Israel. To explore the epidemiological history of the virus in MG, we performed a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis on the 40 new sequences combined with another 3,062 sequences deposited in GISAID up to 15 April 2020. We also made use of a publicly available tool for the automated lineage assignment within SARS-CoV-2 (https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin) [23] . Our estimated phylogeny identified two major clades branching at the root of the tree (Figure 3 ). These two clades were named lineages A and B, following a recently proposed SARS-CoV-2 lineage nomenclature [39] : lineage A can be defined by the Wuhan/WH04/2020 sequence, while lineage B is represented by Wuhan-Hu-1. Lineage B can be further divided into a number of component sublineages, and our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority (n=37, 92.5%) of MG sequences belonged to lineage B.1 which contains sequences from a variety of countries including Australia, China, Canada, Malaysia, and the USA [40] (Figure 3 , Table 1 ). Of these 37 B.1 sequences, 11 were isolates from cases that reported travel to European countries (CV2, CV3, CV11, CV13, CV17) or the Americas (CV4, CV6, CV12, CV20, CV28, CV35), in addition to the isolate CV1 from a traveller who returned from Israel. Aside from sublineage B.1, two sequences were assigned to lineage B in our ML phylogeny (isolates CV22 and CV36, with the former reporting travel to Germany), while one sequence could be assigned to lineage A (isolate CV7) who reported travel to European countries (full results from the Pangolin COVID-19 lineage assigner are presented in Supplementary Table S2 ).To assess the evolution of these lineages in more detail and in time, we performed Bayesian timemeasured phylogenetic analysis using a molecular clock model. We analysed three subsets of data (A, B, B.1) extracted from each lineage from the ML tree that included Brazilian sequences. Our maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees showed that most of MG's sequences were interspersed with viruses sampled from other countries (Figure 4b, c, d) . This pattern, similar to that observed elsewhere [40] [41] [42] , is also in accordance with our ML tree and with the epidemiological data, indicating that the appearance of these viruses were linked to travel exposure rather than community transmission, and reinforcing the idea that multiple independent introductions from overseas occurred in MG.In contrast, some other SARS-CoV-2 sequences from MG grouped together, forming clusters that included sequences from Brazil and other countries: these are apparent in the data subset B.1 phylogeny (Figure 4d ). However, these clusters have very low posterior probability support, likely due to the low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes [43] [44] [45] . Nonetheless, four clusters, each comprising only two MG sequences, showed posterior probabilities >80%. One of these clusters (Figure 4d) , with a posterior probability of 100%, was formed by isolates CV34 and CV36 that arose from local contacts with a confirmed and a suspected COVID-19 case, respectively.From the time-scaled phylogenies, we estimated the mean time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil to range from 27 January to 22 February 2020 (95% HPD interval; mean date of 10 February 2020). This is consistent with the start of reported cases in Brazil and with the epidemiological data from the first case confirmed in SP, regarding a traveller returning from Lombardy, Italy, on 21 February 2020 [11, 13] .We provide a preliminary characterization of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in MG, the second largest state in Brazil with respect to population size, where 1,578 cases were reported up to 28 April 2020. We report genomic data obtained by sequencing 40 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases confirmed by RT-qPCR in MG. We also collected epidemic data of case and death time series to estimate key epidemiological metrics such as the case fatality ratio, the observation rate and the effective reproduction number, R. Combined epidemiological and genomic data strongly suggest that the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in MG was associated with multiple independent importations from returned travellers.Epidemiological analysis using case and death time series revealed that in MG, where case incidence was ∼7.85, the distribution of cases and deaths was more spatially uniform (i.e. less focused on Belo Horizonte), while in SP and RJ states it was more centralized around capital cities, although with a wide variance. The estimated observation rate was 15.3% in MG, indicating that 1 case in 7 was reported in that state by 28 April 2020. Despite the different approaches used, the R values estimated for MG were similar to those estimated previously [46] . As all estimates of R were > 1, we conclude that virus transmission is not controlled and that the epidemic in MG will continue to grow unless stricter non-pharmaceutical interventions are implemented.Our time-measured phylogeny revealed that MG's isolates are scattered throughout the tree, although some clusters suggestive of local transmission were also observed. This dispersed distribution has been observed in other studies such as from China [42] and New York [47] , and is consistent with the selfdeclared travel history of patients to different countries in the Americas and Europe. From our phylogeny we inferred that multiple independent importations of SARS-CoV-2 infection from returned travellers had occurred in MG. This is noteworthy because it has been argued that several introductions are necessary for an outbreak to establish in a new location [48] . The mean time of the most recent common ancestor of all Brazilian strains analysed in this study was estimated to be from 27 January to 22 February 2020, and range that includes the first COVID-19 confirmed case reported in 21 February 2020 [49] . These results illustrate that by combining genomic data and available epidemiological information we can generate more reliable phylogenetic inferences.Despite the grouping of some MG sequences, because of the small sample size data which covers only about 30 days of the MG epidemic we cannot infer a close relationship between these sequences with certainty at this stage. In addition, the low genetic diversity of sequences available limits conclusions about SARS-CoV-2 directionality and spread based on genetic data alone. As noted elsewhere [43] , such phylogenetic results should be approached with caution and considered as hypothesis-generating with respect to the transmission events of SARS-CoV-2 in a local setting.In conclusion, at the end of April 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic in the state of MG was expanding (R>1) and highly geographically dispersed, with many cases and deaths reported away from the capital city. Genomic data and other epidemiological information from travel-related cases allowed us to identify several independent introductions in MG, helping to explain the geographical patchiness of reported cases and deaths. These initial insights based on the restricted data reveal that transmission is likely to continue in the near future and suggest there is considerable room to improve reporting. Increasing COVID-19 testing and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing will undoubtedly help to understand how the virus is spreading in Brazil and thus greatly assist epidemic control.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-11,8
324cae411412115f22484c780d29300d142bb643,"CASE STUDY Low-dose radiotherapy for COVID-19 pneumonia treatment: case report, procedure, and literature review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak in late 2019 eventually imposed upon developing countries a major problem for public health systems, due to a lack of installed attention capacity [1] . Examples from European countries such as Spain or Italy, who saw their emergency and hospitalization systems rapidly overwhelmed despite a greater response capacity [2] , raised major concern in Latin American countries. In Peru, a major population mobility restriction was introduced on March 15 [3] , in order to alleviate the admission rates in a country where, according to official numbers, the overall availability of mechanical ventilators (MV) does not exceed 822 for a total of~33 million inhabitants [3] . Despite these efforts and as of May 25, the contagion incidence curves seem to still be increasing, with an average of more than 4000 new cases daily since the first official case was reported on March 6 [3, 4] .Currently, in light of the lack of evidence for a specific or effective medical treatment, hospital-and especially intensive care unit (ICU)-based support management have been left as the only options for the expected 5% of advanced cases [5] . According to this and in addition to the previously described situational features, the fragile balance between patients' admission and attention capacity should be approached from a preventive perspective.The anti-inflammatory effect of low-dose radiotherapy (LD-RT) was tested for infectious respiratory conditions in former times; however, this practice fell into decline after the advent of medical treatments [6] . Pre-clinical and clinical data regarding toxicity and effectiveness of such treat-ments have been published, showing an acceptable safety profile [7] .Herein, we present the case of a patient treated at our institution, describe the followed biosecurity and disinfection protocol, and review the available evidence regarding this topic published to date.We here report on a 64-year-old male patient with a prior history of pulmonary tuberculosis successfully treated in 1975. Ten days prior to admission, he noted malaise, headache, and myalgia, followed by the onset of fever and dry cough 5 days prior to admission. After rapid worsening of symptoms and onset of dyspnea, he presented in the emergency department, where COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Baseline vital signs were: heart rate (HR) 93 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 22 bpm, temperature (T°) 37.7°C, blood pressure 133/93 mm Hg, oxygen saturation level (SpO2) 89%.Oxygen support therapy was started with a non-rebreather mask at 10 L/min output (FiO2 100%) Pa/FiO2 During the second day of hospitalization, the dyspnea worsened further and was present at rest. Oxygen therapy with a non-rebreather mask was intensified to 15 L/min, reaching 85% SpO2 and 246 Pa/FiO2. Empiric treatment with tocilizumab 600 mg IV was started and the antibiotic was switched to ceftazidime 2 g iv bid. Due to further deterioration and a high likelihood of fatality of the clini- HFNC high-flow nasal cannula, NR not registered cal infection, whole-lung RT was offered as compassionate treatment [8] .The third day continued with the prior installed management. Clinical and ABG analysis showed RR 25/min, SpO2 91.2%, PO2 73.5 mm Hg, FiO2 0.5, and Pa/FiO2 147. The following protocol was followed regarding biosecurity measures, treatment planning, and delivery: all equipment was precovered with disposable plastic barriers. The patient was transported from the hospitalization unit with a fully isolated transport bed, through a designated transit area at the very end of the regular daily schedule. All involved personnel wore personal protective equipment (PPE), including dedicated garments, goggles, and NIOSH N95 respirators (FFP2 equivalent). A chest planning CT scan was performed, organs at risk (OARs) and whole-lung target volume were contoured. A 1-Gy prescription was opted for and planning with the VMAT technique was performed. Procedure duration included 10 min of patient positioning, 1:20 min CBCT imaging verification, and 1:30 min beam-on time. Taking the same previously described measures, the patient was transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuing medical management. Quaternary ammonium was employed for disinfection and ultraviolet light was ad- OAR organ at risk, CTV clinical target volume, PTV planning target volume, Dmax maximum dose ditionally used to cover the simulation CT and treatment bunkers.The patient was kept under observation due to a potential need of intubation and assisted ventilation. Oxygen therapy was continued with a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50 L/min due to persistent altered ABG values. Medical therapy was intensified with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg bid and azithromycin 500 mg bid; additionally, the enoxaparin dose was intensified (60 mg sc bid).Three days after RT (sixth hospitalization day), the patient showed improvement in respiratory patterns and a persistent, although ameliorated, cough. HFNC management was de-escalated to a low-flow system with 30% FiO2. ABG parameters showed PaO2 90.5 mm Hg and Pa/FiO2 226.25. Seven days after treatment the patient was discharged from the ICU to continue management in a lower-complexity area. No RT-related toxicity was seen during the process.Imaging control did not show a clinical correlation: comparing the first CT at admission with the eighth post-RT day, the latter displayed a stronger interstitial inflammatory pattern (Fig. 1 ).Baseline and eighth post-RT day imaging. Evident worsening of the inflammatory process can be observed; however, a dissociation between these finding and the good clinical evolution of the patient is to be notedA chest CT scan with 2.5 mm thick slices was acquired for planning purposes, accounting for a total set of 143 images. The hands-up position was determined and non-forced expiration was intended. Delineation of OARs and wholelung CTV was performed on a contouring system (Monaco v.5.11.02, Elekta AG, Sweden). A circumferential 5-mm and craniocaudal 10-mm PTV expansion was created. The contoured OARs included the heart, esophagus, spinal cord, and trachea. Additionally, the aorta, bronchi, and carina were considered for documentation motives (Table 2) . A 1-Gy single dose was prescribed to the PTV (Fig. 2) . Planning was performed with the Monte Carlo algorithm, for a 6-MV nominal energy delivered with a 360°arc and 90°collimator position (Elekta Infinity, Elekta AG) for better conformity achievement. Total estimated monitor units (MU) were 692.24. The approximated planning time was 30 min. Equivalent uniform dose (EUD) constraints were employed and priority for heart avoidance was given. Isodose volumes for 1 Gy and 0.5 Gy and dose-volume histograms (DVH) can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3 . In addition, the target coverage and OAR dosimetry details can be seen in Table 3 .This first reported case to our knowledge in our country and the region raises the question of the effectiveness of RT to treat COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Due to the lack of contemporary data, it is still difficult to define the safety profile and best treatment timing in terms of prompt or delayed management. Regarding toxicity, the expected secondary effects after whole-lung irradiation are well known by radiation oncologists according to the delivered dose [9, 10] . Doses lower than 1 Gy should not be of major concern for short-or long-term follow-up. Lessons obtained from preclinical and clinical studies, the former performed for the first time over 100 years ago, have already established the basis for this treatment modality [11] . Experiments in cats and mice performed in the 1940s showed a beneficial protective effect in animals exposed to 0.5-1 Gy 24 h after virus inoculation. On the contrary, no greater difference was observed with exposure after 48 h, suggesting a major improvement in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) regulation with early treatment onset [12, 13] . A more recent investigation assessed the impact of a 1-, 2-, and 3-Gy single fraction in a murine model, in order to simulate the impact of radiation exposure in astronauts. After 2-year followup, neither of the selected doses caused caspase-3 overexpression nor ceramide species accumulation, which directly induce pneumocyte apoptosis and subsequent fibrosis [14] .The radiobiological rationale for adopting RT as an approach to counteract CRS encompasses a variety of mechanisms. COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pathogenesis is directly related to T helper 1 cell (Th1) activation, which subsequently initiate the dysregulated inflammatory cascade through different factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) amongst others, and in addition to phagocytic activity, contribute to upregulating the cytokine storm [15] [16] [17] . An observed pattern in severe cases points to major damage to tissues expressing high concentrations of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), mainly type II pneumocytes; therefore, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade is consequently K Low-dose radiotherapy for COVID-19 pneumonia treatment added as an extra factor by further activating macrophages and granulocytes and promoting continuous interstitial inflammation [18, 19] . The anti-inflammatory properties of RT include polarization of macrophages to an M2 phenotype (leukocyte adhesion mediator), and downregulation of nitric oxide, TNF-, and TGF-α. Besides, the upregulation of heme oxygenase, IL-10, TNF-β, NFκβ, and apoptosis mechanisms, as well as T-regulatory cell enhancement, have been postulated as co-adjuvant mediatory reactions [20] [21] [22] . Moreover, LD-RT might prevent accelerated viral drug-related mutation, which has been recently described due to increased selective pressure, while potentially improving the immune response by means of the previously described mechanisms and enhanced RNA damage compared to antiviral therapy [23, 24] .In the clinical setting, data about nonmalignant pathologies were published during the past century. The comprehensive review published by Calabrese et al. describes a series of publications regarding infectious diseases, including bacterial and interstitial pneumonia [6, 25] . An example is the study published by Oppenheimer in 1943. Satisfactory clinical outcomes were obtained after treating 56 patients with a 0.5-Gy equivalent, doses that were previously reported to satisfactorily treat bacterial lung conditions by Chamberlain [26] . Differences between three subgroups were reported, as patients who were treated from 2-5 days and 6-14 days had full symptom resolution. However, with treatment onset after 14 days, the therapy failed to completely resolve symptoms in 50% of the subjects. No fatalities were recorded [27] .It is also to be remarked that the overall COVID-19 intubation-related mortality rate varies between 30 and 70%, according to specific geographical regions [5, 15, 16] . No major data are available at the moment in terms of lung injury secondary to mechanical ventilation, although this still carries inherent risks [28, 29] . Preventive therapeutic approaches to avoid intubation seem of relevance, as this is associated with elevated mortality per se. However, this premise should not be taken lightly, due to the delicate balance between noninvasive and invasive ventilatory management in these terms. It has been previously demonstrated that noninvasive ventilation and delayed intubation, when indicated, could also yield lethal consequences in SARS management [30, 31] .Regarding irradiation technique selection, a three-arc VMAT plan was preferred over APPA and IMRT-based fields, in order to guarantee whole-lung tissue coverage and OAR (mostly cardiovascular structures) sparing, while simultaneously maintaining the beam-on time as short as possible [32] [33] [34] . It should also be noted that positioning and verification times must be accounted for; therefore, expected target coverage, OAR exposure, and image ver- ification technique are factors to be included in decisionmaking. Additional criteria according to available technology and logistic features could be considered. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the exposure threshold remains controversial for translation into clinical effects. Previous differing publications have described either none or developing of detrimental effects after delivering a 0.5 Gy mean dose to the heart [35, 36] . Additionally, the risk of developing secondary cancers after LD-RT from previously reported benign entity treatments has been estimated to be below 1% [37] . Weighing up all these considerations and due to the rapid deterioration of these patients' status, prioritizing the management of the acute event, in order to potentially save the patient's live, is of major relevance.The compassionate treatment offered to the patient and the possible related response in terms of avoiding invasive maneuvers showed clinical improvement from day 2 after RT. This is also correlated with the observed continuous decrease in inflammatory markers. The initial elevation of serum markers has been described previously, potentially establishing the first downregulator signal and starting point for further inflammatory control; however, this should be further elucidated [38] . Similarly, the observed mild lymphopenia could be derived from the same phenomenon, although the development of COVID-19 has also been reported as a direct cause of this alteration, as for other viral infections [39] . Despite this, the case's evolution time would indirectly point to a positive effect of RT, due to the usual status worsening of patients after the seventh day. However, no conclusions but only hypothesisgenerating premises could be drawn.Close follow-up, ICU management including continuous ABG, and imaging control are mandatory. The intervention decision should be taken on a multidisciplinary basis and with express consent of the patients, balancing potential benefits and risks, preferably encompassed by a prospective clinical protocol. Ethical concerns are raised as well, due to the rapid deterioration of patients' status and the need for early decision-making. In desperate need of positive outcomes, errors from selecting inadequate treatment should not be repeated. Recently published evidence from different groups has demonstrated not only the lack of effectiveness but also the risks of employing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .Despite the previously presented evidence and pathophysiological plausibility, and on the basis of this novel situation, no agent-specific clinical data addressing the possible long-term secondary effects of treating this particular K group of patients are available, nor is it known if a synergy between the COVID-19-induced CRS and RT could impact the incidence of long-term secondary events. This may be taken into consideration when prescribing RT in this setting.The importance and responsibility of establishing properly designed study protocols to clarify this hypothesis falls to the multidisciplinary team and joint efforts from leading scientific societies. Consensus for patient management and health personnel protection is urgently needed. Results from ongoing trials (NCT04377477, NCT04380818) will elucidate the effectiveness of this therapeutic tool regarding improvement in Pa/FiO2 parameters, hospital stay, and ICU admission rates. Assessing rates of invasive management requirements after RT as a specific endpoint is also recommended.Radiotherapy arises as a promising option for COVID-19 pneumonia management. Prospective data from a larger cohort of patients are needed to confirm the safety profile and effectiveness of this approach in this specific group of patients.Funding Open Access funding provided by Projekt DEAL.Conflict of interest R.

Esta realidad pone en riesgo el seguimiento de patologías crónicas como las demencias. Asimismo, la atención de las posibles complicaciones neuropsiquiátricas relacionadas al aislamiento preventivo de la población (cuarentena), que en el caso de Argentina, se considera la más prolongada la Latinoamérica. El objetivo del presente trabajo es determinar la frecuencia de las distintas modalidades de consulta médica en relación a la patología neurocognitiva del paciente y las variables predictoras de consulta desde el inicio de la cuarentena.Métodos: Estudio descriptivo observacional, transversal basado en la recolección de datos a través de una encuesta.Resultados: 324 participantes: 165(50.9%) realizaron al menos una consulta médica.Frecuencia de modalidades de consulta: Teléfono: 109(33,6%), correo electrónico: 62 (19,1%), videoconsulta: 30(9,3%), servicio de emergencias: 23(7,1%). Predictores de consulta: Clinical Dementia Rating≥1 (p<0,001), diagnóstico: Alzheimer (p=0,017).

As a result of this situation, the follow-up of such chronic diseases as dementia may be at risk. Similarly, neuropsychiatric complications related to lockdown measures may also be neglected;Argentina's lockdown has been the longest implemented in Latin America. This study aims to determine the frequency of the different types of medical consultations for neurocognitive disorders and the predictors for requiring consultation since the beginning of the lockdown.Methods: We performed a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study based on data collected through an online survey.Results: Data were collected on 324 participants, with 165 (50.9%) having had at least one medical consultation. Consultations were held by telephone in 109 cases (33.6%), by e-mail in 62 (19.1%), by video conference in 30 (9.3%), and at the emergency department in 23 (7.1%). Predictors of requiring consultation were Clinical Dementia Rating scores ≥ 1 (P < .001) and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (P = .017). Higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores were found in the group of respondents who did require medical consultation (P < .001), but no significant differences were found between groups for Zarit Burden Interview scores.Conclusion: We identified a high prevalence of behavioural disorders and caregiver burden during lockdown. Nevertheless, only 50% of respondents had sought medical consultation (by telephone or email in 52.7% of cases). Care of people with dementia must be emphasised, guaranteeing follow-up of these patients.Keywords: COVID-19; pandemic; public health; dementia; neuropsychiatric symptoms; caregiver burden.Varios países del mundo están sufriendo una grave carga en sus sistemas de salud como consecuencia de la pandemia COVID-19 relacionada al nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ha resultado en un sistema de atención de salud drásticamente nuevo, que no está exento de dificultades para algunos de nuestros pacientes de edad avanzada, muchos de los cuales se encuentran solos en sus hogares sin el adecuado acceso a la tecnología.Lo mencionado previamente, pone en evidencia grandes problemas, en primer lugar la existencia de un elevado riesgo de interrupción del seguimiento de los pacientes con demencia, población considerada de mayor riesgo para COVID 19, y en segundo lugar, la dificultad para acceder a la atención ante nuevas demandas por cambios cognitivos o conductuales como consecuencia de la pandemia, el confinamiento prolongado o el estrés. 2 El objetivo primario:Determinar la frecuencia de las distintas modalidades de consulta médica en relación a la patología neurocognitiva del paciente, realizada por los cuidadores desde el inicio de la cuarentena.Objetivos secundarios:1. Definir las variables asociadas a la realización de la consulta médica durante la cuarentena, como también la consulta del cuidador a una guardia de emergencia (edad, sexo, escolaridad, grado de sobrecarga mediante la escala de carga del cuidador de Zarit 9 y del paciente (tipo de demencia, estadío evolutivo medido por la escala Clinical Dementia Rating-CDR 10 y determinar las manifestaciones conductuales evaluadas por el Inventario de síntomas neuropsiquiátricos-NPI 11 ).2. Definir las variables asociadas a la realización de la consulta médica por la modalidad de videoconsulta: (edad y escolaridad). vs 53 (RIC 28) de los que no consultaron (p=0,9).*U de Mann Whitney. 6: Según la edad, el sexo y la escolaridad del cuidador: No hubo diferencias significativas por t-Test.1: Edad del cuidador: La media de edad de los cuidadores que realizaron videoconsultas fue menor en comparación a la edad media de los cuidadores que utilizaron otras modalidades de consulta (p=0.03).2: La escolaridad del cuidador: No hubo diferencias significativas por t-Test.El brote de la enfermedad por coronavirus de diciembre de 2019 ha puesto a la población de varios países en aislamiento preventivo (cuarentena) y está siendo un verdadero reto para los sistemas sanitarios de todo el mundo 13 , en especial para las regiones de Latinoamérica. La pandemia llegó a Argentina el 3 de marzo con la identificación del primer paciente, 64 días después del reporte del primer caso en China.Desde entonces, el gobierno argentino tomó varias medidas para mitigar el impacto y el 20 de marzo, instaló la cuarentena preventiva y obligatoria que, con sus diferentes fases, rige hasta el día de la fecha en el área metropolitana de Buenos Aires (AMBA), donde viven 15 millones de personas y se registra un alto nivel de contagios 8 . En este contexto, los hallazgos de nuestro estudio, reflejan una significativa prevalencia de síntomas neuropsiquiátricos en la población encuestada en cuarentena, tanto en los pacientes, como en sus cuidadores en la región del AMBA. Más del 90 % de los pacientes presentó alteraciones neuropsiquiátricas. El 63% de los cuidadores manifestaron signos de sobrecarga y cerca de la mitad sobrecarga severa. Sin embargo, a pesar de la alta prevalencia de las alteraciones conductuales, sólo el 50% de los encuestados, pudo realizar al menos una consulta médica durante este periodo.Cabe destacar, que la mayoría de los estudios de la literatura evidencian impactos psicológicos negativos relacionados a la cuarentena y algunos sugieren que los mismos podrían ser extensos, sustanciales e incluso duraderos en relación a la extensión del confinamiento 12 . Sin embargo, estas investigaciones se han basado en estudios Page 9 of 15 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f poblacionales y hasta el momento la literatura no cuenta con investigaciones sobre los efectos de la cuarentena en la población de adultos mayores con deterioro cognitivo y demencia. Paola Barbarino, directora ejecutiva de ADI (Alzheimer´s Disease International) afirmó que cuando los países se apresuraron en establecer la cuarentena en la población, olvidaron las necesidades de las personas más vulnerables, exacerbando sentimientos de ansiedad y soledad en los pacientes 14 .En relación a la modalidad de las consultas médicas, pudimos observar que los cuidadores mayores de 60 años, utilizaron preferentemente llamados telefónicos y correo electrónico y solo el 9% pudo usar el sistema de videoconsulta; esta pequeña proporción correspondió a cuidadores menores de 60 años.Las consultas médicas se caracterizaron por la presencia de pacientes con demencia (CDR≥1), de tipo Alzheimer, con predominancia de alucinaciones, depresión, ansiedad, irritabilidad, alteraciones del sueño, con puntajes de NPI, más elevados que aquellas personas que no consultaron.Por otro lado, los pacientes que realizaron una consulta directamente a una emergencia médica (guardia) se caracterizaron por presentar puntajes más altos de NPI y mayor prevalencia de síntomas disruptivos como tendencia a realizar actividades motoras repetitivas sin propósito y alucinaciones.Argentina en estos momentos, atraviesa una etapa crítica de la pandemia con un notable incremento en el número de casos, de pacientes fallecidos por COVID 19 y de efectos secundarios relacionados a la pandemia y a la cuarentena prolongada. Resulta necesario, que la población mayor con patología cognitiva y demencia, de alto riesgo para COVID 19, pueda continuar su tratamiento y acceder a algún tipo de consulta, más allá de la clásica modalidad presencial. La alta prevalencia de alteraciones en la salud mental de nuestros adultos mayores, debería ser un tema prioritario en la agenda sanitaria de la región 2 . Debemos considerar que la mitad de los pacientes encuestados y sus cuidadores confinados en cuarentena, no realizaron consulta alguna, aun teniendo una elevada prevalencia de síntomas neuropsiquiátricos. La brecha digital y la escasez de recursos tecnológicos en los hogares, podrían ser elementos de exclusión social en esta población a la hora de acceder a modalidades de consultas más complejas durante este contexto crítico. 15 , deberían replantear su funcionamiento, para asegurar que las personas con trastornos neurológicos puedan recibir la atención necesaria, brindando protocolos de seguridad acordes y ofreciendo diferentes modalidades de consulta médica. Tenemos que considerar que la telemedicina por videoconsulta podría resultar útil tal vez sólo a un número reducido de pacientes adultos mayores. Nosotros proponemos considerar la modalidad telefónica y por correo electrónico como herramientas sencillas y de fácil acceso para realizar el seguimiento de esta población durante la pandemia y poder así, determinar algún tipo de intervención temprana en base a la clínica del paciente, mientras se programa la implementación de sistemas telemedicina de mayor complejidad. CONCLUSION El manejo de la salud pública implica decisiones inmediatas y cambios profundos relacionados con estas nuevas situaciones, pero no se debe descuidar el manejo general de todos los pacientes, como así subestimar el impacto en la esfera emocional que provoca la pandemia y la cuarentena (medida de eficacia probada), en esta población de pacientes y su entorno.La investigación en tiempos de COVID-19 nos debe aportar conocimiento de calidad que redunde en una mejor atención de la salud de los ciudadanos en estos momentos de crisis.Bibliografía",Argentina,abstract,2020-08-03,8
969fbafa8e2fb7cc333926b7b08e1d3a4b981e3e,Data Mining Approach to Analyze Covid19 Dataset of Brazilian Patients,"The outbreak of Coronavirus(Covid19) started with first cases on December 2019, in Wuhan(China). The first reported case [1] in South America was in Brazil on 26 February 2020, in São Paulo city. The strategy to stop the infections in the country was a partial lockdown to avoid the propagation of the virus.On 28 January 2020, Ministry of Health of Brazil reported a suspected case of Covid19 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, recently one student returned from China [2] , [3] . The same day were reported two suspected cases in Porto Alegre and Curitiba [4] . The first confirmed COVID-19 case [5] were reported in Brazil, a man of 61-year-old who returned from Italy. The patient was tested in Israelita Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo state. On 14 May [6] , more than 200 000 cases were confirmmed, this number double during the first days of May.Until August 11, the numbers of Brazil 1 are: total of 3,112,393 cases, with an increasing rate of new cases of 44,255(+1.4%) and a total of 2,243,124 recovered cases.Nowdays, many scientists are working around coronavirus covid19, but searching for conducted studies in South America, there is only a few number. After a searching in IEEX Xplorer using coronavirus, covid19 terms, one paper with Brazilian Affiliation is found [7] , related to data augmentation for covid19 detection. Considering a preprint repository related to Medicine(Medxriv), using terms: covid19, coronavirus, data mining more than 50 papers are found.The table 1 presents the top 10 results of MedxRiv query. Four of this papers is a conducted study for South America countries and there is any work analyzing Brazilian context. In spite of, there is 4 papers with Brazilian Affiliation. Considering, the previous evidence it is necessary to conduct studies with Brazilian data, then the initiative of Fapesp is valuable to foster research on covid19 topic. The actual paper uses Data Mining Approach to perform an exploratory analysis of the dataset of Brazilian patients of Sao Paulo State. The methodology to explore data is presented in Section 2, the experiments and results in Section 3. Conclusion states in Section 4, final recommendations and future work are presenten in Section 5, 6.The conducted work follows a methodology inspired in CRISP-DM [18] . The image 1 presents the flow between the phases of the exploration. This step is related how to deal with data before of generate graphics for analysis.-If a specific variable must be numerical, but there is string values, so it is discarded -If null values are found, a discarding process must be considered.-If range reference for one exam, analytes is null then the analysis is not possible.Using clean data is possible to answer some questions related to age distribution, sex distribution, distribution of results to detect anomalies or outliers. The questions can require a kind of specific graphic to suppot analysis.Considering distribution of few classes, a pie chart is useful to check proportions, subsection 3.3, 3.8 . For age distribution, bar plot can show how is the distribution, see subsection 3.4, 3.5, 3.6. The analysis is dozen of values can be supported for boxplot graphics, in subsection 3.9, 3.10.This subsection present some graphics to describe data and let posterior analysis, besides the requeriment of some graphics related to distribution, i.e. bar plot, boxplot.Description of datasets The Figure 2 is presented with counting values, unique values, top for each field. The name of columns were transformed to lowercase to have an uniform name of fields. Fleury has the highest de exame(722), de analito(978). SL has de exame(478), de analito(652). Therefore, numer of de valor referencia are related. -SL Hospital presentes NaN(Not a number) values, then it is possible find NaN values in the datasets.Female population is slightly bigger than male population in Einstein, Fleury but SL presents male population bigger for 0.05%(29 people), see Fig. 3 .The graphic Fig. 5 presents the number of collect exams per day and month, Einstein presents an increasing number from January to June, Flury a decreasing from January to April but a peak on May, June. Besides, SL Hospital has an increasing from February to June.To answer what were the most frequent exams during the month of each dataset, graphic Fig. 7 presents the 20 most frequents.-Three datasets has blood count exam on the top of each month.-Only Fleury has exams related to covid19 detection on April, May, June on the top 5.Einstein and Fleury presents analytes related to covid19, i.e. resultado covid19, Covid19 deteccao por PCR, Covid19 material and more. Again, Fleury presents a variety of names for analytes related to covid19. And SL Hospital does not have any in the top 20.Considering analytes related to covid19, graphic 8 presents the number of detected/not detected during the months for Hospital Einstein. Fleury and SL do not have an standardized outputs of covid19 exams, therefore is not possible to generate the graphics yet. Considering top 14 of de analito and de resultado, the graphic Fig. 9 is presenting boxplot of the values of Einstein Hospital. It is necessary not to consider qualitative values, then only numerical values were used to build the plot. Analyzing the graphic is remarkable to many outliers in many of analytes, then a cleaning process is necessary.The next graphics are created splitting Einstein dataset for genre. There is presence of NaN values in the reference value then these analytes are discared for the graphic, table 3.10 presents the no valid de analito, it is a total of 8. Plotting the distribution (Fig. 12) for 30 most frequents analytes for men. The next graphic 13 present the distribution for positive cases of covid19. In the two previous images 12 and 13 is possible to observe a concentration of outliers in the sides of the normal distribution, i.e. TGO, TGP, Creatinina, Neutrófilos #, Ureia.Coronavirus pandemic is active in the world, scientist are working to understand how to stop the virus, many areas are studying the covid19 impact in Heath, Economy therefore datasets related to patients are useful and important. Fapesp initiative to gather university and hospital is remarkable because it can foster research on the topic. Real world datasets are not clean or ready for Data Mining or Data Science tasks then an exploratory phase is mandatory to see if data can be representative or useful to answer questions. Then, many cleaning steps were necessary to generate the final dataset and graphic, besides this cleaning step reduced the available dataset of men in 20%, with a maximum value of 75.30% for Magnesium Analyte, then it is possible a meanignful reduction of data is a cleaning task is performed.Finally, share the process of analysis is useful for researchers interested to analyze with this dataset, so it can save time, effort to future research.For researchers interested to work with these datasets, consider:-Check if range of dates for each dataset to know if this data is useful for your study. -Sirio-Libanes Hospital has some issues related to encoding, this is the smallest dataset then you must analyze if it useful for analysis and search for the problems to fix them. -Only Einsteing dataset has a standardized output for covid19 exams: detected or not detected. If you are from Computer Science or related field, this is better for your study. Because, Fleury has a variety of outputs, therefore is necessary the presence or advice of one person related to Medicine to explain you the different values. -If you want to automatize filtering considering reference range of values, remember there are many for many analytes, then the suggestion is check this manually to check if it is possible to code the process.For further work, a crossing of data is proposed to improve the analysis considering other variables, i.e. social-economic data, previous existence of health issues related to patients, considering data of other hospital to enhance the study. By the other hand, a deep analysis will be performed with this new cleaned dataset.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-15,8
b7cb127f95feee44495181b6a017feac1f3ce24b,,"D uring orthodontic treatment (which usually lasts between 2 and 3 years), patients are required to wear a variety of removable and fixed appliances, and about 85% of patients experience some kind of urgency during their treatment period. 1 Emergencies generally involve risk of death and urgencies do not. 2 However, in dentistry, any dental problem that requires immediate treatment to save a tooth, stop ongoing tissue bleeding, or alleviate severe pain is considered a dental emergency. Orthodontic emergencies are rare, but orthodontic urgencies-problems arising from orthodontic appliances or accessories, in which a timely additional appointment is required-are not uncommon. 3 In Brazil, according to the Code of Consumer Protection and Defense, the dentist is considered a supplier of services and has the obligation to be well-prepared to offer a service to the patient. Orthodontists are responsible (regardless of the existence of guilt) for compensating any damage caused to the consumer related to poor service or insufficient or inadequate information on the provision and risks of these services. 4 With the pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in the world, specific guidelines are constantly published and updated by the World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, National Ministries of Health, and national councils for each professional area. Routine dental care was suspended in many countries as governments sought to halt the spread of COVID-19. 5, 6 In Brazil, the Federal Council of Dentistry presented guidelines for evaluating dental urgency and emergency during the coronavirus pandemic. 7 Dentists were advised to manage urgencies and emergencies only; however, the professional can decide to maintain the opening of dental offices or to care only for patients with urgencies or emergencies.In orthodontics, urgencies-such as breakage of appliances, brackets, or tubes-are not life-threatening, but it is advised to resolve them quickly or to avoid prolonging the treatment time, decreasing the patient motivation, and losing the patients' confidence in the orthodontist. 3 Appropriate handling of orthodontic urgencies will provide relief from pain and distress for the patient. 8, 9 All dental professionals are feeling a moral duty to reduce routine care for fear of spreading the COVID-19 disease among patients, their families, and community, but are concerned about the financial consequences. 5 The objective of this survey was to evaluate the most common orthodontic urgencies and emergencies during the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil and to assess how orthodontists are dealing with patients and the challenges of the current scenario.This study was approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the UNING A University Center (protocol no. 4.002.200) and all subjects signed informed consent to participate in the survey.Sample size calculation was performed with a confidence interval of 95% and a margin of error of 5%. Considering that the population of orthodontists in Brazil is approximately 28,000, 10 conducting a questionnaire would require at least 379 subjects and/or answers.A Google Forms questionnaire was sent to about 1000 orthodontists from Brazil, most of whom graduated from 4 universities in various cities, through WhatsApp Messenger App (WhatsApp, Inc, Menlo Park, Calif). The orthodontists were not identified.The questionnaire was constructed on the basis of what we intended to report, but this was not a validated questionnaire because we did not intend to evaluate a health condition or quality of life. We administered a survey, with several questions that allowed us to evaluate the most common urgencies and/or emergencies in orthodontic practice during the coronavirus pandemic, to assess how orthodontists are dealing with patients and how are they concerned with the orthodontic treatment of their patients and with the financial impact of the pandemic in their dental offices.Questions involved personal information as age, sex, degree of orthodontic graduation, and time of experience with orthodontics. Questions regarding the dental office and appointments during the pandemic, type of emergency care provided, type of appliance related to the emergencies, and others were included in the survey. The levels of concern about the impact of the pandemic on patients' orthodontic treatments and regarding the financial impact on the dental office were evaluated with a 0-10 point numerical rating scale. 11, 12 The respondents answered the questions regarding only their solo practices.The questions and potential responses are listed below: The questionnaire was available for responses for 48 hours (May 1-3, 2020). Responses were obtained and tabulated in Excel, for statistical analysis.Descriptive statistics were performed with percentages. Comparisons of specialists 3 MScs 3 PhDs and females 3 males were performed with chi-square tests, 1-way analysis of variance, and Tukey tests and independent t tests.Statistical analysis was performed with Statistica software (version 10.0; Statsoft, Tulsa, Okla), and results were considered significant at P \0.05.Over 48 hours (May 1-3, 2020) Most orthodontists (66.8%) are handling only emergencies and/or urgencies, 19% maintained the routine orthodontic appointments, and 14.2% closed the dental offices and are not working since the quarantine was recommended.Regarding the type of appliances that caused most urgencies in orthodontics, 74.7% of the orthodontists mentioned urgencies related to preadjusted stainless steel fixed appliances, followed by esthetic fixed appliances (29.6%), orthodontic accessories (16.7%), fixed retentions (15.9%), fixed expansion appliances (15.4%), and self-ligating appliances (13.7%). Removable retainers and orthopedic removable appliances, fixed functional appliances, and aligners were mentioned by \10% of the orthodontists (Fig 1) .The most frequent urgency that resulted in patients requesting additional orthodontic care was bracket breakage (67.6%), followed by archwire breakage causing injury (60.5%), and breakage of molar tubes and/or bands (44.1%). The other urgencies were mentioned by\20% of the orthodontists and included the following: metallic ligature causing injuries (19.1%), loss of elastic ligatures (15.8%), breakage of fixed retention (15.3%), breakage of fixed expansion appliances (13.1%), poor oral hygiene problems (12.8%), breakage of removable appliances or aligners (8.7%), and urgencies related to tooth movement (6.8%) (Fig 2) . Only 31.3% reported urgencies related to orthodontic accessories.The majority of patients got in touch using the professional WhatsApp messenger (83.8%). Other ways in which patients came into contact to schedule additional urgent appointments were personal WhatsApp, telephone, or dental office webpage.Almost half of the orthodontists (47.6%) gave their employees a vacation, 27.8% of the staff was at home office, 12.7% were suspended from their activities by government assistance, and 11.9% continued to work in the dental offices routinely. Only 31.1% of the orthodontists provided emergency care accompanied by their staff.The mean level of concern of orthodontists related to the impact of the pandemic in the orthodontic treatment of their patients was 7.70 (standard deviation, 2.22). The mean level of concern about the financial impact of the pandemic on the dental office was 8.94 (standard deviation, 1.63).More specialists maintained routine orthodontic care during the pandemic related to the MScs and PhDs. The level of concern of the orthodontists regarding the orthodontic treatment of their patients was similar among specialists, MScs, and PhDs. However, the level of concern about the financial impact of the pandemic was significantly greater for specialists and MScs than for PhDs.It is known that effective management of orthodontic appliance problems should minimize disruption to the normal course of treatment and prevent future problems from occurring. 13 In the current worldwide situation, stay-at-home orders have been proposed in several countries, and orthodontists were prevented from performing face-to-face conventional orthodontic care. However, some urgencies can cause a significant delay in treatment progress, besides somehow injuring the patient. In a recently published article, patients' greatest concern was the delay in the end of orthodontic treatment. 14 There were more female than male respondents, reflecting the proportion of registered orthodontics specialists in Brazil. 10 The percentage of female orthodontists continued to rise, reflecting the recent trend in postgraduate education. 15 In addition, women are more willing to participate in researches. [16] [17] [18] Most participants were aged 21-40 years. Because the questionnaire was sent through WhatsApp, the youngest respondents represented the majority of participants. In addition, several studies that included a survey of dental professionals showed the same age pattern of respondents. [19] [20] [21] Most respondents who were specialists were younger and had \10 years of practice, whereas MScs and PhDs were older and more experienced. Obtaining MSc and PhD degrees takes on average 5-6 years in Brazil, plus 3 years to previously obtain a specialist degree. Thus, because obtaining the degrees is time-consuming, the more educated the orthodontist, the older they will be.Most orthodontists were handling only emergencies and/or urgencies. A systematic review showed that some knowledge gaps existed among dental professionals regarding emerging infections that affect the respiratory tract. 22 Amid so much information, some dental professionals followed the stay-at-home recommendations of their cities and/or states, delaying nonurgent care, others considered dentistry as an essential activity and continued their care normally, and some only provided care which could not be delayed.Preadjusted stainless steel fixed appliances were responsible for most of the urgencies reported by orthodontists, followed by esthetic fixed appliances (Fig 1) . Preadjusted appliances are by far the most popular fixed appliances during the past 3 decades, 23 and stainless steel brackets remained the most common worldwide, followed by ceramic brackets. 15, 24 Keim et al 15 showed that overall, 63% of the clinicians use some kind of self-ligating system, and \20% use esthetic brackets. Thus, the appliances that caused the emergencies followed the trends of the most used appliances. Some types of active orthodontic mechanics, active expanders, and functional appliances need closer and frequent monitoring because they can cause problems with continuous unsupervised use. However, in the present survey, they were not reported by orthodontists as frequent urgencies. Maybe because, when the survey was carried out, stay-at-home orders had been recommended for \2 months, so some specific orthodontic urgencies, related to tooth movement and some active appliances without supervision, did not have enough time to occur.Unfortunately, orthodontic appliance breakage does occur, despite the clinicians giving clear and concise instructions to the patients and their parents. 8, 9 The most frequent orthodontic urgency found was bracket breakage (Fig 2) , which is also the most reported in the orthodontic literature. 25, 26 Archwires that needed to be retied or replaced were also reported (Fig 2) . Jones et al 25 reported that only 13% of the total urgencies were related to archwire problems. This finding may be due to the study being a University-based survey, and the patient access to the urgency service was not as easy as talking directly to the dental office team. Moreover, certain teeth have a greater predilection for failure than others, with potential reasons including increased masticatory loading, poor oral hygiene, and inappropriate diet. 8, 9, 27 WhatsApp messages were the most common way of communication between the patient and the dental team (83.8%). Recent studies showed that smartphones provided fast and clear access to electronically mailed digital images and allowed professionals free mobility, not restricted by the constraints of a desktop personal computer. In this context, it is important to consider remote monitoring and teleorthodontics concepts and applications, such as the remote provision of orthodontic care, advice, or treatment using information technology. 28 Many of the urgencies reported by the orthodontists in this survey could be solved with remote consultations without the need of a scheduled urgency appointment, by teleorthodontics. 28 However, in Brazil, this type of attendance was not approved by the Federal Council of Dentistry when the survey was performed. This regulation of the distance dental practice, mediated by technologies, in Brazil was approved on June 4, 2020. 29 Brazilian orthodontists were more concerned with the financial impact of the pandemic on the dental office (8.94) than in relation to orthodontic treatment of their patients (7.70). It must be argued that financial worry overrides the concern with the treatment itself because the nature of the orthodontic treatment allows spaced appointments, and also because urgency appointments are allowed. Furthermore, we are facing a health and economic crisis of unprecedented proportions, because pandemics often result in global recessions. 30 The paralysis of the economic activities in a developing country such as Brazil has devastating effects that will cause a longlasting recession. Unlike developed countries, such as the United States, where dentists have had significant government assistance, like paycheck protection program and loan forgiveness, here in Brazil, we do not. Upon our restart, our dental offices are reflecting the financial recession that all business offices in Brazil have been showing. Thus, it was expected that the financial impact of the pandemic would be of great concern to orthodontists and dentists in Brazil. Because of the measures enacted to stop the spread of this pandemic, a sharp decrease in consumer and business spending until the end of 2020 is expected. 31 In addition, the orthodontists' financial concern relies on the fear of not receiving payment from patients and the overhead costs to provide a safer working environment to the patients, staff, and themselves. This outcome will potentially reduce the orthodontist profit margin even further. 32 Recent surveys showed similar results, indicating that dentists fear economic losses and nonpayment of salaries to their employees, expecting a financial loss of .70% amid the COVID-19 outbreak. [33] [34] [35] However, in developed countries where professionals have government assistance and the economy is strong, the concerns of orthodontists are probably different from those found in the present survey.Finally, orthodontists, who had PhD degrees were less concerned with financial impact than specialists and MScs. PhD respondents were older, most likely with an already consolidated career, including financial reserve, in addition to possibly having another job as a university professor, or teaching in continuing education courses, each of which guarantees a continuous income during the crisis. 36 The main objective of this survey was to identify the most common orthodontic urgencies that orthodontists faced during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients will need urgency orthodontic conventional care, 14 but some of these urgencies certainly can be avoided with high-quality remote care, and orthodontists should be able to provide it to their patients. 37 Breakage of brackets, archwires, or tubes and/or bands were the most common causes of urgency and/ or emergency appointments during the early stage of the pandemic. The level of concern of orthodontists regarding the orthodontic treatment of their patients was similar among specialists, MScs, and PhDs. The level of concern about the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly greater for specialists and MScs than for PhDs.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-20,8
0eb676ab2b98b90645b9eefa0d42690275f67b64,Journal Pre-proof High neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic marker in COVID-19 patients Opinion High neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic marker in COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the world. During hospitalization, common clinical features include acute respiratory infection, fever, pneumonia, cough, fatigue, and inflammation [1, 2] . In addition, increased plasma levels of inflammatory cytokine have been found in patients with COVID-19 [1, 3] . The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to serve as a reliable indicator of severe COVID-19 [1, 4] .Additionally, critically ill COVID-19 patients show higher NLR when compared with non-ICU patients [5] . Xia et al. 2020 [2] found that approximately 80% of SARS-CoV-2 patients infected with bilateral pulmonary involvement have increased NLR.A Chinese study aimed at assessing the NLR cut-off value for progression of disease reported that NLR>3.3 is independently associated with more severe COVID-19 (HR: 2.46, 95% CI 1.98-4.56). Furthermore, NLR>3.3 was associated with lower survival compared with NLR <3.3 (NLR >3.3: 6.3 days and NLR <3.3: 13.5 days) [6] . Another Chinese study performed in Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine included 32 moderate and 31 severe cases and found an optimal cut-off of NLR >4.7 is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 [7] . Afterward, a European study conducted in Italy showed that severe patients are also older and had higher NLR compared with nonsevere patients, suggesting that NLR may be a useful marker to early screening of COVID-19 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patients [8] . Surprisingly, the risk of in-hospital mortality is 8% higher for each unit increase of NLR (OR: 1.08, 95%CI: 1.01-1.14), and patients from tertile 3 (NLR 4.85-88.09) have a 15-fold higher risk of death than patients from tertile 1 (NLR 0.54-2.21) [9] .In addition, several chronic diseases may influence the circulating leukocyte count, and thus NLR. Qin et al. reported in a cohort study that 44% of COVID-19-infected patients had at least one comorbidity, mainly hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [10] . On the other hand, low NLR has already been associated with lower risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic diseases, such as renal disease and diabetes [11] . Likewise, in our previous study it was observed that a high NLR is associated with increased risk of sarcopenia in hospitalized cancer patients [12] , as another group had found an inverse correlation between NLR and the Mini Nutrition Assessment, which was also an independent factor in predicting malnutrition in elderly subjects [13] .Given that patients with chronic diseases may progress from mild symptoms to severe disease, NLR should be monitored starting from hospitalization, because high NLR concentrations potentiate the symptoms' severity and thus the mortality rate of COVID-19 ( Fig. 1) .As strengths of this manuscript, we highlight that NLR is an easily measurable and non-costly marker of systemic inflammation for the hospital clinical routine. However, as a limitation, we emphasize that recently two COVID-19-specific and more accurate prognostic scores have been described. First, the COVID-GRAM [14] is able to predict a risk score based on outcomes of COVID-10-infected patients during the hospital admission, which included ten variables, namely: chest radiographic abnormality; age; dyspnea; haemoptysis; unconsciousness; cancer history; number of comorbidities; lactate dehydrogenase; direct bilirubin; and NLR. Second, the C: co-morbidity, A: age, L: lymphocyte count, L: lactate J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f dehydrogenase (CALL) score involves four items and was aimed at predicting the clinical worsening, but not the progression of severe cases [15] .Indeed, NLR is a low-cost marker compared to cytokines, since in the clinical routine it is common to use the blood count. Therefore, NLR is a useful systemic inflammation marker for screening COVID-19-infected patients and may be used as a useful indicator of a poor prognosis at the initial moment of hospitalization. In addition, we highlight the importance of further investigations to incorporate the assessment of the nutritional status of these patients.None declared.GDP, MCMDV, and AL wrote the article and approved the final version of this manuscript.No funding was received for this work.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-14,8
8000d0f325af91eb4effa5c5ec555c36ba5f8dfa,"Human development, social vulnerability and COVID-19 in Brazil: a study of the social determinants of health","In January 2020, a new coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] . On March 11, 2020 the WHO declared a pandemic [2] .As of April 11, 2020, there were more than 4.1 million cases and 284 000 deaths due to the disease worldwide [3] . The countries with the highest number of cases are the USA (1 300 000), Spain (224 000), and the United Kingdom (224 000). In number of deaths, the USA (79 000), the United Kingdom (32 000), and Italy (30 000) have the highest numbers [3] .In Brazil, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on February 26, 2020, and the first death was confirmed on March 17, in São Paulo, the country's most populous metropolis, with approximately 12 million inhabitants [4] . The disease spread rapidly to other Brazilian states. On April 11, 2020 the country had 163 000 cases and 11 000 deaths [3] , with confirmed cases in all 26 states and in the Federal District.In all countries, but especially in those of low and middle incomes, there is concern regarding the effects of the pandemic on the most impoverished populations [5, 6] . These population groups have difficulties in adopting preventive measures (such as social isolation); they are exposed to a context of pragmatic vulnerability that increases the risk of contamination, and, if infection occurs, they have limited access to health services. This is a complex, dynamic context that requires special attention from governments.All of these conditions in which people live and which express, to a greater or lesser extent, the risk of illness, are called social determinants of health (SDH) [7] . The identification of the SDH that influence the dynamics of COVID-19 in Brazil is of fundamental importance for dealing with the pandemic and its consequences, thus contributing to the definition of mitigating public policies.In Brazil, the Human Development Atlas and the Social Vulnerability Atlas are two important sources for studying the SDH, as they help to understand the context of the population's living conditions and thus supporting decision making. These include the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) with their respective dimensions. The MHDI considers development as ""the capacity to expand the freedoms of individuals, in relation to their capacities and opportunities"" [8] . Although advances have been observed, especially in the last three decades, the MHDI of 1/4 of Brazilian municipalities are considered low or very low. The SVI, on the other hand, measures ""the access, absence, or insufficiency of some assets in areas of Brazilian territory, which should, in principle, be available to every citizen, due to the action of the State."" About 1/3 of the Brazilian municipalities are classified as having high or very high vulnerability [9] .The MHDI ranges from 0 to 1; the closer to 1, the greater the degree of human development in the municipality. Municipalities are classified into the following five development strata: very low (MHDI 0 to 0.499), low (MHDI 0.500 to 0.599), medium (MHDI 0.600 to 0.699), high (MHDI 0.700 to 0.799), and very high (MHDI 0.800 to 1) [8] . The SVI varies from 0 to 1; the closer to 1, the greater the degree of social vulnerability in the municipality. Municipalities are classified into the following five strata of vulnerability: very low (SVI 0 to 0.200), low (SVI 0.201 to 3.00), medium (SVI 0.301 to 0.400), high (SVI 0.401 to 0.500) and very High (SVI > 0.501) [9] .Based on this and on the need to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and the population's living conditions, this study aimed to identify the SDH related to the incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates of COVID-19 in Brazil, in 2020.This is an ecological study involving all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil until May 6, 2020. In this study, the following three epidemiological indicators were adopted as dependent variables: i) COVID-19 incidence rate/100 000 inhabitants, ii) COVID-19 mortality rate/1 million inhabitants, and iii) COVID- 19 In addition to these, the following 16 variables that make up the Social Vulnerability Atlas and that express the population's living conditions were included: 1) illiteracy rate of people 18 years or elder, 2) illiteracy rate of people 25 years or elder, 3) income per capita of those vulnerable to poverty, 4) percentage of income from work, 5) Gini Index, 6) percentage of employees 18 years or older with a formal contract, 7) percentage of employees 18 years or elder without a formal contract, 8) percentage of public sector workers 18 years or elder, 9) percentage of self-employed workers 18 years or elder, 10) percentage of employers 18 years or elder, 11) degree of formality of the employed 18 years or elder, 12) percentage of employed persons 18 years or elder who have completed primary education, 13) percentage of employed persons 18 years or elder who have completed secondary education, 14) percentage of employed persons 18 years or older who have completed higher education, 15) average income of employed persons 18 years or elder, and 16) percentage of employed persons 18 years or elder without income.After data extraction, the variables were grouped into 10 blocks for statistical treatment. This organization aimed to reduce multicollinearity, which could compromise the quality of the study results. Data analysis was subsequently divided into the following four stages:Step 1-Exploratory analysis of epidemiological indicators according to population size and human development and social vulnerability: In this stage, municipalities were grouped according to population size and strata of human development and social vulnerability. Epidemiological indicators were subsequently calculated for each stratum, and exploratory analysis of rates was carried out.Step 2-Analysis of bivariate spatial correlation: Moran bivariate statistics and pseudo-significance test were used to assess the correlation between the incidence rate and the independent variables. The Moran index ranges from − 1 to + 1. Values close to zero indicating spatial randomness; positive values suggest positive spatial autocorrelation, and negative values suggest negative spatial autocorrelation [10] . Only variables with statistical significance (P < 0.05) in this stage were included in the next one. It should be noted that, in stages 2 and 3, only incidence rate was analyzed, given that only 821 municipalities (14.7%) had registered deaths on the date of collection.Step 3 Multivariate analysis and spatial association:The association between the COVID-19 incidence rate and the independent variables was initially tested with the use of classical multivariate regression (ordinary least squares [OLS]). The model residues were submitted to spatial dependence analysis by global Moran statistics to assess the need to incorporate a spatial component of the regression model, according to the decision model proposed by Luc Anselin [11, 12] . Once established, Lagrange multiplier tests were applied to define whether the most appropriate spatial model for the data set would be the spatial delay model (assigning an unknown value to the response variable Y) or the spatial error model (considering the spatial component as noise to be removed) [11] . Finally, residues from spatial models were subjected to Moran statistics again to verify spatial independence. In addition to this criterion, the following items were used to assess the quality of the final model: Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), log probability, and determination coefficient (R 2 ). Analyses were performed using GeoDa software (version 1.10.0.8, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA).Because this study uses data in the public domain, Research Ethics Committee approval was waived.A total of 125 186 cases and 8452 deaths from COVID-19 were included in the study. Cases were reported in 2496 municipalities (44.8%), and deaths were reported in 821 municipalities (14.7%). Although the disease is present both in municipalities with large populations (> 100 000 inhabitants) and in those with small sizes (≤ 10 000), 81.3% of municipalities with up to 10 000 inhabitants have not yet registered cases of COVID-19.Municipalities with populations over 100 000 inhabitants were the first affected, and, to date, they have an incidence of 88.95/100 000 and a mortality rate of 61.36/1 million inhabitants. In second place are municipalities with up to 10 000 inhabitants, with incidence rate of 45.89/100000 and mortality rate of 27.26/1 million. It is noteworthy that the case fatality rate in municipalities with populations between 10 000 and 20 000 inhabitants is similar to that observed in large municipalities (6.81 and 6.90%, respectively) ( Table 1) .In relation to human development, it was observed that all 44 municipalities with very high MHDI were affected by COVID-19. This group had the highest COVID-19 incidence rate (106.71/100 000) and mortality (73.12/1 million). In second place are municipalities with very low MHDI, 56.2% of which have already registered cases of the disease. Regarding incidence and COVID-19 mortality rate, the group with very low MHDI held third place (COVID-19 incidence rate: 59.00/100000 and COVID-19 mortality rate: 36.75/1 million) (Tables 1 and  2) .Regarding social vulnerability, 55.8% of the municipalities with very low SVI have already registered cases of COVID-19, followed by the municipalities with very high SVI (52.8%). Considering the incidence and mortality rates, municipalities with average SVI held first place (99.37 cases/100 000 and 68.48 deaths/1 000 000). It is also noteworthy that the municipalities with high SVI had higher case fatality rate (7.36%) (Tables 1 and 2) .Initially, a positive bivariate spatial correlation was observed between the incidence rate of COVID-19 and the general SVI (Moran I = 0.076; P = 0.002) and a negative correlation with the MHDI (Moran I = -0.022; P = 0.002) (Fig. 1) . Of the 49 variables analyzed, five showed no spatial correlation with the incidence rate of COVID-19 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. In the multivariate regression model, 21 variables were associated with incidence rate. None of the variables in block 2 (domains of the SVI) showed significance. In all other blocks of variables, the residuals of the regression model were spatially dependent. Lagrange multiplier tests indicated the spatial error model for block 8 (domains of the MHDI education) and spatial lag model for the others ( Table 3) . The spatial regression model, finally, identified 17 indicators associated with incidence rate, 13 of which showed positive association, namely the following: SVI; MHDI; MHDI education; Percentage of people who live in households with per capita income less than half minimum wage (2010) and who spend more than 1 h to reach place of work; percentage of people aged six to 14 years who do not attend school; percentage of people aged 15 to 24 years who do not study, do not work, and have per capita household income equal to or less than half the minimum wage (2010); percentage of people with per capita household income equal to or less than half minimum wage (2010); activity rate of people aged 10 to 14 years; life expectancy at birth; percentage of individuals aged 11 to 13 who are enrolled in the final years of elementary school or who have completed elementary school; per capita income; percentage of employed persons aged 18 or elder with complete elementary school; and average income of employed persons aged 18 or over. Four variables showed a negative association, namely, illiteracy rate of the population aged 15 years or over; percentage of employers aged 18 or over; percentage of people aged 18 or over without complete elementary education holding informal occupation; and percentage of employed people aged 18 or over with complete higher education (Table 3 ).COVID-19 currently represents the main global health, social, and economic challenge. In Brazil, the spread of the disease started in the most developed municipalities in the country, and it has spread throughout the Brazilian territory without delay, reaching smaller and more vulnerable areas whose populations are exposed to a chronic and historical context of social deprivation. This process of spatial dissemination justifies the complex influence of SDH on the spread of the virus across the country. Considering that the virus is reaching the most vulnerable and least developed municipalities in the country after those with better living conditions, there is reason to believe that these municipalities will be more severely affected and will suffer incalculable consequences, if consistent support measures are not adopted urgently.The first reason concerns the risk context of these populations and the difficulties in implementing and/or adopting preventive measures. Approximately 37 million Brazilian workers earn their income from activities related to the sale of products and the provision of services, constituting a population vulnerable to contamination [13] . In poorer municipalities, the percentage of these populations rises considerably [13] . Furthermore, in many cases, this is the only source of income for the family's subsistence, which makes adherence to voluntary social isolation difficult to maintain for a long period without the proper support of emergency public policies.COVID-19, therefore, has a double effect on the most vulnerable populations, to the extent that it both perpetuates poverty and is perpetuated by poverty itself. It is perpetuating in the sense that, for each percentage point reduction in the global economy, it is estimated that an additional 10 million people will be placed in poverty [5] . In Brazil, the pandemic could increase by 6.5 percentage points in the poverty index, thus affecting almost one quarter of the Brazilian population [14] . It would furthermore increase inequality in income distribution (6.5% increase in the Gini Index) [14] . In the states of the North and Northeast Regions, these effects of pandemics can be even more pronounced, given that they are the least developed regions with the most vulnerable populations.It is perpetuated by poverty, because this vulnerable population, having no financial reserves and depending on emergency government assistance, will scarcely be able to adhere to non-pharmacological preventive measures, such as social isolation, wearing masks, and hand hygiene. In this regard, living conditions are able to maintain the COVID-19 transmission chain active. In our study, there was a higher incidence rate in municipalities with greater social vulnerability; higher proportion of people who live in households with per capita income less than half minimum wage and who spend more than 1 h to reach place of work; higher proportion of children aged six to 14 years who do not attend school; and higher proportion of people aged 15 to 24 years who do not study, do not work and have a per capita income of less than half minimum wage. These populations are more likely not to follow government recommendations [15] .The lack of home structure and the lack of access to minimum resources, such as water and basic sanitation, both on the outskirts of large cities and in municipalities in the interior of the country, can increase the risk of illness due to COVID-19, as observed with other respiratory diseases [16] . In Brazil, four million families do not have a bathroom at home; 35 million do not yet have access to treated water, and 100 million do not have a sewage network [17] . Therefore, it is possible to state that the degree of suffering generated by the pandemic depends on the area where individuals live and the social conditions to which they are subjected [18] . Even in rich countries, such as the United States of America (USA), the social inequalities that exist in cities determine the greater or lesser risk of illness for their residents. In Boston, for example, there is a high concentration of poverty and a prevalence of diseases caused by it in certain areas and good living conditions and a low prevalence of these diseases in other nearby points [19, 20] . This scenario reinforces the relationship between social policies and the health conditions experienced by the population.A study carried out in the USA, with data from 433 cities, involving 283 256 cases and 6644 deaths from COVID-19, showed that the highest social vulnerability index was associated with a higher incidence and lethality due to the disease (Relative Risk-RR = 1.19), being still higher when considering the population aged 65 or older (RR = 1.63). In the study, 28.9% of the municipalities had a high social vulnerability (SVI ≥ 0.46) and a high adjusted lethality rate (≥ 2.3%) [21] .In addition, mortality caused by the disease, especially in household providers, can increase the poverty of families. In this investigation, municipalities with small population sizes, as well as those with low MHDI and high SVI already show high mortality rates. The situation tends to become more critical when all municipalities are affected, which will not take long to happen. Even with the set of actions implemented by the Brazilian government, through ""Brazil's response policy to COVID-19"" [22] , it is likely that after this pandemic, Brazil will face a second crisis related to poverty and the diseases associated therewith. The loss of income can bring other consequences for the health of the population, such as a higher frequency of mental illnesses, increased consumption of alcohol and other drugs and increased domestic violence [23] . It is not yet possible to predict the size of the impact of the pandemic on people's lives, especially on the most vulnerable and, for this reason, strategies to combat COVID-19 must be developed on different fronts of action. The second reason refers to the capacity of municipalities to face the contamination of their population and to offer conditions for detection and treatment of patients. If we consider that 7% of those infected will need hospitalization and that 2% will require intensive care [24] , the group of municipalities with very high vulnerability (which recorded 4964 cases of COVID-19) would need 347 hospital beds and 99 intensive care unit (ICU) beds.Several factors make this scenario even more worrying. First, these small and more vulnerable municipalities do not have a hospital structure or ICU beds to meet the demand imposed by the pandemic [25] . In general, these beds are concentrated in municipalities that are regional health centers that serve the municipalities through agreements between managers. Second, because the disease first arrived in the larger municipalities with higher human development, these beds are already occupied. Third, these populations depend exclusively on beds in the public Unified Health System (SUS, acronym in Portuguese). About 94.4% of the individuals who constitute poorest 20% of the population are dependent on the SUS [21] . For this reason, the strengthening of all components of the health system is of fundamental importance for tackling the pandemic in Brazil [26, 27] .Even with all the precautions adopted, this study has some limitations, among which the following stand out: i. the underreporting of COVID-19 cases due to the limited availability of tests and the capacity of local surveillance services, ii. deficiencies in investigating deaths due to the disease, with significant underreporting, and iii. Use of secondary data that are subject to constant variation.Concerns with the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country's smallest, most vulnerable, and least developed municipalities raise the alert for Brazilian political authorities. It is necessary to do the following: 1) delay the arrival of the disease in these locations by adopting effective prevention mechanisms that consider the collective risk of illness, the social context experienced by these populations, and the best existing scientific evidence; 2) expand and prepare the health network with urgent investments in the SUS at all levels of care; and 3) guarantee social protection for the vulnerable population.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-31,8
71e6e60a23930e05c2a2274b989a9aece9955518,Generated Time-series Prediction Data of COVID-19 s Daily Infections in Brazil by Using Recurrent Neural Networks Article Title Generated Time-series Prediction Data of COVID-19's Daily Infections in Brazil by Using Recurrent Neural Networks Corresponding author(s),"• This data is useful because it provides researchers with a solid background foundation for predicting COVID-19's daily infections by depending on very limited data (30 time-steps and 40 time-steps alternatives). This facilitates the prediction process by reducing the crucial need for big data that is required to train deep recurrent neural networks.• Government institutions and infection control units can utilize and filter this data to estimate and develop the required action plans. As well, researchers can use them in spatial models related to the geographical distribution of the pandemic and the increase in numbers.• The data generated by the models represent a data lake that can help researchers to build a reinforcement learning model that can learn how to classify and select the fittest models against upcoming infection rates. More importantly, a reinforcement learning model that adjusts and combines between the best weights in these trained models can be developed to construct a new prediction model for extended long-term prediction purposes.• Although real numbers of infected people are higher than reported as there is a worldwide limited capacity to provide more tests to people, therefore, this data helps in modelling real numbers more accurately in the studies that perform an estimation of infection prevalence.• This data can very useful for social scientists who aim at developing analysis frameworks that compare and study the social structure and socio-economic conditions in different countries and cultures, and the relation of these factors to the prevalence of the pandemic.In the past five months, many non-medical data articles have focused on critical aspects of transitionrelated analysis and data of COVID-19's case, as infections data collection, filtering, geographical mapping of infections [1] , [2] , and forecasting. In that sense, forecasting studies utilized various approaches as exponential smoothing models [3] , estimation of the daily reproduction number [4] , Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) models [5] , ARIMA models [6] , [7] , and nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks -NARANN models [7] . Furthermore, several approaches depended on using more or different data as the SEIRQ model [8] , which involved using seven categories of data, one of them is the number of infected people. Similarly, a research study for predicting cases in China depended on extra data from SARS and MERS diseases that are fitted on an exponential growth model [9] . As well, an improved version of Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered -SEIR was used with extra data about the intervention and quarantine strategies against the pandemic [10] . On the other hand, this data article focuses on long-term forecasting of the daily infections in Brazil by using limited data of infections numbers only on a recurrent neural network structure that uses Gated Recurrent Unit -GRU mechanism that is similar to Long Short-Term Memory -LSTM mechanism. The choice of 30-and 40-days' time windows is made experimentally as explained in the methods section.Although there is an accompanying uncertainty in the generated predictions, however; the evaluation of the models' performance over various durations (not less than 54 days as shown in the metadata Table   1 ), shows the possibility of achieving long-term predictions by using limited data. In that sense, the generated predictions show polynomial trendlines between orders two and four for the case of Brazil rather than developing a non-stopping exponential or power trend that grows indefinitely. These RNNs are boosted by an online adversarial linear regression evaluation function, which performs a day-by-day correction of the models' generated data over the whole duration. As the prediction is made till 2020-10-01, this date was selected based on the news of early vaccine release by September 2020 by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca [11] among many other pharmaceutical firms such as Moderna that announced manufacturing 100 million doses by the 3 rd quarter of 2020 [12] . Similarly, the selection of Brazil is based on the importance of predicting the infection numbers in one of the world's populous countries, which is currently ranked as 2 nd in the world regarding the number of total infections with COVID-19 [13] (2020-07-13). Moreover, choosing the second in rank prioritizes having no external factor that can have a substantial influence over the pandemic's behavior, which is possible in the case of the USA (ranked as 1 st [13] ), where massive demonstrations occurred during June, and July 2020 [14] and this requires different measures to neutralize the influence. In that sense, 4200 Deep recurrent neural networks RNNs were built by Keras Library in Python environment and by using limited data (30 time-steps and 40 time-steps) from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University [13] that includes infections numbers from January 22, 2020, to several dates -indicated in the metadata in Table 1 . These trained models are categorized as follows: 3173 in deterministic mode, 20 in non-deterministic mode, 1001 in a non-deterministic mode for validation, 1 model as a control group for validation by using the data of India, and 5 models for showing performance of different time-steps. The csv file that includes the training data was accessed, processed, cropped, and divided without scaling into training/testing/evaluation sets. Subsequently, the long-term prediction data in this article was generated using the trained models. The deterministic setup aspect is explained in the methods section, as well, the metadata, inference settings, and training settings are located in csv and json files, which can be accessed at the data repository.Overall, the data in this article consists of models, prediction tables, graphs, settings tables, and a Python notebook. The data is split into two datasets and both are uploaded in two online data repositories. Dataset one includes the model files, predictions, graphs, and metadata, and Dataset two includes the code as one Jupyter Notebook file in Python programming language. Dataset one is divided into three folders: 1) (Deterministic mode), 2) (Non-deterministic mode), 3) (Technical validation), and one compressed zip file that includes all files and folders in the dataset. 07-04-2020 07-04-2020 07-04-2020 08-03-2020 07-04-2020 1 End date for training data 06-05-2020 06-05-2020 06-05-2020 06-04-2020 06-05-2020 2 Start date for evaluation data 07-05-2020 07-05-2020 07-05-2020 07-04-2020 07-05-2020 3 End date for evaluation data 29-06-2020 29-06-2020 29-06-2020 13-06-2020 29-06-2020 11-07-2020 4 Duration of evaluation data 54 days 54 days 54 days 68 days 84 days 66 days 5 Start date for training process 28-06-2020 28-06-2020 03-07-2020 13-06-2020 12-07-2020 6 End date for training process 30-06-2020 01-07-2020 03-07-2020 13-06-2020 12-07-2020 In Dataset one, the deterministic folder contains two folders: 1) 30 time-steps, and 2) 40 time-steps. On the other hand, the Non-deterministic folder and Technical validation contain data for 30 time-steps. The generic structure for each time-steps subfolder contains the following four folders:1. (Predictions) folder, including prediction tables (to 2020-10-01) in (.csv) extension. Each csv file includes the predicted daily infections table that is generated by using a trained model. Each table includes three columns: 1) date, 2) model prediction, 3) evaluated prediction. The folder includes an extended evaluation for the best model till 2020-07-11.2. (Graphs) folder, including prediction graphs (to 2020-10-01) in (.pdf) extension. Each graph describes the model's performance against the true data. The graphs mainly include four highlighted trendlines: 1) prediction for the period of the time-steps, 2) prediction for all the validation period, 3) prediction for four steps only, and 4) prediction to the target date. The folder includes an extended evaluation for the best model till 2020-07-11.3. (Settings) folder, including: settings files in (.json) extension. This folder includes all the settings that are used for training the models. The settings folder includes (Metadata) folder, which comprises four tables in (.csv) extension: 1) (dates_info_to_2020-10-01.csv) file includes dates of training and prediction processes. 2) (models_accuracy_settings_to_2020-10-01.csv) file includes models' settings and accuracy. 3) (gen_data_info_to_2020-10-01.csv) file includes counts of generated data. 4) (best_model_accuracy_settings_to_2020-10-01_.csv) file includes settings and accuracy of the best model. 4. (Trained models) folder, including model files in (.h5) extension. These files are the trained models and they can be used in inference by using the predict function in the Python notebook.The technical validation folder includes an additional folder named (Control group) for the model of India. As well, there is an additional folder that includes the data for the performance of different timesteps -till 2020-06-29. The following tables and figures show a brief about the results. First, Table 2 shows the best performing 10 models in the deterministic mode 1, Figure 1 shows the graph for the third-best performing model that is not showing a non-stopping exponential growth, and Table 3 shows the settings of this model. On the other hand, Figure 2 shows different trends in this mode.0.57569909 1909 model_trained_cf40d4ca-6cd7-44dc-a1e9-bcb190a5d466.h5 0.574641935 Similarly, Table 4 shows the best performing 10 models in the deterministic mode 2, Figure 3 shows the graph for the second-best performing model in this mode showing a polynomial growth (first and second models shown in Table 4 are identical in performance -non-stopping exponential growth -thus, they are ranked together as first), and Table 5 shows the settings of this model. On the other hand, Figure 4 shows different trends in this mode. Thirdly, Table 6 shows the best performing 10 models in the non-deterministic mode, Figure 5 shows the graph for the second-best performing model that shows a polynomial growth, and Table 7 shows the settings of the best performing model in the non-deterministic mode. On the other hand, Figure 6 shows different trends in this mode. To ensure the reliability of the data, technical validation of the data was performed. The csv file for daily COVID-19 infection numbers was accessed from COVID-19 Johns Hopkins University's Data Repository, processed, cropped, and divided into training/testing/evaluation sets.Predominantly, allowing a relatively large evaluation period (not less than 54 days) reflected a better understanding of the models' generalizability without new data, this is particularly important in tackling time-sensitive prediction processes with limited data as a basis for decision-making. The evaluation periods are shown in the metadata Table 1 .As well, generating various models within a range of variations of settings serves the exploration of most efficient settings that would benefit future applications and potential reuse of the dataset.In that sense, after carefully looking at the trendline in the generated graphs, the data shows that a certain degree of uncertainty is reflected in the generated models while maintaining logical forecasting of the future that doesn't involve a non-stopping exponential growth trend regardless of the 85% high accuracy in the validation model. The case of the 85% accurate validation model in Figure 7 shows a non-stopping exponential growth trend that fits that data -over 68 days till 2020-06-13 -with fast growth in time-series predictions beyond this date. This rapid growth describes a failing long-term prediction of a total infected people to be 108095368 over 110 days from 2020-06-14 till 2020-10-01, which is almost half of Brazil's population [15] . On the other hand, the trend that is associated with the true data is approximating a polynomial trendline. Moreover, when testing this accurate model against new true data till 2020-06-29, the accuracy drops to a maximum of 68% (84 days evaluation), while maintaining the same steep exponential growth trendline. The period between 2020-05-31 and 2020-06-29 (30 time-steps) as indicated in Table 6 , shows that the model is adopting a fast growth pattern that is cannot maintain logical long-term forecasting. The fast growth pattern is repeated on dates before 2020-05-31 and after 2020-06-29. This pattern has worked as a guideline for identifying logical models that might be less accurate than 85% as in this validation model, but still more applicable than the validation model. The major difference between this validation model and the other models in the dataset is the cropping date of the data. This cropping point filters the data fed to the validation model to start from 2020-03-08 and end at 2020-04-06. The error -non-stopping exponential growth -can be reproduced when setting the crop-point of the data to day 80 since 2020-01-22. Overall, this validation model provides three main indicators: 1) Around 3 months of validation, indicate that the exponential growth pattern can fit true data on a long-term basis (more than the used time-steps as input to the model, ex. 15 time-steps or 20 time-steps and not more than a month), but it becomes not reliable when it comes to extended long-term predictions. This suggests that a polynomial trendline of order 2 to 4 is more probable to describe the data. 2) Croppoints influence the accuracy and the growth pattern of the trendlines in the models, which is the reason behind testing many crop-points.3) The exponential growth that is generated by models can be controlled and reduced by adjusting the crop-point to day 110. Figure 7 shows the prediction graph for one of the validation models. The complete validation dataset includes 1001 models, by taking 358 models as a sample that shows a 95% confidence level and 4.15% margin of error, the following Table 9 shows that long-term prediction is achievable during 68 days despite exponential growth afterward, as we can be positive that 77%, 81%, 64%, and 1% of the models can achieve more than 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% accuracy, respectively -by using same settings. Nevertheless, using such settings allowed a non-stopping exponential growth pattern. On the other hand, the deterministic and non-deterministic datasets have fallen into the second and third categories (the models have scored an accuracy of 50% to less than 60%, and 60% to less than 70%). However, two factors have a great influence over the results: the first factor involves the uncontrolled randomness that was eliminated to allow limited reproducibility throughout the training session, as this might have limited the achievement of higher accuracy. As a result, the desired polynomial curve was achievable at the expense of limiting the higher accuracy due to controlled randomness. Consequently, the controlled randomness mostly provides the phases of the logistic function, the initial log phase (slow growth), followed by near-exponential growth, the transitional phase (the slowdown), the saturation phase (transitional phase) then the maturity phasea plateau or stationary phase -(the growth stops). In that sense, the second factor that influenced the results is the crop-point (a source of randomness itself) of the data, as the ""numbers"" of the input data -the daily infections numberscontain inherited randomness that could lead to a pattern that translates into higher accuracy. This particularly means that there is a certain correlation between the numbers that allow better forecasting at a certain crop-point and worse predictions at another crop-point while using the same settings. However, as this validation dataset is non-deterministic, meaning that there is a certain degree of randomness, then the most controlling factor is the crop point as the other three datasets have been tested by using similar settings except for the crop-point (the two deterministic datasets have shown similar results to the non-deterministic dataset in terms of growth). This highlights that the crop-point as a source of randomness exceeds in influence the initial randomness that is created by the neural network to initialize the weights of the network.Consistently, this certain pattern or correlation can be overcome by allowing a higher level of randomness and much greater variations of settings. This can be computationally impractical and timeconsuming. Therefore, the objective of creating a data lake of with many variations in data points and trends, to develop a hybrid leading reinforcement model on top of this data lake, is more feasible in terms of speed and efficiency as these variations can ease the process of assigning or clustering them to reward and penalty classes in the deep reinforcement learning model. Further validation has been performed over the three best models in the three modes that are reported in the deterministic and non-deterministic modes, Table 10 shows updated performance till 2020-07-11.Accuracy till 2020-06-29Accuracy till 2020-07-11 Deterministic Table 10 . Evaluating Performance till 2020-07-11. Source: AuthorThe changes in performance are limited, but they reflect the unstable frequency that is inherited in the true data. This unstable frequency can be of natural cause related to the pandemic or a reflection of difficulties due to high numbers of infections and the implications of this on the health care system. Overall, this proves the need for highly varied predictions for the case of Brazil as in this dataset to get a clearer picture of the situation.On the other hand, India was chosen as a control group for validation to compare against Brazil in terms of the model's accuracy by using the same RNN's architecture and the same crop-point. In the case of India, a model was capable of achieving 95% accuracy till 2020-07-11 (61 days), the complete report for achieved accuracy by using different settings is shown in Table 11 . Evaluating Performance of India as a Control Group till 2020-07-11. Source: AuthorThe performance of the validation over India shows that the exponential trendline is reliable in longterm predictions that seek accurate performance for periods that do not exceed two months, which can be very useful to decision-makers. However, it is possibly not credible for longer periods. These accuracy values particularly mean that the inherited randomness in the true input numbers is influencing the results. As well, the unique case and situation related to every country are inherited in the results of the models. However, this also means that extended long-term predictions (more than two months) can become a possibility while using limited data, which contributes to validating the accuracy of models in Brazil's case.Lastly, several options were tested before starting wide-scale training-saving of the models and they influenced the training:1. Although scaling is a normal procedure in feature engineering for RNN applications, however; it is found through several validations that it has reduced the accuracy. 2. The code can generate overlapping time-series sequences to enlarge the training dataset, however; more accurate models were obtained by using the smaller data. 3. It was found that shuffling the data during the training of the models helped the training to generalize the results. 4. Filtering raw training data that is fed to the models, proved to be essential to avoid misleading the models by 'zero' instances that appeared early since 22-01-2020. 5. The non-deterministic mode can -within a certain range -provide a higher accuracy due to randomness, however; the patterns of trendlines are similar between the two modes.The models were built in Python programming language by Keras deep learning library on the Google Colab platform, and they depend only on numerical data of daily infections in each country, no other data has been added to the models except for the time series input.Mainly, to prepare the data and perform feature engineering, the (gen_rnn_data) function divides the raw dataset in a csv file for the training and evaluation data into training and testing sets, with an option to scale the data and to generate overlapping time-series data to enlarge the data. These two options were found to be not useful during the training of the models, so they were not used. As well, no feature engineering was implemented except for cropping the data to create the validation dataset and to avoid very small numbers as zero, or one, or two, which appeared at the starting point of the data (22-01-2020) till March. The cropping-points are indicated in Table 1 .The architecture of the models is based on predicting 15/20 time-steps (Y) by using 15/20 time-steps for training (X), which is equivalent to using 30/40 time-steps in total for training and testing the models. The choice of these time windows in the case of Brazil was determined experimentally. It was found that smaller time-steps such as 5 (5 for each of X and Y) and 10 (10 for each of X and Y) did produce less generalizability, which can be the same case with higher values as 25. Generally, the accuracy of all models was calculated using three R squared values (r2 -coefficient of determination): 1) the model's accuracy over the time-steps, 2) the model's accuracy over the whole evaluation period, and 3) the sum of both. The main functions used to train the models are:• (train_rnn): A recurrent neural network was chosen as the main architecture of the models as it can handle complex relations in time-series forecasting problems. For that, by using Keras deep learning library, the (train_rnn) function was developed to construct this RNN -by choosing one of these RNNs types: 1) LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) and 2) GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), along with a convolutional layer within a composite autoencoder's neural network. The choice of the GRU-CNN composite autoencoder is determined based on both, 1) GRU can provide faster convergence and higher performance than LSTM due to the reduced number of parameters in the model and simpler architecture, and 2) the boosted performance when using a hybrid architecture of CNN with RNN, which outperforms RNN alone without CNN. The latter case can be explained by both, CNN's capability of feature learning that identifies the important features in the input sequence as being the first layer, and RNNs capacity to detect temporal dependencies in the input that enables efficient forecasting of multivariate time-sequences. These two architectures were merged without batch normalization that is part of the basic block of CNNs and FCNs in certain applications as computer vision and time-series classification tasks, as it removes -normalizes -the noise in the data, which in return could destroy the dependencies or the relations between the inputs to the GRU autoencoder. The hybrid architecture ends with a dense layer and involves using linear activation function for generating numbers, rather than categorical activation functions such as softmax or sigmoid in traditional CNNs and FCNS when configured for classification tasks.• Later after training the model, (predict) recursive function can specify a threshold to include several time-steps predictions as shown in Figure 8 , (ex. to keep just the first 2 time-steps predictions out of the 15 time-steps), then it removes the rest and adds the selected ones to the end of the previous input sequence that is used to generate this output, while removing the same number of values at the beginning of the input, to update the input and re-predict the next 15 steps with the newly added values at the end of the input sequence. This loop can be repeated depending on how many time-steps we want to generate. This function allows us to recognize the inherited randomness in the data to explore how the model behaves on every threshold and to which limit it is accurate, so we can later select the best threshold that fits the unseen evaluation data. • The (adversarial_evaluation) function was developed to take the output of the model, and train it against daily updated actual numbers to evaluate the predicted numbers as near as possible to the actual numbers to increase the generalizability of the models.• The (predict_select_model) function can be used to test the performance of the models against many thresholds and each other, then it returns the best model with the best settings.• The (recursive_train_predict) function is the user's interface for the training -prediction process.• Helper functions, including 1) (eval_predictions) function that is used to evaluate the performance of the models. 2) (plot_predictions) function that is used to plot the graphs. 3) (train_ml) function that is used within the (adversarial_evaluation) function to perform linear regression operations. 4) (save_tables) function that is used to save the settings and accuracies of the models into tables of different formats and lengths. 5) (get_settings) function that is used to extract and process the settings of the models. 6) (save_data_structure) function that is used to save the folders and files correctly. 7) (select_models_acc) function that is used to filter models based on the accuracy threshold. 8) (select_best_models_acc) function that is used to filter out the best models. And 9) (random_seed_changer) function that is used to change and select a specific random seed across the used libraries in the Python environment to ensure the reproducibility of the results and the weights of the models during the training session.A note on (random_seed_changer) function: Initially, we should not confuse between deterministic settings and replicability, as the first does not necessarily lead to the latter. Generally, there are sources of randomness, since different hardware and software versions of used libraries in deep learning can produce randomness even when deterministic settings are used. For instance, there are four main sources for randomness, ex.: 1) GPU's numerical operations are mostly non-deterministic, so single-threaded CPU was used.2) The programming environment and the initialization of the neural network can be random; therefore, random values were specified during the training session.3) Different versions of deep learning libraries can provide different results by using the same settings, this was addressed by using ""2.3.0-tf"" version. 4) Training on different hardware can introduce randomness, thus, the models were trained on Google's Colab platform at a time-window that is indicated in Table 1 . This deterministic setup is useful to serve the procedural objective of the dataset, which is to report settings used to produce all models that were trained in a training session while using the same software and hardware. This can allow future work to evaluate the statistical significance based on no factors influenced the training except for changed settings of the models, which is essential later for uniform training of a reinforcement learning -RL model. This can provide further control over the stochastic process in the neural network, by using the stochastic data that was regulated by deterministic settings during its training process, as training data for an RL model, which is the major objective of the dataset. ** The 20 models in the Non-deterministic mode were all trained in 1 session. The Google Drive File Stream service that syncs files automatically from the training session on Google Colab to Google Drive, has created the designated folder on 3 July and indicated correct created date of 9 files out of 20 as: 3 July and incorrect modified date as: 25 June for these 9 files that even shows 24 June when downloaded. This error can be noticed in the compressed zip file. However, the code already included a working second layer of protection against these errors, as there is an internal collective settings dictionary file that states exactly all settings used at the beginning of the training process for each model before generating individual settings files, which is created on 3 July. The dictionary clarifies that the actual creation of settings that were used to initialize each training session of the 9 models, occurred on 3 July, as this dictionary creation code is responsible for generating universally unique identifiers as models' naming convention.

83f38e1c87a0e4b3f61893d7e256ac8155de0854,reCommendaTions | reComendações,"As presentes recomendações foram elaboradas após a publicação da Nota Informativa nº 3/2020 CGGAP/DESF/SAPS/MS, em 4 de abril de 2020, na qual o Ministério da Saúde recomenda o uso de máscara de pano por toda a população, em locais públicos. Levando-se em consideração a necessária priorização do fornecimento de Equipamentos de Proteção Individual (EPIs) para pacientes com suspeita ou confirmação da doença, assim como para profissionais de saúde, a Sociedade Brasileira de Nefrologia (SBN) posicionou-se favoravelmente ao uso de máscaras de pano por pacientes renais crônicos em diálise, em ambientes públicos, exceto no ambiente da diálise. As presentes recomendações englobam onze itens relativos ao que é racional para posicionamento, procedimentos, indicações, contraindicações, assim como tecidos apropriados para confecção e os cuidados de higiene a serem adotados. Essas recomendações poderão ser modificadas a qualquer momento, à luz de novas evidências. These recommendations were created after the publication of informative note 3/2020-CGGAP/DESF/SAPS/MS, of April 4, 2020, in which the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommended the use of a cloth mask by the population, in public places. Taking into account the necessary prioritization of the provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for patients with suspected or confirmed disease, as well as for healthcare professionals, the SBN is favorable concerning the wear of cloth masks by chronic kidney patients in dialysis, in public settings, except in the dialysis setting. The present recommendations have eleven items, related to this rationale, the procedures, indications, contraindications, as well as appropriate fabrics for the mask, and hygiene care to be adopted. These recommendations may change, at any time, in the light of new evidence.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Coronavirus infection; Covid-19.2. The cloth mask can prevent the spread of droplets expelled from the nose or mouth of people in the environment, acting as a mechanical barrier, thus reducing spread of the disease by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected people, who can transmit the virus, especially in places of community transmission, and where measures of social distance are difficult to follow. Nonetheless, these masks do not protect healthy individuals from contracting the virus 1,2 .pAtIents weARIng mAsks duRIng the pAndemIc 1. Considering the scarcity of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), the SBN recommends that all asymptomatic chronic renal patients, as well as the general population, should wear protection masks, based on recommendations from the Ministry of Health (MH), through Informative Note 3/2020-CGGAP/DESF/ SAPS/MS1. 3 . We recommend that all chronic kidney patients on dialysis wear a cloth mask when going out for essential activities and during transportation to the dialysis clinic. The use of the mask aims to reduce the spread of the virus by asymptomatic patients in these environments.4. Patients with Covid-19 infection suspicion or confirmation should wear a surgical mask, as well as adopt other precautionary measures already described in the SBN Good Practice Recommendations 3 .Even though there is a shortage of PPE, there is no evidence to support the recommendation for the use of cloth masks within dialysis centers. There is a possibility of contamination at the site, favoring the spread of the virus; concurrently, we know understood that recommending the use of surgical masks by all asymptomatic patients while on dialysis may worsen the current situation of PPE scarcity. Healthcare professionals, employees and patients with suspected or confirmed infection must have priority on having masks. This recommendation may change, depending on the effective supply of these materials in the country.6. The fabrics recommended for making a mask are, in decreasing order of their ability to filter viral particles: a) vacuum cleaner bag fabrics; b) cotton (composed of 55% polyester and 45% cotton); c) cotton fabric (such as 100% cotton T-shirts); and d) pillowcases of antimicrobial tissue 1 .7. According to guidelines from the MH, some precautions need to be taken regarding the use of the fabric masks. The instructions for making them and hygiene measures are included in the technical note from the MH, available at: <https: // www. saude.gov. br/images/pdf/2020/April/04/1586014047102-Nota-Informativa.pdf>.8. Hereby, we stress some recommendations provided by the MH link (item 6) regarding the use of cloth masks:8.1 The mask should be changed whenever there is dirt or moisture. Chronic kidney patients on hemodialysis should calculate the number of masks required, depending on the time spent traveling to the clinic, and the return home. It is estimated that each mask can be used for a period of two hours. 8.2 The use of the mask is for one individual only, so the patient should not share it, even if it is sanitized. 8.3 Upon leaving the dialysis clinic, the patient must be able to put on the mask without assistance. Healthcare professionals should not assist the patients in this, due to the risk of contamination.8.4 When arriving at the clinic, the used mask must be removed and packed in a plastic bag exclusively for that purpose, and should not be kept in the same compartment (bag, backpack) as the plastic bag that houses the clean mask that will be used on the return home.8.5 When arriving home, the patient must clean the masks according to the guidelines contained in the MH technical note: immerse the mask in a container with drinking water and bleach (2.0 to 2.5%) for 30 minutes. The dilution ratio is 1 part of bleach to 50 parts of water (for instance: 10 ml of bleach to 500 ml of drinking water). After the immersion time, rinse the mask under running water and wash it with soap and water. After washing the mask, wash your hands with soap and water. The mask must be dry for reuse. After drying the mask, iron it with a hot iron and put it in a plastic bag 1 .9. It is important to maintain the other preventive measures already recommended, such as social distance on days when hemodialysis is not performed, avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth, in addition to hand hygiene with water and soap or 70% alcohol gel. 1, 3 10. Cloth masks should not be worn by people who have difficulty breathing, are unconscious and unable to remove the mask without assistance. Based on clinical criteria, the nephrologist will be able to evaluate other possible contraindications.11. These recommendations may change at any time, in the light of new evidence. In this sense, one should look for possible updates.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-26,8
0545e44b0009d5597035fe2886cd8b8d316594a1,Mortality from COVID in Colombia and Peru: Analyses of Mortality Data and Statistical Forecasts Aug 24 Final version,"The coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic has killed over 800,000 people, mostly in highincome countries, and sickened millions more around the world (Basset et al., 2020; Johns Hopkins University & Medicine [JHU], 2020; Worldometers.info, 2020) . Mortality, even with acknowledged undercounts (Katz et al., 2020; Montagano, 2020 ; Office for National Statistics [ONS] , 2020; The Economist, 2020), is the least biased metric available to monitor the trajectory of the pandemic, to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and to estimate healthcare needs.Reliable predictions of the COVID burden, using mortality as an indicator, are critical to plan responses to the current and potential future pandemic waves. Here, we determine the excess mortality from COVID in Colombia and Peru by comparing average weekly mortality counts for recent years with 2020 for the weeks corresponding to the first COVID wave. We complement this analysis of recent past trends with forward projections to November 1, 2020 using the latest iteration of the Global COVID Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) , an open-source statistical model to project COVID mortality trends. In Colombia and Peru, where the epidemic has not yet crested, we compare the excess in projected all-cause mortality by week and we compare these two countries with results from Italy, where mortality from the first viral wave has peaked; from Florida state in the United States and Spain, both of which show incomplete resolution of the first wave before the start of a second (which we define as a ""rebound"" mortality peak), and from Australia, where the two separate peaks from the first viral wave are seen arising from two different sub-national viral waves.For each setting, GCAM uses non-linear regressions to fit an eight-parameter model to the observed daily mortality counts. We used Bayesian inference (Carpenter et al., 2017) to generate several thousand posterior samples of potential epidemic curves for each country. The model builds on observed daily mortality counts for places that have already reached epidemic peaks (such as Hubei, China, which accounted for about 90% of Chinese deaths, and Italy and Spain). For settings where the epidemic is still growing, future death count predictions are necessarily less certain, and GCAM displays a variety of curves that could occur based on Bayesian prior distributions, which are quantifications of expert knowledge of the underlying process and comparisons with other coronaviruses. A semi-automated GCAM website (www.cghr.org/covid) provides regular updates. GCAM is open, transparent, and uses a reasonably simple method that employs publicly-reported mortality data to make plausible projections. The method is designed to improve as mortality data are added daily.We compared excess mortality during the first 26 weeks of 2020 to average mortality rates in previous years for Colombia and Peru. We defined excess mortality as death from all causes minus average expected mortality, following methods reported by Aron et al. (2020) .We calculated the average expected number of deaths in Colombia and Peru from historical data for weekly counts of death. In Colombia, five years of final mortality data were available (2015 Government of Colombia, 2020) and in Peru, three years of final mortality data (2017-2019) were used. The primary method of comparison is graphical analysis of weekly data for weeks 1 through 26. Additionally, we computed the p-score, representing percentage of excess deaths relative to the expected deaths for each week with complete data in 2020. These analyses will be updated as more recent weeks of mortality data are published.We collected COVID mortality data by age and sex, where reported, from the World Health Organization (WHO), country reports (WHO, 2020a), and from online data collections (Basset et al., 2020; JHU, 2020; Worldometers.info, 2020) . We deemed each setting's epidemic to have begun on the day after the first COVID death was recorded. We forecast deaths until December 1, 2020.For a comparison with current COVID mortality (mainly from acute pneumonia leading to respiratory failure), we examined the WHO mortality database (WHO, 2018) to estimate average baseline pneumonia and influenza deaths during 2015-17. For the US, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mortality database (National Center for Health Statistics, 2020), and for Russia and China, we used the Global Burden of Disease (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018). We obtained age-and sex-specific population denominators from the United Nations Population Division (United Nations, 2019), and for Hubei, China, and for US states, from national vital statistics (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2018; National Center for Health Statistics, 2020). We calculated age-specific mortality rates at age 20 years or older for pneumonia and influenza (as COVID deaths are rare in children and adolescents), and present totals for both sexes (Garg et al., 2020) .GCAM uses Bayesian non-linear regressions to fit a parametric model to the observed daily mortality counts. The form of the model and the prior distributions (which quantify subjective beliefs about the nature of the epidemic) were specified in late March 2020 and informed by the daily COVID mortality counts in Hubei, China and Italy. The daily intensity of death is assumed to follow a skew-normal density function, which is a typical ""bell-shaped"" normal distribution with an added term to permit an epidemic to rise quickly and fall slowly, as has already been observed with COVID deaths (Basset et al., 2020; JHU, 2020; Worldometers.info, 2020) and with two earlier coronavirus epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS; WHO, 2003) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS; WHO, 2019).The daily death counts were modelled with a negative binomial distribution, an extension of the more commonly used Poisson distribution but allowing for extra variation via an overdispersion parameter. The eight parameters estimated for each region cover: total expected deaths, adjusting for age, compared to the peak Italian deaths; peak day; epidemic duration; skewness; over-dispersion; and deaths outside the main epidemic. A few settings, most notably Iran and Florida have death counts that have rebounded following a decline from a first peak, and a second skew-normal curve was added to these epidemic trajectories, bringing the total number of parameters to 14 for these regions.We used Bayesian inference (Carpenter et al., 2017) to combine prior distributions and observed data, and generated several thousand posterior samples of potential epidemic curves for each country. Bayesian prior distributions are quantifications of expert knowledge of the underlying process. For settings where the epidemic is still accelerating, death counts are less predictive, since a variety of curves can fit any particular series of increasing counts. In these cases, GCAM relies on Bayesian prior distributions. For each country, we present the actual mortality daily totals, projected daily totals, the date of peak mortality, and duration of mortality in excess of baseline years' pneumonia and influenza totals. We present the most likely pathway and a series of ""credible regions"" at various probability levels. Credible regions for daily incidence are ""central regions"" with a specified probability of containing the entire epidemic curve (Myllymäki et al., 2017) , whereas the credible regions for cumulative mortality are made up of conventional pointwise intervals.The Appendix provides full details, including the formula for the model, specifics of the prior distributions for each parameter, and simulated epidemics for a population with Italy's demographic structure. As validation, we fitted the model to training data of deaths on or before April 22 and compared the projections with data observed up to May 27 for 11 countries or US states (data not shown). The source code is available at www.cghr.org/covid.In Peru, the greatest excess mortality occurred during the weeks of May 25-31 (p-score = 200% excess mortality; excess deaths = 4109) and June 1-7 (p-score = 193% excess mortality; excess deaths = 4115) (Appendix Table 2 , Appendix Figure 2 ). Figure 3 shows the GCAM mortality forecasts for daily COVID deaths until December 1 for Colombia, Peru and for comparison countries with more mature epidemics. The dark line is the median model projection and the red-shaded area represents credible intervals, ranging from 50% (darkest) to 98% (lightest). The actual peak dates are shown for the first or rebound peaks (Australia shows two peaks mostly from different viral peaks in different states). For each graph, the horizontal line represents the uncertainty in the peak date. Colombia's mortality peaked on August 12 (range August 7-19). Peru's mortality data show some evidence of a rebound peak, with the first larger peak on May 24 (range May 22-26) and a less certain rebound peak on September 6 (range Aug 18-Sept 30). As comparison, Spain shows a larger first mortality peak on March 29 (range March 28-30) and a smaller, more uncertain peak on August 19 (range August 14-30). Florida shows a larger rebound peak. Italy demonstrates a single peak in late March and Australia shows two distinct peaks. The first represents mostly deaths outside Victoria state and the second peak are deaths within Victoria. Figure 3 and Table 1 show the range of expected cumulative deaths in the comparison countries. The total number of deaths in Colombia is expected to be 24,000-31,000 (median = 27,000). The lowest value would represent an approximately 48% increase in COVID deaths over totals as of August 21, and the maximum would represent a 92% increase (Table 1) . Peru can expect 29,000 to 42,000 deaths (median 33,000) which represents an increase from 7% to 55% above current COVID deaths. We used the average annual deaths in previous years from pneumonia and influenza in both sexes above age 20 years as a crude indicator of historical hospital and ventilator capacity. We compare these totals against the median COVID deaths, and this ratio provides an estimate of the ""surge"" capacity needed to deal with the excess COVID deaths. This shows that both Colombia and Peru have reasonably high ratios (3.1 and 2.6, respectively) where surge capacity is needed, above the value for Spain (2.4), for example.For all countries, we estimate an average of 124 days (range: 115-148) until December 1 during which COVID deaths will exceed the daily death total of pneumonia in earlier years (Table 2) . For Colombia, this is 155 days (range: 144-171) and for Peru, 188 days (range: 165-224). As a proportion of all annual mortality, the median estimate of excess COVID mortality is 12.9% in Colombia and a very high 34% in Peru.We compared the GCAM model's performance to other mortality models. The sixth column in Table 1 -""precision""-reports the ratios of upper to lower credible intervals, which is our measure of uncertainty. The precision for Colombia and Peru are reasonably robust at 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. GCAM results showed generally consistent results for the selected countries over the six model runs (Appendix Figure 3 ). By contrast, results from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) were far more uneven, showing lower estimates than GCAM on April 22 and 29, and higher estimates afterwards. Similarly, the IHME median model results indicate that Brazil may have 125,000 deaths by Aug 4 th and GCAM estimates an upper limit of 70,000. Moreover, the IHME model does not show consistent improvements in precision as would be expected with more death data for these countries and for others (Appendix Figure  4 ). Appendix Figure 5 compares GCAM forecasts up to May 27 to IHME forecasts and those produced by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) COVID-19 Team (2020) , training the models on data up to 21 April. Both GCAM and the Los Alamos projections contain the observed mortality data within their credible intervals, but IHME does so less consistently. The credible intervals for the LANL are notably wide.Colombia and Peru will have a substantial burden of excess deaths due to COVID compared to the deaths in earlier years. Peru's COVID mortality has already had one peak in late May, and there is the possibility of another peak in early September. Colombia's COVID mortality peaked in mid-August. In Colombia and Peru, the final total of the first viral wave of COVID deaths will continue to rise by at least 48% in Colombia, and at least 7% in Peru, reaching 24,000 and 29,000 respectively. In the worst case, but still plausible, scenario, totals will reach 31,000 in Colombia and 42,000 in Peru. These totals are broadly consistent with the actual excess mortality from all causes observed in Colombia (30% excess for the week of June 22-28) and in Peru (200% excess for week of May 25-31). Hence, as a proportion of overall adult mortality, the annual excess for the median projection for Colombia is about 13% and for Peru it is 34%. In Colombia, the excess all-cause mortality until July 1, 2020 was most notable among males, and at ages 60 or higher (Government of Colombia, 2020). By contrast, in North America and Europe, most of the excess all-cause and COVID mortality has been at ages 70 or higher. These totals are aggregates, and as recently observed other countries, micro-epidemics with different trajectories are likely to occur, as has been observed in sub-regions of Italy and Spain (Basset et al., 2020; JHU, 2020; Worldometers.info, 2020) . Indeed, the two mortality peaks seen in Australia largely represent different epidemics outside and inside the state of Victoria.Improving the trajectory for COVID mortality in Colombia and Peru depends on the effective and prolonged implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and masking. Appendix figures 1 and 2 highlight the COVID excess mortality burden following the implementation of quarantine and suggest that adherence to these measures was suboptimal. Considering the context of COVID transmission and mortality risk within upper middle-income countries such as Peru and Colombia, relative to high-income countries, is also important for understanding the effects of intervention strategies . For example, while populations tend to be younger in middle-income countries than in high-income countries, elderly populations may face higher COVID attack rates due to larger household sizes with closer intergenerational contact (i.e., elderly individuals in contact with a wider range of age groups), and in particular when nursing homes or long-term care facilities become foci of outbreaks .Initial infectious disease models estimated that COVID deaths in the US would reach 1.0-2.2 million (roughly 40%-80% above the usual annual total of 2.8 million deaths) if no preventive action were taken . These same projections suggested 510,000 COVID deaths in the UK, roughly doubling the current annual total of all deaths. To date, the US and UK COVID death totals have been substantially lower, suggesting that these first models were inaccurate (overestimating death rates early on in the epidemic). For similar reasons, these models applied to Colombia and Peru are also unreliable. Notably, a key limitation across countries is the absence of population-representative serological surveys on random samples of populations (Mallapaty, 2020) to help establish the true infection-fatality rate. This underscores the need for improved mortality surveillance systems in Colombia and Peru, with the capacity to report mortality data with minimal time lags and by age and place of death (such as long-term care homes). Colombia and Peru would also benefit by launching COVID antibody sero-surveys in the near future to provide nationally representative estimates of the total number of people with a history of infection in each setting. The availability of serological data can substantially enhance the accuracy of modelling, beyond relying on reported cases alone, and can therefore better inform and monitor intervention strategies to minimize harm caused by COVID (Metcalf et al., 2020) .In a time of crisis, open data sharing is particularly important, hence the full input details and code of GCAM are freely available (www.cghr.org/covid) and we welcome critiques and suggestions on how to refine our estimates. We provide a simple metric of precision that can be used to gauge improvements over time. Future estimates will adopt these methods to examine Asian, African, and Latin American countries, many with weaker health systems and mortality surveillance capacity (Jha, 2014) .Conceived the idea and developed the study design: PB, PJ.

PB is the guarantor...Precision ( Table 2 . COVID mortality estimates, total mortality, percent of total deaths, and comparison to past pneumonia deaths in selected countries.Notes: Reported and excess deaths are from the New York Times (Katz et al., 2020) based on media reports and data from national statistical agencies, except for Italy, where they are based on discussions with the Italian Statistical Agency..We assumed the mean number of daily deaths for each setting to follow the shape of a skewnormal density function, which resembles a typical ""bell-shaped"" normal distribution with added skewness to permit an epidemic to rise fast but fall slowly (as has already been observed with COVID-19 deaths, see Basset et al., 2020; Johns Hopkins University, 2020; Worldometers.info, 2020) . Each country's epidemic consists of the sum of two skew normal curves. In some cases (i.e. Australia) the two curves correspond to two separate waves of COVID-19 mortality, whereas in other settings (such as Colombia) the two curves combine to create an epidemic with a single peak. The observed deaths in region on day follows a negative binomial distribution with mean and overdispersion parameter , or more specifically:, , ; , ,The are age and sex standardized death counts, obtained from each country's population data and age-specific mortality risk calculated from Italian data on 29 March 2020 (EpiCentro, 2020). The model parameters which determine the shape of the epidemic curve are: and , the expected total deaths for each skew-normal curve relative to the Italian rates on 29 March;, the locations of the peaks of the epidemic; , the durations of the epidemic (the skew-normal scale parameters); , the skewness parameters specifying the steepness of the growth phase of the epidemic relative to the decline phase; and , a 'spark' term allowing for occasional deaths outside the range of the main epidemic.We used the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm within the Stan software (Carpenter et al., 2017) . From each posterior sample of the model parameters, we computed the intensity and simulated potential future death counts from the negative binomial distribution. We calculated predictions envelopes, which contain the entire true epidemic curve from the samples, with the GET package in R (Myllymäki et al., 2017) .For each country, we present the actual mortality daily totals, projected daily and totals, the date of peak mortality and derive credible intervals (CI), at various probability levels. We calculated age-specific mortality rates at age 20 years or more for influenza and pneumonia, and present totals for both sexes, as COVID-19 deaths are only rarely reported in children and adolescents.We chose Bayesian prior distributions which generate simulated epidemic curves consistent with data from Italy and Hubei, China (Basset et. al, 2020; Johns Hopkins University, 2020; Worldometers.info, 2020) , and with SARS and MERS outbreaks (World Health Organization, 2003 , 2019 . Appendix Table 3 shows the prior distributions for each of the model parameters, the densities for several parameters are displayed in Appendix Figure 3 . Figures 3d and 3e show the course of an epidemic for a population of 1 million people with the age distribution of Italy, and the distribution of the final number of total cases appears in 3f. The prior median and 95% prior interval are shown above the horizontal axis of Figure 3f .As a validation exercise, the model was trained on deaths up to a specified date and predicted the number of deaths expected by 4 August 2020. Six sets of training data were used, with the earliest training period ending on 22 April and the latest training period ending on 26 May. The results were compared to similar forecasts made by IHME (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2020) in Appendix Figure 4 . As the period of the training data lengthens the uncertainty in the projections decreases, something which is seen most clearly in the predictions for France. Further, while the point estimates change to a certain extent, the prediction intervals are generally overlapping. While the predictions made from the small amount of data available on 22 April are imprecise, the prediction intervals from this date could have been relied upon to encapsulate the eventual predictions made with additional data. The notable exception is Brazil, where predictions on 4 May and earlier are too optimistic.Appendix Figure 5 compares GCAM forecasts up to May 27 to IHME forecasts and those produced by the Los Alamos National Labs (LANL, 2020), training the models on data up to 21 April. The prediction intervals are 95% pointwise envelopes for IHME and Los Alamos, and an 80% global envelope for the expected number of cases for GCAM. Both GCAM and the Los Alamos projections contain the observed mortality data within their credible intervals, but IHME does so less consistently. The credible intervals for the LANL model are notably wide.Forecasted deaths and 95 percent prediction interval for deaths up to August 4 from the GCAM model and from IHME.

How data were acquired Swabs for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 were biological inactivated with 2% SDS. Protein samples were run on a SDS-PAGE and processed for mass spectrometry analysis. Data was acquired using a nano-HPLC (UltiMate 3000, Thermo) coupled to a Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive Plus, Thermo). Protein identification and relative quantification were performed with PatternLab for Proteomics v4.0 software. Data was further analysed with Panther Server Classification System (http://pantherdb.org) Data format RAW data (ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD020394) and supplementary excel files with data analysis output, figures and tables.Five SARS-CoV-2 positive and five negatives oro-and naso-pharyngeal swabs were obtained from the COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory installed at Institut Pasteur de Montevideo. They were selected in a random way. Data from swabs samples origin was confidential and thus totally unknown.Sample was collected by health professionals from local public hospitals.  This dataset provides evidence of mass spectrometry detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins directly from clinical samples. Also offers insight into the human biological processes altered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This dataset is intended to be used by researches that have the aim to develop an alternative diagnosis tool based on mass spectrometry using clinical samples (oro/naso-pharyngeal swabs). Also, it would be useful for researchers in the areas of virology and immunology since it provides unbiased insights into host proteome response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The dataset set offers information of SARS-CoV-2 peptides detected from clinical samples and could be used for further development of alternative diagnostic strategies. Additionally, it gives preliminary information on biological processes and pathways turned on in oro-and nasopharyngeal mucosa in response to this viral infection. To deal with this pandemic, produced by a totally unknown infectious agent, the scientific community is carrying forward an unprecedented effort to rapidly generate knowledge and diagnostic methods with impact in the health of the people currently infected. In that sense, sharing this data could help to accelerate different human health related scientific developments.The proteomic dataset presented here was generated from oro-and naso-pharyngeal swabs obtained from the diagnostic pipeline implemented at Institut Pasteur de Montevideo. Five positive and 5 negative swabs were first inactivated and the proteins were extracted. Proteins were separated shortly (1 cm) in a SDS-PAGE and processed for mass spectrometry analysis as described in Materials and Methods section. We performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and we observed that negative and positive samples grouped separately (supplementary figure 1 ). Also, we were able to identify an average of 1100 proteins from each sample. Details regarding the identified proteins are depicted in Supplementary table 1 (molecular weight, protein coverage, spectrum count, proteins score and other statistical information is given). The nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 (Uniprot accession number: P0DTC9) was identified in all sample previously assigned as positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR standard diagnostic tool. The tryptic peptide RGPEQTQGNFGDQELIR (MH + = 1944.95) was systematically detected in all positive samples, even in those where the viral protein was identified with lower spectral counts. We further performed comparative and quantitative analyses of the datasets using PatternLab for Proteomics v4.0 software. The number of proteins uniquely detected in each sample group is shown in Figure 1 (Venn diagram). The most abundant proteins uniquely detected in positive swabs were the human proteins ""Guanylate-binding protein 1"" (Uniprot accession numbers P32455) ""HLA class II histocompatibility antigen DR beta chain"" (Unirpot accession number D7RIG5) and the nucleoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 (Uniprot accession number P0DTC9). Details regarding these and the other differentially detected proteins are depicted in Supplementary Table 2 (first and second tabs in the excel file show the list of proteins uniquely detected in positive and negative samples, respectively; information related to the number of replicates, spectrum count and description is given). Considering the proteins present in both conditions, we analysed the significant difference in relative abundance between the two sample sets by means of spectrum count. In this way, we found 57 proteins with increased relative abundance in positive samples and 24 proteins with increased relative abundance in negative samples. The results are shown as a Volcano plot where the x-axis represents the log2(p-value) and the y-axis the log2(fold change) ( Figure 2 ). Human proteins exclusively detected in positive samples together with those statistically increased in the same condition were considered to perform a biological processes overrepresentation test and a Reactome pathways analysis using Panther db (http://www.pantherdb.org/).The most significant overrepresented biological processes were ""SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane"", ""nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated decay"", ""viral transcription"" and ""translational initiation"". The most significant overrepresented Reactome pathways were ""SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane"", ""Viral mRNA Translation"", ""Peptide chain elongation"" and ""Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) enhanced by the Exon Junction Complex (ECJ)"".

Pathways with less than 5 proteins found in the input dataset were not considered.Samples were obtained by health professional at local public hospitals and delivered to the diagnostic laboratory located at Institut Pasteur de Montevideo. As it is a preliminary and exploratory research, information regarding any aspect of patients was confidential and totally unknown. Samples containing both, oro-and naso-pharyngeal swabs, in the same sample tube and without addition of transport media (to avoid contamination with medium proteins) were randomly chosen. Samples were previously analysed by standard qRT-PCR diagnostic method. We collected five SARS-CoV-2 positive and five negative samples. For viral inactivation, 2 mL of 2% SDS was added and incubated overnight at room temperature. Inactivation of SARS virus using SDS was reported in [1] . These procedures were performed in a Biosafety laboratory level 2.Protein extraction from swabs containing SDS solution was performed by vigorous vortexing. Supernatant was recovered and stored at -20 °C. Protein quantification was carried out by densitometry analysis in gels. For that purpose, 6 l of 4X loading SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to 18 l of each sample and heated for 10 min at 100°C. Samples were loaded into pre-cast gels (NuPAGE™ 4 to 12%, Bis-Tris, 1.0 mm, Mini Protein Gel, 10-well, Invitrogen). Five and 2.5 l of LMW-SDS Marker Kit (GE Healthcare) were also loaded to be used as standard. Electrophoresis was run at 150 V. Gels were fixed with 50% ethanol / 10% acetic acid, for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation and stained overnight with colloidal Coomassie blue in the same conditions. After destaining by ultrapure water washing, gel images were digitalized with UMAX Power-Look 1120 scanner and LabScan 5.0 software (GE Healthcare). Quantification was performed using ImageQuant TL software (v8.1), 1D analysis module, and the LMW-SDS Marker Kit (GE Healthcare) as standard. Then, 12.5 g of each sample were loaded into a 12.5% acrylamide gel, run at 10 mA per gel until samples enter 1 cm into the resolving gel. The gel was fixed and stained as described above. Gel fragment containing the samples were sliced with a scalpel and transferred to an eppendorf tube. Sample processing for mass spectrometry analysis was performed as described in [2] which includes sample reduction with 10 mM DTT at 56 °C for 1h with vigorous agitation; cysteine alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 45 min with vigorous agitation and protected from light; in gel protein digestion with 2 g trypsin (sequence grade, Promega) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, overnight at 37 °C; peptide extraction by the addition of 60% acetonitrile/ 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with vigorous agitation; and vacuum drying concentration.Samples were analysed by nano-LC MS/MS using a shotgun strategy on a nano-HPLC, UltiMate 3000 (Thermo) coupled on line to a Q-Exactive Plus (Q-Orbitrap) (Thermo) mass spectrometer through an Easy-Spray source (Thermo). Five g of tryptic peptides was injected into an Acclaim PepMap TM 100 C18 nano-trap column (75 m x 2 cm, 3 m particle size, Thermo) and separated using a 75 m x 50 cm, PepMap TM RSLC C18 analytical column (2 m particle size, 100 Å, Thermo) at a constant flow rate of 250 nL/min and 40 °C. Column was equilibrated at 1% of mobile phase B (A: 0.1% formic acid; B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) followed by an elution gradient from 1% to 35% B over 150 min and 35% to 99% B over 20 min. Two technical replicates were run for each sample.The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive mode. Ion spray voltage was set at 1.7 kV; capillary temperature at 250 °C and S-lens RF level at 50. Mass analysis was carried out with a data dependent mode in two steps: PatternLab for Proteomics (version 4.0) software (http://www.patternlabforproteomics.org) [3] was employed to generate a target-reverse database using sequences from Homo sapiens and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, both downloaded from Uniprot consortium in June, 2020 (http://www.uniprot.org). In addition, 127 common mass spectrometry contaminants were incorporated. Thermo raw files were searched against the database using the software integrated Comet search engine applying the following parameters: trypsin as proteolytic enzyme with full specificity and 1 missed cleavage; oxidation of methionine as variable modification, carbamidomethylation of cysteines as fixed modification; 40 ppm of tolerance from the measured precursor m/z. XCorr and Z-Score were used as the primary and secondary search engine scores, respectively. Peptide spectrum matches were filtered using the Search Engine Processor (SEPro) and acceptable FDR criteria was set on 1% at the protein level. PatternLab's Buzios module was employed to perform a principal component Analysis (supplementary figure 1 ). PatternLab's Approximately Area Proportional Venn Diagram module was used to compare the proteins identified in positive and negative swabs and to determine which proteins were uniquely detected in each sample set using a probability value of 0.05 as a filtering option. PatternLab's T-Fold module was used to detect proteins present in both conditions but at significantly different relative abundance by spectral count analysis.A statistical overrepresentation test was performed using the Panther Server Classification System (http://pantherdb.org) released 2020-04-07 [4] . The annotation data set ""GO biological processes complete"" and ""Reactome pathway"" were used for analysis. The release date of GO ontology dataset was 2020-03-23. The protein showing significant increased relative abundances in positive swabs were used for analysis. Homo sapiens database was used as reference List.All proteomic data have been deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD020394 and is available [5] .Oro-and naso-pharyngeal samples were remitted to Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, that has been validated by the Ministry of Health of Uruguay as an approved center providing diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Samples were deidentified and anonymised before receipt by the study investigators. Samples were selected in a random way. Data from swabs samples origin was confidential and thus totally unknown.",Uruguay,first author,2020-08-05,8
97bf3b6c5543182cff60d5b53950176165429f6b,An estimate of the COVID-19 infection fatality rate in Brazil based on a seroprevalence survey,"The infection fatality rate (IFR) is one of the most important quantities of any new disease. An accurate estimate of both the case fatality rate (CFR) and IFR is thus usually a challenge before the end of a pandemic. 1 It is, nevertheless, a very important endeavor as it has direct implications on the amount of resources and effort that should be allocated to prevent the spread of the disease and help steer policy-making in general. For instance using the United States as reference, Perlroth et al. 2 concluded that a CFR below 1% makes schoolclosures and social distancing not cost-effective.In Brazil, a large random seroprevalence study was performed by the EPICOVID19-BR team 23 which aimed to test 250 individuals in each of the 133 selected large sentinel cities. It has so far been carried out in 3 stages using the Wondfo lateral flow test for immunoglobulin M and G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The first stage was conducted between May 14 and 21, 2020, but did not reach its target number of samples, and in only 90 of the 133 cities at least 200 tests were performed. The total number of tests in all cities was 25025. Round 2 was conducted from June 4 to 7 and reached over 200 tests in 120 cities. Considering all cities a total of 31165 individuals were tested. Round 3 was performed between June 21 and 24 and made over 200 tests in all 133 cities for a total of 33207 tests. The total number of tests in all rounds was 89397, see Figure 1 .The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly affected Brazil. 24 The federal government response has been heavily criticized, 25 and in August 2020 the number of confirmed cases and deaths crossed 3 million and 100 thousand, respectively, second only to the USA in raw numbers. Furthermore, strong ethnic end regional variations in hospital mortality were found, casting doubts on the availability of public health care for the sections of society that cannot afford private care. 26 This daring situation motivates even further the need for an estimation of the IFR which is as accurate as possible in order to trigger an adequate political response to the crisis.As summarized by Figure 1 , in order to estimate the IFR we make use of three complementary datasets. We compute the percentage p a (t) of Brazilians that have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 at the city, state and Brazilian levels via the EPICOVID19-BR data. We robustly correct for false positive and negative rates and combine prevalences from different cities without neglecting the non-Gaussian nature of the distributions (details in the Supplementary Materials). The result is shown in Figure 2 and in Table I (the federal state acronyms explanation and full numerical tables can be found in the Supplementary Materials). We note a sharp increase in prevalence between rounds 1 and 2, and a subsequent stabilization between rounds 2 and 3. The state of Pará (PA) exhibits an unexpected sharp decrease in prevalence in the last round, possibly due to a heterogeneity in the sampled population.We obtain the number of fatalities via the public Painel Coronavírus dataset. 27 Painel Coronavírus is the Brazilian reference to keep track of the pandemic at the federal level and provides the deaths by COVID-19 with their geographic location.Using this combined information we can then compute the IFR at the state and country levels:wheret is the time of a given EPICOVID19-BR phase.The results for Brazil are given in Table I and Figure 3 , the ones for the states (combining all rounds) in Figure 4 . We see in Figure 3 that round 3 exhibits a considerably higher IFR, which we explore below. We note significant statistical tensions in the data of two states: Pará (PA) and Roraima (RR). We therefore consider their IFR estimates unreliable, but due to their small population they have insignificant impact on the IFR estimates at the country-level. The numerical results for all the states and for the three rounds separately can be found in the Supplementary Materials. The confidence interval was computed by combining the statistical sources of error and including the non-Gaussian nature of the distributions.Our overall estimate of the IFR of 1.05% (95% CI: 0.96-1.17%) is in agreement with some, but not all, of the previous world estimates discussed earlier. In particular, at the country level, our combined estimate agrees qualitatively with the one by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, 16 even though their result falls outside our 95% CI. At the state level we also find some disagree- ment between their values and our 95% CIs, see Figure 4 . Our estimate is also very precise: the statistical error is smaller than the aforementioned similar studies. However, it may suffer from a number of systematic biases related to each of the three datasets, which we now discuss. First, we are assuming that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain present in the patients. Indeed, there are reports that IgG levels fade in recovered patients on a timescale of a few months. 30 Even if confirmed, this effect should have only a small impact on our results since the last round of EPICOVID19-BR was performed on 22/Jun/2020, still early in the Brazilian epidemic progression. In fact, the number of confirmed cases in Brazil had increased over 20-fold in the preceding 2 months, which means that our IFR estimates must be dominated by recent infections. In any case, the fading of IgG levels leads to an underestimate of p a and an overestimate of the IFR.ture. As we are analyzing the 133 large sentinel cities that entered the EPICOVID19-BR survey this bias is not expected to be sizable. Its effect is, nonetheless, the underestimation of the IFR.A third potential bias comes from the fact that the time in Painel Coronavírus is not the actual time of death but rather the time of notification. In order to alleviate this issue and also average out oscillations due to weekends, we smooth the dn d /dt data according to a forward 7-day moving average (details in the Supplementary Materials).Finally, the SIVEP-Gripe dataset is biased towards cases with severe symptoms. Indeed, there is a significant number of cases that are hospitalized when symptoms are notified (see Supplementary Materials). We took this into account via a delay parameter τ ∆ = τ sd − τ sivep sd = 2 ± 1 days (see Table II ) which models the time that a patient takes to go from symptoms onset to severe symptoms (details in the Supplementary Materials). Had we set τ ∆ = 0, we would have obtained for the IFR in Brazil a value of 1.02% (95% CI: 0.93-1.13%), a 3% lower estimate.It is important to stress that the overall IFR we computed is relative to the 133 large cities that were tested by the EPICOVID19-BR survey. These cities amount to 35.5% of the Brazilian population and one may speculate that the IFR may be different in smaller cities and rural or poorer areas.As new medications and treatment protocols for the disease are discovered and become available it is hoped that the IFR will decrease. Since our data comes from the first months of the pandemic, our results therefore also set a baseline for future comparisons of the fight against COVID-19 in Brazil.Concluding, we hope that our careful evaluation of the IFR in Brazil will help reinforce, at the federal, state and municipal levels, the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgency of taking the proper actions in order to reduce its societal and economic impact.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-21,8

All the gathered data from Twitter were retrieved using a set of keywords in Portuguese: corona, coronavirus, COVID, COVID19, COVID-19, distanciamento social (social distancing), isolamento (isolation), lockdown, quarentena (quarantine), ivermectina (ivermectin), tamiflu, cloroquina (chloroquine), azitromicina (azithromycin), hidroxicloroquina (hydroxychloroquine), pandemia (pandemic), and comorbidade (comorbidity). These keywords were selected due to their popularity in web sites, such as Google Trends (https://trends.google.com.br), when associated to COVID-19. Also, all news were retrieved from COVID-19 sections of UOL web site. All the data were gathered from January 1 to May 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first public dataset of tweets and news on COVID-19 in Portuguese language and it has a considerable quantity of data. Figure 1 shows the daily distribution of the gathered tweets and news. We noticed that the discussions on COVID-19 topic across both platforms started to take off in late March. That occurred after the first death due to coronavirus in the Brazil [1] . Interestingly, the low points on the chart refer to weekends and holidays, showing a decrease on the number of posts by both users and journalists. Figure [ 1] also shows that the number of news published on COVID-19 in the last weeks of May is decreasing, while the number of tweets on this topic still remains high. The reason for this difference between the graphics may be due to the difference in interest between the two platforms on the same topic. Since the raw data were huge, we had to filter and create different and specific datasets. All of them are available in a Mendeley dataset. Our data collection has been created according to Twitter's Terms & Conditions [2] and UOL's rules [3] . Table 1 presents the name of each dataset and a brief description of its fields. It is worth mentioning that all the datasets from Twitter contain the field tweet_id, which is a unique tweet identifier that can be used to join other data from Twitter from its API, like tweet metadata. The text news from UOL are available in its own dataset.Description Fields In December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China was reported [4, 5] . Due to the rapid spread of the virus in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a state of emergency. In Latin America, there were 937,974 cases of COVID-19 and 49,139 confirmed deaths until May 31, 2020 [6] . In South America, Brazil is the country most affected by the disease. According to the same report [6] , there were 465,166 infected cases and 27,878 deaths in Brazil.Due to the spread of the disease in the world, social media platforms and news web sites have become places where there is an intense and continuous exchange of information between government agencies, professionals and general public. A representative number of scientific studies have shown that social media and news sites can play an important role as a source of data for crisis analysis and also for understanding people's attitudes and their behavior during a pandemic [7, 8, 9] .In order to assist the monitoring of public health and also to support decision making by professionals, several monitoring systems have been developed to classify large amounts of data from social media. This data can be used to quickly identify the thoughts, attitudes, feelings and topics that occupy people's minds in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic [10] . Systematic analysis of these data can help policy makers and health professionals to identify issues of greatest interest to the population and resolve them in the most appropriate way.We collected news articles and tweets regarding COVID-19, in Portuguese, from January until May in 2020. For tweets collection, we used Twitterscraper (https://pypi.org/project/twitterscraper) Python library and we considered a set of keywords in Portuguese related to COVID-19 to filter the Twitter stream and obtain relevant tweets about the pandemic. The distribution of the collected data over for each keyword is shown in Figure 2 . In order to retrieve tweets only in Portuguese, we used the option --lang in Twitterscraper. Furthermore, we used the Google Translator to identify the language of collected tweets, and to discard those not in Portuguese. Twitter metadata presents a location entry, however, we noticed that very few users fill in this field and many of those users fill in nonstandard labels. Thus, to keep a high number of tweets, we have chosen to filter by Portuguese language, once Brazil is the biggest country speaking this language (around 75% in the world1). Besides, we manually evaluated the tweets that informed the location, and only 4% (four percent) are from people who speak Portuguese and are not in Brazil. For news collection, we gathered all the articles published in a specific COVID-19 section from UOL portal, so we didn't have to filter by keywords. We have chosen UOL because it is responsible for publishing the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper and it is the leading Brazilian newspaper by daily circulation [11] . Figure 3 shows that the distribution of the news articles over each keyword is very close to the tweet collection. This indicates that there is a convergence of interest on a specific topic between journalists and social media users. On Twitter, users post short public messages that are referred as tweets. These tweets can be sorted into categories by the inclusion of hashtags, or words or phrases beginning with a hash mark (#) and ending in whitespace, within the bodies of tweets. The use of hashtags (#) on Twitter allows followers to collate discussions around specific topics, including public health themes or events. In order to facilitate the identification of tweets that have hashtags for researchers or data enthusiasts, we created the dataset called Hashtags.Wordcloud is a popular text analysis tool that provides a visualization of word frequency in the source text while giving more prominence to words that occur more often. Figure 4 shows a wordcloud visualization of the 50 most frequently encountered hashtags in the dataset. It provides a general overview of the dominant terms related to the COVID-19 topic. We can observe that medical treatment, control procedures, and political issues are the most common themes discussed by users. Twitter users usually post images and videos, in addition to texts. This type of content published in periods of crisis, such as pandemics and disasters, has been investigated by several researchers [12, 13, 14] . The image and video data produced during crises has potential value in helping researchers to understand the social experience during difficult times. In order to facilitate the identification of tweets that have images or videos for researchers or data enthusiasts, we created the dataset called Media. Figure [5] shows the percentage of tweets that were published with at least one image or video. The impact of the current pandemic can be explored by looking at more frequent corpus terms in the Portuguese language. They are significantly more present in those months than in the corpus as a whole. Table 2 shows the 20 most frequent terms from January to May, 2020, and it was generated based on general.csv dataset. We can observe that they all are related to COVID-19, thus demonstrating that our queries were well chosen. Although we used some drug names as keywords in queries, these terms were not as popular with users. This may indicate that people do not usually exchange information about medicines via Twitter.In accordance with Twitter's Developer Policy [2] , all data include only tweet IDs. User IDs and personally identifying information were removed from all tweet contents and metadata.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-18,8
544435b574e6321a593853861bf792ac022e5be8,The SARS-COV-2 outbreak around the Amazon rainforest: the relevance of the airborne transmission,"The ray of light that runs through a dark room reveals the existence of numerous small grains of dust that can float in the air for a long time. Since antiquity, this phenomenon was already known. A famous observation of this effect is documented in Lucretius's poem De Rerum Natura, written around 50 BC. In addition to the empirical description of the phenomenon, and following the tradition of Democritus and Epicurus, Lucretius also proposed an atomistic explanation for the support of particles in the air, according to which their weight would be compensated by the collisions of air atoms. 1 However, the behavior of tiny bodies immersed in fluids was only understood from the 19th century on owing to the works of Robert Brown, 2 George Gabriel Stokes, and finally with Einstein's famous work of 1905, On the movement of small particles in suspension within liquids at rest.Currently, this phenomenon has gained tragic relevance due to the uncontrolled dispersion of the Covid-19 throughout the planet, since airborne transmission is one of the forms of viral contamination, as well as the direct reception of drops exhaled by a contaminated person and the contact with infected surfaces. There is still no consensus among researchers as to which of these forms of contagion is the most important in the case of the coronavirus. Despite being the third outbreak of this virus in less than two decades, existing research had not yet fully understood its transmission mechanisms. A similar situation occurred with the Influenza virus. While some important books and works drew attention to the relevance of the transmission by aerosols (droplets), [3] [4] [5] other authors argued that short-distance transmission by drops would be the main means of infection, 6, 7 and this latter position prevailed for a long time among health authorities who practically ignored airborne transmission. 8, 9 At the end of March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a bulletin stating that there was insufficient scientific evidence that SARS-COV-2 was significantly airborne transmitted. A few months ago, at the beginning of the current pandemic, several governments and the most important health authorities on the planet recommended that only hand washing and a distance of two meters between people would be safe protection procedures and that the use of masks was unnecessary throughout the population. However, with the rapid spread of the coronavirus in countries and in the world, the deadly reality has imposed itself and forced the planetary health authorities to reverse this directive, saving thousands of lives by requiring the use of masks in several countries. From a scientific point of view, this late change in positioning was the authorities' recognition that air transmission of SARS-COV-2 is an unquestionable fact. Nevertheless, it remains to be understood how this 3 process takes place. In this article we will clarify the physical processes involved in this means of contamination and explain theoretically the results of recent epidemiologic experiments. Besides, we will discuss some recent relevant epidemiologic papers and analyze the SARS-COV-2 outbreak around the Amazon rainforest that may help to understand the relevance of the long-range viral airborne transmission. Finally, we will show that there are still some important recommendations that health authorities should indicate to reduce viral transmissibility.The airborne transmission of the coronavirus is now experimentally well demonstrated by important works published during the last months. A relevant study issued in the journal Nature revealed the existence of the RNA of the SARS-COV-2 in aerosols collected from the air of several closed environments and open places of two hospitals in Wuhan dedicated only to patients infected with Covid-19 (12) . 10 Another paper analyzed the air at the Nebraska Hospital Center and also found the SARS-COV-2 in most environments occupied by patients with mild and moderate infections. 11 In these two studies it was not possible to confirm if these viruses were active. However, this doubt was finally resolved by a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine,where the presence of active SARS-COV-2 in droplets was observed more than three hours after they were artificially produced in the laboratory (65% of relative humidity and temperatures between 21-23ºC). 12 Now, it is certain that under normal day-to-day conditions SARS-COV-2 remains active for hours in the droplets suspended in the air.Extensive study published in The Lancet journal, analyzing empirical data from 16 countries on 6 continents, concluded that the probability of infection by SARS-CoV-2 decreases by 10·6% when using a protection for the eyes. 13 That is, the risk of contagion through the eyes is very high and continues to be minimized by health authorities, including the WHO, as had happened in the case of masks. This may be a new mistake in combating the pandemic.Besides these experiments, there were several empirical situations that put in The striking difference observed between the north and south regions could not be explained by the issue of social isolation, since both adopted, almost simultaneously, similar isolation measures. Nor is it due to the greater poverty in the northern region, as the southern States also have a large number of inhabitants living in precarious dwellings, including thousands of slums, which would facilitate the rapid spread of the virus. A possible difference in health care system between regions could also not be claimed as an explanation of this phenomenon, as it would not justify the sudden drop in the number of deaths. So, the remarkable disparity in the evolution of the contamination in these regions needs to be deeply investigated.A factor that can play an important role in the spread of SARS-COV-2 is the climate. During the months investigated in this work, in the regions surrounding the forest, the average temperatures were always above 30ºC and the average relative humidity, above 80%. In southern States, average temperatures and average relative humidity were not higher than 22ºC and 50%, respectively. Therefore, there is no direct relationship between high ambient temperature and decreased transmissibility. On the other hand, some studies showed that, in general, in environments with relative humidity above 60%, approximately, the drops absorb more than evaporate water into the air. 23, 24 So, we believe that the airborne transmission of the SARS-COV-2, facilitated by the high humidity of the air, could be a primary factor in the development of the epidemic in Brazil. Our hypothesis is confirmed by other studies conducted in some cities in Brazil at the beginning of the pandemic, although these studies use the number of cases as an analysis variable. 25, 26 To better understand this relationship, it is interesting to know the amount of water vapor that actually exists in the atmosphere, that is, its absolute humidity.A similar situation has occurred in abattoirs in France, Germany, and the USA that have become huge poles of contamination. The dominant explanation for this phenomenon has been the airborne transmission facilitated by the low temperature of these environments. We agree that the aerial contagion was responsible for the spread of the virus in the abattoirs. However, the pandemic evolution in Brazil, Middle East, Europe, China, and USA has demonstrated that habitual temperatures seem to have little influence on the survival of the virus in the external environment. Therefore, we believe that also in the abattoirs the most important factor was the very high humidity of the air perpetuity.It is now experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that airborne contagion by SARS-COV-2 can occur long after an infected person has spoken, coughed, or sneezed in an environment. These scientific results call into question one of the main recommendations of health authorities to contain the outbreak: the distance of 1m to 2m between people would be a safe method of prevention. This indication is based only on old studies about the direct transmission by larger drops, dangerously ignoring the contamination by the virus airborne in droplets that remain suspended in the air for several hours, and even days after the environment has been visited by an infected person. This recommendation created in the population the false idea that, by staying two meters from each other, it is not necessary to use a mask or other protections. Even the highest leaders of the WHO conduct daily interviews without a mask.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.perpetuity.The very high SARS-COV-2 transmission rates in Amazonian States in Brazil and many abattoirs around the world provide empirical corroboration of the relevance of the airborne way of contagion. These two environments have high air humidity that allows viruses to survive much longer in droplets in suspension or deposited on surfaces.Therefore, air humidity seems to be the major climatic factor in the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. On the other hand, apparently, there is no direct relationship between high ambient temperature and decreased transmissibility. Besides, the collective immunity in Amazonian States may have been achieved with a contamination rate of around 15% of the population, much lower than predict conventional statistical studies, and which would have an extraordinary impact on pandemic management across the planet.The argument that the wind disperses the drops has made people feel more protected in open places. However, the same wind that can disperse the drops can also carry them and project them on passersby, whether on the beach, on the street, in the elevator, at home, or on public transport. So, in addition to the mask the use of eye protection should also be recommended. It should not be forgotten that drops in suspension can also be deposited on our face, hair, and clothes.Finally, another important alert about air conditioning and heating systems comes from our calculations: if they are poorly positioned and/or sized, they can work as a dangerous spreader of viruses.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-07,8
d32ba1d8102e33885145f63718abe1b3b0215e9c,Lower cost alternatives for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19: conventional RT-PCR and SYBR Green-based RT-qPCR,"In December 2019, an increase in the number of severe pneumonia cases was reported in China, more specifically in the Hubei Province [1] . In January, the causative agent was identified as a new β-coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2. The progressive number of cases and the fast dissemination to other countries led the World Health Organization (WHO) to officially declare the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. In March, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic infection. According to WHO (last update: 2 May 2020), 215 countries or territories were affected with 238.628 deaths and more than 3.349.786 confirmed cases [2] .In Brazil, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on February 26 in the State of São Paulo, considered the epicenter of the disease in the country [3] . Since then, the number of confirmed cases has been growing, steadily reaching the highest number of cases by day at the beginning of April, with around 1000 cases per day (Brazil, Ministry of Health, 2020 -https:// covid.saude.gov.br). Until May 2, 2020, the total number of cases was 96.559 with 6.750 deaths (lethality rate of~6.8%). However, only severe cases were tested due to a lack of testing reagents in the market and the number of cases can be far higher.For this reason, the WHO advises that, in addition to isolation, massive diagnostic testing must be implemented in affected areas [4] . The SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity is a major issue worldwide and the development of alternative tests is urgently needed, particularly in developing countries where availability of supplies or infrastructure to carry out the real-time PCR test is limited. Thereby, the aim of this study was the standardization of alternative molecular methods, with lower cost and easier availability of reagents, for the diagnosis of COVID-19. It was based on the SYBR Green method and conventional PCR utilizing primers described by Corman et al. [5] .A total of 700 nasopharyngeal (NP)/oropharyngeal (OP) swabs was collected from symptomatic patients and asymptomatic/healthcare worker during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of São Paulo, Brazil (from February 28 to April 28), and 184 (26.3%) were positive by qRT-PCR, from which 63 positive samples were selected for the study. The selection of the 63 nasopharyngeal (NP)/oropharyngeal (OP) samples from 700 patients with suspected COVID-19 was carried out according to the Ct (cycle threshold) that were split into three different groups according to the Ct: Group 1 was composed of 19 samples with Ct ranging from 15.00 to 20.99. Group 2 was composed of 27 samples with Ct ranging from 21.00 to 29.99 and group 3 was composed of 17 samples with Ct ranging from 30.00 to 38.99. All considered positive by real-time PCR According to Corman et al. [5] . The samples were collected in five hospitals in the São Paulo City: (1) University Hospital at São Paulo University (HU-USP); (2) Santa Casa da Misericórdia Hospital (SCMH); (3) Hospital São Luiz Gonzaga (HSLG); (4) Infant Hospital Candido Fontoura (IHCF); (5) Pediatric Hospital Menino Jesus (PHMJ). The samples were divided into three different age groups, with 8 samples under the age of 18 years (school age), 52 samples were from patients aged 19 to 60 years (adult age), and 3 samples were from patients over 60 years of age (adult in the risk group). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Research with Human Beings at the University of São Paulo and all the procedures followed the ethical guidelines for human experimentation (CAAE) 74683917.1.0000.5467.The extraction of RNA from clinical samples was carried out on the NucliSens easyMag® platform fully automated (BioMerieux, Lyon, France) and all 63 samples selected in this study also were extracted using guanidinium isothiocyanate phenol (Brazol, LGC Biotecnologia, Brazil), according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used as positive controls a clinical isolated in Vero-E6 cell culture (SARS.COV-2/SP02/ human2020/Br, GenBank accession number MT126808.1) and water with a negative control. For complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, when necessary, we used the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μL of the extracted sample is diluted in a mix of 3.2 μL of DEPC-treated water, 2 μL of RT Buffer (× 10 concentrate), 2 μL of RT Random Primers (× 10 concentrate), 0.8 μL of dNTP mix (100 mM), 1 μL of RNase inhibitor (20 U/μL), and 1 μL of Multiscribe™ Reverse Transcriptase (50 U/μL). The reverse transcriptase reaction carried in Veriti Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) following the cycling: 25°C for 10 min, 37°C for 120 min, and 85°C for 5 min.All the steps of molecular biology diagnosis followed strict procedures to prevent contamination, including redundant negative controls and segregated environments for pre-and post-amplification procedures. The SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay (one step) was performed, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, with the QuantiFast SYBR® Green RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Briefly, 8 μL of target RNA and 1 μL [10pM/μL] from each primer (E-Sarbeco F1 and R2) [5] were added to the 12.5 μL 2x Master Mix QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR, 0.25 μL of enzyme RT-Mix and Ultra-Pure Water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to complete 25 μL of reaction. The reverse transcription reaction was performed at 50°C for 10 min, followed by 5-min denaturation at 95°C, 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, and 60°C for 30 s. The reaction was completed by determining the dissociation curve of all amplicons generated in the ABI 7500 device (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). The SYBR Green qPCR reactions (two steps) were carried out in a 20-μL final volume containing 10 μL of 2X PowerUp SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany), 2 μL of each primer [10 pM/μL], 5 μL of cDNA, and 1 μL of Ultra-Pure Water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The thermal cycling conditions used were as follows: 50°C for 2 min, followed by 5 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 58°for 15 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a dissociation curve was subsequently made. Both reactions were performed using an ABI 7500 machine (Applied Biosystems).Two conventional RT-PCR methods were tested, including one-step RT-PCR and two-steps PCR. The one-step protocol used the Pyromark OneStep RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The analytical sensitivity of the assays was determined with 8 serials 10-fold dilutions with an isolated sample of the SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2/SP02/human/2020/BRA (GenBank accession number MT126808.1) strain is a clinical isolated, propagated and titrated in Vero-E6 cells, from Instituto Adolfo Lutz (ATCC), and stored in liquid nitrogen in our laboratories as ICB-Cell-Culture-Collection. All 8 diluted samples were tested by gold standard TaqMan RT-qPCR and the resulting cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared for the determination of viral titers. We also tested each of the proposed assays with 63 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples previously tested by TaqMan-based real-time RT-qPCR in our laboratory. The obtained Ct was subsequently compared with the results generated with SYBR Green-based real-time qPCR. The limit of detection of SYBR Green RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR was determined using synthetic RNA-positive controls provided by the University of Charité (Germany) and serial dilutions of the virus isolate.For the present study, we evaluated the performance of two molecular methods. As the first step, we determined the specificity of the tests and, as shown in Table 1 , none of the 17 clinical samples positive for other respiratory viruses was amplified by the proposed methods (Fig. S1 ). In addition, 36 previously negative samples for SARS-CoV-2 by the TaqMan RT-qPCR method were also negative in all the other two methods, showing 100% specificity (Table 1) .To evaluate the sensitivity of the two alternative molecular diagnostic tests, we first tested the SYBR Green RT-qPCR. The method showed positive reactions with all serial dilutions of the SARS-Cov-2 isolate with Ct values ranging from 2.79 to 3.77 (3.51 average) with regard to the gold standard RT-qPCR by the TaqMan protocol ( Fig. 1a and b; Table S1 ). On the other hand, The RT-PCR methods (one-step RT-PCR and two-steps PCR amplified the DNA fragment with the expected size until dilution 10 −7 (Fig. 1c and d, respectively) . No other fragments with sizes different of 113 bp were observed.Of the 63 clinical samples identified by RT-qPCR by the TaqMan method [5] , only one was negative by the SYBR Green RT-qPCR method (36.95 TaqMan Ct value). The Ct values of both methods were similar to a difference in Ct of 1.92 on average (Fig. 2a) . In addition, 59 out of 63 samples (93%) were clearly detected by the tested one-step and two-step RT-PCR methods (Fig. 2b  and c) . The unamplified samples by these methods have Ct values ranging from 36.16 to 38.99 by the TaqMan RT-qPCR. Thus, the tested RT-PCRs could detect positive samples with maximal Ct of 35.98. All results generated by the tested alternative methods are shown in the Supplementary Material (Table S2 ).The rapid spread and elevated morbidity and mortality rates of the SARS-CoV-2 led to a global public health emergency state. Statistical analyses suggest that several millions will be infected in the coming months [7, 8] , challenging public health systems and highlighting the importance of efficient diagnostic tests for preventing virus dissemination. The current gold standard diagnostic method for COVID-19, based on the TaqMan RT-qPCR assay, is efficient but not accessible to laboratories in developing countries based on the elevated costs and the present global demands for supplies and reagents. Thus, the use of reference primer sets for conventional amplification protocols could represent low-cost alternatives with preserved specificity and sensibility [9] . Our results demonstrated that both SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay and two conventional RT-PCR protocols represent valuable alternatives for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2.None of the tested alternative diagnostic methods showed amplification of another respiratory virus, including other β- These results support a previous report of Corman et al. [5] .In addition, our data indicate that the probes recommended for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 by the TaqMan RT-qPCR are not the only ones capable to confer the required specificity with regard to other respiratory viruses. The SARS-CoV-2 was capable to detect all tested dilutions of the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 isolate with low Ct value differences with regard to the reference method. On the other hand, the two tested conventional RT-PCR assays were capable to detect the genetic material of the virus up to a 10 −7 dilution (corresponding to a Ct value of 33.37 in the reference TaqMan RT-qPCR) in agarose gels. The higher sensitivities of both RT-qPCR methods in comparison to RT-PCR methods were expected [9] [10] [11] . Nonetheless, we believe that conventional RT- PCR methods may be adequate to detect the virus at the onset of the disease symptoms and among patients with severe symptoms when higher viral loads are observed [12, 13] . Furthermore, adding higher RNA or cDNA loads in the reaction mix may improve the sensitivity of the tests and, consequently, enhance the detection of lower viral loads.Although the conventional RT-PCR method requires more time to deliver the result, the technique still proved to be very efficient and indispensable in times of pandemic, where even in the most remote places in the world the diagnosis can be made.In summary, the two protocols tested were suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, particularly in places where the reference TaqMan RT-qPCR is not available. Thus, the proposed protocols represent alternatives with lowcost reagents and readily available for the screening and molecular diagnosis of COVID-19; however, it would be necessary and extremely important that the health departments and health ministries of each country or city, validate and officially release the use of these methods as recognized diagnostics for COVID-19. 2018 Availability of data and material Available in request.Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Ethics approval Our institutional review board approved this study and all biological samples were collected under the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Science (ICB), USP.Code availability Not applicable.

4ff017ecf2cbbf11c992cc4a9a29933a1a9eab2c,The effect of public health policies in the transmission of COVID-19 for South American countries AUTHORS,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). COVID-19 was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China (2) and have caused serious public health concern in over 213 countries (3) . Several public health measures-social isolation, temporary closure of borders, temporary closure of academic institutions and public places, and quarantine-have been used to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. South American (SA) countries have fragile public health systems, thus, COVID-19 has a detrimental impact on their population health (4).Given the importance of assessing the public health interventions to monitor their effectiveness, we estimated both reproduction numbers (R0 and Rt) to identify the impact of the initial public health interventions in South America.We used the data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (13) . The database is publicly available and contains the worldwide geographic distribution of COVID-19. The database is updated daily and provide new cases and deaths by country and date of notification.We extracted the data from ten South America countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Containment and mitigation decrees issued by each country against COVID-19 were found in government's official webpages. (Appendix 1).The following binary variables were recorded for each country for qualitative analysis: Isolation, separation of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in a healthcare facility or their home; Quarantine, social restriction and home containment of persons with suspected or known contact with a patient with COVID-19, or individuals with a travel history to Europe or Asia; Social distancing, group of measures related to the prevention of mass gathering, closure of academic institutions, and cancellation of social and public events; Community-wide containment, mandatory isolation of every citizen of the country in their home, with only permission to acquire life supplies (i.e., food or water) in restricted hours of the day (14) .Basic reproductive number (R0) and time-dependent reproductive number (Rt) R0 is used to determine the early-outbreak transmission dynamics of a specific infectious pathogen. This parameter estimates the expected number of newly infected people that arise from effective contact with an ill person (15) . We estimated R0 using data for the two weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in each country. The time frame was selected based on the maximum period to symptoms onset and because the period of exponential growth rate must be used to compute R0 to avoid its underestimation. We specified the prior serial interval distribution using a Gamma distribution with a mean serial time of 3.96 days and a standard deviation of 4.75 days, based on a contact tracing study conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (16) . R0 was estimated with the maximum likelihood method described by White and Pagano (17) .The Rt accounts for the expected number of secondary cases that a primary case would produce at time t. We estimated Rt from the time series of daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in each country, using the novel methods described by Thompson et al. and specifying the same Gamma distribution specification as we did for R0 (18). We chose a 5-day moving window to elucidate the time trend exhibited by Rt. A previous study in China used a 10-day moving window to report Rt (19) ; however, they specified a mean serial time of 7.5 days, a misspecification of the mean by a factor of two with respect to the CDC contact tracing study. We, thus, chose a finer window to account for the faster spreading dynamics we specify in our models and estimate the number after 90 days for each country.Likewise, the time to implement a community-wide containment varied among SA countries.The reproduction number -R0 or Rt -is a measure that depends on the socio-cultural dynamics of a specific population (15) . Human behaviors play a critical role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as person-to-person contact exposes a susceptible person through respiratory droplets from an infected individual (23) . Therefore, mitigation measures, such as social distancing or case isolation, are necessary to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Ideal policies should be country-specific, and the overall objective is to reduce R0 (mitigation) or to reach an R0 <1 (suppression). Regardless of the aim, a combination of measures are the best strategy (12).Three countries, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay opted for a mitigation strategy. Ferguson et al.suggest that the best mitigation strategy is the combination of social distancing of high-risk groups (elders and patients at risk of severe disease), case isolation, and quarantine (12).Here we highlight several explanations for the change between R0 and Rt. First, the implementation of public health measures by some countries within the first week of the outbreak could have lowered R0. These laws aimed to reduce human contact, which, in turn, reduced the spread of the virus in the community. In contrast, the three countries with the highest R0 in the early phase issued their first mitigation laws ≥14 days, which gave SARS-CoV-2 a higher chance of transmissibility among the population. Second, the reproduction number is susceptible to the ability of each country to detect COVID-19 cases (25) . A lack of testing impairs the identification of cases within a community and provides limited data to estimate the reproduction number, generating unclear information to analyze the effect of mitigation or suppression interventions in a community. In addition, after notification of the first case, a number of cases tends to emerge in the subsequent days, thus inflating R0. Despite the international donations of test kits to identify and isolate cases (26, 27) , the fragile and fragmented structure of healthcare systems in South America deters a prompt diagnostic of true cases.Although we used national reports of COVID-19 cases, under reporting is likely, and difficult to quantify. True case identification correlates with the testing capacity of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which is difficult in any country and likely be impaired in SA countries.Our findings reflected a positive impact of the mitigation and suppression measures in SA nations to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Despite the fragile health system of most of these countries, the use of a combination of isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and communitywide containment has avoided a skyrocketing number of cases. The difference of R0 in the early phase of the outbreak is probably due to a combination between a shortage of testing and the public health measures adopted by each country. However, the peaks of Rt during the study period suggest that Latin America is still far from containing the spread of COVID.",Venezuela,abstract,2020-08-12,8
a2fef8addb841a434af1bfbe60eb8c4568a1286e,Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Modeling of COVID-19: Inequalities on Case-Fatality Risk,"The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 challenges health systems and epidemiological responses of all countries worldwide since its first report in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. [1] The number of human deaths associated with COVID-19 exceeds past coronavirus outbreaks, [2] and this number is increasing, mainly in the Americas. Several mitigation measures oriented to reduce the severity, named case-fatality rate (proportion of persons with COVID-19 who die from this disease), have been considered by various governments, as the household-based prevention model, which usually includes remote work and self-quarantine. Apparent differences in the COVID-19 case-fatality rate between regions [1] and temporal variations concerning the basic reproduction number R t [3] are indicators of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the mitigation measures and their effects. Indeed, the effectiveness of the mitigation measures depends on the time of its implementation, [4] and presumably, on other factors such as the proportion of individuals unable to working remotely, e.g., socioeconomically disadvantaged people who mostly depend on informal activities.Besides the dependence of COVID-19 on biological, clinical, and epidemiological aspects, [5] in this work, we will show that even in populations under similar mitigation measures, COVID-19 case-fatalities can be spatially heterogeneous. This anisotropy can intuitively be associated with barriers to health services, such as hospitals and intensive care units, however, other social and economic aspects could also cause health inequalities. [6] [7] [8] Thus, we provide quantitative evidence that socioeconomic factors are as relevant as the barriers to health services for health inequalities in the COVID-19 outbreak, i.e., the systematic, avoidable and unfair differences in health outcomes that can be observed between populations, social groups within the same population or as a gradient across a population ranked by social posi-tion. [9] Based on Bayesian non-spatio-temporal and spatio-temporal modeling, we evidenced multidimensional poverty risk factors namely educational, childhood/youth, employment, health, and dwelling poverty factors, that significantly affect the inequalities on COVID-19 case-fatality risk.Identify the factors that trigger health inequalities on the COVID-19 outbreak and its distribution over space described in terms of proximity, distance, clustering, and concentration, is fundamental to reduce the COVID-19 impact on vulnerable communities and enhance the effectiveness of mitigation measures through the implementation of individualized and effective strategies. Thus, our findings assist policy-makers in the spatial planning of strategies focused on mitigating case-fatalities in most vulnerable communities and preparing for future pandemics by progressively reduce the factors that generate health inequality.We use the COVID-19 death official reports by the National Institute of Health of Colombia (INS). [10] This study region has a population of around 50 million people distributed in 32 administrative units called departments and Bogotá D.C as the capital district. Colombian COVID-19 data can be interactively displayed on this dashboard (https://rpubs.com/gppoloi/ CoCo). The first death by COVID-19 in Colombia was reported on March 16, 2020, and in total, 13837 people have died, as the INS report of August 12, 2020. Data were smoothed considering a weekly calibration and aggregated at the departmental level, and all the departments with deaths reported from week 12 (from March 16) to week 31 (to August 02) of 2020 were considered. For this reason, six eastern departments were unconsidered. Thus, data summarising population-level deaths were spatiotemporally aggregated to a set of 27 non-overlapping areal units for 20 consecutive time intervals, in this way comprising a K × N matrix of spatio-temporal observed deaths.As proxy covariates of case fatality inequalities, we consider the Colombian Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) database. [9] The MPI is a complex index of deprivation and poverty comprising five dimensions: educational (EMPI), childhood/youth (YMPI), employment (WMPI), health (HMPI), and dwelling (DMPI) poverty conditions. These dimensions contain information on 15 variables (EMPI: illiteracy, low educational attainment; YMPI: school non-attendance, school lag, barriers to childhood care services, child labor; WMPI: informal employment, economic dependency; HMPI: lack of health insurance, barriers to health services; DMPI: lack of access to safe water, inadequate disposal of human feces, poor housing construction, and critical overcrowding), which contribute percentage differently in each department according to the adjusted MPI, which reflects information on the number of multidimensionally poor people (incidence of poverty) and the proportion of deprivations that this group dares.[11] As the calculation of the MPI changes from one year to the next, we only use data for one year, meaning this covariate will only capture the spatial variation in the case-fatality risk. [15] The childhood/young poverty dimension YMPI was considered as baseline to avoid collinearity, as HMPI+EMPI+YMPI+WMPI+DMPI = 100%, represents the percentages of contribution to each dimension to the adjusted MPI of each department.[11] Variables definition and a detailed explanation of the calculation of the adjusted MPI can be found in the supplementary material S1.Due to the heterogeneity of the population, we calculate a standardized case-fatality ratio (SCFR) employing an indirect standardization method for each Colombian department. [12] Thus, as shown in the Table S2 of supplementary material, we calculated age-specific expected deaths (E) for each age group in each department multiplying the values of the population projection for the year 2020 calculated using the 2018 population census,[13] by the case-fatality rate by age group previously established in Italy and China. [14] In this manner, we consider that areas with larger and more elderly populations are likely to exhibit a higher case-fatalities and avoid misleading comparisons using crude rates based on the population under study as a whole. Accordingly, the SCFR was computed for each department dividing the INS reported deaths (O) by the calculated expected deaths (E).A conditional autoregressive (CAR) model and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations were used to describe the variation in the SCFR, considering prior distributions for a set of spatial and temporal random effects. [15] This kind of model is usually proposed to analyze the epidemiological aspects of different disease dynamics. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Initially, a Poisson log-linear 4 All rights reserved.

The number of deaths is denoted by.., Y Kt ) denotes the K × 1 column vector of observed deaths for all K departments for the week t. The vector of covariate regression parameters is denoted by β, and a multivariate Gaussian prior was assumed with mean µ β and diagonal variance matrix Σ β .To check for the null hypothesis of spatial independence we used the Moran's I statistic based on 10,000 random permutations of the data given by:wherer is the mean of each MPI, r k denotes MPI's for the kth department and r j denote MPI's at another department j. W = (w k j), is a K × K neighbourhood matrix, where w kj = 1 if departments (k, j) share a common border, and w kj = 0, otherwise.Finally, we considered a spatio-temporal structure through a latent component for the department k and week t denoted by ψ kt , encompassing spatiotemporally autocorrelated random effects, and the complete set is denoted by ψ = (ψ 1 , ..., ψ N ), where ψ t = (ψ 1t , ..., ψ Kt ).

The temporal autocorrelation is thus induced via the mean ρ T φ t−1 , while spatial autocorrelation is induced byvector of ones and the K × K identity matrix respectively. Hence,the spatial autocorrelation is induced by the neighbourhood matrix W.We generated MCMC samples from three independent Markov chains. Each chain was run for 1100,000 samples, of which 100,000 were removed as the burn-in period and the remaining 1000000 samples were thinned by 1000 to remove correlation amongst the samples. This leaves 1000 samples for inference from each chain. All analyzes were conducted in R version Version 1.3.959, [22] using the 'CARBayesST' package version 3.1, [23] following the recently published manual on spatio-temporal disease risk modeling in R using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and the CARBayesST package. [15] The effects of each MPI on the COVID-19 SCFR were quantified as relative risks, for a fixed increase ξ in each covariates value. Thus, the relative risk for a ξ increase in each HMPI is computed by:Risk of death if HMPI increases by ψ Risk of death given the current value of HMPIand equivalently calculated for EMPI, WMPI, DMPI and YMPI.6 All rights reserved.

Standardized case-fatality rate Figure 1A shows the SCFR for the 27 departments from Colombia with deaths reported from week 12 (from March 16) to week 31 (to August 02) of 2020. An SCFR equals 1, which means than the observed fatality risk is equal to the expected one, was not observed in any department. La Guajira, Putumayo, Norte de Santander, Córdoba, and Cesar, represent the highest case-fatality risk departments for COVID-19. La Guajira, in northern Colombia, exhibited the highest case-fatality risk with a mean SCFR of 16.2, which corresponds to an increasing of 1620% in the observed COVID-19 deaths compared to the expected value over the 20 weeks study period. Casanare, in eastern, and Antioquia in northwestern Colombia were the departments with the lowest case-fatality risk with a mean SCFR of 1.1 and 1.5, which corresponds to a 10% and a 50% higher risk, respectively.For each department, the MPI is divided into the percentual contributions of each dimension (education, childhood/youth, employment, health, and dwelling), as described in Figure 1 . These percentage contributions range from 5% to 40%, where the highest ones are typically given by the education and employment dimensions (together correspond to more than 50%), as shown in Figure 1C and Figure 1E , respectively. The relation between the variation of the percentage contributions of each dimension and the temporal average SCFR is not visually apparent. For instance, Antioquia (index 2 in Figure 1A ) and Córdoba (index 13), which have one of the lowest (1.5) and highest (10.28) SCFR, respectively, are characterized by similar percentage contribution of the employment, health, and dwelling poverty dimensions. In contrast, in Santander (index 24) and Boyacá (index 6), which have the same SCFR (e.g., approximately 4), the percentage contributions of these poverty dimensions are also similar. Additionally, some spatial trends can be observed in the MPI dimensions. For instance, from western to eastern, Santander (index 24), Boyacá (index 6), Casanare (index 9), Meta (index 18), Cundinamarca (index 14), Bogotá DC (index 4), Caldas (index 7), Tolima (index 26), Cauca (index 10), and Nariño (index 19) have a percentage contribution of the health dimension to the MPI around 20% ( Figure 1B) . However, this trend is not followed by the SCFR (Figure 1A) , suggesting that the health dimension by itself does not explain the SCFR heterogeneity and therefore case-fatalities inequality. 7 All rights reserved.

No reuse allowed without permission.[11] Therefore, as HMPI is directly linked to self-reporting, we strengthen the importance of public strategies promoting the prompt self-reporting of symptoms associated with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure for the prevention of fatal cases. Furthermore, we verified that although the average COVID-19 testing turnaround time is similar across the country, the time from symptoms onset and the official notification/diagnostic is longer in social groups with low educational indicators (r = .6, p < .005). Furthermore, people living in more socio-economically disadvantaged regions have higher rates of the known clinical risk factors that increase the case-fatality risk of COVID-19. [8, 27] The provision of safe water, sanitation, and waste management are essential for preventing and protecting human health during the COVID-19 outbreak. [28] Basic prevention measures for the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, such as handwashing [29] , depend directly on the practice of hygiene measures in communities, homes, schools, marketplaces, and healthcare facilities. [28] Additionally, these measures, especially those for wastewater treatment, are fundamental and urgent when it is contemplated that the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible [30] and even more so than wastewaters from hospitals or quarantine centers dedicated to COVID-19 treatments may contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles [31] . This is in agreement with the Bayessian analysis that spatially relate the COVID-19 case-fatality risk with the percentage contribution of the dwelling dimension to the MPI.We consider the official INS report even containing biases inherent of underreporting and the number of diagnostic tests performed. However, we contemplated the spatial isotropic underreporting rate [10] , which implies that although the values found for case-fatality risk are not definite, the described spatio-temporal trend is expected to continue. We verify that a spatially homogeneous increment in the observed cases, generates an adjustment of the intercept, however maintaining the importance of each MPI dimension as shown in the results of this work.We provide evidence that the multidimensional poverty index significantly affects the inequalities in the COVID-19 case-fatality risk.

73178d4c12c75a840d0d0375a5a034296e078f28,Optimal quarantine strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic in a population with a discrete age structure Journal Pre-proof Optimal quarantine strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic in a population with a discrete age structure Optimal quarantine strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic in a population with a discrete age structure,"At the end of 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in the city of Wuhan, China.In January 2020 the disease was given the name COVID-19 and, by mid February, China already faced over 60 thousand cases [1] . Many scientists then began to model disease to forecast its worldwide impact ( [2] , [3] ), even influencing policies of many governments.As the disease spread across Europe and the United States, some countries were forced to implement quarantines or even lockdowns to mitigate the harms and were able to do the so called ""flattening of the curve"", i.e., to postpone and dampen the maximum number of active cases. By mid May, Brazil is entering this stage, with some states declaring stricter quarantine policies.Optimal control theory has been applied to general epidemic models ( [4] , [5] ) as well as to specific disease models such as HIV ( [6] , [7] , [8] ), tuberculosis ([9] , [10] ) and influenza ( [11] ). Recently, a few works applying optimal control theory to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as [12] and [13] , have appeared. This paper focuses on a SEIR model with quarantine as was proposed in [14] , but dividing the population in age groups as in [15] . This is particularly important since COVID-19 has worse consequences on the elderly than it does on younger people.Our goal is to calculate the optimal quarantine strategies numerically for different choices of parameters in the model, which reflect the decisions governments must make when implementing these policies, such as evaluating the economical costs of the quarantine for each of the age groups and when to start implementing the measures. Then, we compare the controls by looking at how they reduce deaths in comparison to the same period without quarantine. The best strategy gave us a calendar of when to relax the measures in each of the age groups.Our model consists of a classical SEIR model with a quarantined class. Besides, we assume that the population has an age structure (see [16] , [17] for models with a continuous age structure and [18], [19] for models with a discrete one). There are three age groups, described in Table 1 .and Q i (t) be the number of susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and quarantined individuals in each age group at time t ≥ 0, respectively. We assume that the total population All parameters are nonnegative. β ij is the transmission coefficient from age group i to age group j. Typically, it will be assumed that β ij = β ji for all i, j.σ i and γ i are the latency and recovery periods, respectively, for age group i. λ is the exit rate from the quarantine. Our controls are the u i (t), which denote the fraction of susceptible individuals in each age group that are put into quarantine per unit time at t. As such, they satisfy, a priori,However, it is unrealistic to expect an entire population to stay under quarantine for a long time. There are essential workers such as healthcare professionals and police officers that cannot stay at home during these times. As most of these workers are in age group 2, we suppose that all of age groups 1 and 3can be quarantined (for age group 3, indeed, this is especially important since they are a risk group for the COVID-19 pandemic). Thus, we shall loosen (2) by considering, for example,Evaluating u max is one of the tasks of each government's authorities. In this paper, we fix this parameter at u max = 0.9. This means thatLetbe the total population of age group i. Adding the equations in the system above, we see that N i (t) is also constant for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Since R i (t) only appears in the other equations as a part of N i (t), we substitute the equations for R i i(t) by N i (t). Hence, we may also consider the system ofParameter values are taken from [15] and are listed in Table 2 . The data fitting was performed using an adaptation of a least-squares algorithm from [20] .To see how the numbers of infections and recoveries are distributed in the three age groups, we refer to the data available in [21] , shown in Table 3 . For simplification, we suppose that the difference between the number of cases and the number of deaths represents the number of recoveries. This is not necessarily correct, because some of the patients that we considered as recovered might still carry the disease, but we use this approach due to the scarcity of information regarding recoveries we currently have. The respective distributions are shown in Table 4 .According to [1] , Brazil had as of May 13, 2020 a total of 97,575 active COVID-19 cases. Even though there seems to be a large underreporting in the country [22] , this number will be considered as the total number of infected individuals nonetheless. To estimate the number of exposed cases, we look at data from May 8, 2020, since the mean incubation period of the disease is thought to be around 5 days [23] . Once again according to [1] , at this time Brazil had 76,603 active cases, so this gives us an estimation of 20,972 exposed cases. We also suppose that these cases follow the age distributions of cases from Table 4 . Finally, as of May 8, there were 65,124 recovered cases in Brazil Table 2 : Parameter values (data from [15] ).Value Parameter ValueTherefore, our initial time will consist of data from Brazil as of May 8, 2020.The total population is assumed to be 200 million, divided into 40% young people, 50% adults and 10% elderly. We also assume that there are no quarantined individuals when the simulation starts. Since the numbers of exposed, infected and recovered are very small in comparison to the total population, we assume that the initial number of susceptible individuals is equal to the total population of the respective age group. The initial conditions of all variables, rounded to the nearest integers, are listed in Table 5. 6 3. The optimization problemUsing system (4), we consider the functional to be minimized as Quarantined 0 0 0In the formula above, T is the quarantine duration and the parameters B i are the costs of the control. We assume that B i > 0 for i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and thatwhere B ∈ R is the total control cost. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the optimal controls follow from standard results from optimal control theory.For instance, we can use Theorem 2.1 in [24] to show that the optimal control exists. Pontryagin's maximum principle ( [25] , [26] ) establish that optimal controls are solutions of the Hamiltonian system with Hamiltonian functionwhere λ S i , λ E i , λ I i , λ Q i and λ N i are the adjoint variables. These variables must 8 satisfy the adjoint equationswhere i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and C ∈ {S, E, I, Q, N }. The adjoint system is detailed in (9) below.The adjoint variables also must satisfy the transversality conditionsfor i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.Finally, the optimality conditions come from solvingThis results inSince we are considering bounded controls (because of (3)), the u * i are calculated usingwhere u 1 max = u 3 max = 1 and u 2 max = 0.9. Uniqueness of the optimal controls (at least for small enough T ) also follow from standard results, such as Theorem 2.3 in [24] . Numerical solutions of systems (4) and (9) can be found by a forward-backward sweep method [26] .The algorithm starts with an initial guess of the controls u 1 , u 2 and u 3 and then solves (4) forward in time. After this first part, it uses the results and the initial guesses to solve (9) backward in time and new controls are defined following (13) . This process continues until it converges.Quarantines are not just a matter of public health, for they also present economic questions, for example. This means that we must pay close attention to the control costs B i . These numbers reflect how the population is capable of dealing with the quarantine of the respective age group. Smaller values of B i mean that the population can withstand a stricter quarantine without many economical side effects. This is not possible, on the other hand, for bigger values of B i .Since the bigger economic toll of the quarantine lies on the adults (because they form almost all of the economically active population), we assume that B 2 is the greatest of the three values. As the isolation of the young implies closing schools, this educational impact makes B 1 the second highest cost, albeit much smaller than B 2 .How the total cost B is distributed among the age groups determines the shape of the optimal controls. To study this relation, we let B = 5000, with B 2 ∈ [3600, 4600] and B 3 ∈ [10, 110]. For our simulations, we consider B 2 ∈ {3600 + 50k : 0 ≤ k ≤ 20} and B 3 ∈ {10 + 5k : 0 ≤ k ≤ 20}. This means that 441 cost distributions will be analysed for each quarantine length.Our goal now is to compare these distributions by investigating the number of deaths caused by the pandemic at the end of the quarantine for each one of them. As in [15] , the deaths will be calculated as a fraction of the recovered, since there is no disease induced mortality in our model. From Table 3 , we can derive the case fatality rates µ 1 , µ 2 and µ 3 for age groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively.The results are Let D(b 2 , b 3 , t) and R i (b 2 , b 3 , t), i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, denote the cumulative number of deaths due to the disease at time t and the number of recovered individuals in the optimal control problem for age group i, respectively, for the cost distribution with B 2 = b 2 and B 3 = b 3 . By our discussion above, we can write According to [22] , ratio estimates of reported to unreported cases vary from Figure 3 plots the graphs of the optimal controls u 1 (t), u 2 (t) and u 3 (t) for this cost distribution. An interesting feature of these plots is that they provide an ""optimal calendar"" of when the quarantine should start to be relaxed. This calendar is shown in Table 6 . We now investigate how the length of the quarantine influences its effectiveness by plotting the total number of infections for the cost distribution B 1 = 1390, B 2 = 3600 and B 3 = 10 in Figure 4 .The three curves reach their minimum around the same time that the controls reach zero. For quarantines of 45 and 60 days, the number of cases at the end is, indeed, much smaller than it is in the beginning. However, for the shorter quarantine, there are more cases in the end than the initial total.This fact shows that quarantines cannot be too short, or else the overall situation in the end could be worse than in the beginning. Moreover, the number of cases starts to go up again towards the end in all three cases.To finish this Section, we analyse how the initial conditions affect the optimal control. We can interpret this as a way to see what happens if it takes too long for these measures to be implemented. We do this by considering initial conditions of exposed, infected and recovered twice and four times as much as their original values. As of May 13, 2020, the number of active cases in Brazil doubles every 10 days [1] , so this means waiting 10 or 20 days, respectively, to start the quarantine. In the plots of Figures 5 and 6 , we consider distribution B 1 = 1390, B 2 = 3600 and B 3 = 10 with initial conditions twice and four times their original values, respectively. They provide different relaxation calendars, which are described in Tables 7 and 8. A comparison of Tables 6, 7 and 8 shows that the quarantines have to be much stricter if there is a delay in their implementation. Moreover, as we did in Figure 2 , we look at the reduction in deaths at the end of the quarantine in Figure 6 : Plots of the optimal controls for different quarantine lengths. Initial conditions of exposed, infected and recovered are multiplied by four. Hence, the longer it takes for the quarantine to start, the less effective it is. In this paper we considered an age-structured SEIRQ model, where the quarantine entrance parameters are thought as controls of the system, and we looked for the optimal controls via Pontryagin's maximum principle. After writing down the optimality system, we calculated the optimal controls numerically and analysed how some of the parameters influence the results.These parameters represent the difficult choices authorities must make, such as deciding how many essential workers are allowed to remain circulating, estimating the economic impact of the quarantine and even when to start it. As such choices are made, the optimal controls give guidelines of how to proceed.In Section 4, we considered a constant total control cost and distributed it among the age groups in 441 ways. The distribution with the best results with regard to deaths during the quarantine gave us a calendar of when to relax the isolation measures in the three age groups (for quarantine lengths of 30, 45 and 60 days, respectively):• For the youngs, the date of relaxation was the 16th, the 18th or the 14th day.• For the adults, the relaxation started at the 12th, the 13th or the 11th day.• For the elderly, it started at the 25th, the 39th or the 52nd day.The optimal controls that induce this calendar produced a reduction in the number of deaths of 286, 439 and 462 times, respectively, in comparison to the same period of time without quarantine. However, in the three cases the number of infected cases reached a minimum just before the end of the simulation, so by the time the quarantine ended, the cases were going up again, even becoming bigger than the original values for the shorter length we considered. This shows that the quarantines are not effective if they are not long enough.We also showed that waiting too long to start the quarantine makes the period before the relaxation become longer. This also produced a loss in efficacy, since the reduction of deaths due to the quarantine (in comparison to the ""doing nothing"" scenario) decreased as the number of initial cases increased.In our model we used data from Brazil as initial conditions and in the parameter fitting. Brazil is a very large country, with many cities at different stages of the pandemic. This means that studies such as this one should be made locally to best suit the characteristics of each city. As the plots of Figures   5 and 6 suggest, the sooner the quarantine is implemented, the shortest the time the controls need to stay at their maximum is.Finally, we acknowledge that not all individuals have the same possibility of fulfilling the quarantine. In countries with severe socioeconomic inequalities such as Brazil, the wealthier citizens have much more resources to go through the isolation period than the poorer [27] .

51a55370b1895821a2097577f8d317c7f9e17cae,Journal Pre-proof The use of moderately hypofractionated post-operative radiation therapy for breast cancer in clinical practice: a critical review The use of moderately hypofractionated post-operative radiation therapy for breast cancer in clinical practice: a critical review,"Post-operative radiation therapy (RT) reduces both loco-regional recurrence rates and breast cancer mortality in most patients who receive either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. [1, 2] For decades, conventional radiation doses ranged from 50 to 50.4 Gy, given in 25 to 28 fractions over a course of 5 to 6 weeks. This empirical schedule J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was based on the assumption that a total dose around 50 Gy, prescribed in 1.8 -2.0 Gy fractions, might maximize tumour control while minimizing normal-tissue injury. This was reinforced by data analyses from early studies of hypofractionation in breast cancer using outdated and erroneous radiobiological models and archaic methods of treatment calculation and delivery, leading to high rates of late normal-tissue damage. [3, 4] In the early 90s, a re-evaluation of the correlation between fraction size and normal-tissue injury in breast tumours suggested that an extended treatment duration was neither favourable for tumour control nor necessary to spare normal tissue. This led to the development of the moderately hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) approach, which comprised fraction sizes up to 3 Gy combined with a reduced total dose, aimed at obtaining radiobiological equivalence to conventionally fractionated regimens. [5, 6] Trials were developed using an (i) explanatory approach based on radiobiological assumptions, e.g.START A investigating hypofractionated regimens that were hypothesized to be isoeffective with 50 Gy in 25 fractions and (ii) pragmatic trials e.g. START Bbased on historical patterns of practice predominantly in the north of the UK using traditionally 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks whereas centres in the south tending to use 25 fractions. [7] , [8] Of note, 40 Gy in 15 fractions has never being assumed to be isoeffective with 50 Gy in 25 fractions as radiobiologically it is estimated to be equal to 46-47 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, depending on the α/β ratio of the tissues in question.Hypofractionated schedules decrease the overall treatment period by reducing the total number of fractions and thereby offer a therapeutic schedule that is more convenient for patients and health care providers. Hypofractionation may also improve patients` access to medical care (particularly in circumstances in which there is insufficient capacity), reduce indirect costs related to work interruptions and travel to the radiation oncology department, next to decreased direct treatment costs. [9] The aim of this International Expert Opinion Report is to provide an overview of the current evidence and, derived therefrom, a guideline for the clinical application of moderate hypofractionation in patients with invasive breast cancer.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fA systematic review in accordance with The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook of Interventions Systematic Reviews was performed. [ Hypofractionated Dose). We also manually searched the reference lists of the included studies and review articles. We considered prospective trials, retrospective studies, systematic reviews, guidelines, and consensus papers for our analysis and discussion. Other types of studies were excluded. After an independent review of the references (by two authors -GNM and PP) and the removal of duplicates, 1,558 potentially relevant abstracts remained. After further analysis, 149 articles were withheld for discussion within our international radiation oncologists breast cancer experts group (Figure 1 ). Eligible citations were retrieved for full-text review. A committee performed an independent check and the definitive approval of the review.The primary endpoint was effectiveness (loco-regional recurrence rates).The second endpoint were safety (side effects) and calculated radiobiological equivalence.Six randomized phase III trials were published with formal comparisons between moderate hypofractionation and conventionally fractionated irradiation for breast cancer patients (Table 1 and Table 2 ).The Royal Marsden Hospital and Gloucestershire Oncology Centre study included 1,410 breast-cancer patients who were at least 50 years of age and who had T1-3 N0-1 M0 cancer with a maximum of one involved node. [6, 11] Patients were randomly assigned to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions (i.e., conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation [CF-WBI]) or one of two dose schedules (39 or 42.9 Gy in 13 fractions) (EDQ2, equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions based on an α/β of 4, of 45.5 and 52.19, respectively). The 10-year risks of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence were 12.1%, 14.8%, and 9.6%, respectively. Although local recurrence significantly differed between the HF-WBI groups (P = .027), neither HF-WBI group significantly differed from the CF-WBI group. Overall, side effects were limited, regardless of the treatment group (e.g., telangiectasia, shrinkage, induration, distortion, shoulder stiffness, and oedema), with the lowest rates in patients treated with a total dose of 39 Gy. This ""pre-START"" trial had an explanatory radiobiological design, the overall time (5 weeks) being kept constant, with two test arms representing a dose/fractionation that could be isoeffective based on the lower and higher estimates of the α/β ratio. This allowed estimation of the ""true"" isoeffective dose/fractionation regimen for both tumour and normal tissue. The 42.9 Gy in 13 reactions schedule was shown to have a higher effect compared to 50 in 25 fractions for normal tissues, leading to a modest dose reduction for the UK START A to 41.6 Gy total dose.The UK START A included 2,236 breast cancer patients (pT1-3a pN0-1 M0) undergoing either breast-conserving surgery (n = 1990; 85%) or mastectomy (n = 336; 15%). [7, 12] Randomisation was between CF-WBI 50 Gy in 25 daily policy. At 10-year follow-up, loco-regional recurrence was 6.7% in the conventional fractionation group, 5.6% in the 41.6 Gy hypofractionation group, and 8.1% in the 39 Gy hypofractionation group, respectively (p = NS). At 10-year follow-up, normal-tissue effects (telangiectasia, breast oedema, and moderate or marked breast induration) were significantly reduced in the 39 Gy hypofractionation group, as compared to the conventional fractionation group.There were no significant differences between the conventional fractionation group and the 41.6 Gy hypofractionation group. Likewise, other side effects (such as shoulder stiffness, arm oedema, and breast shrinkage) were similar between the hypofractionation and conventional fractionation groups.The UK START B randomized 2 215 women (pT1-3a pN0-1 M0) who underwent breast-conserving surgery (n = 2038; 92%) or mastectomy (n = 177; 7%) to receive either CF-WBI 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks or HF-WBI 40.05 Gy in 15 daily fractions over 3 weeks. [8, 12] An optional boost dose of 10 Gy in 5 fractions was allowed per institutional protocol. At 10-year follow-up, the loco-regional recurrence rates did not significantly differ between the conventional and hypofractionation groups (5.5% and 4.3%, respectively; P = 0.21). Normal-tissue effects, such as breast oedema, telangiectasia, and breast shrinkage, were significantly less common in the hypofractionation than in the conventional fractionation group; no significant differences existed in arm oedema, shoulder stiffness, or breast induration. This pragmatic trial design, employing a biologically estimated lower dose led to, not surprisingly, a lower rate of acute side effects as the total dose was reduced, but it also produced lower late normal tissue side effects, which are more dependent on dose per fraction. Importantly, local control was at least as good. Overall survival was unexpectedly better, raising the exciting hypothesis that a shorter overall treatment time could be beneficial for survival, which could not be concluded in view of the noninferiority design of this trial for local control. The explanatory START trials showed that α/β ratio for both breast tumours and late reacting normal tissues appears similar, demonstrating no advantage in using conventional 2 Gy per fraction regimens. [12, 13] The Ontario Clinical Oncology Group trial included 1234 women with T1-2 N0 M0 breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery who were randomized to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f receive CF-WBI 50 Gy in 25 fractions or HF-WBI 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions (EDQ2 47.24 Gy). [5, 14] The 10-year local relapse rate was 6.7% for the CF-WBI group as compared to 6.2% for the HF-WBI group, for a non-significant absolute difference of 0.5% (95% CI, −2.5 to 3.5) . Similarly, at 10 years the overall survival rates were 84.4% in the CF-WBI and 84.6% in the HF-WBI group, for a nonsignificant absolute difference of 0.2% (95% CI, −4.3 to 4.0). Moreover, the cosmetic outcomes were good or excellent for most patients: 69.8% for HF-WBI and 71.3% for CF-WBI, for a non-significant absolute difference of 1.5% (95% CI, -6.9 to 9.8). No differences in late adverse events in the skin or subcutaneous tissue were noted. [15] The patients in the CF-WBI group received a boost of 10 to 14 Gy (in 5 or 7 fractions, respectively), and those in the HF-WBI group received 10 to 12.5 Gy (in 4 or 5 fractions, respectively). The reported toxicities during treatment were statistically significantly lower in the HF-WBI group than in the CF-WBI group for the following outcomes: hyperpigmentation (9% vs. 20%; P = .002), breast pain (55% vs. 74%; P = .001), acute dermatitis (36% vs. 69%; P < .001), fatigue (9% vs. 17%; P = .02), and pruritus (54% vs. 81%; P < .001). Similarly, grade 2 or higher acute side effects were much less frequent in the HF-WBI group than in the CF-WBI group (47% vs. 78%; P < .001). At 6-month follow-up, the HF-WBI group showed lower rates than the CF-WBI group in lack of energy (23% vs. 39%; P < .001), and fatigue (0% vs. 6%; P = .01). The 3-year poor cosmetic outcomes were less frequent in the HF-WBI group than in the CF-WBI group (8.2% vs. 13.6%; P = 0 .002). The 3-year local relapse-free survival rate was 99% for both groups (P = 0.37) , but it is recognised that this trial is under-powered for this endpoint. [16] The Beijing trial included 820 pT3-4 pN2-3 post-mastectomy breastcancer patients, who were randomized to receive post-mastectomy RT of the chest wall and select nodal irradiation (supraclavicular and level 3) of 50 Gy in 25 fractions weeks or 3-week hypofractionation 43.5 Gy in 15 fractions (EDQ2 = 50 Gy). [17] The primary endpoint of this study was local control. The 5-year locoregional relapse rates were 8.1% and 8.3% for the conventional dose and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hypofractionation groups, respectively, resulting in a non-significant absolute difference of 0.2% (90% CI, -3.0 to 2.6) and a hazard ratio of 1.10 (90% CI, 0.72-1.69; P < .001 for non-inferiority). The hypofractionation group had a lower rate of grade 3 acute skin toxicity than the conventional dose group did (3% vs. 8%; P < .001). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of other acute or late toxicities.The linear-quadratic model, based on the α/β value, is assumed to reliably predict the different fractionation sensitivity of early and late normal tissues for prescribed fraction sizes between 1.8 and 3 Gy. [18] It can be used to predict the biological effective dose (BED) and thereby to calculate equivalent dose/fractionation schedules. For example, based on an α/β ratio of 3 Gy for late normal tissue response, a 15-fraction schedule leading to an equivalent rate of late effects of 50 Gy in 25 fractions requires a decrease in total dose to 42.8 Gy in fractions of 2.85 Gy to maintain the same risks of late side effects, not taking into account the shorter overall treatment time. [19] [20] [21] Applying this concept to the dose distribution for locoregional radiation therapy for breast cancer obtained with 3D-CRT, it is possible to calculate various scenarios regarding the relative radiobiological effect to both tumour and normal tissues to compare the former standard of 50 Gy in 25 fractions with the 40 Gy in 15 fractions as tested in the START-B trial. [21, 22] Table 3 illustrates the mathematical estimations, clearly showing that for a broad range of α/β values for normal tissue and breast cancer, the reduction of the total dose with the 40 Gy in 15 fractions schedule leads to a lower expected effect both for the volumes inside and outside the therapeutic radiation doses. This relative sparing proportionally even increases for dose levels below the prescribed dose level, as typically extending into neighbouring normal tissue including heart and lungs.Both the explanatory-and the pragmatically-designed trials demonstrate indeed that moderate hypofractionation leads to a lower rate for side effects, especially for the 40 Gy in 15 fractions schedule, thereby confirming the appropriateness of the radiobiological estimations. [11, 22] The at least as good local control might be explained by the influence of the shortened overall treatment time as a contributor to anti-tumoural efficacy due to tumour cell J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f proliferation, as hypothesised by the START triallists, estimating that 0.6 Gy per calendar day could be lost in the period between 3 and 5 weeks of treatment. [22] Most of the patients who participated in the trials had early-stage breast cancer and underwent breast conserving therapy including WBI without regional nodal irradiation. Therefore, the use of hypofractionated RT in post-mastectomy patients and/or those requiring regional nodal irradiation still remains a matter of debate. However, there is no radiobiological reason why these patients should have different outcomes, even on the contrary taking the radiobiological calculations from Table 3 into account. Notwithstanding this, several current guidelines support the use of moderate hypofractionated RT for breast cancer patients on the one hand rather broadly independent of disease stage, patient's age, and the use of systemic agents, but remain reluctant towards chest wall and regional lymph node irradiation. [23, 24] In the 2019 St Gallen consensus conference, the panellists were divided as to whether hypofractionated treatment was appropriate for these women. [25] In contrast, the recently updated ESMO guidelines recommend moderate hypofractionation for routine postoperative RT of breast cancer, advising to carefully monitor, evaluate, and compare outcomes of patients treated with hypofractionation outside of the inclusion criteria of the published studies. [26] The reluctance to do so is illustrated in the United States National Cancer Database study, the results of which demonstrate that between 2004 to 2014 the use of hypofractionated post-mastectomy RT of the chest wall (with or without the regional lymph nodes) is as low as 1.1% of all patients. [27] Nevertheless, the data from the START studies (the Royal MarsdenHospital study, as well as both START A and START B) show that 14.7% (n = 864) of the patients received lymphatic radiation, with another 8.5% (n = 513) undergoing mastectomy. [28] After 10-year follow-up, the cumulative incidence rates of both patient-and physician-assessed side effects (marked or moderate severity) were similar for these patients as well, without statistically significant differences in local recurrence rates after mastectomy or breast conserving surgery. [12] Additionally, similar results were found in the Beijing trial, even for locally advanced breast-cancer patients and using older techniques. [17, 29] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Some clinicians argue that, due to the long interval that side effects might occur, especially with regards to heart, lung function and nerve tissue, moderate hypofractionation for regional nodal irradiation should be assessed with caution until the results of other prospective randomized clinical trials are available. [30] Also, some clinicians have expressed concern because chemotherapy was used in only 11%, 35%, and 22% of patients in the Ontario Clinical Oncology Group, START A, and START B trials, respectively, with most patients receiving a currently non-standard regimen. [5, 7, 12, 14] However, standard chemotherapy, including anthracycline and taxane-or anthracycline-based regimens, was used in both the Beijing trial and the MD Anderson trial, with satisfactory toxicity results, albeit after relatively short follow-up periods. [15, 17] Reassuringly, the START trials' data showed very low rates of ischemic heart disease and lung fibrosis (<2%). [28] Even though reported rate may be higher when using modern diagnostic instruments due to increased detection of subclinical heart or lung disease, patients currently rarely develop cardiac or pulmonary toxicity symptoms that require medical intervention. [31] [32] [33] A point to consider is the very low rate of brachial plexopathy in patients who received regional nodal radiation. suggesting a non-confirmed genetic susceptibility. [28] The EORTC 22881/10882 ""boost"" trial demonstrated that a boost dose to the primary tumour bed after breast conserving surgery and whole breast irradiation decreases local recurrences rates to a similar relative extent across all risk groups. [34] However, patients with risk-factors for local recurrences, including young age, high grade, and involved margins, derive a larger absolute benefit from a boost dose, and should thereby be advised to receive this independent of the fractionation schedule. While in most trials a conventionally fractionated boost of 5 to 8 fractions of 2Gy was used, the UK and The Netherlands as well as some Italian institutions gathered many years of experience using hypofractionated boost schedules, demonstrating its safety and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f tolerance. [35, 36] Some countries, like The Netherlands, mostly integrate the boost simultaneously (SIB) combined with adding a number (in general 5) of fractions and without increasing the maximum fraction size. The IMPORT High trial, integrating the boost while maintaining a constant number of fractions, assessed more than 2,600 patients and showed that a hypofractionated SIB is safe in term of 3 year toxicity and showed an expected a dose response for adverse effects with increasing dose, but not with fraction size. [37] Moreover, an analysis of tumour factors that might be predictive of response to hypofractionated RT based on a central review of tumour samples showed that molecular subtype clearly predicted local recurrence, while tumour grade, molecular subtype and hypoxia did not predict the response to hypofractionation RT, suggesting that patients of all grades and molecular subtypes may be safely treated with hypofractionated RT regimens. [38] Treatment-related toxicities are probably more related to the type of RT technique than to the dose schedule. This concept is accepted in some countries, including the Netherlands and the UK, where moderate hypofractionation has been the standard for practically all indications of RT in breast-cancer patients for many years. [35, 39, 40] The results of prospectively collected databases and other real-life retrospective studies confirm that hypofractionated RT, with or without regional nodal irradiation, is safe, well-tolerated, and associated with satisfactory local control rates. [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Perhaps there is excessive concern about toxicity related to moderate hypofractionated RT to the regional nodal areas, an issue that is not considered as a subject of discussion for most other types of cancer. For example, the fractionation schedules for head and neck cancer are independent from the anatomical sub-site, even though high biological-equivalent doses of radiation (60 to 70 Gy) are usually delivered, even concomitant with chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with locally advanced disease. [51, 52] Little data are available about the use of hypofractionation before or after breast reconstruction, which is increasingly done using implants or autologous tissue. [53] RT might increase the frequency of complications including capsular contracture rates and reconstruction failures. [54] [55] [56] [57] o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and the regional lymph-nodes, followed by an optional boost to the mastectomy scar of 13.32 Gy in 4 fractions. [41] Breast reconstruction using temporary expanders or implants was performed in 41 patients (59%). The 3-year local relapse-free survival rate was 89.2% for all patients. Three of the patients who had breast reconstruction had the expanders removed due to infection before RT.The rate of implant failure was 24%, and 8% of the patients needed additional surgical correction. These complication rates are similar to those observed after conventional RT in breast-reconstruction patients. [58] [59] [60] We expect that moderate hypofractionation for patients after breast reconstruction will compare favourably to conventional fractionation, provided a homogenous dose distribution is given, as most breast-related side effects that are associated with radiation-related toxicities (e.g., skin retraction, fibrosis, and breast shrinkage)show a trend to be less frequent and less severe in patients who underwent hypofractionation. [7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17] The recently published ESTRO-ACROP guidelines for target volume delineation for the chest wall irradiation after implantbased breast reconstruction allow, by limiting the target volumes to anatomically defined zones at risk only, for a reduction of the irradiated volume, which is expected to lower the risk for side effects. Moreover, there is now an even more urgent need than before to share the available evidence, offering emergency guidance for breast radiation therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO) statement, our aim and obligation should be ""to stop, contain, control, delay and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reduce the impact of this virus at every opportunity"". In our roles as healthcare professionals and breast cancer experts this translates into minimising the exposure of our patients to COVID-19 without compromising the oncological outcome. In this context, the use of moderate hypofractionation is an appropriate approach even more at this specific worldwide moment in time.Over the last decades, RT techniques have improved considerably for the treatment of breast cancer patients. [62] Two-dimensional field-based treatment set-up was routinely used in the prior decades, with limited options to estimate the predicted radiation effect on the organs at risk (e.g. heart, lung, contralateral breast, oesophagus, brachial plexus etc). Thanks to the progress made in both hard-and software, RT transitioned progressively to individualised treatment planning taking into account patient's anatomy [63] - Figure 2 . Essential in this is that treatment planning should be based on anatomically defined target volumes, as defined by cooperative groups or societies such as ASTRO or ESTRO. [64] Finally, accurate image-guided position verification is required to limit treatment set-up variation for increased precision of dose delivery and thereby smaller safety margins around the target volumes. [65] Using modern RT techniques, the absolute risks for severe side effects including secondary malignancies and heart disease are very low compared to the past. [66] Contemporary, homogeneously delivered, volume-based RT permits even more, irrespective of the target volumes, the adoption of moderately hypofractionated RT for breast cancer patients. Dose inhomogeneity or regions of ""hot spots"" increase both the total dose and the dose per fraction. The renowned radiation biologist, Rodney Withers recognised this situation with conventional 2Gy/fraction radiation therapy plans and called it ""double trouble"". [13, 67] If moderate hypofractionation is also added as a third factor, then this could be called ""triple trouble"" as the equivalent dose in 2Gy fractions can become higher relative to conventional fractionation with large doses per fraction in case of marked dose homogeneity. [20, 68] As illustrated in Table 2 , this effect should remain however absent for hotspots up to 107%, thanks to the moderately increase fraction size accompanied with a decrease in total dose. Moreover, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f modern radiation therapy techniques reduce dose inhomogeneity to the minimum and the clinical effect of this becomes negligible. This is illustrated by the FAST breast radiotherapy that tested 50Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with 5 fractions of either 5.7 or 6.0Gy over 5 weeks: dose inhomogeneity showed no difference in cosmesis at 2 years with hypofractionation compared with conventional fractionation. [69] Existing data confirms that moderately hypofractionated RT for breast cancer is efficient, convenient and safe for all indications, target volumes and techniques, with most evidence available for 2D-and 3D techniques for treatment of the breast and the chest wall, with and without a boost. Based on a more limited set of data, combined with radiobiological considerations, we recommend extrapolating these results to other indications, target volumes and techniques including regional nodal irradiation and treatment after mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction.We recognise that some colleagues are still concerned about a generalised application of hypofractionation. Therefore, we recommend that centres participate in the ongoing trials addressing the use of moderately hypofractionated RT for breast cancer in some pertinent clinical circumstances.Centres that already apply hypofractionation as a standard should record, review and analyse their outcomes as this can contribute to provide further evidence and thereby confidence in that treatment.

4c7bbc2bef3453d4d50945a5e0f8e5745555fcce,"Anxiety, Distress, and Turnover Intention of Healthcare Workers in Peru by Their Distance to the Epicenter during the COVID-19 Crisis","Peru has enabled the most restrictive measures in its national public health history to control the current COVID-19 outbreak. [1] [2] [3] [4] The first patient with COVID-19 in Peru was detected in Lima on March 5, 2020. 5 Five days after, classes in schools were suspended nationwide, and on March 12, all classes at universities were suspended nationally. 6 On March 15, a state of emergency, border closure, and lockdown was declared with the order of social isolation for 15 days, 7 which has been extended multiple times, and currently, it has been announced to be until June 30, 2020. Those measures were very similar to the ones imposed in China, which have affected people's lives, jobs, health, and well-being, 8 increasing stress and anxiety 9,10 during the COVID-19 outbreak.Because of the social isolation in Peru, the COVID-19 crisis is expected to affect people's mental health, especially that of healthcare workers. After the first case was detected on March 5, 2020, the confirmed cases increased rapidly overwhelming healthcare workers. Furthermore, personal protection equipment (PPE) access, burnout due to long work hours, not seeing their families for many days, the high risk of becoming infected, and the psychological harm of uncertainty have been reported to affect the physical and psychological status of healthcare workers in China 11 and Iran. 11, 12 However, at the best of our knowledge, this has not been properly studied in Peru, as it has already been reported in China, [13] [14] [15] Singapore, 16 Iran, 12, 17 Italy, 18, 19 France, 20 United Kingdom, 21 and Spain. 22, 23 The COVID-19 crisis is causing an increase in burnout or anxiety, 24, 25 which resulted in an unprecedented psychological impact, [26] [27] [28] and affecting people's life satisfaction that is one of the most critical indicators of mental health. 29 , 30 We aim to use early evidence in Peru to help mental health service provide in screening people with psychological issues during the COVID-19 outbreak from a novel perspective of typhoon eye theory. 13, [31] [32] [33] It has been observed that people who reside far from the epicenter of an outbreak usually overestimate the likelihood of becoming infected, 34 which has been reported for COVID-19 13 and earthquakes. 32 This study identifies the vulnerable regions where individuals are more likely to suffer from well-being issues and helps to guide medical professionals' attention toward the more mentally vulnerable groups based on the distance from the epicenter in the COVID-19 outbreak in Peru: Lima (the capital of Peru). The ""ripple effect"" refers to the phenomenon that the mental health issues are more problematic for people around the center of the epicenter, which was the case for mental health services during the SARS and Ebola outbreaks. [35] [36] [37] However, because tremendous amount of social media exposure and information have been perceived during the COVID-19 outbreak, 38 our research group already has reported that in China individuals' well-being deteriorates over distance from the epicenter, 13 as depicted by the psychological typhoon eye theory. 31, 32 In this study, we test whether the typhoon eye theory works and for whom it works in the COVID-19 outbreak in Peru.We performed our analysis on healthcare workers as they are a COVID-19 vulnerable group. We selected age as a variable because it has been reported that the younger population are usually more adaptive to a natural disaster or to the outbreak of a virus. 39, 40 However, younger population also tend to access information on COVID-19 more frequently via digital sources such as social media, 41 which causes them to be exposed to more negative content. 42 Family size is an indicator of social support that one could receive during crisis like the current one 43 because it served as an important resource to buffer stress and anxiety. 44 We surveyed healthcare workers in 15 of the 24 provinces in Peru; these locations vary in their travel distance from the epicenter of Lima (0-1,292 km). We used anxiety, distress, and turnover intention scales to assess the mental health of healthcare workers in Peru after 1 month of lockdown and social distancing measures.Turnover intention is defined as the likelihood of an employee to leave his current job. 45 Overall, drawing from psychological typhoon eye, 31, 32 this study provided a snapshot of adult healthcare workers' mental health during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to enable more targeted mental health support in Peru.Study design. We conducted a cross-sectional survey from April 10, 2020 to May 2, 2020, after 1 month of lockdown and social distancing measures, in Peru because of the COVID-19 outbreak. At the beginning of the survey (April 10), the number of confirmed cases in Peru was 5,897 and 169 deaths, 46 whereas at the end of the survey (May 2), the number of cases increased to 42,534 and the number of deaths increased to 1,200. 47 We surveyed healthcare workers from 15 Peruvian provinces with varying severities of COVID-19. Lima, the capital of Peru, was considered the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak because the first case of COVID-19 in Peru appeared in Lima. It also continuously reported the highest number of COVID-19 patients during the survey, with 4,210 cases (71.4% of total cases) on April 10 46 and with 26,908 cases (63.3% of total cases) on May 2. 47 Participants. The online survey reached 400 healthcare workers in healthcare organizations such as hospitals, clinics, first emergency responders, medical wards, nursing home, dental clinics, pharmacies, and other healthcare institutions. We received responses from 303 of them (response rate of 75%), who worked in 111 healthcare facilities, including 55 healthcare facilities in Lima, 33 healthcare facilities in Loreto, and 23 healthcare facilities from the other 22 cities (at least one from each city). Their distance to the epicenter (Lima) ranged from 0 km to 1,292 km. All survey participants provided their informed consent before the enrollment. The survey was approved by the Tsinghua University Ethics Committee (#20200322). The participants remained anonymous and had the option to finish the survey at any time, and their information was kept confidential. The participants were not involved in any of the planning, execution, and reporting stages of the study.Outcomes and covariates. Healthcare workers' anxiety, distress, and turnover intention were assessed using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, 48 the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K6), 49 and the two-item turnover intention scale, 50 respectively. The total score of anxiety was considered as normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , and severe (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) , whereas the psychological distress was considered as low (< 5), moderate (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , and serious (³ 13). The cutoff value to consider the presence of anxiety was 10 51 and 13 for psychological distress. 52 The healthcare workers reported their age, gender, family status, education, occupation, type of healthcare organization (public or private), job level (entry, junior, intermediate, senior, and chief), exercise hours per day in the past week, and chronic health issues (yes or no). Education included the categories of high school, technical, bachelors, medical specialty, masters, and doctorate. Participants reported whether they had any chronic disease because comorbidities increase the chance of complications in a person with COVID-19 53 and because people with ongoing medical issues could be more anxious. Using their work locations, we calculated the distance of their cities to the epicenter of Lima for each participant.Statistical analysis. Data analysis was performed in STATA version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) with a significance level set at P < 0.05, and all tests were two-tailed. We used linear regression to predict anxiety, distress, and turnover intention using unweighted data. Table 1 presents the descriptive characteristics of the participating healthcare workers. Of the 303 healthcare workers, 53 (17%) were physicians, 63 (21%) were nurses, 63 (21%) were pharmacists, 80 (26%) were technicians, 20 (7%) were volunteers, and 24 (8%) were others. 51 In the K6 distress scale, the participants scored an average of 19.2 (SD of 4.5), higher than the cutoff of mental distress disorder at 13. 52 Predictors of anxiety, distress, and turnover intention. The regression results in Table 2 examined the predictors of anxiety, mental distress, and turnover intention of healthcare workers in Peru during the COVID-19 outbreak. Education level had a negative association with anxiety (β = −0.746, CI: −1.441 to −0.050, P = 0.036). The effects of gender, age, work level, type of contract, and type of institution on anxiety were not significant. In the case of mental distress, the predictors (gender, age, education level, work level, type of contract, or type of institution) were not significant. There was a negative association between age and turnover (β = −0.033, CI: −0.057 to −0.008, P = 0.009), with younger healthcare workers (β = 2.817, CI: 2.452 to 3.181) aged among 18-24 years in comparison to 35-44 years (β = 2.162, CI: 1.946 to 2.378). Healthcare workers in the private sector had a higher turnover intention than those in the public sector (β = −0.420, CI: −0.810 to −0.031, P = 0.035). The effects of gender, education level, and work level on turnover intention were not significant.The distance to the epicenter as a predictor. First, margin analysis revealed the relationship between the distance to the epicenter and anxiety was significantly negative, a ripple effect, taking all the other covariates equal (β = −0.002, CI: −0.004 to −0.0002, P = 0.031). This relationship, however, might vary when other variables changed. The regression results in Table 2 indicated a significant interaction effect between the distance to the epicenter and the type of institution on anxiety (β = −0.005, CI: −0.010 to −0.000, P = 0.049). The interaction effect between the distance to the epicenter and job contract (full time versus part time) on anxiety was not significant (β = 0.002, CI: −0.001 to 0.005, P = 0.223). Yet, margin analysis showed the relationship between the distance to the epicenter and anxiety was significant and showed a ripple effect only among full-time healthcare workers (β = −0.003, CI: −0.005 to −0.001, P = 0.011) and not among temporary healthcare workers (β = −0.001, CI: −0.004 to 0.002, P = 0.583).Second, margin analysis revealed the relationship between the distance to the epicenter and anxiety was significantly negative, a ripple effect, taking all the other covariates equal (β = −0.003, CI: −0.005 to −0.004, P = 0.023). This relationship, also, varied when other variables changed. The regression results in Table 2 indicated a significant interaction effect between the distance to the epicenter and the type of institution on anxiety (β = −0.008, CI: −0.014 to −0.002, P = 0.010). Margin analysis showed the relationship between the distance to the epicenter and anxiety was significant and Married without any children 6 (2) 3 (6) * Includes other occupations such as medical technologists, dentists, psychologists, biologists, administrators, ambulance drivers, physician auditors, students, and providers of general services.showed a typhoon eye effect only among healthcare workers in public institutions (β = 0.008, CI: 0.001 to 0.015, P = 0.021) and not among healthcare workers in private institutions (β = 0.000, CI: −0.002 to 0.002, P = 0.883). The interaction effect between the distance to the epicenter and job contract (full time versus part time) on anxiety was also significant (β = 0.004, CI: 0.000 to 0.008, P = 0.029). Moreover, margin analysis showed the relationship between the distance to the epicenter and anxiety was significant and showed a ripple effect only among full-time healthcare workers (β = −0.004, CI: −0.007 to −0.002, P = 0.002) and not among temporary healthcare workers (β = 0.001, CI: −0.004 to 0.004, P = 0.955).Third, margin analysis revealed the relationship between the distance to the epicenter and turnover was not significant taking all the other covariates equal (β = 0.002, CI: 0.0003 to 0.001, P = 0.494). The regression results in Table 2 indicated a significant interaction effect between the distance to the epicenter and the type of institution on turnover (β = 0.002, CI: 0.001 to 0.004, P = 0.001). Margin analysis showed the relationship between the distance to the epicenter and turnover was significantly negative among healthcare workers in both public institutions (β = −0.003, CI: −0.005 to −0.002, P = 0.000) and private institutions (β = −0.001, CI: −0.001 to −0.000, P = 0.000).Since 2012, Peru implemented the community mental health model as recommended by the WHO 54 as an approach to provide care in the community through specialized facilities called community mental health centers. However, as reported in 2019, actual full-time employees of these centers reported that there are critical barriers that still need to circumvent. 55 Some of them include lack of consistent training, resources, structure, and policies that effectively support the use and importance of these centers in the evaluation and adequate treatment of mental health conditions. 55 This situation also gets worsened when general practitioners in Peru consider themselves as not very competent in diagnosing and treating mental disorders. This was reported in a self-perception survey that evaluated the competence of Peruvian general practitioners in diagnosing and treating major depression, anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, and schizophrenia. 56 It is reported that of the 434 responders, 70.5% believed they were competent in diagnosing depression, 73.3% for anxiety, 67.6% for alcohol dependence, 62.0% for schizophrenia, and when the four mental disorders were combined, only 41.6% of participants self-perceived competence in providing an adequate diagnosis. 56 These results highlighted the need to improve medical education so as to develop the skills necessary to confront mental health disorders. 56 There is a very limited number of studies that have assessed mental health in the general public and healthcare workers in Peru, and, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the mental health of healthcare workers in Peru during the COVID-19 outbreak.Our study shows that overall people who were geographically further from the epicenter in Peru during the outbreak experienced less anxiety and mental distress, corroborating the ripple effect and disconfirming the typhoon eye theory. 11, 13, [31] [32] [33] However, this relationship can change depending on the type of institutions (public versus private) and contract (full time versus part time). The relationship between the distance to the epicenter and distress for healthcare workers in public institutions was positive, showing a typhoon eye effect (β = 0.008, CI: 0.001 to 0.015, P = 0.021). Distance to the epicenter is a crucial factor for psychiatrists to consider to screen the mentally vulnerable groups, 13,30,57 but research needs to first establish whether the distance to the epicenter carries a ripple effect or a typhoon eye effect. Furthermore, our results indicate that healthcare workers with a lower education level were more anxious, and younger healthcare workers and those in the private sector were more susceptible to turnover.An important factor to consider is that at the beginning of the survey (April 10), the number of confirmed cases in Peru was 5,897 with 169 deaths, 46 whereas at the end of the survey (May 2), the number of cases increased to 42,534 and the number of deaths increased to 1,200. 47 This significant increase in confirmed cases and the accompanying coverage in the national and international media could have also caused increased anxiety and distress in healthcare workers. In addition, the reported precarious health system and saturation of every hospital in Peru with COVID-19 patients 3 could have also caused an increase in turnover intention for healthcare workers. Similar to Iran, 17 China, 13 and the United States, 58 we did not identify a universal risk factor that could predict specific mental disorders in Peruvian healthcare workers. This is expected as each country has their own medical system, clinical capacity, access to PPE, labor conditions, lockdown policies, and cultures.Limitations. The context of this study has a clear epicenter of COVID-19, Lima, in Peru. However, it is not always the case as observed in South Korea. 59 Our data were collected in Peru, a geographically large country, and it remains unclear whether the typhoon eye effect or the ripple effect will generalize in other countries, most of which are smaller. The epicenter of Lima is in the midwest of Peru, whereas the epicenter of Wuhan is in the middle of China, and the epicenter of New York State in the United States is in the northeast. Thus, we suspect that either the typhoon eye effect or the ripple effect might play out differently in term of pace and patterns.Our results show that Peru's healthcare workers' anxiety and mental distress decreased as the distance from the epicenter increases, corroborating the ripple effect and disconfirming the typhoon eye theory. A lower education level increased the anxiety levels, whereas age and gender did not affect the anxiety and distress levels. The turnover intention was not associated with the distance to the epicenter nor gender, but it was higher in younger healthcare workers in the private section. Our results can help guide mental health service providers toward vulnerable groups of healthcare workers that are closer to Lima, the COVID-19 epicenter in Peru. We urge for more research to assess the mental health of healthcare workers and general public in Peru, a country that was not given the importance it deserves.",Peru,abstract,2020-08-18,8

Thus, it is possible to conceive an IL-6 inhibition strategy to control CRS in patients with progressive hyperinflammation. Tocilizumab is a humanized anti IL-6 receptor antibody approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, giant cell arteritis, and lifethreatening cytokine release induced by chimeric-antigen receptor T-cell therapy [14] .Faced with the possibility of not having the health resources to confront the pandemic, and in the absence of treatments with demonstrated efficacy, we constituted a multidisciplinary, composed of physicians from various specialties including rheumatology, immunology, hematology, infectious diseases, intensive care medicine and pulmonologists, with the aim of developing a guide to consider the use of tocilizumab, with a strict protocol to evaluate the patient and suggest its use for specific patients.Our purpose is to present our experience of tocilizumab use in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19, with emphasis on ventilatory results, inflammatory parameters, and adverse events.Study design: Observational retrospective cohort study.Setting: Patients hospitalized in Clínica Alemana, Santiago, Chile, with a diagnosis of COVID-19, for whom evaluation was requested by our multidisciplinary team for eventual tocilizumab use. The results of the patients evaluated between April 13 and June 16, 2020 who received tocilizumab and who were discharged or died before July 18, 2020 are reported. All data was collected by this multidisciplinary team from the patient's medical record by the multidisciplinary team.Participants: The multidisciplinary team evaluated each case by reviewing the patient's medical file and discussing with the treating physician. Criteria were previously established to consider the use of tocilizumab:Inclusion criteria:1. Age >18 years. ii. Multiple pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography or computed axial tomography and/or increase in infiltrates.iii. O2 saturation <93% with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 21% or O2 requirement to maintain saturation>92%. iv. Fever>38ºC.b. And at least two of the following:i. C-reactive protein (CRP) > 5mg/dL (or relative increase >50% in less than 48hrs).ii. Alveolar-Arterial (A-a) O2 gradient with deterioration>50%.iii. Increase >25% of ferritin with respect to the previous value within the last 48 hours or isolated value >2000 ng/mL. iv. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)>3.12 or lymphopenia <700/mm3. v. Fibrinogen increase >25% or >800 mg/dL. Exclusion criteria:1. Not controlled infection by bacteria, fungi or non-COVID viruses.2. Active tuberculosis.3. Any concurrent immunomodulatory medication or intervention that the treating physician believes would put the patient at increased risk.4. History of diverticulitis or intestinal perforation. 5. Absolute neutrophil count <1,000/mm3, platelets <50,000/mm3. 6 . Known allergy to tocilizumab, or to any other anti-IL-6 agent. 7 . Any condition that, in the opinion of the treating physician or the multidisciplinary group, would increase the patient's risk when receiving tocilizumab.If the patient met the criteria, the indication for tocilizumab was discussed within the multidisciplinary group.If tocilizumab use was recommended, this suggestion was communicated to the treating physician and to the patient or his/her family, explaining the risks and benefits, specifying that the use was off-label. If its use was accepted, tocilizumab was administered as a single 60 minutes intravenous drip infusion. The dose used was 8 mg/kg, with a maximum of 800 mg.Variables: The baseline characteristics of the patients were recorded. Data from clinical chart was recorded, specifying the level of care, the type of ventilatory support (nasal cannula, non-invasive mechanical ventilation [NIMV], invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), the use of prone position, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), convalescent plasma, corticosteroids (CS), and tocilizumab. Several laboratory parameters were considered including lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), transaminases, and IL-6. The A-a gradient and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) were calculated.The change, between the time of tocilizumab use and 72 hours after, in laboratory and ventilatory parameters was analyzed.The use and time of use of mechanical ventilation (MV), and the percentage improvement of the A-a gradient and of PaO2/FiO2 after 72 hours of tocilizumab use were defined as outcomes.Deaths, non-covid-19 infections and events not attributable to the usual course of the disease were recorded and analyzed.Data sources/measurement: Data was obtained from the patient's clinical record in the institutional electronic clinical file. The use of MV was evaluated as a qualitative and quantitative variable (days of use), and improvements in the A-a gradient and PaO2/FiO2 were evaluated quantitatively. Non-COVID-19 infections and adverse events not attributable to the usual course of the disease were evaluated as qualitative variables.Statistical methods: The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac OS, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY. Categorical variables were described as frequencies and/or percentages, and quantitative variables were described as mean and standard deviation (SD) for those normally distributed or median and interquartile range (IQR) for those not normally distributed. Changes in parameters were analyzed using T-test for paired variables or Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test, as appropriate. The associations between variables and outcomes were evaluated using linear or logistic regressions for univariate and multivariate analysis. The covariates included in the multivariate analysis model were age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, smoking status, days with symptoms. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.In case of missing data, the analysis was performed with the available data.Desarrollo medicine faculty approved the study prior to data collection.This study did not receive any type of financing.Participants: 29 of 68 evaluated patients (42.6%) received Tocilizumab.Baseline characteristics: The mean age of the patients was 56.9 years, and only two were women. 37.9% were obese and the most frequent comorbidity was hypertension. All patients presented lymphopenia and elevated inflammatory markers ( Other interventions: (Table 3 ) six patients received HCQ (400 mg every 12 hours the first day and then 200 mg every 12 hours for four days, five days in total).Laboratory parameters: From admission to the day of tocilizumab use, lymphocytes decreased by a mean of 30.7% (SD 36). After 72 hours of using tocilizumab there was a significant improvement in the lymphocyte count, NLR, ESR, CPR, and fibrinogen. A mild and transient, but statistically significant, rise in alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and D-dimer was observed (Table 4 ).Ventilatory parameters: The improvement in PaO2/FiO2 (23%) and A-a gradient (30.7%) after 72 hours of tocilizumab use was statistically significant. Nine patients received tocilizumab while on MV. Of the remaining 20 patients, 11 (55%) required MV after using tocilizumab. Of these 11 only one required IMV (the other three patients who used IMV required it before tocilizumab use) (Tables 2, 4).Infections: Seven culture samples were positive after tocilizumab use, in five patients (17.2%). Only three of them presented a proven clinical infection ( Table 5 ).The first patient was an 81-year-old man, with history of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic CS use, who received tocilizumab on the second day of hospitalization while on NIMV (with a procalcitonin [PCT] of 0.28 ng/mL), was intubated on the third day, and on the sixth day a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was identified in the endotracheal aspirate culture, without clinical impact. On the ninth day of hospitalization a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was identified in two blood and one catheter tip samples.This was compatible with a central line associated bacteremia and the central line was removed. The fever disappeared without additional antibiotic treatment. He was discharged after 29 days of hospitalization.The second patient was a 66-year-old man with a urine culture positive for candida albicans (>100,000 colony forming units) with non-inflammatory urine (PCT of 0.45 ng/mL at the time of tocilizumab use). This was an asymptomatic candiduria. Twelve days later he presented two positive blood cultures for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. He had an elbow bursitis and a retroperitoneal hematoma at the same time. He was successfully treated with intravenous cefazolin and was discharged after 44 days of hospitalization.The third patient was a 54-year-old man, who presented a positive culture of the endotracheal aspirate for a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The bronchoalveolar lavage culture of the same day was negative. He was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics.In all patients the PCT measured on the day of tocilizumab use had a median value of 0.17 ng/mL (IQR 0.1-0.38; <0.5 ng/mL= low risk of sepsis). In the five patients who presented a positive culture, PCT had a median value of 0.26 (IQR 0.17-0.28), at the time of tocilizumab use. There was no statistically significant difference in the PCT between these two groups.Thus, three patients presented a clinically relevant infection, and none of these had severe course.Adverse events: Events out of the expected course for COVID-19, after receiving tocilizumab, were described in 6 male patients (20.7%).One patient presented leukopenia of 2,800/mm3 with neutropenia of 1,425/mm3, which normalized ten days after discharge. Two patients had mild elevation of transaminases. The study of known hepatotropic agents was negative, thus a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection or drugs was considered as possible causes. One of these patients had already had his post-discharge evaluation and transaminases had normalized.On the 27th day of hospitalization, an 81-year-old patient (patient number 1 in table 5) who required intubation presented a small left para-aortic pleural collection, possibly with blood content, on computed axial tomography. This did not mean any change for the course of his hospitalization, and he was discharged after 29 days of hospitalization.Two patients presented pulmonary thromboembolism. The first case occurred in a 54-year-old patient, on his eighth day of hospitalization and on his seventeenth day of symptoms, seven days after receiving tocilizumab and after three days connected to IMV, being on prophylactic anticoagulation, without D-dimer level of that day. Pulmonary thromboembolism was bilateral and difficult to anticoagulate, and his hospitalization lasted 26 days, but he was discharged in good condition. The second patient was 66 years old and presented a left basal subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism, on day 17 of hospitalization and on the 25th day of symptoms, 14 days after receiving tocilizumab and after 15 days on MV (nine of them on IMV), being on prophylactic anticoagulation, with a D-dimer of 1.751 ng/mL (11 days before it was 5.858 ng/mL). After seven days of anticoagulation, the patient presented an extensive retroperitoneal hematoma. He was discharged after 36 days of hospitalization in good condition. Deaths: Two patients died (6.9%). The first patient was an 81-year-old man with history of prostate cancer successfully treated surgically. The patient required IMV after 1 day of hospitalization and received tocilizumab in this condition on the fifth day of hospitalization and twentieth of symptoms. The patient managed to transition to NIMV temporarily. The only positive culture was a urine culture with Enterobacter cloacae (patient number 4 in table 5).The patient followed a progressive course with respiratory and hemodynamic deterioration, with elevated levels of troponin and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide, and presented a sharp drop in his hematocrit (from 35% to 23%, being anticoagulated with dalteparin) before dying in the eleventh day of hospitalization.The second patient was a 73-year-old man with history of obstructive sleep apnea and possible interstitial lung disease. He received tocilizumab on the third day of hospitalization and eighth of symptoms while on NIMV. He did not present notable infections or events, but had progressive respiratory deterioration, and after 7 days in NIMV it was decided to limit therapeutic efforts and the patient was not intubated. He died on the twelfth day of hospitalization.No significant associations were found between the different variables and death.Lymphocyte count: A greater percentage improvement in the lymphocyte count between the day of tocilizumab use and 72 hours afterwards was significantly associated with a higher number of days with symptoms when tocilizumab was used, and a higher cumulative dose of corticosteroids. These associations did not maintain statistical significance in the multivariate analysis (Appendix Table 1 ).Ventilatory parameters: A greater percentage improvement in the A-a gradient was significantly associated with a lower level of D-dimer when receiving tocilizumab, and a greater improvement in PaO2/FiO2 was associated with a higher level of ESR and lower D-dimer at the time of receiving tocilizumab. These associations were weak, and none remained significant after multivariate analysis (Appendix Table 1 ).Mechanical ventilation: A lower lymphocyte count 72 hours after tocilizumab use was associated with requiring MV in patients who were not on MV at the time of receiving tocilizumab (table 6). In the 20 patients who received tocilizumab without using MV, there were no significant differences between the 11 patients who required MV later and the 9 who did not, except in the lymphocyte count 72 hours after receiving tocilizumab (p = 0.004) and their percentage of improvement (p = 0.016). At the time of receiving tocilizumab, the median number of lymphocytes in those who subsequently required MV was 682 (IQR 484-767) and rose to 807 (IQR 666-1335) 72 hours after tocilizumab, a median improvement of 51.7% (IQR 30.3 -79.3). In those who did not require MV after tocilizumab, the lymphocytes rose from 737 (IQR 571-806) to 1602 (IQR 1402-2087), a median improvement of 157.8% (IQR 99.7-180.6).A greater number of days in MV after tocilizumab was significantly associated with worse PaO2/FiO2 and A-a gradient, and with lower lymphocyte count, but only the A-a gradient and the lymphocyte count maintained statistical significance in the multivariate analysis (Appendix Table 1 ). Furthermore, a lower number of lymphocytes on admission was associated with requiring IMV (table 6).Infections: Older age, low lymphocyte count and a high NLR were associated with a greater possibility of presenting a positive culture (Table 6) .Deaths: No associations were found.This is the first Latin American report to evaluate the use of tocilizumab in patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19.Our cohort corresponds to relatively young Latin American patients, mainly men, with a significant prevalence of comorbidities known to be strong risk factors for severe COVID-19 [15] .The patients presented a severe disease and 69% required MV. All patients presented biomarkers compatible with hyperinflammation, impaired gas exchange, and rapid worsening of these despite receiving usual treatment.The use of hydroxychloroquine was infrequent since its prescription decreased when reports were published that warned of the ineffectiveness and risk of adverse events of its use [16] .Rapid clinical deterioration in most of our patients, in a phase of hyperinflammatory disease, led to the indication of immunomodulatory therapy, at first with CS. In practice, we used a sequential strategy in which the use of tocilizumab was decided only once despite the use of corticosteroids a worsening of the patient condition was observed. CS usefulness in COVID-19 remains controversial[17], however, in a recently published trial, the use of dexamethasone (6 mg every day for a median six days, approximately a cumulative dose equivalent to 225 mg of prednisone) resulted in lower 28-day mortality [18] .In our cohort the cumulative dose of CS, equivalent to prednisone, was higher, with a median of 725.9 mg. A recently published retrospective analysis also showed good results with a high dose of CS and subsequent use of tocilizumab [19] . Undoubtedly, the routine CS use with a high cumulative dose results in an important confounding factor when interpreting efficacy and safety data.In our patients, 72 hours after tocilizumab use, a dramatic improvement was observed in ventilatory parameters and in most CRS biomarkers. D-dimer was highly variable from day to day in our patients.Although its values increased 72 hours after tocilizumab and seemed to be associated with improvements in A-a gradient and PaO2/Fio2, the changes in its levels over the course of the hospitalization make it difficult to draw conclusions about its associations and predictive role. and function may be critical to reduce disease severity. It is expected that the use of CS would be associated with greater lymphopenia and worse NLR, but what we observed was that after the use of tocilizumab these parameters improved significantly. It can be hypothesized that blocking IL-6 could help in COVID-19 not only by inhibiting directly the exaggerated inflammatory response, but also by restoring cellular immunity which is crucial for virus clearance.After multivariate analysis, the decrease in the A-a gradient, but not the increase of PaO2/FiO2, correlated with a lower number of days of MV use after tocilizumab infusion. This is because the gradient is a more sensitive index to evaluate disturbances in gas exchanges [25] .Assessing the safety of tocilizumab use in a COVID-19 patient is of the utmost importance. Despite the increase in transaminase values after tocilizumab use in our patients, this was transitory and not associated with liver failure. Two patients (6.9%) suffered from pulmonary thromboembolism, which seems to be within More than an immunosuppressive agent, tocilizumab acts as an immunomodulator, and our patients significantly raised their lymphocytes after its use, which was associated with a lower risk of infection.Two of our patients died (6.9%). The mortality rate in our center, as of July 16, 2020, counting 1076 hospitalized patients, is 5.3%. The rate of our cohort is slightly higher, but it should be considered that it consists of patients selected because of their severity.Our study has several limitations. It is an observational study without control group. It represents a small number of patients from a single center. In the analysis of the results, it was not possible to have some data in all the patients. This report may not capture adverse events that may occur in the long term.Our study is relevant because it represents the experience of a Latin American country, with a population poorly represented in other series. In addition, we provide more information to assist in choosing the best ""window of opportunity"" for tocilizumab use, specially the work of a multidisciplinary team that evaluated each patient in detail. Our team analyzed the pathophysiological rationality and the accumulated evidence and established criteria to consider the use of tocilizumab that considered the presence of an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Even when the patients met the established criteria, there was a group discussion weighing the risks and possible benefits before suggesting the use of the drug. Furthermore, we describe the use of tocilizumab together with high doses of CS, we detail the infections, adverse events, and deaths, and we analyze the variables associated with a better hospital stay.

d9cf622df774943f26ca857436a491cee471a33d,The arrival and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia,"The number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is rapidly increasing throughout South America. The To assess the genetic diversity and origins of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia, we sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from NP-VTM clinical specimens. Sample preparation for sequencing was done using whole-genome amplification with custom designed tiling primers and the Artic Consortium protocol (Figure 1 ). We performed univariate analysis to determine whether certain lineages were associated with a health-care worker status, hospital exposure (including intensive care unit admission), or a travel history to high-risk areas. A significant association (P = .033) was only found between infection with B.1 lineage and a travel history to high-risk areas. In conclusion, Pangolin lineage B.1 was associated with prior travel to high-risk areas.We further constructed a time-scaled ML phylogeny using TreeTime and specimen collection date constraints. 8 In addition, the unfeasibility of complying with quarantine measures due to concern over loss of income or loosing employment, as well as the lack of water and inappropriate wastewater treatment may favor transmission and halt potential mitigation efforts needed for containment of the virus. This is why alongside strengthening public health capabilities there is an urgent need to better understand and address the main drivers influencing the epidemic spread in this The displayed time tree was inferred under a strict clock model with a fixed substitution rate of 0.8 × 10 −3 , based on previous rate value estimates. 5 TreeTime analyses were run for a total of six iterations and marginal date estimates of ancestral states are shown with 90% confidence intervals. SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 United States, Canada, Chile, and Iceland lineages (Figure 1) . That is the case of lineages A.5, B.1.3, B.1.11, B.1.5.1, and B.1.25 . Interestingly, the third most common lineage in the country was the B lineage, which has been reported worldwide in returning travelers from China, and which may suggest an independent introduction in the country of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 lineage. This is also the case for other Latin-American countries, such as Uruguay, which has reported the occurrence of B, B.1 and A.1a lineages, 12 Chile that has reported B and A.2a lineages 13 and Brazil with the largest genomic epidemiology study so far in the region. 14 It is well known that mutational events in the S and N genes of coronaviruses may affect its pathogenicity. 15 In fact, it has been demonstrated that both of these genes are undergoing episodic selection as the virus is transmitted amongst humans. 16 More recently, the description of several mutations in the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 capable of inducing a missense mutation has suggested the possibility for increased viral infectivity and virulence. 9,17 Also, illustrating how the two S1 domains recognize different receptors and how the spike proteins are regulated to undergo conformational transitions and increase infectivity in coronaviruses. To date there are few studies that have associated the SARS-CoV-2 lineage with the infection severity 18 and differential diagnosis. 19 In our case, we identified the key mutation D614G in most of the Colombian genomes which has been associated with increased infectivity, 9 future studies should unveil its clinical consequences and impact in South America and its regional particularities.In conclusion, this represents the first genomic epidemiology study of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia. Future studies in the country and elsewhere in South America, including sequencing of viral genomes as the predicted epidemic peak approaches, and of contact cases and spread clusters, may help to better identify transmission routes and inform potential prevention measures. Our study supports the relevance of genomic surveillance and the critical need to establish coordinated efforts to generate genomic data in South America that will enable integrative analyses to uncover SARS-CoV-2 dynamics at the continental level.The authors thank Dirección de Investigación e Innovación from Universidad del Rosario for funding this study.

55bdc5291574f4273700b4633220e1bf49cc3d4a,Is Higher Viral Load in SARS-CoV-2 Associated With Death?,"The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for causing >11 million infections around the world since December 2019 [1] . Although the severity is mild in most cases, up to 33% of the infected patients require hospitalization and almost 20% die [2, 3] . To date, several studies have focused on the risk factors for moderate to severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), such as comorbidities, older age, and laboratory abnormalities [4, 5] . However, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 viral load on clinical outcomes remains understated. Two Chinese studies demonstrated that the viral load in hospitalized patients was higher [6, 7] and one recent American study demonstrated that higher viral loads were correlated with a higher risk of intubation and death for inpatients [8] . Nevertheless, the correlation between viral load and hospitalization risk in inpatients and outpatients remains unelucidated.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay in nasopharyngeal swab specimens is the primary diagnostic method for COVID-19 [9] . Data concerning cycle threshold (Ct) values, which are inversely proportional to the amount of RNA viral copies, has been used as an inference of the viral load.Viral load can also act as a biomarker of disease severity, clinical outcome, and mortality. We conducted a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, disease severity, and clinical outcome of 875 patients at a large university hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, between March and June 2020.This retrospective observational cohort study involved patients who presented We used the cycle threshold (Ct) values as a semiquantitative measure of viral load. The amount of viral RNA copies present in the positive samples is inversely proportional to the corresponding Ct value. That is, the greater is the amount of viral RNA, the lower is the Ct value.Nasal swab samples were collected from the patients at admission. The RNA of the samples was purified using the Quick-RNA Viral Kit (Zymo Research, USA), according to manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA was stored at −80°C.Our study included a large number of admission SARS-CoV-2 samples with a stratified clinical expression in mild (non-hospitalized), moderate, and severe (hospitalized) than described by others who did not categorize patients.Argyropoulos et al. [16] found that patients with mild Covid-19 infection presented high viral load, as was demonstrated in our study. However, their study demonstrated that hospitalized patients had a lower viral load than nonhospitalized patients, but they did not categorize the patients according to disease severity. Their small sample size probably accounts for the different results we observed in this study. Viral load distribution according to the Ct values from initial samples of our study patients followed a V curve, with mild and critically ill patients having higher viral load than hospitalized patients with a better outcome.Ct values of <25 were consistent with high viral load in patients who were more likely to die during hospitalization. Magleby et al. [17] evaluating the correlation between Ct values and clinical outcome demonstrated a significant association between higher viral load and death or intubation.In conclusion, we found that admission SARS-CoV-2 viral load, as was determined by the Ct value, is an important surrogate epidemiological marker of infectivity that was independently associated with mortality among the patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These findings suggest that Ct values can be used to assist clinicians to identify patients at a high risk for severe outcome.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-06,8

The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may create a variable clinical spectrum of symptoms and signs, which varies from asymptomatic conditions to the occurrence of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Its spread has increased quickly. On January 20, China confirmed the transmission of COVID-19 from human to human. On January 23, the city of Wuhan closed all its access paths to decrease disease spread, but this was not enough. On January 30, 2020, during an emergency meeting convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 was pointed out as a public health emergency of international interest, and it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (Lai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . 2,719,897 cases of COVID-19 and 187,705 deaths have been confirmed in the world until April 25, 2020, according to an information report from the Pan American Health Organization -PAHO (2020) and WHO (2020) .China disclosed the adoption of active measures to help control the quick spread of COVID-19 in its territory. More than 30,000 health professionals moved to the province of Hubei and city of Wuhan. This professional category was soon affected by the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 3,000 health professionals were infected in China (Li et al., 2020; Huang and Zhao, 2020a) . In the face of long work shifts (that reach 16 hours per day on average), the risk of getting infected by a high-infectious disease and the lack of enough biological protection measures, mental suffering among health professionals suddenly became evident and, as a consequence, it brought sleep, anxiety, and depression disorders. Thus, not only the physical health, but also the mental health of these workers became more vulnerable during the COVID-19 outbreak (Huang and Zhao, 2020a,b; Dai et al., 2020) .Hence, health professionals are key personnel to containing infectious diseases like COVID-19. They perform their activities in a full and assertive way when in a calm environment where the risks they are exposed to are dully controlled. Thus, more should J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f be understood about the mental health condition of these workers and the negative psychological repercussions when facing a prolonged source of distress to plan actions that promote and protect their mental and physical health (Mo et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020) .On February 2, 2020, the China State Council announced the adoption of direct lines of psychological support in the entire country to offer help during the pandemic (Lai et al., 2020) . Such action was based on studies indicating that the authorities should provide effective information and guidance regarding personal protection and also psychological interventions that may safeguard the mental health of the entire population (Wang et al., 2020) . Another study found that health education should be combined with psychological counseling for vulnerable subjects, such as the health professionals that are in the frontline fighting COVID-19 (Mo et al., 2020) .Based on a scenario of increasing pandemic threat and a global atmosphere of anxiety, along with depression caused by the social distancing measures recommended to reduce disease transmission and an overload of information disclosed by different media outlets, information collection on the behavior and mental condition of health workers may help establish effective measures that stimulate and protect their health during the war against the pandemic (Wang et al., 2020) . Due to this situation, we have aimed to formulate a systematic review of literature regarding the psychiatric repercussions in health professionals that work in health systems to fight the clinical implications caused by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2. METHODA systematic research of all published papers was made in PubMed, Embase, ISI (Web of Science) and Scopus databases using the following combination of keywords:""COVID-19"" OR ""Coronavirus Infections"" (Medical Subject Headings -[MeSH term]; ""Health Personnel"" OR ""Health Care Provider"" [MeSH] term); and ""Mental Health"" (MeSH term), from December 2019 to April 2020.The reason for limiting time to 2019-2020 was because during this period there was an increase in the number of research studies about health professionals as populations that are vulnerable to being contaminated by a highly virulent disease. Therefore, concern for health professionals has been associated not only with anxiety but also with other multiple clinical manifestations, like depression (having to face a large number of deaths, long work shifts and their association as an important indicator of psychic distress due to multiple uncertainties and demands associated with the treatment of COVID-19 patients.The following searches were carried out: 1 and 2 and 3. The search strategy and retrieved papers were reviewed in two separate occasions to ensure proper sampling.Then, each paper from the sample was read and data were extracted and added to a matrix that authors, journal, study sample description and main conclusions.This study is based on the following research question: What are the psychiatric impacts on health professionals in the face of physical and psychological conditions to which they are subjected due to the high demands of the COVID-19 pandemic?This question had obtained a larger impact in 2020 due to situations that involve health professionals directly in the diagnosis, treatment and support to patients, in the development of psychic spaces for pain installation and psychic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f suffering and other mental health symptoms. Thus, this systematic review aims to present the causes, psychiatric disorders per se, consequences and potential interventions.The eligible studies should meet the following inclusion criteria: original studies about the psychiatric repercussions in health professionals involved in the fight against COVID-19; observational studies that measured the behavioral actions of health professionals involved in the fight against COVID-19. We excluded review studies and Controlled Randomized Trials, case reports, studies with methodological bias and conflicting results; there were no restrictions regarding language.Data were collected independently by two reviewers (MLRN and FCTS) and any divergences between reviewers were solved by a mediator until a consensus was reached. The remaining papers were researched in full to determine if they met the inclusion criteria or not. The necessary information was collected from published papers ( Figure 1 ).Stata, version 14.0 (Stata Corp), was used to collect data and perform relevant analyses in this meta-analysis. Each numerical value of the result was presented with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The publication bias was found through the Egger and Begg tests, p<0.05 was considered a significant publication bias. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to test result stability using Stata 12.0 software. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3. RESULTSThe detailed steps of the literature research flow and screening process were described in Figure 1 . A total of 90 papers were found. Two independent researchers analyzed the title and abstract of the paper, 78 studies were removed because they did not meet the inclusion criteria and 12 potentially related papers were eligible. In the end, eight papers were considered relevant for a systematic review with meta-analysis. Table 1 .As shown in Table 1 , we found that the psychiatric repercussions among health professionals in the fight against COVID-19 was significant in studies developed in European and non-European countries. Results of a sensitivity analysis revealed that the studies significantly showed a posttraumatic stress concentration among professionals, which indicated statistically robust results. The publication bias was examined both in a qualitative (funnel plot asymmetry) and quantitative manner ( Li et al. (2020) have observed that the indirect traumatization scores for front-line nurses, including psychological scores and responses, were significantly lower (p<0.001). Mo et al. (2020) pointed out that the multiple regression analysis showed that children, work hours per week and anxiety were the main factors affecting the level of stress of nurses (p=0.000, 0.048, 0.000, respectively). For Qi et al. (2020) , a total of 1,306 subjects were enrolled. A group of subjects had significantly higher scores of PSQI (p 0.0001), AIS (p<0.0001), anxiety (p<0.0001), and depression (p=0.0010) and a higher prevalence of sleep disorders with PSQI>7 points (p<0.0001) and AIS>6 points (p=0.0001). Huang and Zhao. (2020a) pointed out that health professionals have a higher rate of sleep disorders in comparison with other occupations. Younger health workers and people that spent longer periods of time (≥ 3 hours/day) had a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms than those that spent less time (<1 hour/day and 1-2 hours/day) in the outbreak. Huang and Zhao (2020a,b) observed that medical support workers were more prone to poor quality of sleep compared with other occupational groups. The multivariate logistic regression showed that age (<35 years) and time spent focused on COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD and with medical support to workers that had a higher risk of poor sleep quality. Dai et al. (2020) Health professionals that work to fight COVID-19 are being more severely affected by psychiatric disorders (Lai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020) , sleep disorders (Huang and Zhao 2020a, b; Qi et al., 2020) , stress (Mo et al., 2020) , and indirect traumatization (Li et al., 2020) than other occupational groups. After studying physiological and molecular reasons of psychiatric disorders more profoundly, we observed that somatic symptomatology culminates in psychoneuroimmunology bias analysis (PNI) of COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020) . The release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL) -1β and IL-6 of the respiratory tract, may be stimulated by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by COVID-19 (Conti et al., 2020) . In parallel, the increase of cytokines was also seen in major depression disorders and in functional somatic syndromes (Wang et al., 2020) . Thus, COVID-19 and such psychiatric disorders have a similar psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) structure.In this clinical scenario, the studies carried out by Lai et al. (2020) and Zhang et al. (2020) present higher statistically significant risks of a psychiatric symptomatology associated with depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia in health professionals working in patients affected by COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The results were obtained, respectively, through scales regarding the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) (Lai et al., 2020) .The studies conducted by Zhang et al. (2020) and Lai et al. (2020) observed a higher statistically relevant prevalence in health professionals who are not doctors of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia; however, a new symptomatology associated with obsessive-compulsive traces and somatization was also reported. The organic presence of disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in doctors, but it was a risk factor for non-doctors (Zhang et al., 2020) . Regarding a higher predisposition or vulnerability to disorders among health professionals, the profiles of female nurses were significantly reported with more severe levels of all the measures of mental disorders (Lai et al., 2020) . Being at risk of contact with patients, being a woman and living in rural areas were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (Zhang et al., 2020) . In the analysis of subgroups of front-line medical workers, compared to the male gender, women also had a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disorders (p<0.0001) (Qi et al., 2020) . A multiple regression analysis also showed that anxiety J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was significantly associated with stress developed by nurses whose fight against the COVID-19 pandemic makes them constantly under pressure.Factors that stimulate the psychic conditions mentioned include work conditions to which health professionals are subjected to, such as performing tasks under great pressure, irregular work schedule, and long shifts, contributing to the development of psychological and sleep disorders (Sveinsdottir, 2006) . Besides the general stressors to which these professionals are exposed to, the COVID-19 pandemic context brings specific stressors, such as the risk of infecting yourself and others, the care of relatives socially isolated at home and worries about mental and physical health conditions among coworkers (IASC, 2020) . This prolonged exposure to stressors may exceed the mechanisms individuals have to fight back and this results in psychological repercussions for these subjects (Fava et al., 2019) .One of the causes of psychological stress among health professionals working in the pandemic may be associated with the difficulties found to ensure personal safety related to the high risk of being exposed to infected patients and the scarcity of protection equipment (Zhang et al., 2020) . In addition, these professionals are seeing significant changes in their work environment, such as the increase of occupational responsibilities, strict measures of safety and reduced self-care due to lack of time and energy (IASC, 2020; WHO, 2020). In a cross-sectional study including 1,306 health professionals in the province of Hubei, China, frequent work hours and occupational stress, besides COVID-19 severity, were mentioned by subjects as the main factors influencing sleep quality (Qi et al., 2020) .In turn, reduced social support received by these subjects due to long work hours and stigmatization of workers in contact with COVID-19 patients may also contribute to the professional stress of workers directly involved with the pandemic (IASC, 2020; WHO, 2020) . This evidence is corroborated in the analysis of 4,357 health professionals in China, which found that ""being isolated"" among many other factors was a factor associated with poor prognosis of psychological disorders (Dai et al., 2020) . Similarly, working in rural areas was also associated with a higher risk of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) among health professionals. This fact may also be associated with higher concerns about the risk of infection due to the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f need of working at a service that often has poorer work conditions in comparison with those from the urban area (Zhang et al., 2020) .Besides the psychiatric symptomatology analyses, some interventionist measures may contribute to reduce the stress suffered by health professionals and promote mental health improvement, even during the pandemic. At first, it is important to acknowledge violent emotions, under these circumstances, including anger, irritability or mood alterations. They should be seen as regular and comprehensible stress reactions and, therefore, should not be processed as guilty. Ensuring basic needs are duly satisfied is also especially important, besides having sufficient breaks, keeping a healthy diet and remaining physically active. The use of substances, like alcohol and tobacco, as a coping strategy may bring psychological and physical damage in the long term and should be avoided. Sharing experiences and feelings with colleagues experiencing similar problems may help reduce psychological stress. Telephone calls and message services can be used to keep social contacts in the private sphere, which is a great contributor to maintaining good mental health (WHO, 2020; IASC, 2020; Petzold and Ströhle, 2020) .The studies analyzed have limitations due to the limited scope, because most of the subjects belong to Wuhan, China, and due to the short period of the analysis. In addition, another limitation was the psychological assessments in online research and self-report tools. Therefore, large-sized longitudinal studies that include other health professionals, in addition to doctors and nurses, are necessary to further explore the pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies and use of clinical interviews to elaborate a wider assessment of the problem.

2d424aa3ea79e02855ddc8a20b3e23bb9ed5b1a2,"The impact of COVID-19 partial lockdown on the air quality of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","On December 31, 2019, China alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) of several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, an 11 million people city in the central Hubei Province. On January 7, 2020, the identification of a new virus, named SARS-CoV-2, was announced (WHO, 2020a) . The disease, known as COVID-19, produces mild symptoms in most people, but can also lead to severe respiratory illness. On January 23, authorities have quarantined the city of Wuhan and, by the end of January, authorities had enforced restrictions in at least fifteen additional cities in Hubei Province. Cases were recorded in every provincelevel subdivision in China and, in a few weeks, the virus had spread to dozens of other countries in Asia. The United States reported the first coronavirus case on January 20, in the Washington State, and, on January 24, the first cases were reported in Europe (Spain, France and Italy) (Hopkins, 2020) . Latin American was free of the virus until February. The first case confirmed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (on February 25) was a 61-years old man who had travelled to Lombardy, northern of Italy (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020) . On March 5, the Argentinian Ministry of Health reported the first coronavirus case, a 43-years old man who has also visited Italy (Argentina, 2020) . Since then, the virus has spread all over the world: in Africa, Asia, America, Europe and Oceania (Hopkins, 2020) .On March 12, 2020, there were more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and the WHO announced that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic (WHO, 2020b) . On April 2, 1 million cases and more than 52,000 deaths were reported, affecting 204 countries and territories around the world. Fifteen days later, the number of cases had risen to more than 2 million (Hopkins, 2020) . As the cases spread, most of the countries adopted restrictions to the transportation, commerce and cultural activities, schools and universities were closed and exams were cancelled, and social distancing was imposed.Brazil declared COVID-19 a public health emergency on February 3 (Croda et al., 2020) and São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were the first states to step up coronavirus restrictions. On March 16, Rio de Janeiro state's governor declared public health emergency and determined that schools and universities should remain closed, and theaters, cinemas and other public events should be cancelled, work at home would be implemented when possible and gatherings should be avoided. On March 19, a new decree determined that bars, restaurants, beaches, shopping centers and commerce in general (except for food and medicines) should be shut from March 21. Public transport within the city was limited as well as part of the passenger's transport within states. Industrial activities were not suspended, as well as all activities related to health and basic services (DOERJ, 2020) . Similar restrictions were adopted in the state of São Paulo.The outbreak of the coronavirus led to the emptying of streets and public spaces whether by the partial lockdown or by personal responses. During the first quarantine week, in Rio de Janeiro, public transport had a reduction of approximately 50% and private vehicles were significantly reduced (Cyberlab, 2020) . The containment measures had a huge impact in the daily life of the citizens, but they also had a positive impact on air quality (Saadat et al., 2020) . Satellite images recorded in March and April 2020 showed a clear decrease in particulate matter in the metropolitan areas of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Pollutant concentrations depend on emissions, but also on meteorological conditions, transport, deposition and atmospheric chemistry, so a direct relation between satellite images for a single day and emissions cannot be done. Anyway, the same results had been observed in China, Italy, Spain, France and other areas of the world (Copernicus, 2020; NASA, 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020) .As an example, in Fig. S1 (Supplementary material), satellite images obtained on March 23 (2018, 2019 and 2020) and on March 16, March 23 and April 06, 2020 (before the lockdown, on the first lockdown day and during the lockdown, respectively) are displayed (Earth, 2020). These data obtained by the CAMS/Copernicus/European Commission + ECMWF suggested a decrease of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ).Since the relationship between local emissions and environmental concentrations is not linear and vary for different areas of a city, results of individual air quality monitoring stations may not show the same reductions.The main goal of this work is to discuss the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the air quality of the city of Rio de Janeiro comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak.Rio de Janeiro is a coastal city located on the western shore of Guanabara bay. The city is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro and is part of the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro (MRRJ), the second largest urban center in Brazil, with approximately 12 million inhabitants. The city of Rio de Janeiro has approximately 6.5 million people, with 70.7% of its territory urbanized and large areas (more than 30%) covered with the remaining tropical rainforest vegetation (Braga et al., 2019; IBGE, 2020) . The city is divided by the Tijuca Massif in the southern and northern regions. The south, a typical urban area with residential and commercial buildings and predominance of vehicular emission sources, receives winds from the Atlantic Ocean. The north of the city receives air masses from the main industries in the MRRJ: metallurgical and steel industries in the western zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro (Santa Cruz and Campo Grande districts), pharmaceutical, chemical, plastic and metallurgical industries in the northern area (cities of Belford Roxo and Nova Iguacú) and the city of Duque de Caxias (northeastern area), with more than 800 industries in several sectors, such as chemistry, petrochemistry, oil refining, fuel storage, power generation, gas production, plastic and metallurgy .In this study three Districts, shown in Fig. 1 , located in the northern and western area were analyzed: Irajá, Bangu and Tijuca. These locations were selected because they are representative of the city, with different characteristics, and have been characterized in previous studies Mendes et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2018) . The Districts of Irajá and Bangu frequently show ozone pollution episodes and are located in an area which receives the air transported from the industrial and petrochemical districts. In Irajá, the wind rose shows the predominant winds from the east and northeast and from the west. In Bangu predominant winds are from the east and west. Tijuca, also located in the northern area, near the Tijuca Forest mountains (Tijuca Massif) predominantly receives weak mountain breezes from the south and pollutants due to local vehicular emissions. These locations have been previously described by Dantas et al. (2020) and the main characteristics are briefly described in Table 1 .Air quality data available for the city of Rio de Janeiro is very limited, especially regarding hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ). During the studied period, data was obtained by the automatic monitoring stations of the Municipal Department of the Environment (SMAC), using standard methods and equipment according to Brazilian legislation (CONAMA, 1990 (CONAMA, , 2018 . Ecotech analyzers (Melbourne, Australia) were used to monitor nitrogen dioxide-NO 2 (Serinus® 40 model), carbon monoxide-CO (Serinus® 30 model), ozone-O 3 (EC 9810 and Serinus® 10 model), total hydrocarbons (THC) and non-methane hydrocarbons-NMHC (Synspec Alpha 115 model). Particulate matter with diameter small or equal to 10 μm (PM 10 ) was determined with a Met One BAM-1020 Continuous Particulate Monitor (Washington, USA). The concentrations of NO 2 , CO, O 3 and NMHC were obtained at 10-minute intervals and PM 10 at 1-hour intervals. NO 2 and NMHC were not determined at the Tijuca monitoring station, while CO was not determined at Irajá station during the studied period.Meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, speed and wind direction) were also determined in the three monitoring stations. In this study, the impact of these parameters on air quality was not quantitatively evaluated, but data were used for a qualitative interpretation of pollutant concentrations.Experimental data obtained by the monitoring stations were initially analyzed to identify spurious data and values were organized in spread sheets as 1-hour means. For the comparison of the results obtained in different days, medians were used instead of mean and standard deviation values, because data are not necessarily parametric. For the same reason, results are presented as boxplots. Statistical analysis was performed using free software (R, 2020) and standard methods.Experimental results were obtained from March 2, 2020 to April 16, 2020 at the monitoring stations of Irajá (PM 10 , NO 2 , O 3 , THC and NMHC), Bangu (PM 10 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 , THC and NMHC) and Tijuca (PM 10 , CO and O 3 ). The obtained results are shown in Figs. 2-4, respectively, for Irajá, Bangu and Tijuca. For each day, 1-hour means, from 6:30 to 18:30 h (local time BRT), were calculated and plotted as boxplots. Results covering the whole day (day and night hours) are shown in the Supplementary material section. Data obtained in January and February 2020 were not considered because, during those months, pollutant concentrations are in general impacted by the high flux of tourists due to summer holidays and the celebration of Carnival. Also, during February 2020, the rainfalls (276.1 mm) were 155% higher than the historical mean in 1997-2019 (Alerta Rio, 2020) , affecting the pollutant Description of the studied areas in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Tsuruta et al., 2017; Dantas et al., 2020) . ). As previously described, the most important partial lockdown procedures started on March 21-23 (Saturday-Monday). Then, the period from March 23 to April 16 was highlighted in a darker color. The spread of the data is typical of these locations as have been shown in previous studies (Tsuruta et al., 2017; Dantas et al., 2019; Geraldino et al., 2020) .As a general trend, concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the monitoring stations. In general, primary pollutant concentrations showed a decrease in the first days of the lockdown. The differences observed between them can be explained considering the fleet characteristics in Rio de Janeiro. According to the last emission inventory for the MRRJ, mobile emissions account for 98, 67.3, 66.5 and 42.3% of total emissions of CO, HC, NO x and PM 10 , respectively (INEA, 2016) . Mean values for Brazil, estimated in the last national inventory of vehicular emission, showed that 47 and 46% of CO and NMHC, respectively, are emitted by light-duty vehicles (LDV). Motorcycles also contribute with a high fraction (34 and 25% of CO and NMHC). Heavy-duty vehicles (trucks and buses), fueled by diesel, contribute to 91 and 96% of NO x and particulate matter emitted by vehicular sources, respectively (NEI, 2014) . During the partial lockdown, trucks continue to run since industrial and construction activities were maintained as well as the transport of food and cargo in general. The fleet of buses was partially reduced while passengers' cars circulations had a 70-80% decrease in the first lockdown week (03/23-03/ 29) and then raised to approximately 50% (Fiocruz, 2020) . Then, a higher decrease in CO and NMHC should be expected, mainly for the period of 03/23/2020 to 03/29/2020, as will be discussed later. Ozone concentrations, the main secondary pollutant in Rio de Janeiro, markedly increased, mainly in Tijuca and Irajá, as expected considering previous results obtained during a ten-day truck driver strike . In order to clarify these results, data were classified and analyzed for each week. The primary pollutants PM 10 , NO 2 and CO concentrations determined from March 2 to April 12, 2020 are shown in Figs. 5-7. Data are presented as boxplots grouped in weeks: first (03/02-03/08), second (03/09-03/15), third (03/16-03/22), fourth (03/23-03/29), fifth (03/30-05/04) and sixth (05/04-12/04). The beginning of each ""week"" was considered as being on Mondays to match the implementation of the main restrictions. For each period, 1-hour means, from 6:30 to 18:30 h (local time BRT), were calculated and plotted in Figs. 5-7. Results covering the whole day (day and night hours) are shown in the Supplementary material section (Figs. S4-S6 ).The first two weeks in March (from March 2 to March 15) were used as a reference. As previously described, on March 16 (third week in Figs. 5-7) schools and universities were closed and social isolation was recommended. When considering the primary pollutant PM 10 , it was observed an increase in the concentrations (median values) determined in Irajá (10.7%) and Tijuca (11.0%) in the third week in comparison with the values for March 2-March 15. If data were compared with a longer period (02/16/2020-03/15/2020) the difference is still higher (approximately 25-30%) because of the heavy rains in February which led to lower particulate matter levels. Concentrations levels in Bangu were lower in the third week in comparison to the second.For NO 2 , concentrations (median values) in the third week were 28.8% higher and 1.8% lower in Irajá, and Bangu, respectively. If data for a longer period (02/16/2020-03/15/2020) were used as comparison, the difference is higher (approximately 10-20% higher). For CO, values were 15.2% lower and 12% higher in Bangu and Tijuca, respectively. The increase in primary pollutant levels in Irajá and Tijuca can be attributed to the small reduction in the traffic and people circulation in the city. Meteorological conditions as a high atmospheric pressure system, high temperatures and absence of rains until March 20 could contribute to the increase in pollutant concentrations. Winds from the north-northwest also favored the transport of pollutants to Irajá and Tijuca. As an example, air masses arriving in Irajá were simulated using the dispersion model Hysplit implemented by the Air Resources Laboratory -NOAA e Australian Bureau of Meteorology (HYSPLIT, Rolph et al., 2017) . Using a backward dispersion model, air masses arriving at 8:00 (local time, BRT) from the north-northwest were modelled (Fig. S7 Supplementary Material) . The air mass trajectory passed through the industrial areas of Nova Iguaçú and Belford Roxo and over the main highways BR-101 and 116, and also through several avenues and the expressways Linha Vermelha and Avenida Brasil, with intense traffic of both light and heavy-duty vehicles. The monitoring station of Bangu, located in the west area (see Fig. 1 ), between the massifs of Pedra Branca and Gericinó-Mendanha, received winds from the west area and was not impacted by the vehicular emissions of the main avenues and highways.On March 23, the partial lockdown was implemented with a high initial response of the population. A clear decrease of PM 10 and NO 2 was observed in all the stations as a consequence of a decrease of approximately 80% in the vehicular flux (Cyberlab, 2020) . The reduction in PM 10 levels (median values) in comparison with the first two weeks (shown in Fig. 5 ) was 21.4, 17.5 and 33.3% for Irajá, Bangu and Tijuca, respectively. For NO 2 (Fig. 6) , was 53.9 and 32.2% for Irajá and Bangu, respectively. The reduction in CO concentrations was 48.5 and 41.3% in Tijuca and Bangu, respectively (Fig. 7) .As expected, the decrease in PM 10 and NO 2 was not directly proportional to the vehicular flux reduction, because it depends on other factors such as the transport of air masses and meteorological parameters. Moreover, the traffic of trucks and other cargo vehicles was not reduced since supermarkets, drug and construction materials stores continued the activities as well as industries and gasoline stations. These vehicles fueled with diesel are the main contributors to PM 10 and NO 2 . Urban buses circulation was only partially reduced (approximately 50%). Considering the last emission inventory for the MRRJ (INEA, 2016) emissions of PM 10 and NO 2 are mainly due to heavy-duty vehicles. Trucks contribute to 49.8 and 32.1% of PM 10 and NO 2 emissions, respectively, while urban buses account for 42.6 and 50.6%. The lower decrease for particulate matter levels in comparison to NO 2 is probably due to the highest contribution of trucks which continue circulating within the city. Other sources such as construction works, industrial emissions, dust resuspension and transport from the vegetated areas (rainforest) could also contribute to particulate matter emission. Recently, Tobias et al. (2020) reported similar results for the city of Barcelona (Spain). The decrease in CO levels was lower than the reduction of light-duty vehicles flux. In part, these results may be due to a surge in demand for food and package delivery services which led to the increase in motorcycles use.On April 3, and during the weekend (April 4 and 5), an increase on vehicular flux was observed. As fully published in media, some gatherings were registered in supermarkets, banks and other public places, in part due to the payment of salaries, and also by the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. As consequence PM 10 , NO 2 and CO levels increased in comparison with the previous week. In Fig. S7 (Supplementary Material), air masses from the west, originating in an urban area, are shown for March 4.In Table 2 , the trends in primary pollutant levels are presented for the third to sixth weeks using March 2-15 as a reference. In general, as shown in Figs. 2-4, primary pollutants concentrations were lower on Sundays. However, since median values were used, the inclusion of Sundays had a negligible impact on values presented in Table 2 . As shown in Figs. S4-S6 (Supplementary Material), when considering the night-time hours, the same trends were observed.In Fig. 8 , concentrations of O 3 (1-hour mean), the main secondary pollutant, determined at Irajá, Bangu and Tijuca monitoring station from March 2 to April 12, 2020 are displayed. In the Supplementary material section, data covering the whole day (day and night hours) are shown (Fig. S8 ). As shown in Table 2 , ozone levels increased in the three monitoring station during the third week in comparison with the two reference weeks (median values) by 31.1, 22.5 and 63.0% for Irajá, Bangu and Tijuca, respectively. After March 23, concentrations remained high. During the fourth week, in Irajá and Tijuca, values were 12.9 and 44.0% higher than values determined from March 2 to March 15. In Bangu, concentrations were only 2.7% lower. The same tendencies were observed in the following weeks. From April 6 to April 12, sparse rainfall and low solar irradiances favored the decrease on ozone levels. Similar results were also observed in Barcelona (Tobias et al., 2020) .As fully discussed in previous studies , ozone concentrations in Rio de Janeiro highly depend on nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and total nitrogen oxides (NO x = NO + NO 2 ) concentrations ratios (NMHC/NO x Results showed that, in Irajá, NMHC concentrations increased in the third week (21.4%) and with the lockdown decreased 28.4 and 14.3% (fourth and fifth weeks, respectively) and in April increased again. Since NMHC/NO x ratios were approximately equal in the period of March 02-22, the increase in ozone concentrations was probably related to air masses entering from the northern industrial area. As recently discussed by Dantas et al. (2020) , the reactivity of the volatile organic compounds (VOC) mixture in Irajá is highly increased by industrial air masses rich in aromatic compounds (such as alkyl-substituted benzene and xylene isomers). During the fourth and fifth weeks, the sharp decrease in NO 2 concentrations (53.9 and 19.7%, respectively) lead to an increase in ozone, since atmospheric chemistry in Rio de Janeiro is under VOC-controlled conditions. In April, as previously discussed, the levels of all pollutants had a small variation due to the relaxation of social isolation measures. In Bangu, NMHC remained with small variations and the increase of ozone levels may be attributed to the decrease in nitrogen oxides (Geraldino et al., 2020) .In order to perform a further analysis, the primary pollutants PM 10 , NO 2 and CO concentration values determined from March 23 to April 12, 2020 (partial lockdown) were compared with the same values obtained in 2019. Results for the three studied locations are shown in Figs. S13-S15 (Supplementary Material). In these figures, individual 1hour values for each day were used to construct the boxplots.For PM 10 , median values for 2020, were equal, 19.35% higher and 28.70% lower than in 2019 for Irajá, Bangu and Tijuca, respectively. For NO 2 , median values were lower in 2020: 32.9 and 24.1% in Irajá and Bangu, respectively. CO were also lower in 2020: median values 37.0% and 43.6% in Bangu and Tijuca, respectively.These results are in general agreement with the former analysis. Particulate matter emissions are mainly related to diesel fuel and also industrial and construction work which were affected to a lesser extent by the lockdown. Furthermore, local characteristics, such as the distribution of the fleet and transport of air masses could influence the results: in Tijuca, a residential area where the main input is due to vehicular emissions, PM 10 levels decreased. Bangu receives the input of air masses originating in Santa Cruz and Campo Grande, where are located several metallurgical and steel industries and also mining and construction business which could contribute to particulate matter increase.In spite of NO 2 being emitted mostly by diesel vehicles, levels were lower in 2020, as was observed in other countries and could be probably attributed to the decrease in local and interstate buses circulation, massive cancellations of flights and cruises and the reduce demand of energy production. The CO sharp decrease is clearly related to the emission reduction as a consequence of a 50-80% decrease in lightduty vehicular flux.These results showed the impact of the partial lockdown on the air quality of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The main restrictions were applied from March 23, however, in April, social isolation was relaxed in spite of the recommendations of WHO, scientist and medical experts and also state's governments. The partial confinement of the population, reduction of road traffic and economic activity led to the decrease in CO and NO 2 levels and, by contrast, to the increase in ozone concentrations. Similar results had been observed in 2018, during a 10-day truck driver strike. Since particulate matter and ozone are, in general, the pollutants of main concern in Rio the Janeiro, these results suggest that the assessment of air quality policies in the city requires the analysis of air masses transported from the industrial areas as well as the study of VOC speciation and the impact of NMHC/NO x ratios on ozone levels, considering that the high temperatures and solar radiation indexes favor ozone formation. The impact of meteorological conditions cannot be neglected and should be analyzed in the future.CRediT authorship contribution statement The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-10,8
20a07679716a8af83aa5f11aa5b6bbd529f275dd,"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Rabies Reemergence in Latin America: the case of Arequipa, Peru","During the last decades, enormous progress has been achieved towards the elimination of canine rabies in the Americas (1-3). By 2019, health authorities in the Americas felt that Latin America was closer than ever to achieving the elimination of human deaths by rabies. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) announced on the eve of World Rabies Day -28 September that only five human cases were reported in the region in the previous 12 months (4) . The number of people dying from rabies reduced by more than 30 fold in 25 years (5) . This reduction in human cases followed a drastic reduction of reported rabid dogs in Latin America from 15,686 in 1982 to 1,131 in 2003 (5) . Both achievements were due mainly to a coordinated regional plan that involved multi-pronged strategies and continuous activities conducted by national governments and local communities (3) . The successes of this regional endeavor have continued until recent years (6) . The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has disrupted these strategies and activities in Latin America and could jeopardize the elimination prospects in the whole region.Among the different strategies to prevent human rabies around the world, the most effective is mass dog vaccination (7) (8) (9) . In most Latin American countries, the Ministries of Health organize annual or biannual mass canine rabies vaccination campaigns in areas affected and unaffected by canine rabies (3) . During the few days these campaigns are held every year, a massive movement of people is required: many vaccination teams are deployed to salient locations all over cities to set up vaccination tents, many other vaccination teams visit houses door-to-door in remote or inaccessible areas, health promotion workers use megaphones to advertise the campaign on foot or from open trucks, and most importantly, all dog owners are expected to leave their houses and take their dogs to the vaccination points (3, 10) . Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and sequential efforts to minimize that risk are huge barriers for implementation of mass dog vaccination campaigns.Even though the most cost-efficient and high impact intervention to prevent, control, and eliminate canine rabies is mass dog vaccination (8, 9) , surveillance is also a vital component of rabies control programs (11) (12) (13) . In Latin America, since 1983, rabies control programs have included intense surveillance (3) . Regionally, in Latin America data are collected in a system for epidemiological surveillance of rabies called SIRVERA (3, 14) that allows centralization of data, sharing information, evaluating progress, identifying areas with inappropriate surveillance, and detecting anomalies (e.g. outbreaks, expansion). Nationally and locally, surveillance consists mostly of submitting brain samples representing a specific proportion of the dog population (0.2% of the dog population per year is considered ideal in Latin America (3), a quota system that does not necessarily inform rabies control and elimination programs (15) . The surveillance system also seeks to increase awareness and facilitate communication between communities and health inspectors so citizens report suspect dogs (e.g. animals neurological signs, excessively aggressive, salivating profusely, changing mood, or dying suddenly).In response to the report of a suspect or confirmed rabid dog, a veterinarian or health inspector eliminates any dogs exhibiting rabies signs and submits samples for diagnostic testing of rabies (16, 17) . Any submissions testing positive are further responded to with focus control activities around the location the dog was originally found. A team of public health professionals is deployed to the field to conduct broad control and prevention measures such as dog vaccinations, administration of post-exposure prophylaxis, and removal oscf exposed (bitten) dogs (16) (17) (18) (19) . The most direct effect of such activities on rabies virus transmission is the prompt removal of rabid dogs, which effectively reduces the infectious period, the time a rabid dog is able to transmit the rabies virus (20) , and the elimination of in-contact dogs which could shorten the transmission chains (21) . SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 5.1 million people in Latin America as of August 5, 2020 and the pandemic has required an unprecedented, coordinated effort among national public health departments (22) (23) (24) . Public health departments have necessarily shifted their focus and resources to implementing stay-at-home orders and ramping up emergency preparedness efforts. Moreover, veterinarians and other authorities have considered dog vaccination a high risk activity during the pandemic or a non-essential veterinary activity (e.g. non-urgent or non-emergency care) (25) . Changes in resource allocation as well as professional activities and public mobility may have impacts on the control and surveillance of other diseases. In the case of rabies in Peru, and other Latin American countries, the yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns, the cornerstone of rabies prevention, have been postponed and likely will be downsized this year. Surveillance and focus control efforts have also been scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we use a deterministic compartment model to explore the long-term effects of short-term changes to the rabies prevention protocols that have been developed and maintained over the past three decades. Specifically, we investigate how a reduction in canine vaccination coverage, decreased rabies surveillance, and decreased focus control efforts can affect canine rabies dynamics in Arequipa, Peru.The total population, N, was calculated based on estimates provided by the Peruvian Ministry of Health to be 203,183 dogs (26) . The background death rate, , was calculated as the inverse of the average age of the dog population. Average age was calculated from a 2019 survey of over 3000 dogs to be 1099.2 days [1063.3, 1135.1]. Survey methods are described in detail elsewhere (27) . The birth rate, , was calculated to maintain a steady state equilibrium: = N + I.The incubation period of rabies (1/ ) was assumed to be similar to rates reported in the literature. Hampson et al. found the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean incubation period from when exposed dogs were bitten to when they become infectious to be 22.3 days [20.0, 25.0] (20) . The infectious period (1/ ) when surveillance is in place, was estimated from Arequipa focus control data to be 2.5 days [1.9, 3.1] based on the difference between when owners reported their dog began showing symptoms and when they were euthanized by the public health veterinarians or health inspectors.The rate of immunity loss (v2) is estimated to be the inverse of the immunity period offered by the vaccine. The vaccine used in the vaccination campaigns is rated for 1 year, so correspondingly v2 = 1/365. Vaccination rates vary by year depending on coverage rates of the vaccination campaign. We make the simplifications that immunity is immediate upon vaccination and that the entire vaccination campaign happens in one day (though in reality it is spread across several days to weeks). In this way, immunity is ""pulsed"" once yearly and then immediately begins to decay. Supplement Table 1 shows estimated coverage rates from longitudinal survey data. Because vaccination coverage rates are based on a few days or a single day (the vaccination campaign) , we assume a single day for our calculations (10) .The pulsed vaccination rate (v1) can be calculated then as vaccination coverage = 1-e -v1*t , where t =1 day.The transmission coefficient, , can be very difficult to measure, but can be derived from the equation for R0. Using the next generation matrix methods, an equation for R0 can be derived from the disease system:One challenge in estimating R0 for canine rabies globally is lack of accurate case counts. Rabies cases in humans are grossly underreported; in dogs, this trend is even more apparent (3, 6, (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . The WHO estimated that though in 2010 less than 10 human cases were reported in Latin America, there were in reality closer to 200 (13) . In the literature the R0 for canine rabies across the world is reported from 1-2 (20, (33) (34) (35) .In Arequipa, R0 was estimated from data collected from focus control team members responding to positive cases. Out of 214 cases, there are data on 33 cases about the number of secondary dogs that a rabid dog bit. Hampson et al. showed there is about a 0.49 probability that a dog will contract rabies if bitten by a rabid dog with a binomial confidence interval of [0.45, 0.52] (20) . To estimate R0 for Arequipa, we randomly assigned a probability form the binomial distribution described by Hampson and used a bootstrap resampling method to estimate mean and 95% confidence intervals (20) . We estimate R0 to be 1.36 [1.05, 1.88]. This R0 estimation should be considered as the low end of possible values as the data are biased due to being from focus control reports; these were cases that were responded to and controlled, limiting their number of secondary cases. Furthermore, we calculated R0 from by fitting our simulated monthly incidence of infected dogs to the reported rabies case data using a least squares fitting approach (36, 37) . We use a conservatively low estimate of reporting rate (10%) of rabid dog cases. Due to the high number of people killing rabid dogs without reporting them and the high number of dogs hit by cars and never investigated, 10% is likely an overestimation of reporting rate for canine rabies cases in Arequipa. Using this rate of underreporting, we estimated an R0 of 1.44.We present results for the possible range of R0 from 1.36, our low estimate from the focus control data, to 2, the high estimate from the literature, in order to show trends for a wide possibility of R0, the true value of which is unknown. However, we also present results specifically for R0=1.44, our best estimate for canine rabies in Arequipa.Disruptions caused by COVID-19 will interrupt two key rabies elimination activities: mass dog vaccination and canine rabies surveillance. The disruption of each of these activities will affect several parameters in the model. Many vaccination programs around the world, not only against rabies, have been affected by scarce funds already shifted towards pandemic response and fear of being infected with the COVID-19 virus (38) . Similarly, for canine rabies, the yearly vaccination campaigns are in jeopardy of being completely skipped this year in multiple countries, which would lead to an increased pool of susceptible dogs vulnerable to infection. To examine the effects of vaccination interruption in the model we change v1, the instantaneous per capita vaccination rate to reflect different scenarios: meeting the regional (39) and national goal of 80% coverage (17), a complete cancellation scenario of 0% coverage, and an intermediate effort of 58% coverage to match rates obtained previously (27) .All computation was done using R (41).Interventions are displayed both as a surface plot with the full range of possible values of R0, and as a 2D line plot with R0 = 1.44, representing our best estimate for Arequipa, Peru (Figure 3) . We investigated the effects of changes in rabies prevention strategies including decreased vaccination campaign coverage represented by the parameter v1 ( Figure 3A -C, E) and decreased surveillance represented by the parameter (Figures 4D,E) . When vaccine coverage reaches the 80% recommended by PAHO, the numbers of infected dogs are suppressed to nearly 0 ( Figure 3A) . Conversely, with no vaccination coverage at all (due to a cancelled vaccination campaign, cases begin to grow exponentially ( Figure 3C ). However, even intermediate coverage ( Figure 3B ), or in other words, not hitting the 80% recommended by PAHO ( Figure 3A ) has a significant impact on suppressing the rise in infected numbers compared to no vaccination coverage at all ( Figure 3C ).The effect of decreased surveillance and subsequent focus control is postulated to result in increased rabid dog survival time from 2.5 to 3.7 days as seen in Figure 3D -though incidence increases, the number of infected dogs can still be dampened by mass vaccination. The worst case scenario, where all control activities, mass dog vaccination, surveillance, and focus control, cease, results in a marked exponential rise in rabies cases within a few months ( Figure 3E ).Our results show that stopping or pausing dog vaccination and rabies surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic will substantially increase the number of cases of canine rabies with an associated increased risk of human rabies within a few months. The lockdowns have the potential to reduce contact between rabid dogs and humans, but essential activities and some measures to reactivate the economy require people to leave their houses in a city with the highest rate of dog bites in Latin America (42) . This model is a logical tool to clarify trends that may result from neglect of rabies due to COVID-19 (as opposed to a tool to predict exact numbers of infected dogs on specific dates). We examined COVID-19 caused disruptions of mass dog vaccination campaigns, surveillance activities, and focus control over a wide range of plausible R0 values. Though the magnitude of the number of infected dogs changes with R0, the trends show that decreasing vaccination coverage and increasing survival time of infectious dogs due to decreased surveillance and focus control will result in increased rabies burden in Arequipa.In rabies-affected areas, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to interrupt the multi-pronged rabies control program that Peru has developed over recent decades at several points. The first prong of Peru's rabies control program that may be affected by COVID-19 is the rabies surveillance system. Because Peru's surveillance system relies heavily on submission of samples from dogs reported to exhibit signs of rabies by the public, the absence of people leaving home to observe these dogs has caused greatly decreased reporting rates. Since COVID-19 control measures began in March 2020, there has been a 10fold decrease in samples submitted to be tested for rabies. Furthermore, lockdowns have hindered the ability of public health teams to respond and remove rabid dogs. Rabid dogs are often killed by motor vehicles because they behave erratically and run into traffic (40) . With the government-mandated quarantine and associated decrease in travel, there are fewer cars on the streets and fewer people outside to notice erratically behaving dogs. For these reasons, we postulate that dogs may live longer and transmit rabies to a larger number of dogs before they die, as reflected by a decreased parameter , the death rate due to rabies. From our focus control data, we find that dogs are removed an average of 2.5 days after becoming symptomatic though these data do not reflect traffic deaths. Our model indicates that an increased average survival time of 1.2 days (consistent with dogs dying of rabies as opposed to being killed) could cause a rise in rabies cases. Parallels of decreased surveillance measures can be drawn to the ebola crisis, where protocols to contain ebola interrupted screening and diagnosis of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV (52, 53) . Adequate surveillance is one essential piece of infectious disease control programs that is often neglected for more immediate emergencies.The model presented above has many sources of uncertainty, perhaps the most significant is a likely massive underreporting of canine rabies cases leading to lack of accurate data and bias in parameterized data around which the model is constructed. Inadequate surveillance can exacerbate underreporting-a common problem in rabies-affected areas (3, 6, 10, 13, 29, 32) -and lead to more cases as the virus spreads undetected. Furthermore, in Peru, one of the COVID-19 control measures is to shut down markets where more sellers are seropositive. These markets usually attract free-roaming dogs and provide them with food (organic trash). Rabies surveillance professionals have noticed that after shutting down the largest markets in Arequipa dogs are wandering farther to find food. The impact of these changes in dog behavior is unknown. The COVID-19 pandemic likely has caused many changes in both human and dog behavior not captured explicitly in our model. These effects are compounded by the limitations of our model; it is a deterministic model and does not capture the changeable nature of outbreaks. Next steps include building a more flexible, stochastic model around the current framework.Our model demonstrates that the effects of stopping or pausing rabies prevention activities could have serious effects on future cases of canine rabies, and consequently, on the risk of human rabies. Given that COVID-19 will continue to challenge public health departments in the short-and medium-term, it is essential to create a strategy for rabies surveillance and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. This strategy should consider new approaches to dog vaccination that can accommodate social distancing and other COVID-19 prevention measures. New dog vaccination approaches, even with suboptimal coverage, could prevent canine rabies cases in the short term. However, an uninterrupted optimal level must be reached for the long-term goal of elimination, as has been shown previously (57, 58) . The epidemiological model presented in this paper indicates that decreasing or stopping rabies programming during the pandemic could have downstream effects on rabies in Peru, and likely in the region, and even threatens to undo the remarkable achievements in decreasing rabies cases over the past several decades. This outcome would join a number of other disease spikes that occurred following natural disasters or public health crises. However, it is an outcome that can be avoided with a proactive and careful approach to balancing COVID-19 prevention with rabies surveillance and vaccination programming.",Peru,abstract,2020-08-13,8
c9f9b127123fcd3e10c7706f4bd5f2ccab54224e,Efficacy of Localized Lockdowns in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"Behavioral non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only readily available measures to prevent and control transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NPIs range from simple individual-level recommended behaviors, such as wearing face 30 masks, frequent hand-washing, or maintaining physical distance; to society-level regulatory actions, such as school closures, quarantines, or lockdowns (1) . The effects of those interventions have been typically described using mathematical models (2) (3) (4) (5) and have informed health policy since the beginning of the pandemic (6, 7). However, there is a lack of empirical evidence of the causal effects of NPIs (8, 9) , as most research focuses on associations (10, 11) . Understanding 35 the impact of NPIs in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is crucial, because those interventions will probably continue until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes available (1, 2) .Several countries have managed to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic using NPIs (5, (12) (13) (14) . As governments have begun easing restrictions, localized lockdowns are becoming an increasingly relevant policy option in cases of resurgence (15) (16) (17) . Localized lockdowns are typically 40 implemented in transmission hotspots and can be implemented for populations/areas large and small to suppress an outbreak. In principle, localized lockdowns can reduce social and economic costs compared to larger-scale SARS-CoV-2 suppression strategies and can provide a gradual exit from nationwide lockdowns. Early in the pandemic, the Chinese government imposed a localized lockdown and other strict NPIs in the city of Wuhan (5), effectively suppressing the 45 SARS-CoV-2 transmission (10). Subsequently, similar targeted lockdowns have been implemented in neighborhoods (e.g., Beijing, China), suburbs (e.g., Melbourne, Australia), towns (e.g., Vo, Italy), districts (e.g., North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany), and, most recently, at the city level in Leicester, England (12, 16) . Despite the increasing prevalence of localized lockdowns, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness. 50 4 On May 22, 2020, the World Health Organization declared South America the new epicenter of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The first COVID-19 case in Chile was reported in March 3, 2020, and by the end of March, national borders, schools, and non-essential businesses were closed and night-time curfews were enforced (18) (Fig. 1A) . Most importantly, policymakers in Chile implemented localized lockdowns at the municipality (comuna) level, the 55 smallest administrative subdivision in the country, at various points in time. The criteria used by the government to impose lockdowns were loosely defined as a function of the number and density (per km 2 ) of infectious COVID-19 cases, increases in case incidence, and health system capacity (18). Across the country, there was substantial variation in the duration of these municipality-level localized lockdowns and, for each municipality under lockdown, in the 60 lockdown status of neighboring municipalities. We used this policy as a natural experiment to evaluate the efficacy of localized lockdowns on SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Allowing for interference between municipalities (19, 20) , we estimated the individual direct effects of extending the duration of these local lockdowns and the individual total (sum of direct and spillover) effects of maintaining lockdowns in neighboring municipalities. We characterized 65 transmission by the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt); that is, the average number of secondary cases per primary infected case (21) . We did this using causal time-series analysis at the municipality level based on the daily series of COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health (22) , adjusted for the time-lag between onset of symptoms and case report ( Fig. 1A) (10, 21) . Based on the potential outcomes framework for causal inference (23, 24), we used the 70 augmented synthetic control method to analyze the progression of the epidemic in comparable municipalities that underwent different lockdown interventions (25, 26) , varying the duration of the intervention (∆D) and the proportion of the population under lockdown in the neighboring 5 municipalities at each time point t (Pt ) (Fig. 1E) . We estimated the counterfactual progression that the disease would have exhibited had an alternative lockdown policy taken place (Fig. 1E) . 75We adjusted for or balanced several municipality-level characteristics that may affect virus transmission (table S2) Providencia, and Santiago, the municipality of Punta Arenas was placed under lockdown early 7 on in the pandemic, from April 1 to May 7. It initiated lockdown with one of the highest case 120 incidence per 100,000 population in the country. Notably, Punta Arenas is geographically isolated and has few local interdependencies that could result in active transmission networks during a localized lockdown. Our estimates show negligible spillover effects: increasing Pt from 0 to 1 would only result in a reduction of Rt =0.02 (Fig. S5 and Table S13), probably due its geographical isolation and minor interdependencies with neighboring municipalities. 125Having assessed the role of duration and spillovers, we evaluate the impact of lockdowns in geographic areas of increasing size. We considered three target lockdown areas (Fig. 4A) : the municipality of Ñuñoa (red), a cluster of six municipalities (orange), and Greater Santiago (green). We extended the study period to encompass the mandatory lockdown for Greater Santiago that began on May 15, and varied the population under lockdown in the targeted area 130 and the proportion of the population under lockdown in neighboring municipalities (Pt). Fig. 4B shows the estimated Rt from March 15 to June 15. In general, an epidemic will continue to grow as long as Rt is greater than one. Fig. 4 shows that the epidemic kept expanding in all three target areas until a city-wide lockdown was implemented on May 15. These results highlight the challenges of suppressing virus transmission in areas with a high degree of economic and social 135 interdependencies, such as Chile's capital, when there is a substantial proportion of neighbors that are not under lockdown.Epidemiologists have long known that the only way to stop an epidemic is to break the chain of transmission. Today, strategies to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission are limited to NPIs. In principle, localized lockdowns can break transmission chains by limiting contact between 140 infectious and susceptible individuals, and this goal could be achieved at household, neighborhood, municipality, county, or state levels. The social distancing imposed by a 8 lockdown, however, must be maintained and enforced until an adequate control of transmission is achieved. Localized lockdowns may also provide a gradual exit to larger-scale strategies at lower cost, if effectively implemented. In this paper, we have shown that effective 145 implementation of localized lockdowns is challenging and is affected by spillovers from neighboring areas where transmission networks exist, such as in a city.We used recent methods from the causal inference literature to provide empirical estimates for the effects of localized lockdowns and, crucially, of the effects of interventions on neighboring areas. We found that localized lockdowns can help contain transmission, but their efficacy is 150 dependent on the duration of the intervention and potential spillovers from neighboring areas.For instance, the efficacy of localized lockdowns within Greater Santiago, where there is high economic and social interdependency between municipalities, was strongly affected by suppression measures in place in neighboring municipalities. In contrast, localized lockdowns showed good results in municipalities such as Punta Arenas, which are geographically isolated 155 and thus have transmission networks that are relatively unaffected by neighboring areas.

At the end of 2019, a new pathogen subtype was discovered as causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. The occurrence of this event was broadcast by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the first time on January 4, 2020. Nine days later, the first case of the disease outside the country of origin was reported in Taiwan. On March 11, 2020 , the worldwide spread of the disease was characterized as a pandemic by the WHO [2] .The confirmation of the first case in Brazil occurred on February 26, 2020. On the date of this publication (June 19, 2020), 978,142 cases have been confirmed, as well as 47,748 deaths [3] . The Greater São Paulo, which is the most populous region in the country with approximately 21.6 million inhabitants, was also the main affected area [4] . To date, 192,628 cases and 11,846 deaths have been recorded [3] .The Hospital das Clínicas -University of São Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP), which is the largest university hospital complex in the country, has been converted into a reference center for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [5] . An entire building with 200 intensive care unit beds (ICU), recently expanded to 350 ICU out of its 918 total capacity, was remodeled to admit only patients with COVID-19.Almost all medical specialties adapted their routine to face the COVID-19 challenge. The Division of Plastic Surgery, following the national and international organizations' recommendations, and the guidelines of our Institutional Crisis Committee, postponed non-essential surgeries and outpatient consultations [6, 7] . One of the main reasons for delaying elective procedures is the known risk of post-operative complications and worse prognosis of patients acquiring COVID-19 [8] . Even with these challenges arising from the pandemic, alternatives were considered to maintain institutional characteristics.HCFMUSP mission is to be an institution of excellence, recognized nationally and internationally in teaching, research, and assistance. Even during this unexpected change in medical activity, the concern about practice training could not be disregarded. The medical staff was also reorganized to offer support and teaching for residents. This aim of this study is to analyze this new scenario and the impact of changes in plastic surgery assistance and medical training.A time frame of 10 weeks, before and after the accomplishment of new guidelines (ANG) for maintaining only essential activities, was considered. The total number of surgeries was evaluated, comparing the periods of January-March 2020 (pre-ANG) and March-May 2020 (post-ANG) with similar periods in 2019 (named 2019-pre-and 2019-post, respectively). Also, the type of procedure and the number of outpatient consultations were evaluated. Operational activities during the 2020 pandemic were also analyzed according to the facility (in the high-exposure building dedicated to the care of patients with COVID-19 or in all other low-exposure units).The pre-ANG period was from January 6 to March 15, 2020, while post-ANG was from March 16 to May 24, 2020. The year 2019 was used as the control, comparing similar periods of 10 weeks, from January 7 to March 17 and from March 18 to May 26 ( Fig. 1 ).Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software version 14. The non-parametric distribution variables were assessed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum. Differences were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05 in a 95% confidence interval.A marked reduction of 74.2% on the total number of procedures was observed in the post-ANG period of 2020. In the comparative 2019-post period, 1036 surgeries were performed (average 103.6 ± 9.7 per week). Despite the significant reduction in the number of operations, 267 procedures still occurred in the post-ANG period (average 26.7 ± 20, 3 per week) (p = 0.0002). Before the pandemic, in the pre-ANG 2020 period, 924 surgical procedures were done (average 92.4 ± 12.0 per week), while in the similar 2019 period, 960 surgeries were performed (96.0 ± 19.5 per week) (p = 0.2260) (Fig. 2) .Although there was a reduction in the total number of surgeries, an increase in the proportion of reconstructive in comparison with aesthetic procedures occurred in the post-ANG period, compared with 2019-post. Cosmetic surgeries were reduced from 19.8 to 4.9%, and the proportions of reconstructive procedures increased from 80.2 to 95.1% (p = 0.0002). The proportions of reconstructive and aesthetic procedures did not differ significantly when the pre-ANG and the 2019-pre periods were compared (p = 0.0813) (Fig. 3) . In the first weeks of the pandemic, a universal decrease in procedures was observed. In the high-exposure building, however, a rise in the number of surgeries was progressively noticed (Fig. 4) . Pressure injuries and patients transferred from other buildings with confirmed COVID-19 requiring plastic surgery treatment were the leading causes. Since new admissions were sharply reduced for non-COVID patients, the only source of procedures in individuals without confirmed COVID-19 was admissions of trauma at the emergency department (facial fractures and complex wounds) and oncologic patients (Fig. 5) .Regarding the number of outpatient visits, a decrease of 59.8% was observed after ANG. A total of 1571 consultations were performed (157.1 ± 93, 6 per week) in the post-ANG period, while in the 2019-post period, 3907 (390.7 ± 43.1) were done (p = 0.0003). In the pre-ANG period, 3603 consultations were fulfilled (360.3 ± 107.5 per week), while in the 2019-pre period, 3723 consultations had been accomplished (372.3 ± 114.9 per week) (p = 0.4495) (Fig. 6 ).As a reference center in the Greater São Paulo for fighting against the COVID-19, the HCMFUSP gathered all patients infected with this disease in just one institute, moving all activities not related to COVID-19 to other units of the complex. As a consequence, immediate oncological reconstructions, facial trauma surgical treatment, and complex wound care were maintained in these institutes with low exposure to the infectious agent.Regarding surgeries performed after ANG, a drastic reduction in the total number was observed (Fig. 2) , followed by an increase in the proportion of reconstructive procedures (Fig.  3) .Despite the reduction in the absolute number, reconstructive surgeries maintained the usual complexity and provided practical training for residents. Although 739 reconstructive surgeries had been done in the 2019-post period, the 254 reconstructive surgeries performed in the post-ANG period are still a relevant number. Despite this decrease, high-complexity procedures were performed both in low-and high-exposure buildings. Breast cancer, head and neck tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, melanomas, and digestive tract neoplasms were the leading causes for high complexity reconstruction, such as microsurgical flaps. In addition to these reconstructions, other procedures were maintained at low-exposure institutes for the surgical treatment of facial trauma and complex wounds. As HCFMUSP also remained as a reference center for trauma, the severe victims of these injuries maintained their treatments in the low-exposure institutes.Despite not being a specialty related to the direct care of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, the Division of Plastic Surgery maintained a fundamental role in the high-exposure institute throughout the pandemic. Initially, the most significant concern and demand were to guarantee medical assistance and intensive care to patients referred to the highexposure institute. However, as acutely critical patients occupied the beds, the demand for the prevention and treatment of wounds related to the medical care of these patients, such as pressure injuries, was noticed (Fig. 5) . Patients operated at low-exposure institutes who evolved with COVID-19 (red) and at other low-exposure institutes (blue) in the post-ANG period. There is a progressive increase in the number of surgeries at the high-exposure institute infection and post-operative complications requiring plastic surgery were also treated at the high-exposure institute. Every referral center for trauma or other surgical emergencies should consider the possibility of patients presenting with COVID-19 in the active or incubation phase. Personal protective equipment must be provided for the entire team until the diagnosis can be excluded [9] .Thus, the unit dedicated exclusively to the care of patients affected by COVID-19 also recorded surgical cases, all of them in confirmed COVID-19 patients without the possibility of postponing treatment. Operations were related to the treatment of pressure injuries, complex wounds, and treatment of surgical site complications. Reconstructive surgeries are of high relevance during the pandemic season, due to the demand created by the admission of a large number of acutely critical patients. As shown in Fig. 5 , the occurrence of pressure injuries was the leading cause of Plastic Surgery visits at the high-exposure institute. The hypothesis for this more significant occurrence is difficulty in mobilizing patients and the need for pronation to optimize ventilation parameters [10, 11] . Consequently, the plastic surgeon is an essential part of the multidisciplinary team for treating pressure injuries in the supine or prone position, acting directly in the care of these injuries in patients with COVID-19, and guiding the health care professionals in the prevention and treatment of the identified injuries.The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected plastic surgery activity worldwide. The prevailing profile of reconstructive surgeries at the Division of Plastic Surgery of HCFMUSP allowed the continuity of procedures at all levels of technical complexity. The employed adaptations ensured the maintenance of patient care and the continuity of Plastic Surgery residency training. Ethics approval This is an observational study.

fa0fe7060c3b76cb6b5388e57fb2eb1691fbcebc,"Methylprednisolone as Adjunctive Therapy for Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 (Metcovid): A Randomised, Double-Blind, Phase IIb, Placebo-Controlled Trial","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has caused catastrophic health, social and economic disruptions worldwide. The spectrum of disease associated with this infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild self-limiting infection to rapidly progressing life-threatening disease, with higher mortality rates in older adults with underlying chronic diseases. [1] [2] [3] Respiratory failure is common among critically-ill patients, often requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). 3 Given the poor outcome of patients progressing to critical disease, there is a desperate need to identify drugs that could potentially improve their prognosis.Given the high pro-inflammatory profile of severe COVID-19, many options have been proposed as immune modulators of the disease. 4, 5, 6 In a retrospective study of 201 patients in China, administration of methylprednisolone (MP) seemed to reduce the risk of death in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 7 The effect of short-term low dose corticosteroids has been shown in a preliminary report suggesting that although systemic corticosteroids might not improve ICU mortality in critical patients, their use in the first days of disease could enhance oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction. 8 More recently, a quasi-experimental study showed that an early short course of MP in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes. 9 The premise for the use of corticosteroids relies on their potential role in counterbalancing the hyperinflammatory response in the lung, as well as antithrombotic effect 10 , therefore preventing progression to ARDS. 11, 12 One recent small randomized clinical trial (RCT) has shown benefit in the use of steroids. 13 The RECOVERY study released preliminary data showing benefit in patients A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 randomized to receive dexamethasone in a large robust randomized controlled trial conducted among 15% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the UK. 14 Review of the potential benefits of corticosteroids for the treatment of other viral pneumonias due to SARS-CoV-1, influenza, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, are informative, but sufficiently robust data for their use in COVID-19 outside clinical trials are lacking. 12, 15 The latter are needed to provide solid evidence for clinical decision-making and to further shed light on the benefits or harm of corticosteroid drugs use in COVID-19 infection. Thus, this trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of MP, compared to placebo treatment, in preventing death in patients admitted to a public reference center for management of COVID-19 patients in Manaus, one of the first epicenters of the disease in Brazil.Metcovid was a parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb clinical trial, which ran between April 18 and June 16, 2020, aiming to assess the efficacy of MP in the treatment of hospitalized patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. This trial was conducted at Hospital e Reporting Trials (Consort) guideline. 16 The detailed protocol is available as Supplement 1.Hospitalized patients were included if they had clinical AND/OR radiological suspicion of COVID-19 (history of fever AND any respiratory symptom, e.g., cough or dyspnea AND/OR ground glass opacity Eligible participants were allocated with a 1:1 ratio to receive either intravenous sodium succinate MP (0.5 mg/kg), twice daily for 5 days, or placebo (saline solution). As per hospital protocol, all patients meeting ARDS criteria used pre-emptively intravenous ceftriaxone (1g 2x for 7 days) plus azithromycin (500 mg 1x for 5 days) or clarithromycin (500 mg 2x for 7 days), starting on day 1.Clinical parameters were measured daily by the hospital clinical staff from day 1 until discharge or death. Other laboratory tests were performed at the clinician's discretion. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was recommended when PaO 2 /FiO 2 <150, as per hospital protocol, and ARDS Network high PEEP/low FiO 2 strategy was followed. The hospital has all source documents recorded online, using electronic medical/pharmaceutical recording system (Medview version 710801 and Esthor). Clinical laboratory analyses and routine CT scanning are also available locally. Data were electronically recorded in the source document, and then transferred into an electronic database (REDCap), in tablet computers, at bedside in the wards, and were further validated by external trial monitoring staff. An experienced radiologist reviewed CT scans.The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary endpoints included early mortality (days 7 and 14), need for orotracheal intubation by day 7, proportion of patients with oxygenation index (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) <100 by day 7. Post-hoc exploratory analyses were mortality in subgroups (enrolled already in IMV or not, age and some laboratorial predictors of severity). Subgroup analyses were based on the same direction of prespecified hypotheses (benefit of MP), consistency across other A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 studies, and strong preexisting biological rationale supporting the apparent subgroup effect 18 .Pneumonia (BOOP) after day 7 19 , need for insulin or increase in the dosage in diabetic patients, positive blood culture (Bactec ® ) and presence of viral RNA in the naso/oropharyngeal swab at day 7, were also analysed. As per protocol, day 120 visit will focus on respiratory sequelae of surviving patients, therefore, data will not be presented here.An independent statistician prepared an electronically generated randomization list with 14 blocks of 30 participants per block, generated via R software version 3.6.1 (Blockrand package). The list was accessible only to nonblinded pharmacists in the study. Participants were randomized by the study pharmacist to their designated treatment regimen at the time of inclusion and were subsequently identified throughout the study only by their allocated study number. Nonblinded pharmacists prepared the dilutions in the wards and distributed syringes to the nursing staff labeled as MP/placebo.Hematology and biochemistry analyses were performed in automated machines. Plasma samples from Day1 were diluted (1:2 or 1:5) and used for measurement of human IL-6 by ELISA following the manufacturer's recommendations (R&D Systems, DY206). The optical density was measured using an ELISA plate reader (BioTek, BioTek Instruments Inc, USA). The concentration in each sample was determined based upon standard curves using a four-parameter logistic (4-PL) curve-fit generated by The sample for the primary outcome (reduction in lethality rate) was calculated assuming a 50% lethality rate among critically ill patients, 7 and that MP would reduce lethality by 50%. Preliminary data from our reference hospital, in the beginning of the outbreak, suggested the risk of mortality to be approximately 50%, given that many of the admitted patients arrived in very severe clinical conditions. Thus, considering a test of differences in proportions between two groups of the same size, 80% power and 5% alpha, 378 participants were needed (189 per group). Adding 10% for losses, a final sample size of 416 participants was obtained. Sample calculation was performed using the R software version 3.6.1 (TrialSize and gsDesign packages).A modified intention to treat (mITT) analysis was conducted (all patients who have used at least one dose of the investigational drug, even with protocol deviations were included). The ITT analysis A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 (excluding only patients who have withdrawn informed consent) was also performed and presented in supplementary tables. Descriptive statistics were used for demographic, laboratory and clinical data. For qualitative variables, Chi-square test was performed. T-test or Mann-Whitney test were used for means and median comparisons, respectively. Survival models, using Kaplan-Meier estimate curves, assessed the cumulated proportion of deaths. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR), with respective 95% CI, was calculated using Cox regression analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata ® 13.0 software, and two-tailed P≤0.05 was considered significant.The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.Out of 647 eligible patients, 416 were randomized from April 18 to June 16, 2020. After a posteriori exclusion of patients who did not take any dose, and ICF withdrawals after drug treatment was started, 393 completed follow up (194 in the MP arm and 199 in the placebo arm); Figure 1 shows the trial profile. There were no major differences in baseline characteristics between intervention and placebo groups (Table 1) In the mITT strategy, no significant difference was seen between patients regarding major primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes ( Table 2 ). In Supplementary Table 2 Table 3 shows post-hoc defined subgroups analysis.The radiological presence of BOOP and pulmonary fibrosis during follow up did not differ between groups. Patients receiving MP tended to need more insulin due to hyperglycemia, had no more sepsis or positive blood culture collected on day 7, and a similar proportion was RT-qPCR positive at day 7. After randomization, over the hospitalization period, in patients evolving with shock under treatment with norepinephrine, hydrocortisone was used as per clinical discretion, considering that they were blinded for the interventional drug. Not being an a priori exclusion criterion, these patients were also included in the mITT analysis, and no difference was seen between groups (8.7%in MP x 7.0% in placebo).M a n u s c r i p t 13 We found no evidence of improved survival in the overall population with a short course of intravenous MP in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. However, a subgroup analysis found a lower mortality in patients over 60 years who received MP, and these patients were the ones who also presented a more pronounced systemic inflammatory status as documented by high C-reactive protein values.At present, remdesivir and dexamethasone are the two robust evidence-based therapies that are now used widely 20 . Corticosteroid have been widely used in critically ill patients. 21 Until recently, all the evidence regarding the benefits of corticosteroid in COVID-19 come from observational studies in which there was no clear definition of criteria followed regarding their use. 7, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] The corticosteroid dosages used in the literature are heterogeneous. 15 MP is a non-expensive corticosteroid widely available in public hospitals that has been used more than other corticosteroids in trials in ARDS patients for five days. 30,31 A different time and duration of corticosteroid administration might have affected the observed outcome. For severe community-acquired pneumonia, five days of MP were enough to decrease treatment failure in high initial inflammatory response. 31 Long use duration might be associated with increased prevalence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, especially in younger adult males. 32 We had no chance to evaluate this complication in our study. Glucocorticoid pulse therapy also does not seem to be more beneficial than lower doses in COVID- 19. 33 The observed high mortality, compared to other studies 14,34 , may be related to the study site, a reference hospital receiving transferred patients in very critical conditions, and a late start of MP treatment in the evolution of severe disease. However, a clinically relevant effect in the exploratory analysis performed in patients over 60 years of age was seen, which might be enough to recommend the intervention. In tris trial, the elderly had higher CRP levels when compared to younger patients.This might explain the better response to steroids in this group, as already observed in the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 14 community acquired pneumonia trial which showed improved outcomes in the group of patients with high CRP levels receiving steroids 26 .A recent systematic review of corticosteroid studies showed delayed viral clearance for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. 15 Therefore, if such drugs are used in early disease, they probably need to be used for longer than five days or until clinical improvement is observed, because of the risk of increased viral shedding leading to more inflammation after the steroid is suppressed. This hypothesis needs to be tested. Longer virologic follow up is needed in further trials, as high-dose corticoids have shown to impact the long-term viral shedding 35 .Data from a large RCT using dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days (RECOVERY trial) point to mortality benefit, mostly in critical COVID-19 patients. 14 As dexamethasone, MP also has minimal mineralocorticoid activity, preventing potential safety problems with fluid retention (sodium/water imbalance), a common feature of severe ARDS. Regimen differences between the two trials may explain the results. In contrast to the RECOVERY trial, MP was weight-based dosed in our study (0.5mg/kg twice daily, for 5 days). Thus, equivalence calculation between the total dosing regimens in both studies demonstrates a higher daily total corticoid dosage in Metcovid. Moreover, MP has a shorter biological half-life (24-36h) than dexamethasone (36-54 h). The RECOVERY trial, which administered treatment for twice as long as our study, led to higher corticosteroid bioavailability. In Metcovid, in patients under 60 years, a proxy of less inflamed and therefore less severe subjects, a possible harm was seen with MP, as already pointed out in the RECOVERY study, in which patients not receiving oxygen also had a trend towards increased mortality when using dexamethasone. We hypothesize that one possible explanation is that early use of corticoids in COVID-19 could lead to increase in viral load, with worse outcomes. However, the overall mortality and mortality among ventilated patients were higher in the current study compared to RECOVERY. Therefore, the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 15 comparison between studies is not straightforward, especially because there are differences in health care systems and norms of practice in two different sites. Subjects demographics and severity at enrollment might also explain higher mortality in Metcovid, and differences with RECOVERY data.Available observational data suggest a higher potential to secondary bacterial or fungal infections following use of corticosteroids in viral syndromes, as previously observed in influenza, 36 and impaired immune response in respiratory syncytial virus. 37 In our study, sepsis was not higher in patients using MP, as shown by microbiological surveillance using blood cultures and clinical criteria.However, all patients were hospitalized and receiving a combination of ceftriaxone plus a macrolide, which may have confounded the adequate evaluation of such potential side effect of the corticosteroid use. Corticosteroid drugs have been used in septic shock to restore effective blood volume through increased mineralocorticoid activity and by increasing systemic vascular resistance. 38, 39 For ethical reasons, patients in septic shock were allowed to receive open label steroids for the treatment of shock (only hydrocortisone was used), and this could have reduced the separation between groups in the final analysis. Despite not significant, treatment group had longer median time from ventilation to treatment assignment, what might have increased the mortality in this group, allowing for less significant differences.Regarding pulmonary mid-term complications, BOOP could complicate SARS-CoV-2. Although BOOP seems to improve with corticosteroids when associated with other viral diseases, 40 such effect was not seen in our series.

Nevertheless, one major limitation of this study was the relatively small number of patients submitted to CT scan during follow-up.This study had some strengths, including that it was: (1) double-blind; (2) placebo-controlled; (3) performed in a public hospital setting; and (4) compliant with good clinical practices. It also had limitations as follows: (1) single center; (2) low sample size to estimate small differences between the arms and subgroup analyses; (3) high overall mortality as compared to other settings; (4) late administration of the drug in some patients.In conclusion, the use of MP during only 5 days in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was not sufficient to improve prognosis, as opposed to RECOVERY trial, in which dexamethasone was successfully used for 10 days. Our exploratory analysis showed that MP reduces mortality in hospitalized patients older than 60 years with COVID-19. Caution is needed in the use of steroids in less severe patients, as a trend towards more harm was seen in the lower age group.A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 24 27 Lu X, Chen T, Wang M a n u s c r i p t 29 assessment; IMV, invasive mechanical ventilation.

ef95444a4b9bfaf48923e7e0e0847f4b8b689ace,Title: Delirium and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"Many countries throughout the world have experienced an unprecedented health care crisis caused by the new coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. 1 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is particularly concerning in older adults, whose underlying multimorbidity and vulnerability increase the risk of adverse outcomes following the infection. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that geriatric patients account for almost half of hospital admissions and up to 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 acute respiratory syndrome, the most severe presentation of the disease. 2 The scenario is even more alarming in long-term care facilities, where a combination of the oldest and frailest patients can be found living in close proximity, with a high susceptibility to transmissible diseases. 3 Fever and respiratory symptoms have been described as the most frequent manifestations of COVID-19. 4, 5 However, neurologic symptoms have been commonly found in hospitalized patients. 6 In a case series completed in Wuhan, China, 36% of their patients had neurologic complaints, and 8% had impaired consciousness. 7 Older age is also thought to be a risk factor for atypical manifestations of COVID-19. 8 Recently, a case report from the United Kingdom described delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by inattention and fluctuating symptoms, as the sole manifestation of the disease in a frail nonagenarian. 9 Delirium has often been observed in the context of hospitalized patients with infectious diseases and identified as prominent clinical features in acute respiratory syndromes. 10, 11 Their occurrence can be interpreted as the clinical translation of an acute brain failure, most often resulting from multiple precipitating factors (e.g., dehydration, use of psychoactive drugs, infection) and leading to adverse outcomes, such as increased length of hospital stay, functional and cognitive decline, institutionalization, and death. 12, 13 . GivenThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.that COVID-19 is an acute infectious and inflammatory disease, which in its more severe presentations can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and require mechanical ventilation, it is likely to be associated with delirium. The issue becomes particularly troubling in the context of social distancing and respiratory isolation. Notwithstanding their importance, such measures can become barriers to the prevention and detection of delirium in older adults. 14, 15 Optimum non-pharmacologic management of delirious patients is also hindered by the limitations imposed on the presence of family members and caregivers in the hospital.A recent investigation demonstrated that 26 out of 40 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection had suggestive clinical features for delirium. 6 Despite these preliminary findings, little is known about the clinical significance of delirium in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Previous analyses were limited by their small sample sizes, absence of prognostic estimations 6 , or unclear definitions of delirium. 16 Therefore, our aims were to investigate the occurrence of delirium in a cohort of older adults hospitalized with COVID-19, and explore its association with adverse outcomes in this population.Our work is part of the ongoing CO-FRAIL study, designed to investigate the association between frailty and adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The CO-FRAIL study is a cohort study recruiting patients at Hospital das Clinicas, a tertiary university hospital affiliated to the University of Sao Paulo Medical School, in Brazil.Hospital das Clinicas has become a major center for COVID-19 treatment in Sao Paulo, the epicenter of the pandemic in Brazil. In March 2020, the main hospital building was converted to a COVID-19-only facility, dedicating 900 beds to the care of infected patients. AdmissionsThis article is protected by copyright.

We included COVID-19 cases of Our local institutional review board approved the study, and we adhered to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patient-identifiable information were stored in secure electronic servers, with access restricted to our researchers.Trained medical investigators completed standardized electronic case report forms using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) resources. 18 They retrospectively collected the study information reviewing electronic medical records, nursing records, consulting notes, laboratory tests, and radiologic exams from the complete hospitalizations.Whenever necessary, our investigators also performed structured telephone interviews with the participants or their representatives to complement or clarify their information.Our primary independent variable was the overall occurrence of delirium, which we defined using the Chart-based Delirium Identification Instrument (CHART-DEL). 19, 20 The presence of delirium is characterized by the CHART-DEL instrument based on the documented evidence of acute mental change, combined with at least one of several keyThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.descriptors during hospital stay (e.g., delirium, confusional state, disorientation, hallucinations, agitation, etc.). Medical records must be reviewed in their entirety to capture the occurrence of delirium, including medical and multidisciplinary notes, consultant notes, and admission and discharge summaries. CHART-DEL is more accurate than other chartbased methods, with an overall sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 83% when performed by trained nurses. 19 In our study, the CHART-DEL assessments were completed by trained physicians with a background in geriatric medicine. Our assessors were also instructed to review medical records in detail for any evidence of preexisting cognitive disorders. All patients were initially evaluated on admission by emergency physicians. Routine assessments in the emergency department included level of consciousness measurements, which we further reviewed for consistency during our study procedures. We also reviewed daily clinical notations to detect changes in level of consciousness from baseline. Delirium was defined as a binary event (yes or no), and recurrent episodes were not pondered in our analyses.We also collected data on demographics (age, sex, race or ethnicity, marital status, and literacy), clinical history (previous diagnoses and medications, Charlson comorbidity index, physical examination, supplemental oxygen), polypharmacy (five or more medications), premorbid functional status (Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale), and laboratory tests routinely collected on admission (complete blood count, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, urea, creatinine, albumin). We defined the first available results from within the first 48 hours of hospitalization as the admission results of laboratory tests. Combining our detailed chart reviews with telephone interviews, we were able to work with a complete dataset on our variables of interest.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Our primary outcome was in-hospital death, which we retrieved from electronic medical records. Participants who survived were censored on hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay (days), admission to intensive care, and ventilator utilization.We reported descriptive results for the total sample, comparing the variables of interest according to the overall occurrence of delirium. We used the chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and Student's t-test (normal distribution) or Wilcoxon's ranksum test (non-normal distribution) to compare numerical variables.We used logistic regression models to explore the association between the overall occurrence of delirium and in-hospital death, admission to intensive care, and ventilator utilization. We selected logistic regressions as our primary multivariable analysis method because we would be unable to determine precise dates of delirium onset using our current design. Even so, we performed a sensitivity analysis to examine the consistency of our primary outcome results using Cox proportional regression models. In this alternate approach, we approximated the onset of delirium using the earliest date on which the key descriptors of delirium were annotated, and defined length of hospital stay as our timedependent variable. The proportionality of hazards was checked using the Schoenfeld residuals test. Finally, we studied the association between delirium and length of hospital stay using negative binomial regression models.In a secondary analysis, we investigated whether the association between delirium and adverse outcomes was modified according to age subgroups (50-64 years vs. ≥65 years).We assessed the uniformity of effect estimates across strata using chi-square tests for heterogeneity, and the Mantel-Haenszel method to either calculate pooled adjusted estimates Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. when effects were uniform or report stratum-specific estimates in the presence of interactions (P-value < 0.05).We adjusted all multivariable models for possible confounders, including age, sex, literacy, previous diagnoses, Charlson comorbidity index, polypharmacy, days of symptoms, supplemental oxygen, temperature, mean arterial pressure, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, glomerular filtration rate, D-dimer, and albumin. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and an alpha error of up to 5% was accepted to define the statistical significance of any results. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata MP 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).We included 707 patients in our final analysis, with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 66 (±11) years and a predominance of the male sex (57%; N=402). We identified delirium in 234 participants (33%), of which 86 (12%) already had descriptors of delirium on admission. Only 30 (4%) participants had a baseline diagnosis of dementia, of whom 22 (73%) experienced delirium during hospital stay. Patients with delirium also had a higher prevalence of other comorbidities, such as cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and cancer (Table 1) . Abnormal laboratory findings were more prominent in delirious patients, including higher C-reactive protein and d-dimer levels, more cases of lymphocytopenia, and lower albumin levels. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 39% (N=273), reaching 55% (N=129) in patients who experienced delirium and 30% (N=144) in those who did not (p<0.001). Length of hospital stay, number of days in intensive care, and ventilator utilization were different across groups as well, with unfavorable estimates in the delirium group. Detailed descriptive findings are reported in Table 1 and supplementary materials (Supplementary Table S1 ).This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.We verified that the overall occurrence of delirium was independently associated with in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.75; 95%CI=1.15-2.66) ( Table 2) . The association was confirmed in the Cox proportional hazards regression (Figure 1) In our interaction analyses (Table 3) , we verified that the association between delirium and in-hospital death held both for participants aged 65 years or more (aOR=2.33; 95%CI=1.29-4.21), and for younger patients (aOR=1.93; 95%CI=1.01-3.68). The association between delirium and secondary outcomes was consistent across age subgroups as well, except for ventilator utilization, which was associated with delirium only in middle-aged patients ( Table 3 ).We found that one in three patients with COVID-19 experienced delirium in the hospital. We observed high mortality rates in our cohort and verified that delirium was an independent predictor of in-hospital death. Delirium was also independently associated with increased length of hospital stay, admission to intensive care, and ventilator utilization. In addition, we found that while delirium was particularly relevant in patients aged 65 years and over, its prognostic significance held for middle-aged adults as well.Previous studies have recognized the association between neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and illness severity. 6, 7, 16, 21 Most of these studies have either focused on impaired consciousness 7,21 , or did not provide a clear construct of delirium as their main exposure 16 . In a cohort study of 214 adult patients, Mao et al. (2020) reported that CNSThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. symptoms were present in 25% of the cases, the most common being dizziness (17%), and headache (13%). Impaired consciousness was detected in 8% in their sample but was six times more common in patients with severe forms of the disease (15% vs. 2%). Despite these preliminary reports, their results were limited by smaller sample sizes and the absence of additional prognostic analyses. A recent prediction model for critical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 included unconsciousness as one of the key risk factors to be evaluated on hospital admission, along with the presence of hemoptysis, cancer history, and X-ray abnormalities. 21 Although these findings stress the relevance of impaired consciousness as a predictor of adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the clinical meaning of delirium as a full syndrome was not addressed in the study.In our study, we found consistent evidence that delirium is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Delirium has been associated with postdischarge functional and cognitive decline, but its long-term implications in COVID-19, which frequently leads to severe cardiovascular and lung damage, are still unknown.However, we hope that our findings will stimulate health providers and researchers to work together and creatively overcome the present challenges to patient care to implement new and effective strategies to manage delirium and its complications.The possible mechanisms behind the association between COVID-19 and delirium are also intriguing. Although neurologic manifestations can happen in a broad spectrum of acute and infectious diseases, 22 previous evidence suggests that the coronavirus family is specially neurotropic. 23, 24 Coronaviruses have been shown to have neuroinvasive capacity and breach the central nervous system (CNS) either through the olfactory nerve or through the blood circulation and neuronal pathways. After invading the CNS, coronaviruses can cause direct brain damage by increasing demyelination, interleukins release, and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. 23 These neuroinflammatory pathways are known to participate in the Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. We must also recognize that COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease and that its overall systemic effects could be sufficient to justify both the occurrence of delirium and adverse in-hospital outcomes. In our study, we attempted to capture the systemic component of the disease by adjusting our analysis for important markers of acute illness, including Creactive protein, albumin, glomerular filtration rate, and vital signs. We found that even after these adjustments, delirium remained an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in the hospital, underlining its role as a prognostic marker in COVID-19 patients.Our study had limitations. We identified delirium using a chart-based method, which could raise concerns regarding measurement bias. Misclassifications by the CHART-DEL instrument mostly occur in three scenarios: (1) populations with a high risk of delirium (defined by the presence of at least three of the following factors: cognitive impairment, severe illness, visual impairment, and high serum urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio); (2) populations with a high prevalence of dementia; and (3) poor documentation of delirium signs and symptoms. 19 While the first two contribute to the overestimation of delirium occurrence, the third leads to its underestimation. Most of our patients had a low-to-moderate baseline risk of delirium (96%), and the prevalence of preexisting cognitive disorders was low (4%). Therefore, we were at a higher risk of underestimating delirium, which would be more likely to drive our results towards the null, suggesting that the strengths of the Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.associations we verified could be even higher than what we estimated. Moreover, all CHART-DEL assessments were completed by trained medical investigators with a background in geriatric medicine, and the CHART-DEL instrument has been demonstrated to have good accuracy for delirium detection, even when performed by non-medical professionals. 19 Other limitations included the retrospective nature of our analyses, which prevented assessments regarding delirium duration, severity, and its temporal association with intensive care and other therapeutic measures. Finally, our study was performed in a single center dedicated to high-complexity medical care and our results should be read with parsimony before being generalized to different populations.The study also has notable strengths. We were able to collect detailed clinical data from a large sample of patients and provide new evidence indicating the prognostic relevance of delirium and impaired consciousness in COVID-19. Unlike previous studies, we demonstrated the association between delirium not only with in-hospital death but also with length of stay, intensive care admission and ventilator utilization. We were powered to perform multivariable analyses and confirm our results in regression models adjusted for several possible confounders and in different subgroup analyses. middle-aged and older adults with COVID-19. The prompt recognition of delirium is critical to ensure appropriate clinical care and prevent adverse outcomes in this population.We thank members of the CO-FRAIL Study Group for their efforts in collecting data for our work.

Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U. Todos los derechos reservados.The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that originated in the city of Wuhan, China, has left numerous victims around the world in a short period of time. 1---4 COVID-19 is a predominantly respiratory condition, ranging from flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Approximately 10%---15% of patients have moderate respiratory failure, while 5% of cases progress to severe forms that require invasive ventilatory support in intensive care units (ICU). 2---4 The highly contagious nature of the virus, shown by its high basic reproduction number (Ro: 2.2-3.5) 5 explains why hospitals are crowded with critically ill patients requiring ventilatory support. The supply of respirators currently far outstrips demand, leading to a shortage of these advanced life support devices. This critical health situation forms the basis of the quarantine and social isolation measures implemented to control the rate of infection and minimise, among other things, the need for respirators in the general population. This shortage could become even more acute and dramatic in emerging and underdeveloped countries with severely limited infrastructure and scarce economic resources.We propose a solution to the shortage of respirators for the treatment of COVID-19. The idea is based on transforming a non-invasive ventilation (NIV) device into a critical care ventilator for intubated patients. We describe the basic configuration of our models, and then describe a simulation performed in a patient with healthy lungs and another with ARDS.Traditional NIV devices are not designed to ventilate intubated patients -one reason for this is rebreathing the expiratory carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) accumulated in the single Q4 tube. In other words, as these devices do not have separate inspiratory and expiratory limbs or one-way valves, part of the CO 2 exhaled into the single circuit will be rebreathed on the next inspiration, causing hypercapnia. In order to use an NIV device in a ventilated patient, therefore, hypercapnia must be avoided without depressurizing the system or affecting the patient's alveolar ventilation.In order to use an NIV device in pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (PC-CMV) mode it must be equipped with a time cycle and back up respiratory rate. This allows the NIV device to be used in both mandatory and spontaneous ventilation modes.We propose the following solutions (Fig. 1 ). In all these modifications an antibacterial/viral filter (HMEF) is placed at the end of the endotracheal tube 6 to avoid dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 and to conserve temperature and humidity.This is the simplest configuration, in which a leak port in the HMEF or the leak port used in this type of device allows a continuous flow of gas that flushes the expired CO 2 ( Fig. 1, top) . In other words, the patient exhales through the HMEF while the NIV device provides enough gas to not only ventilate the patient but also to flush the CO 2 trapped in the circuit. This can only be achieved if the NIV device has a highly efficient flow generator to maintain pressurisation. CO 2 rebreathing will depend on the size of the leak and the pressure setting (the higher the pressure, the greater the leak flow and the more efficient the CO 2 flushing.This solution consists of replacing the single branch circuit of the NIV device with a Bain or modified Mapleson D circuit with a double coaxial tube. 7, 8 The bag of the Bain circuit and fresh gas flow are eliminated. The external tube of the Bain circuit is connected to the NIV device, while the internal branch is left open to allow expired gases to escape ( Fig. 1 , middle). The potential advantages of this configuration are: 1) expired CO 2 -rich gas is eliminated through the internal tube, since it is prevented from passing through the external tube by the flow/pressure provided by the NIV device, and 2) some of the temperature and humidity within the circuit is conserved.Another solution is to completely avoid CO 2 rebreathing with a Duck-Bill one-way valve placed at the distal end of the single NIV single tube, behind the HMEF filter and the endotracheal tube (Fig. 1, bottom) . Mapleson C nonrebreathing ventilation systems (e.g. Ambu ® resuscitation bag) use a duck-bill valve in which gas is delivered to patient at one end and CO 2 is exhaled into the environment through an external PEEP valve at the other. 9 The external PEEP must be set to the same level as the expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) of the NIV device in order to reduce expiratory resistance of the duck bill valve, which is not designed for spontaneous ventilation (Fig. 2 ).The proposed configurations ( Fig. 1) The simulations were merely intended to show whether the proposed modifications allowed the NIV system to function correctly, maintained adequate pressure during operation, and avoided CO 2 rebreathing while achieving FiO 2 . Given the urgency to publish the results of this due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not test different ventilatory parameter combinations or other potential modifications to the NIV circuit.The first step was to simulate controlled ventilation in a patient with healthy lungs producing 170 ml/min CO 2 , with 50 ml/cmH 2 O of compliance and airway resistance of 8 cmH 2 O/l/s. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was set at 20 cmH 2 O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) at 8 cmH 2 O, with a respiratory rate of 18 bpm (inspiratory time; 1 s; expiratory time: 2.3 s). Fig. 3 shows that the proposed modifications maintain circuit pressure and eliminate CO 2 correctly, without rebreathing, i.e., the CO 2 returns to 0 during inspiration.The second step was to simulate controlled ventilation in a patient with ARDS producing 170 ml/min CO 2 , with 30 ml/cmH 2 O of compliance and airway resistance of 18 cmH 2 O/l/s. IPAP was set to 25 cmH 2 O and EPAP to 12 cmH 2 O with a respiratory rate of 18 bpm (inspiratory time: 1 s; expiratory time: 2.3 s). Fig. 4 shows that in the pathological lung simulation the configurations tested also conserve pressure settings and prevent rebreathing of carbon dioxide.The final step was to test the systems by simulating a healthy patient breathing spontaneously. Table 1 shows the results of the tests using mandatory ventilation. 4 Alarms may not be as comprehensive and/or sensitive as in intensive care ventilators. This problem will depend on the technical characteristics of the NIV device used for this purpose, and will require closer monitoring.Note: Because of the wide range of NIV devices on the market, the operating characteristics of the particular system available should be checked: ventilatory modes, pressure limits/range, alarms, delivery of supplementary O 2 , etc. We recommend preparing some of the proposed configurations and testing them on an artificial lung to ensure they function correctly before using them on patients.These modifications have been developed for 2 purposes. The first is to replace anaesthesia machines so that they can be used in patients with COVID-19. This would compel us to perform total intravenous anaesthesia in the operating room, because all the proposed options arë openventilation circuits. The second is to ventilate COVID-19 patients with this device when ICU ventilators are busy. This will allow these modified NIV devices to be used as ä ventilatory bridgeüntil an ICU ventilatory device becomes available.Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, the simple modifications involved will allow these models (battery-powered) to be used to transport ventilated patients not only within the hospital but also from remote locations.We propose a number of solutions to transform an NIV device into an intensive care ventilator for intubated patients. These configurations are particularly important for remote regions and emerging and underdeveloped countries where resources are usually scarce and infrastructure is limited.None of the authors has received grants or scholarships related to this presentation.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

c40f844a12bf5d4806b9846af722f0d9a4f2f383,Epidemiology and Infection From the Field Increasing molecular diagnostic capacity and COVID-19 incidence in Brazil,"Different countries have adopted strategies for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 since the declaration of community transmission of the virus by the World Health Organization (WHO), allowing early clinical intervention and the management of these patients with nonpharmacological measures such as hospital isolation, suspension of regular activities and respiratory support in intensive care units (ICUs) promptly after diagnosis [1] . Timely diagnosis has been considered one of the major obstacles for surveillance and healthcare (especially hospital) preparedness in low-to-middle income countries [2] . With that in mind, we studied the increase in COVID-19 molecular diagnostic capacity of public health laboratories in different regions in Brazil. We were especially interested in analysing the association of newly certified laboratories with the increase of COVID-19. Therefore, we searched the epidemiological bulletins provided by the Ministry of Health of Brazil (available at https://covid.saude.gov.br/) for the weekly incidence of laboratoryconfirmed cases; and the Union Official Diary (a daily publication of the Federal Government official decrees, available at https://www.jusbrasil.com.br/diarios/DOU/) to identify new certifications of public laboratories for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis was carried out until 4th June, when the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the country completed 100 days. Both the number of newly certified laboratories and the weekly incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were submitted to Joinpoint Regression, using software Joinpoint 4.8 (National Cancer Institute, Calverton, MD) [3] . This analysis detects changes in rate trends, and was performed using a log link function to fit the data. We also performed univariate and single-step multivariable Poisson Regression model, with the number of laboratories and the epidemiological weeks as predictors for the outcome of interest (rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases), using STATA 14 (Statacorp, College Station, TX), and georeferenced the time of introduction of COVID-19 and certification of laboratories in different areas in Brazil, using ArcGIS 10 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). We then applied the inverse distance weighted (IDW) technique to interpolate discrete cases and transform it in a continuous surface in raster format, highlighting the date of case arrival and the geographic region. IDW is a local deterministic interpolator which does not exceed data intervals between neighbours. We used 20 neighbours and a 1.5 power factor. The diffusion layer was overlaid with the laboratories mapped by municipality and week of certification.Our results are shown in Figure 1 . We can observe on the map (panel C) the COVID-19 spatial diffusion pattern, starting in the main metropolis throughout the country, mainly São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Recife and Manaus. The diffusion follows the path of the urban network going from major metropolis to middle size cities and then to small cities. The velocity of the spread is different among the regions of the country. In North of Brazil, the diffusion was extremely fast despite lack of road transport in several portions. In Northeast and Southeast regions, metropolitan areas and cities with higher populational density concentrated the early cases of COVID-19, spreading after towards the interior of each region. In South and Midwest regions, the diffusion was at the initial stages, centred in major urban areas and near major road axis.Panel A shows the rate of certifications of public laboratories for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by epidemiological week, whereas panel B shows the rate of incidence of laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 by epidemiological week, both in a Joinpoint Regression analysis (per 100 000 inhabitants). One can note an increase of certified laboratories, which does not match the much higher increase in the number of cases.The laboratory's certification ranged from few laboratories (one in the North-Northeast region, one in the Middle East and South and two in Southeast) to 26 labs, in 8 weeks. Almost all regional centres of the country certificated at least one laboratory. In summary, at week 23 the ratio between the number of laboratories to population density (population per km 2 at the last census at 2010) at each Brazil's region was 6:4.14, 4:8.75, 28:86.92, 3:48.58 and 7:34.15, respectively, at North, Middle East, Southeast, South and Northeast. It is also clear from panel C that laboratories are irregularly distributed over the country, with a concentration in the most developed state, São Paulo (13 of 35 laboratories). However, a decentralisation trend can be seen over the last epidemiological weeks, highlighted by the presence of newly certified laboratories specially in North and Northern regions of Brazil. It is important to reveal that in São Paulo State there are many cities performing mass testing, and this could explain the greater growth in the number of labs. Interestingly, the number of laboratories is positively associated with the number of COVID-19 cases in the univariate model (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.11) but negatively associated after adjusting for epidemiological week (number of laboratories: IRR, 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99; epidemiological week: IRR, 1.70; 95% CI 1.69-1.71). This finding can be interpreted in two directions. From an optimistic perspective, the slow increase in certifications of new laboratories for diagnosis does not necessarily correlates with the overall diagnostic capacity of the laboratory net, once already certified individual laboratories may increase their own capacity as well. This analysis could not be performed as no data were available regarding diagnostic capacity of each one of these laboratories. From a pessimistic perspective, the fast increase of COVID-19 incidence and the continuous spread into inner country, less developed areas of Brazil challenges diagnostic Fig. 1 .

The shades of grey range from the darkest for the three initial certified public health laboratories to the light grey representing those that were certified in later stages of the outbreak. capacity and therefore, accurate and timely health surveillance [4] . This implies that, given the fast increase of COVID-19 cases and the continuous spread into inner Brazil [5] , the laboratories (which are continuously increasing their capacity) may still be insufficient to provide accurate data in a setting of exhaustion of hospital (especially ICUs) capacity [6] . The primacy of the growth of cases over laboratory capacity is reinforced by the increase in hospital admissions and deaths (as reported in official data (https://covid.saude.gov.br/) and recent studies [7, 8] ).Health surveillance has been a strong pillar of response to previous public health emergencies in Brazil, including pandemic H1N1 influenza and Zika virus [9] . Challenges for COVID-19 response are not restricted to health surveillance [10] , but strengthening an accurate knowledge of its behaviour can direct preventive strategies (including infection control). Serial antibody prevalence surveys may be an option but are still hampered by inaccurate serological tests [11] . Given that quarantine measures started to be relaxed in national territory, this is a critical moment where diagnosis missing can jeopardise the epidemic control. Therefore, Brazilian states must increase their capacity of timely molecular diagnosis, not only to face this pandemic, but as a network for preparedness for future public health emergencies [12] .",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-18,8
695e7c610fb0f2f6d9dfa6c9cebcdd735fe8557b,Mental health in the era of COVID-19: prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a cohort of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the social distancing,"presence of depression and anxiety symptoms may be associated with lower treatment adherence, leading to worse glycemic control [1, 2] . In patients with diabetes, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms is about two to four times greater than in the general population [3, 4] . Although more research is needed to fully understand the link between diabetes and depression, it is clear that metabolic dysregulation influences brain function and disturbances in peripheral glucose regulation might be associated with depressed mood [5, 6] . Some cases of depression might result from low levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) into the brain, wich was shown to produce antidepressant behavioural responses in experimental studies [6] [7] [8] . Nutrient-activated gut to brain signaling pathways also appear to play a role in the genesis of depressive symptoms. A highly significant association between leptin levels, depressed mood and sleep disturbances has been shown in normal-weight individuals [6, 9] . Also, ghrelin can exert antidepressant effects in men and carbohydrates appear to lead to ghrelin suppression [6, 10, 11] . The association between diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment, and psychological distress could increase depressive symptoms and cause adverse diabetes outcomes [12, 13] . The emergence of a potentially fatal pandemic represents a new reason for uncertainty and anxiety in this group of patients. Since December 2019, when a series of cases of severe pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus was described in Wuhan-China, the COVID-19 infection, as it became known, quickly spread throughout the world [14] [15] [16] . On Jul 07th, more than 11 million and 600 thousand confirmed cases have been identified worldwide, totaling 538 thousand deaths [17] . The first case of someone suffering from COVID-19 in South America was confirmed on February 26th, 2020 in São Paulo, Brazil. Since then, Brazil has recorded the largest number of cases in Latin America and recently has emerged as a new epicenter of the pandemic in the world [18] .A number of measures have been taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, involving the isolation of suspected cases, tracking and monitoring of contacts, and dissemination of regional and national information, which included the recommendation of social distancing, especially for high risk groups such as patients with diabetes [19] . The social distancing recommendation have a psychological effect even in patients without diabetes, as shown by Talevi et al. [20] . In this review, the authors report that up to 53.8% of people experienced psychological distress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. A range of negative psychological responses were identified, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia and worries about individuals' own health and family.The levels of stress, anxiety and depression ranged from mild to moderate-severe [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Among patients with confirmed infection, findings show that nearly 50% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 had depressive symptoms, over 55% had anxiety and almost 70% had somatic symptoms [20, 25] .The psychological repercussion of the current scenario in patients with diabetes is still hypothetical. It is well known that those patients, due to the conditions of the underlying disease, already have a greater tendency to develop psychiatric disorders throughout life. It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the social isolation determined by it, may interfere with parameters of mental health in patients with diabetes. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the current pandemic on the prevalence of mental health disorders in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.This is a cross-sectional study developed to assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in a cohort of patients living with diabetes during the social distancing period due to COVID-19 pandemic. Electronic medical records were used to select patients with diabetes in a follow-up at the Endocrinology department of a public hospital in Southern Brazil. Patients who met the inclusion criteria received a telephone call for an invitation and application of the informed consent form (by electronic means or audio recording). Participants who agreed to participate in this study received a second phone call for data capture. All the study procedures started 1 month after the disclosure of the national ordinance that standardizes the social distancing recommendation for risk groups, including diabetes, in Brazil. At the time of the evaluation, the state of Rio Grande do Sul followed the Contingency Plan and State Action for the Prevention of the Human Infection COVID-19, which restricted the functioning of establishments that offer essential services and which regulated the indication of an exceptional teleworking regime for people with respiratory diseases, immunosuppressed or with chronic disease, upon medical recommendation. All data were collected in 8 days in order to have the same pandemic time for all participants. All contacts were made by telephone by trained researchers in order to preserve participants from social exposure. All data collected during the phone calls were recorded directly on an electronic database validated by the study staff.Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in a regular follow-up at the Endocrinology outpatient clinic, who attended a medical appointment in a one-year period, for type 2 diabetes, and three-year period for type 1 diabetes (from 2016 to 2019), were identified in an electronic database. Inclusion criteria involved age ≥ 18 years old, an hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test collected between January and March 2020 at the hospital laboratory, and having a valid telephone number in the electronic medical record. Patients who had any physical or cognitive impairment that prevented the application of the study questionnaires (such as dementia and severe hearing impairment), as well as patients who were hospitalized at the time of the study, were excluded.The primary outcome assessed was the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes-related emotional distress, eating disorders and sleeping disorders at the moment of the study.For the assessment of psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, the Brazilian validated version of the Self Report Questionnaire-20 (SRQ 20) was used [26, 27] . This 20-item questionnaire addresses questions related to physical and psychoemotional symptoms that may have been presented in the past 30 days, asking yes or no questions. A positive screening for minor psychiatric disorders was considered when the survey scored greater than or equal to 7, which was considered a sign of current mental suffering.Diabetes-related emotional distress was assessed by the Brazilian validated version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (B-PAID), which is a 20-item questionnaire that contemplates the patient's perspective on the impact of certain issues related to diabetes on a 4-point response scale, with responses ranging from 0 = ""it is not a problem"" to 4 = ""it is a serious problem"". The scores for each item were summed up, and then multiplied by 1.25 to generate a total score out of 100. Severe diabetes emotional distress was considered present when the score was greater than or equal to 40 [28, 29] .The prevalence of eating disorders was assessed by the Brazilian validated version of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26). This survey addresses 26 issues related to eating habits and attitudes on a 3-point response scale, with responses ranging from 0 = ""never"" to 3 = ""always"". The presence of a significant eating disorder was considered when the score was greater than or equal to 20 [30, 31] .To assess sleep disorders, the Brazilian version of the Mini Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), a 10-item scale, was used on a 7-point response scale, with responses ranging from 1 = ""never"" to 7 = ""always"". A sleep disorder (moderate or severe) was considered when a score greater than or equal to 28 was present [32, 33] .It should be noted that the scales used to assess mental health disorders were designed for self-application. The fact that those scales were applied by telephone contact could be a potential source of bias. To minimize this effect, the researchers strictly followed the steps of the questionnaires, repeating the alternative answers to each question only when requested to be as accurate as possible.Demographics and clinical data, such as the presence of comorbidities, continuous use medications, weight and height-obtained from the last visit for calculating the body mass index (BMI) -, and HbA1c (high-performance liquid chromatography method) data from the last 3 months were collected from electronic medical records. Cardiovascular disease was considered present if there was a previous history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or heart failure registered in medical records. The presence of diabetes complications was also documented according to medical records. The presence of retinopathy was considered based on the last registered fundus examination. For neuropathy, it was considered the presence of a documented diagnosis of previous neuropathy or a monofilament 10 g test altered in the last medical appointment. For diabetic nephropathy, it was considered the presence of microalbuminuria or chronic kidney disease in which the etiology was attributed to diabetes in the medical records.Some clinical data, such as the use of antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs and previous diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, were obtained from both electronic medical records and checked directly with the patients during the phone calls. Previous diagnosis of common mental disorder was considered if there was a previous or current diagnosis of depressive episode, major depressive disorder or anxiety disorders. Compliance with the recommendation of social distance was questioned directly to the participants according to the follow: (1) total social distancing was considered when the patient did not leave the house under any circumstances; (2) partial social distancing was considered when the patient left the house only for basic activities (such as going to the market and pharmacy); or (3) no social distancing, when the patient maintained regular activities.The institutional ethics committee approved the study protocol (Number 4.029.368), and all authors signed the confidentiality document for data use.The sample size was calculated for a prevalence survey with finite population correction. Considering that the prevalence of anxiety and depression disorders among patients with type 1 was 17.6% and type 2 diabetes was 16%, we considered a mean prevalence known of 17%. The calculation was performed taking into account that in 2019 there were 16.8 million individuals with diabetes in Brazil. The number required for an analysis with 5% accuracy and 85% confidence level was 117 patients [4, 34, 35] . The number of patients included with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes was determined randomly. The limitations imposed by the current pandemic and the recommendation of social distancing to patients with diabetes added difficulty in approaching and contacting a greater number of patients, which motivated the choice of the 85% confidence level.Analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 20.Descriptive data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) or percentages. The data distribution was analysed and, since it had a normal distribution, parametric tests were used. In order to evaluate possible differences according to diabetes type, statistical analyses included unpaired t-test for continuous variables and χ 2 test for categorical variables. The primary outcome (minor psychiatric disorders) was then evaluated as the dependent variable in a multivariable logistic regression model designed to control for possible confounders in the interaction between the primary outcome and the diabetes type. An α level of ≤ 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. This study followed the STROBE statement for the reporting.A total of 245 potentially eligible patients were identified, and 146 were randomly recruited to participate in the study. The recruitment stopped after inclusion of the planned sample size, when 120 individuals, 52 with type 1 and 68 with type 2 diabetes, agreed to participate and provided informed consent (see Additional file 1: Figure  S1 ). Age, sex, diabetes duration, and HbA1c levels did not differ by enrollment status (data not shown). Overall (n = 120), participants had a mean age of 54.8 ± 14.4 years old; 55.8% were female, 85.8% white and 76.7% overweight/obese. The mean diabetes duration was 21.8 ± 10.9 years and the HbA1c value was 9.0 ± 1.6% (75 ± 17.5 mmol/mol) (see Table 1 ). Patients with type 2 diabetes were older (62.3 ± 9.1 vs. 45.0 ± 14.2 years of age; p < 0.001), had a greater racial representation (22.1% vs. 3.8% not white; p = 0.02) and a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity (95.6% vs. 51.9%; p < 0.001), when compared with patients with type 1 diabetes. Although younger, type 1 diabetes patients had a longer diabetes duration (25.2 ± 11.5 vs.Data are mean ± standard deviation or %. An α level of ≤ 0.05 indicates significant difference. BMI, Body mass index; HbA1c, hemoglobin A1c. ACE, Angiotensinconverting enzyme; a Common mental disorders, which includes depressive episode, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. b Social distancing includes patients who followed the orientation of total (home-staying only) or partial social isolation (left home only for basic activities, such as market, pharmacy and health care) 19.2 ± 9.7 years; p < 0.01). Both groups were comparable with respect to HbA1c levels and presence of diabetes complications. From the whole group, 9 patients (7 type 1, and 3 type 2 diabetes) had some previous serious psychiatric diagnosis, which were not considered as common mental disorders in analysis. Among patients with type 1 diabetes, 3 had a diagnosis of schizophrenia; 1 bipolar mood disorder; 1 borderline personality disorder; and 1 self-mutilation history. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, 1 patient had a previous diagnosis of schizophrenia and 1 had a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. There was no difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes regarding the presence of previous common mental disorders. Regarding social distancing, in total, 42.5% of patients were following the guidance of total isolation, 50% were on partial social distancing (leaving home only for basic activities) and only 7.5% were not on doing any type of social distancing (keeping regular daily activities). There was no difference between groups with regard to social distancing.In the studied participants, 93.3% (94.2% in type 1 and 92.6% in type 2 diabetes, p = 0.73) had some sign of a psychiatric disorder, which was assessed by a positive screening in at least one of all the specific scales measured in this study (minor psychiatric disorders, diabetes-related emotional distress, and eating and sleeping disorders).Regarding the primary outcome, the presence of psychological distress, that measure depressive and anxiety symptoms, 44.2% of patients had a positive screening based on the SRQ 20 (see Fig. 1 ). In the type 1 diabetes group, this prevalence was 32.7%, while in the group with type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of psychological distress was higher, 52.9% (p = 0.03). The question number 17 of the SRQ 20 (""has the thought of ending your life been on your mind"") addresses suicidal ideation, and, overall, 6.7% of patients had a positive response to this item. Also, considering all the demographic and clinical differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients showed in Table 1 , we performed a multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the impact of variables of clinical interest on the interaction between the primary outcome (minor psychiatric disorders) and the type of diabetes (see Table 2 ). We included into the model; age, sex, race/ ethnicity, age of diabetes diagnosis, HbA1c, BMI, previous common mental disorders, and social distancing. The adjusted Odds Ratio and its 95% confidence interval for the interaction between minor psychiatric disorders and type 2 diabetes was 7.60 (1.97-29.34). Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes-related emotional distress, eating disorders and sleeping disorders. The presence of diabetes-related emotional distress was found in 29.2% of patients; eating disorders in 75.8%; and moderate/severe sleeping disorders in 77.5% of patients (Fig. 1) . There was no significant difference in these outcomes between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In the type 1 diabetes group, the prevalence of diabetes-related emotional distress was 28.8% vs. 29.4% in the type 2 diabetes group (p = 0.95). For the eating disorders evaluation, 78.8% of patients with type 1 diabetes showed a positive screening for eating disorders vs. 73.5% of those living with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.50). In the analysis of sleep pattern, 76.9% of patients with type 1 diabetes showed signs of moderate/severe sleep disorder vs. 77.9% of those living with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.89). We also performed a multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the impact of BMI on the interaction between the positive screening for eating and sleeping disorders and the type of diabetes, and no significant interaction was identified (data not shown).In this study, we sought to investigate psychological characteristics of people living with diabetes after 1 month of social distancing recommendations in Brazil. We found a high prevalence of significant psychological distress among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with approximately 93% of the studied patients showing signs of current mental suffering in some psychological specific area. Almost half of the patients had a positive screening for psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, with a significant greater tendency in patients with type 2 diabetes. The presence of diabetes-related emotional distress was present in only 29.2% of the interviewees, which does not appear to directly justify the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders found in this study. Approximately three out of four patients had a positive screening for eating and sleeping disorders, which may reflect the systemic repercussion of a latent anxiety condition.It is well documented that depression and anxiety are more prevalent among patients with diabetes when compared to general population [36] [37] [38] . An epidemiological study by Meurs et al. evaluating more than 90,000 patients found an 80% increased risk of depression and anxiety in patients with diabetes [36] . The data described in the literature shows a co-prevalence of diabetes and depression ranging from 17.6 to 21% [39, 40] . In Brazil, the prevalence of depression in patients with diabetes, in usual situations, appears to be similar to that found in other countries, reaching 22% in the most recently published study [41] . Considering the current scenario, a study by Huang et al. in China showed a prevalence of anxiety and depression in the general population of 35% and 20%, respectively [42] . This makes us reflect about the possible impact that 1 month of social distancing, associated with all the stressors related to the current pandemic, has on this group of patients. Health appointments not fully available, difficulties in obtaining diabetes medications and supplies, besides the lack of scientific information regarding the real relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes, may have contributed to the high prevalence of psychological distress found in Table 2 Multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of minor psychiatric disorders Multivariable logistic regression model to assess predictors of the presence of minor psychiatric disorders (χ 2 = 17.94, p 0.05, R 2 Negelkerke 0.19). BMI, Body mass index; HbA1c, hemoglobin A1c. Common mental disorders includes depressive episode, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Social distancing includes patients who followed the orientation of total or partial social detachment (left home only for basic activities, such as market, pharmacy and health care)Confidence interval (95%) P value this study. The possible vulnerability intrinsic to diabetes seems to be exacerbated in the current scenario.It is important to notice that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes differently. There is a tendency for a higher prevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared to those with type 1 diabetes in normal situations. A study performed by Bak et al. showed that patients with type 2 diabetes had almost twice the prevalence of depression symptoms when compared to those with type 1 diabetes [43] . In addition, intrinsic differences in types of diabetes can be affected in different ways during the period of social distancing. In type 1 diabetes, which requires precision in terms of the amount and timing of insulin administration, having more time at home could result in improved adherence and disease control. On the other hand, in type 2 diabetes, the maintenance of healthy habits, including physical exercise and balanced diet, can be greatly impaired during quarantine. These possible differences can have a positive or negative impact in terms of glycemic control, contributing differently to the appearance of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. It should be noted that these differences are still hypothetical, requiring specific studies for a better understanding.Besides the high prevalence of psychological distress, our findings highlight the observation that the risk of suicide may be increased during the period of social distancing by COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. In the studied cohort, almost 7% of patients expressed positive responses to the question ""has the thought of ending your life been on your mind?"" in the SRQ 20. It is important to notice that the questionnaires were applied in a single phone call interview generated by researchers who had no bond or previous connection with participants. It is possible that, if applied under other conditions, this number would be even higher. Our findings are compatible with what was exposed by Gunnel et al., which stated that the pandemic would cause distress and leave many people vulnerable to mental health problems and suicidal behavior. Mental health consequences are likely to be present for longer and peak later than the actual pandemic [44] . This reinforces the importance of the active and ongoing participation of mental health professionals in policy task forces during this critical period [45] .Our study also showed a high prevalence of eating disorders among patients with diabetes after 1 month of social distancing. Literature data show that approximately 14% to 35% of patients with diabetes have a positive screening for eating disorders when assessed by EAT-26, a percentage much lower than the one found in our cohort [46, 47] . A pilot study by Fernandez-Aranda et al. demonstrated that, after just 2 weeks of confinement, almost 38% of patients reported symptoms related to eating disorders. The authors reflect that concerns about health and fitness during confinement might serve as a precipitating factor for the development of an eating disorder in vulnerable individuals [48] . It is important to note that our study was carried out after a longer period of social distancing, but in milder confinement conditions, different from the lockdown measures evaluated in the study by Fernandez-Aranda et al. Nevertheless, although not evaluated in our study, the high prevalence of eating disorders in this population could interfere in diet and, consequently, in glycemic control.Another relevant aspect of our study was the high prevalence of sleep disorders in patients with diabetes during this period. Only one study was carried out to assess sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic, which showed 18% prevalence of sleeping disorders [43] . We believe that the presence of a positive screening for moderate and severe sleep disorder in our cohort is possibly multifactorial: the presence of obstructive sleep apnea in the groups with highest BMI, eventual nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes, staying longer time at home, practicing less physical activity, and having irregular sleep times may play an important role in this variable. In addition, it is possible that the presence of insomnia in this period reflects an anxiety sign related to a heightened concern about the risk of having COVID-19 while having diabetes. These hypotheses are merely speculation, requiring specific studies for better understanding.It is important to highlight some limitations of the present study. This study involved a cross-sectional research design and data regarding mental health that was not assessed before the period of social distancing for comparison in this same population. The absence of a control group without diabetes is also a limitation of the study. It must be taken into account that a relatively small sample was included in this study, although in accordance to the sample size calculation. In addition, patients were selected from a single tertiary center, which can limit external validity. Some parameters, such as labor activities and patients' current purchasing power, and specific information on the use of antipsychotics and mood stabilizers were not available in the electronic medical records and were not assessed directly with the participants, not allowing us to interpret the medication use and economic impact of this period in mental health.Some limitations should be considered in relation to the scales used. The scales used to assess psychiatric disorders work as screening tools and have no diagnostic value. The scales used were originally validated for self-application and, in our study, they were applied by researchers through phone calls due to the limitations imposed by the current scenario. The self-report-questionnaire (SRQ-20), which was used to assess the primary outcome, has validation for minor psychiatric disorders screening in primary health care in Brazil [48] . Despite not presenting validation for screening in patients in tertiary care, patients with diabetes mellitus are included in primary care samples. For the assessment of eating disorders, the eating attitudes test (EAT-26) was used. Although there are no validation studies in the population with diabetes, their results are widely generalizable and used for screening, indicating food preoccupation and restriction [30, 31] . The EAT-26 is often indicated as one of the methods of choice for the initial assessment of eating disorders in patients with diabetes, according to Young-Hyman et al. [49] . The mini sleep questionaire (MSQ) used to assess sleep disorders has validation only for the general population and there are no specific studies on its use in patients with diabetes [32, 33] .Despite not having a diagnostic purpose, this study found a high number of patients showing evidence of significant psychological distress among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results serve as an alarm for the impact that the current scenario may have on the mental health of patients with diabetes. The data from this study highlight the need for mental health access and support for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during and after this pandemic. Future studies and actions should address the impact of strategies to care for mental health in diabetes and to prevent glycemic control deterioration during a quarantine period.Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https ://doi. org/10.1186/s1309 8-020-00584 -6.",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-31,8
ab20b3a12fa07ae9d047b3c30bb5eb3dfcf64944,COVID-19 -The Availability of ICU Beds in Brazil during the Onset of Pandemic,"In the third week of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases reached the two million mark around the world. In nearly four months, the disease caused the death of ~1 53,920 people. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, a total of 569,953 individuals (14, 0246 patients in Brazil) have recovered from COVID-19: this number represents four times the number of global deaths. So far, 56,924 individuals (6,634 patients in Brazil) have received intensive therapy due to the high severity of the disease. From the first identified case, Brazil has reached a total of 33,682 confirmed cases of the disease and 2,411 deaths, with both marks ranking 11th globally. In total, 210 countries and territories as well as two international conveyances worldwide were affected by the disease; and deaths caused by COVID-19 occurred in 166 countries and territories at this moment [1, 2] .To date, the 17th July 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases reached the 14 million mark around the world causing the death of ~5 95,166 people. At Brazil, a total of 2,021,834 individuals were affected by COVID-19 and the disease caused the death of 76,997 individuals with both marks ranking 2nd globally. Brazil had 578,062 active cases ranking 2nd globally, 9,509 total cases of COVID-19 per one million of inhabitants ranking 15th globally and 362 deaths caused by COVID-19 per one million of inhabitants ranking 12th globally [1, 2] . In addition, Brazil performed only 4,911,06 SARS-CoV-2 real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests ranking 9th globally and the ratio between the number of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests done per one million of inhabitants was 23,097 ranking 104th globally [1, 2] . To date, in total, 213 countries and territories as well as two international conveyances worldwide were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; and deaths caused by the disease occurred in 187 countries and territories at this moment [1, 2] . A summary of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario from Brazil by state and Federal District on 17 July 2020 was shown as Table 1 .Brazil has a vast geography and includes 26 states and one Federal District. The states and the Federal District have different numbers of inhabitants and an uneven geographical distribution of the population, causing a heterogeneous population density (persons per km 2 ) ( Table 2 ). In each state or the Federal District, epidemiologic data for COVID-19 showed different numbers of patients and/ or deaths and case fatality rate (CFR). During the onset of COVID-19 pandemic most cases were reported in the state of São Paulo, namely 12,841/33,682 patients, 928/2,411 deaths and CFR of 7.2%. At this moment, the CFR for COVID-19 in Brazil ranged from 1.8% (state of Roraima) to 13 .3% (state of Paraíba) [3] . Brazil had seven states with CFR higher than the global mean CFR. In addition, the Brazilian gross domestic product (GDP) differs among the states and the Federal District due to different levels of economic development, and consequently affecting the capacity and quality of health services in each region. The data was collected at https://covid.saude.gov.br. Access July 17, 2020. Reference 3. In Brazil, the majority of the population receives primary care from the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS), and yet the private health system maintains the major number of ICU beds. In some cases, the state can request support from the private healthcare sector. There is a difference in the number of available ICU beds among the states and the Federal District, as well as between the public and the private health systems. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of ICU beds should be 1 to 3 units per 10,000 inhabitants. In Brazil, at least one ICU bed per 10,000 inhabitants was reported in 24 states and in the Federal District (except for the states of Acre and Roraima). However, these numbers were calculated by adding ICU beds from the public and the private health services.Considering the number of ICU beds at SUS/10,000 inhabitants, only 11 states showed a number of ICUs beds above one ICU bed per 10,000 inhabitants. Moreover, considering only the beneficiaries of private health insurance and the number of ICU beds at the private health system/10,000 inhabitants, all states show a number of ICU beds above three ICU beds per 10,000 inhabitants, except for the state of Santa Catarina, where a total of 2.61 ICUs beds per 10,000 inhabitants were described. The highest number of ICU beds per 10,000 inhabitants was found in the state of Mato Grosso, i.e., a rate of 10.63. São Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, has 1.19 and 3.8 ICUs beds/10,000 inhabitants at the public (SUS) and private health systems, respectively. Moreover, each state shows an uneven distribution of ICUs beds per total area, for example, Amazonas is the largest state in Brazil with 559,168.12 km 2 and ICUs were concentrated only in its capital city, Manaus ( Table 3) .Given the low ICU beds availability, the healthcare system in the states of Amazonas, Pernambuco and Ceará, for example, was on the verge of collapse, as 100% of ICUs beds are being used to treat patients with COVID-19. In the state of Amazonas, the situation was critical, and the local health system was overwhelmed: high death tolls, refrigerated containers were being used to temporarily accommodate the victims' bodies, mass graves were being dug, and burials were being conducted by family members without any infection control measures. Likewise, the public health system in the state of Rio de Janeiro was projected to collapse. The state of São Paulo, the epicenter of the crisis, was also nearing 100% capacity of ICU beds in public hospitals. However, the accurate number or projections for COVID-19 victims cannot be determined because access to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was limited [4] . In this context, the epidemiology and geographic data were described and intercorrelated to evidence the need to optimize the number of ICU beds to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic during its onset.The following epidemiology and geographic data markers were evaluated in our study: number of patients with COVID-19; deaths due to COVID-19; CFR for COVID-19; GDP (in Brazilian Real -R$); number of inhabitants; % of the population per area; total area of the states and Federal District (km 2 ); population density (persons per km 2 ); countries with similar number of inhabitants using as parameter each Brazilian state or Federal District ( Table 2) .The epidemiology and geographic data were correlated with the distribution of ICU beds and the number of beneficiaries of private health insurance ( Table 3) Moreover, (i) the number of ICUs beds and the ratio of ICU beds to total beds were correlated with the number of patients with COVID-19 (CC = 0.920; P-value ≤ 0.001); deaths due to COVID-19 (CC = 0.908; P-value ≤ 0.001); GDP (CC = 0.974; P-value ≤ 0.001); demographic density (CC = 0.390; P-value = 0.044); number of inhabitants (CC = 0.965; P-value ≤ 0.001) and % of the population (CC = 0.956; P-value ≤ 0.001); (ii) ICU beds/10,000 inhabitants was correlated with GDP (CC = 0.472; P-value = 0.013); population density (CC = 0.747; P-value ≤ 0.001); number of inhabitants (CC = 0.396; P-value = 0.041); (iii) ICU beds at SUS and ratio of ICU beds to total beds (%) at SUS and the were correlated with the number of patients with COVID-19 (CC = 0.865; P-value ≤ 0.001); deaths due to COVID-19 (CC = 0.840); GDP (CC = 0.962; P-value ≤ 0.001); number of inhabitants (CC = 0.978; P-value ≤ 0.001) and % of the population (CC = 0.965; P-value ≤ 0.001).The number of ICU beds at the private health system and the ratio of ICU beds to total beds (%) at the private health system were correlated with the number of patients with COVID-19 (CC = 0.911; P-value ≤ 0.001); deaths due to COVID-19 (CC = 0.909; P-value ≤ 0.001); GDP (CC = 0.930; P-value ≤ 0.001); population density (CC = 0.488; P-value = 0.010); number of inhabitants (CC Note: The data is based on the Federal Council of Medicine, 2018. = 0.901; P-value ≤ 0.001) and % of the population (CC = 0.896; P-value ≤ 0.001). Finally, a positive correlation was observed between (i) the number of beneficiaries of private health insurance and the number of patients with COVID-19 (CC = 0.947; P-value ≤ 0.001); deaths due to COVID-19 (CC = 0.929; P-value ≤ 0.001); GDP (CC = 0.995; P-value ≤ 0.001); number of inhabitants (CC = 0.962; P-value ≤ 0.001) and % of the population (CC = 0.955; P-value ≤ 0.001).In this context, the number of COVID-19 cases and epidemiological data in Brazil are correlated with the distribution of ICUs beds between regions. However, there is an important correlation between (1) the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths and (2) the need for private services and the number of beneficiaries of private health insurance ( Table 4) .To corroborate with the previous findings, a partial correlation controlled by GDP and the number of beneficiaries of private health insurance was made, as follows: (i) ICU beds and the ratio of ICU beds to total beds (%) were correlated with population density (CC = 0.449; P-value = 0.024) and the number of inhabitants (CC = 0.414; P-value = 0.040); (ii) ICU beds/10,000 inhabitants was correlated with population density (CC = 0.681; P-value ≤ 0.001); (iii) ICU beds at SUS and the ratio of ICU beds to total beds (%) at SUS were correlated with the number of patients with COVID-19 (CC = -0.602; P-value = 0.001), deaths due to COVID-19 (CC = -0.609; P-value ≤ 0.001), number of inhabitants (CC = 0.688; P-value ≤ 0.001), % of the population (CC = 0.545; P-value = 0.005); (iv) ICU beds at SUS/10,000 inhabitants was correlated with the number of patients with COVID-19 (CC = -0.489; P-value = 0.013) and deaths due to COVID-19 (CC = -0.437; P-value = 0.029); (v) ICU beds at the private health system and the ratio of ICU beds to total beds (%) at the private health system were correlated with population density (CC = 0.604; P-value = 0.001) ( Table 5) .Curiously, an inverse correlation occurred of ICU beds at SUS and the ratio of ICU beds to total beds (%) at SUS with the number of patients with COVID-19 and deaths due to COVID-19. Maybe, the data represents an association between the need to improve the public health system to treat COVID-19 in Brazil.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brazil has taken steps to improve healthcare services mainly in the states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, namely by constructing temporary field hospitals and facilitating access to the private health system. So far, a miracle drug to treat patients with COVID-19 or vaccine to control the pandemic have not been found [5] [6] [7] . The best choice of treatment for severe cases is intensive therapy and intubation. To perform the gold standard treatment, health services should have well-trained medical staff and infrastructure, including the availability of ICUs bed to all patients. Ultimately, Li et al. (2020) stated: ""For a better understanding of this novel virus, more research needs to be done to get optimal strategies for the treatment of COVID-19"" [7] .However, at Brazil, the availability of ICUs beds is unequal between states and Federal District. Brazil is a vast geographic territory with a population that is different in each region based on social behavior, genetics (each region has a different level of ancestral contribution of African, Caucasians and Indigenous genomes) and economic backgrounds raising the need for different medical and social managements in each area from Brazil. In addition, as showed in the descriptive and correlation analysis performed in our data, the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of public health system is higher than the private health care. Also, as stated by Ortega and Marson (2020),4 from the Influenza virus subtype (H1N1) pandemic (2009) to COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil lost ~3 4,500 hospital beds. In approximate numbers, hospital beds in the country fell from 460,920 to 426,380 in the short interval between the two pandemics, despite the increase in the number of inhabitants. The fall in the number of hospital beds occurred in the SUS, which lost 48,530 service spaces. In the same period, the private health service showed an increase of ~1 4,000 beds. However, Brazil gained 17,300 (from 42,400 to ~6 0,000-62,000 thousand) ICU beds in the same period.Three Brazilian states [São Paulo (~18,000 ICUs), Rio de Janeiro (~7,000 ICUs) and Minas Gerais (~6,000 ICUs)] concentrated the ICUS and most of the ICUs are located in the capital cities [4] . The WHO recommends 1 to 3 ICUs beds for every 10,000 inhabitants and Brazil has approximately 1 bed for every 10,000 inhabitants, but the number of ICUs beds is unequal among different regions from Brazil including the adjustment by the number of inhabitants in each state. In addition, the number of equipment such as respirators is scarce, being, according to the government, ~6 5,000 respirators available in the country and, interestingly, in the H1N1 pandemic there were just over 35,000. The number presented here are unequal between states and the federal district. For example, Amazonas states has a vast territory comprising an area of 1,559,168 [12] . Km 2 with a population of 4,144,597 inhabitants and the ICUs are concentrated only at Manaus (Capital city). To treat the severe cases for COVID-19 can be difficult in such situations because there is a limited access for mechanical ventilator, hospital, ICUs and, in many cases, transport to carry out the patients to the treatment site.In Brazil, a special attention should be given for some groups of people as Indigenous people, health professionals and people living in urban low-income conglomerates namely as ""Favelas"" [4] . People living in favelas has precarious condition with, several times, no access to health, social and financial support. Also, people living at Favelas are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection without the access to diagnose and/or treatment; and these people showed a low adhesion to the quarantine and social isolation. Obviously, considering this group of people, the biggest concern is the possibility of having the food to eat. Also, the houses are precarious one with many residents per unit in a small area. Note: CFR -Case fatality rate; GDP -gross domestic product. Note: CFR -Case fatality rate.Concomitantly, healthcare professionals need to be prepared for two other critical situations including the psychological effects of anxiety and depression due to death and other losses during the pandemic; [8] and the follow up and the treatment of diseases that were modified and postponed during the pandemic period, especially the respiratory diseases.Moreover, Brazilian population comprise of ~5 00,000 indigenous citizens that has a limited access to hospital for intubation when needed [9] . Now, Brazil has several cases of indigenous with COVID-19 including 11,394 confirmed cases and 225 deaths [10] . The COVID-19 can be devastating for indigenous population mainly regarding the restrictions to have access to medical care. Also, the loss of indigenous ethnicities, in addition to characterizing the loss of life, reflects cultural and social loss that are irreparable.Finally, as a vast geography territory Brazil show some peculiarities for some regions and can be affected by different pandemics simultaneously. For example, North of Brazil is at risk of Malaria and the outcomes for that is unknown [10] . There is no conclusion about if this zone (Amazon region) can be a hidden burden of COVID-19 due to Malaria symptoms or if is necessary to improve Malaria campaign and COVID-19 sensibilization to reduce the risk of both and concomitant infection. The Brazilian government and health authorities should implement health politics to control both diseases in an area with a vast geography dimension and several restrictions in the health system and with a population under poverty or extreme poverty condition with low access to the health system.There is a shortage of ICUs bed in many health services around the world. And, governments and health services are struggling to control the spread and infection rates. In this context, personal and environmental hygiene is key. However, the Brazilian population and even healthcare professionals are running low on medical supplies, such as facial masks and 70% alcohol [11] . Healthcare professionals, especially medical doctors, nurses and physiotherapists, are continuously working long hours and under intense pressure to treat all patients with COVID-19 in Brazil and worldwide [12] [13] [14] . Curiously, in Brazil, some health professionals are being harassed by some people who view the COVID-19 pandemic with disbelief or think that professionals can spread the disease.In fact, some reactions of the population are associated with the position of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has minimized the risks of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and downplayed the severity of the pandemic in official nation-wide broadcasts, interviews and casual meetings with his supporters. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta's stance towards the pandemic was in line with the WHO recommendations, but not in accord with President Bolsonaro's position. Mr. Mandetta was eventually dismissed after Mr. Bolsonaro had publicly refused to abide by his social distancing guidelines. Also, in interviews and press conferences throughout February and March 2020, the Brazilian President reiterated the need for what he calls ""vertical isolation"" -isolation of the elderly and at-risk groups -to reduce the impact on economy. Furthermore, fake news around the disease and WHO recommendations spreads rapidly on social media: a new dilemma during the COVID-19 outbreak [15] . So far, social isolation and quarantine have been the best measures to reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, to offer the opportunity to treat all severe cases in ICUs and to reduce viral dissemination among less severe cases or asymptomatic patients [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .Brazil shows a high number of healthcare professionals deaths affected by COVID-19 mainly infected at hospitals and ICUs. For example, as described by Palamim and Marson (2020) [22] , on 20 th May 2020, the Federal Nursing Council from Brazil declared a total number of 138 (111 confirmed cases and 27 suspicious cases) deaths of nurses by COVID-19 representing 138/360 (38.33%) of all deaths for nurses worldwide. Also, the female sex represented 84.77% of the cases and 62.32% of the deaths. Moreover, the age range of infections was represented by: 20 to 30 years old -2,938 cases (5 deaths); 31 to 40 years old -6,849 cases (29 deaths); 41 to 50 years old -24,456 cases (38 deaths); 51 to 60 years old -1,485 cases (35 deaths); 61 to 70 years old -201 cases (25 deaths); and 71 to 80 years old -22 cases (6 deaths).During the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, a higher number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory syndrome were registered in Brazil when compared with the number of previous years (2018 to 2019) [3] . However, the number of positive cases of COVID-19 announced by the government was not able to explain the higher rate of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Therefore, the major problems are the limited access and capacity to screen the SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. Although Brazil optimizes the test capacity day by day, approximately 296 tests per 1 million people had been performed. Until the confirmation of 2,000 deaths due to COVID-19, only 63,000 RT-PCR tests had been performed in Brazil. The low application of RT-PCR maybe increased the CFR because only severe COVID-19 cases are diagnosed. Keeping a low number of RT-PCR also increased disease dissemination because we failed to measure the number of less severe cases and asymptomatic individuals. This impasse could be solved with mass RT-PCR testing and environmental measures, such as tests to the detect SARS-CoV-2 tests in sewage [23] [24] [25] [26] .As described in the literature, the factors that might be associated with the low number of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests carried out in Brazil include: (i) difficulty to purchase materials to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR by the high market demand; (ii) increase in the price of materials and equipment to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR; (iii) low availability of equipment; (iv) number of qualified people that are available to perform the RT-PCR technique;(v) number of centers or laboratories able to do the exam -in Brazil there are few test centers; and (vi) transportation of the material to the places where the test can be performed [27] .Lung high resolution computed tomography in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates groundglass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with the diagnosis of viral pneumonia [28] [29] [30] . Lung high resolution computed tomography abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes [28] [29] [30] . Less common findings include pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy [28] [29] [30] . Lung high resolution computed tomography may be helpful in making the diagnosis. However, on Brazil and in some territories around the world, the lung high resolution computed tomography scan is not available to all individuals because lung high resolution computed tomography presents high cost, difficult accessibility for the patients affected, necessity of physical structure and patient transportation to the tomography equipment, exposure to radiation and lack of applicability during hospitalization.As not all patients with COVID-19 can receive a lung high resolution computed tomography scan, especially in a rural zone, forest or Favelas. The lung ultrasound can be a feasible tool. Lung ultrasound is a tool used in lung pneumonia especially in low resource settings (especially tuberculosis) and in rare conditions as cystic fibrosis disease [31] [32] [33] . Thus, among the image exams, the lung ultrasound outstands and might become a useful tool to be used in the treatment and follow up of COVID-19 patients, mainly in more severe cases when intensive care is required. The lung ultrasound examination appears as an alternative in the respiratory system propaedeutic for being a low-cost technique, highly portable and that allows repetition of exams, and can be performed at the patient's bedside [33] .The lung ultrasound in COVID-19 main characteristics are focal, multifocal and/or confluent B lines, corresponding to the ground glass opacity of the thorax lung high resolution computed tomography, in addition to the evidence of pleural thickening and irregularities. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Another advantage is the reduced need for manipulating the patient when compared to the lung high resolution computed tomography, avoiding the transportation of the patient to the X-ray room and reducing the risk of contamination of other patients and the health professionals directly or indirectly involved with the patient [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .Prevention is best practice in order to reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic considering the lack of effective treatment. At the moment, there is no vaccine available and the best prevention is to avoid exposure to the virus. In order to achieve this goal, the main measures, in Europe and Brazil, are the following: (i) to use face masks; (ii) to cover coughs and sneezes with tissues; (iii) to wash hands regularly with soap or disinfection with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol; (iv) to avoid contact with infected people; (v) to maintain an appropriate distance from people; and (vi) to refrain from touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.Interestingly, the WHO issued detailed guidelines including (i) regularly and thoroughly clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water; (ii) avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth; (iii) practice respiratory hygiene covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze; (iv) if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early; (v) Stay informed and follow the advice given by your healthcare provider; (vi) maintain at least 1 m (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.In particular, regarding the use of face mask, health care workers are recommended by WHO to use particulate respirators such as those certified N95 or Filtering FacePiece 2 when performing aerosol-generating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or confirmed cases. Moreover, while an individual without respiratory symptoms is not required to wear a medical mask when in public, people with respiratory symptoms are advised to use medical masks both in health care and home care settings [40] .In Brazil, despite WHO recommendations, reports from the Ministry of Health and reports from state and municipal health departments, there is low adherence to the use of personal protective equipment and social isolation. In many places, crowds of people have occurred for several reasons, including: (i) meetings and parties of friends, colleagues and family; (ii) purchases in markets; (iii) visits to the bank, mainly by low-income people who will register or withdraw the emergency benefit provided by the Brazilian government in the amount of R$ 600 (~$100) to R$ 1,200 (~$200); (iv) demonstrations against and in favor of the federal government; (v) during visits by the president in numerous places in the national territory. In addition, the President of Brazil rarely uses personal protective equipment and during the interview to declare the positive diagnosis of the COVID-19, the Brazilian President removed his mask to prove to the population that he was healthy and would use chloroquine to control the manifestations of the disease.Protocol for the early supportive therapy and monitoring [41] In Brazil, during therapy and support monitoring, oxygen therapy is indicated for patients with SARS and breathing difficulties, hypoxemia or shock. Conservative fluid treatment should be performed in patients with SARS when there is no evidence of shock.Empirical antimicrobials to treat the probable pathogens that cause SARS can be administered and these antimicrobials must be provided within one hour of the initial assessment of patients with sepsis. Also, systemic corticosteroids to treat viral pneumonia or SARS outside clinical trials should not be administered routinely.Patients with SARS for signs of clinical complications such as respiratory failure and rapidly progressing sepsis should be monitored, and supportive interventions should be applied immediately.The patient's comorbidities must be known so that individualized care and prognosis can be understood. Additionally, there must be good communication between the patient and his family.Protocol for the treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome -ARDS [41] Severe respiratory distress should be recognized even when oxygen therapy is performed in high flow. In addition, mechanical ventilation should be instituted early in patients with respiratory failure with persistent hypoxemic (despite oxygen therapy).In COVID-19, the use of non-invasive ventilation should be considered if respiratory discomfort is mild, if there is immunosuppression or if there is a diagnosis of cardiovascular problems. The non-invasive ventilation the should be done on negative pressure operating room. Additionally, endotracheal intubation should be performed if there is no response to noninvasive ventilation. The procedure must be performed by a trained and experienced professional, using aerosol precautions.Mechanical ventilation should be implemented with the use of lower tidal volumes (6 (4 to 8) mL/kg of expected body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure <30 cmH 2 O).Patients with severe ARDS should be placed in a prone position to improve oxygenation, but patient safety must be guaranteed.A conservative fluid management strategy should be adopted for patients with ARDS without tissue hypoperfusion. In addition, the patient must be disconnected from the ventilator, which results in loss of positive end-expiratory pressure and atelectasis. Inline catheters should be used for suctioning the airways and the endotracheal tube should be attached when it is necessary to disconnect the patient.Protocol for the management of septic shock [41] Septic shock in adults should be recognized when infection is suspected or confirmed, and vasopressors should be used if necessary, to maintain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg and lactate above 2 mmol/L, in the absence hypovolemia.Septic shock should be recognized in children with either hypotension (systolic blood pressure below the 5 th percentile or greater than 2 standard deviations below normal for age) or 2 to 3 of the following topics: altered mental status; tachycardia or bradycardia (heart rate <90 bpm or >160 bpm in babies and heart rate <70 bpm or >150 bpm in children); prolonged capillary recharge (>2 s) or hot vasodilation with bounding pulses; tachypnea; stained skin or petechial or purple rash; lactate increase; oliguria; hyperthermia or hypothermia.In the resuscitation of septic shock in adults, administer at least 30 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid to adults in the first 3 hours. In the resuscitation of septic shock in children in places with good resources, administer 20 mL/kg in rapid bolus and up to 40 to 60 mL/kg in the first hours.Do not use hypotonic or starch-based solutions for resuscitation.Administer vasopressors when shock persists during or after fluid resuscitation.If central venous catheters are not available, vasopressors can be administered via a peripheral intravenous catheter, but a large vein must be used, and signs of local leakage and tissue necrosis must be monitored. If overflow occurs, the infusion should be stopped.Vasopressors can be administered via intraosseous needles.Consider the administration of intravenous hydrocortisone (up to 200 mg/day) or prednisolone (up to 75 mg/ day) in patients with persistent shock who need increasing doses of vasopressors.Dexethadone should be used in the dosage of 6 mg 1x day for 10 days in patients with the need for O2 support and the need for mechanical ventilation. Heparin 0.5 mg/ kg 12/12h is also indicated for cases where there is no contraindication.Drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are provided can be supplied in Brazil, according to the Ministry of Health, in specific cases and through family consent.Our data give evidence that Brazil has a very diverse demographic and economic aspects. This diversity was also present in the states and the Federal District regarding the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and CFR. The effective management of severe COVID-19 patients requires ICU services, and the scenario was also dissimilar as for ICU beds, ICU beds/10,000 inhabitants, ICU beds at SUS, ICU beds at SUS/10,000 inhabitants, ICU beds at the private health system, ICU beds at the private health system/10,000 inhabitants and beneficiaries of private health insurance during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of ICUs was uneven between public and private services, given that most patients rely on SUS, which has the lowest number of ICU beds. Moreover, in some states, the number of ICU beds at SUS was above 1 to 3 by 10,000 inhabitants, which was the number recommended by the WHO. RT-PCR testing is crucial to implement social policies to control the pandemic, but Brazil has failed to mass test the population. According to Marson (2020): ""As human beings, we miss 'that global hug', which today is restrained and limited to our partners and in our homes. In a crisis situation, let us live light-heartedly and work together to make our world a better place"" [42] .",Brazil,abstract,2020-08-13,8
9e44e0dd56a936f4a8a9fd18e842b50e60cf7358,"biology H""IT""ting the Barriers for Exercising during Social Isolation","Due to the intermittent characteristic, IT allows to accumulate a higher volume of vigorous exercise [45] and higher time close to or at maximal oxygen consumption levels when compared to continuous exercise [40] . Evidence from healthy and clinical populations have consistently shown that IT promotes metabolic and cardiorespiratory adaptations of similar or even greater magnitude than higher volumes of moderate-intensity continuous exercise [36] [37] [38] [39] . Furthermore, IT is considered effective to reduce cardiometabolic risk factors associated with increased mortality and morbidity, such as high blood pressure [46] , excessive body fat [47] , impaired glucose metabolism [48] , chronic low-grade inflammation [49] among others. Therefore, considering that people with arterial hypertension, overweight/obesity, and diabetes mellitus might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 [50] , it is reasonable to assume that IT might be an interesting strategy to mitigate this risk.In addition to its physiological benefits, IT emerges as a promising non-pharmacological strategy to manage mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety [51] [52] [53] . The psychological benefits provided by IT might be equivalent to those achieved with traditional aerobic training during rehabilitation [51] and in the management of major depressive disorders [52] . It is important to point out that the impact of physical exercise on mental health seems be dependent on the level of symptoms, suggesting that individuals with more severe symptoms might benefit more from exercise performance [54] .IT can be performed in different ways and with different methods for controlling intensity [40, 42] . Among them, sprint interval training (SIT) and ""Tabata"" protocols might be particularly interesting during the COVID-19 pandemic. These methods do not require complex testing, can be performed in a wide range of situations (equipment and spaces) and their intensity can be easily controlled.SIT is a specific type of IT that involves relative short bouts (≤30 s) of maximal or ""all-out"" efforts [40] . SIT became popular in recent decades with the Wingate-based protocol (4-6 × 30 s ""all-out"" sprints interspersed with 4-min recovery) [36] . Whilst this variation requires specialized equipment and high motivation, SIT can be adapted in a diversity of ways and modalities to be performed in different places and with less discomfort [55, 56] .There is evidence that SIT protocols might even more time efficient. Previous studies showed that 3 × 20 s cycling sprints improved cardiorespiratory fitness and glucose metabolism in inactive and obese adults [55, 57] . A previous meta-analysis concluded that as little as two sprints might be recommended to increase VO 2 max [58] . This very low volume SIT may be spread throughout the day, what has been called ""sprint snacks"" [59] , and performed in a practical manner, such as using stair climbing [60] .The performance of ""all-out"" sprints does not require previous physical assessment, such as cardiorespiratory exercise testing, which might overcome logistical barriers imposed during social isolation. A common concern raised by exercise specialists is the negative feeling (e.g., reduced enjoyment and displeasure) and feasibility of SIT for sedentary people [61] . However, previous studies showed that reducing the duration of the sprints to ≤10 s might alleviate the negative feelings and increase the exercise enjoyment, as well as expand its applicability [62, 63] .The Tabata protocol was originally reported as a type of SIT, involving seven to eight 20-s bouts of high-effort cycling interspersed with 10 s of rest [64] . It is commonly suggested to perform the protocol at a given percentage (110 to 170%) of the intensity associated with maximum oxygen consumption [65, 66] , which would require specific tests and equipment. However, in the original protocol, exercise was performed at a constant load and was interrupted when the participants were unable to maintain the predetermined intensity [64] , which might be more practical. Another practical alternative would be to perform each bout at maximum intensity, as previously suggested [67, 68] .Tabata protocol has been used with many different variations that been shown to produce similar physiological adaptations in comparison to traditional aerobic training, but in a time-efficient manner [41] . Among these variations, and noteworthy to the scope of this article, we can highlight the use of body-weight exercises, also called calisthenics (e.g., jumping jacks, mountain climbers, burpees, squats and thrusts) [67, 69] .The performance of body-weight IT has been shown to provide similar acute physiological response than those performed in a specialized bicycle, with the advantage to be more enjoyable [70] . Specifically, Tabata protocols using body weight exercises induce similar increases in cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular fitness in comparison to moderate-intensity continuous aerobic training performed on a treadmill [67, 69] . The use of body-weight exercises is particularly relevant during social isolation since this allow to perform the protocols anywhere, including at home.Studies involving body-weight exercises are commonly performed with active healthy people. However, it might be adapted for other populations by increasing work duration and reducing the relative effort (i.e., submaximal intensity) [71, 72] , changing exercise selection and order based on its complexity, metabolic and neuromuscular demands [73] . Furthermore, practical body-weight exercise with virtual supervision may be an effective alternative during isolation [72] , since supervision seems determinant to optimize IT-based programs effects [47] . However, it is important to note that even unsupervised IT programs may induce cardiorespiratory and body composition benefits [74, 75] .Although the benefits of regular physical exercise on the immune system are well known [6] , the acute effects of aerobic training on immune function depends on how it is done [76, 77] . Previous studies suggested that the performance of high-volume or -intensity aerobic training might impair immune response, leading to transitory immunosuppression and increased infection risk [43, 44, 78, 79] . Although, this hypothesis is under debate [80] ; it might be advisable to adequately organize IT to avoid these possible negative effects.The physiological demand of different IT protocols has a different impact on the immune system [81] . Immunosuppression usually occurs after in protocols that result in increased levels of inflammation, metabolic and oxidative stress. A single SIT session involving 30-s bouts of all-out effort have been shown to negatively impact IgA levels [82, 83] , lymphocytes [84] and neutrophils activity [85] for up to two hours after exercise cessation. Although these effects do not seem to persist for more than a few hours [85] [86] [87] , this might induce an open window for viral infections.Such negative effects were not found in protocols that have a lower metabolic demand [88] [89] [90] , suggesting that the problem might not be inherent to IT per se, but on how it is performed. Exercise-induced immunosuppression is generally related to high glycolytic activity, high cortisol levels and sympathetic stimulation [76, 91] . In fact, IT protocols that induced these metabolic responses have been associated with negative immune outcomes and increased risk of illness [84, 85, [92] [93] [94] . Therefore, some strategies might be used to alleviate this responses, like to reduce the duration of the sprints to less than 15 s [95] [96] [97] , reduce the number of sprints [95, 98] , increase rest duration and perform active rest between sprints [99] or reduce weekly training frequency [100] . Moreover, caution should be taken with training schedule and weekly volume since consecutive days of two daily IT sessions induce acute immunosuppression and increased risk for infection [101, 102] .Over medium to long term, regular IT practice can improve immune response regardless of training status [87, [103] [104] [105] [106] . Therefore, adapted IT protocols could be a promising strategy to increase immunosurveillance while controlling for acute risks. Additional measures to control the risk of infection, like avoidance the exposure to environments with a high risk of contamination during and for the next two hours after exercise performance should also be considered.For SIT, the recommendation is to perform short bouts (≤10 s) of all-out efforts with active rest periods of at least eight times the duration of the bouts. This might help to reduce the negative impact on the immune system and the discomfort associated with SIT. Total volume should involve the accumulation of 60 to 240 s of high-intensity efforts. Tabata protocols can be performed with four to 10 bouts of 20 s interspaced by 10 s of rest. In both cases intensity can be constant aiming to reach exhaustion within the designated number of bouts or with all-out efforts in each bout. It is advisable to avoid exposure to potential contamination during and for the next two hours after exercise, especially in vulnerable populations. Special attention should be given to hygiene and physical distancing (mainly if exercise is performed in outdoor environment and with people that do not live in the same home). If one wants to increase safety, exercise could be performed at home, in stairs, garages or spaces close to home.The exercise type might involve indoor activities like stair climbing, calisthenics and jumping rope or traditional exercises, like running and cycling. The practitioner might perform the same exercises for all bouts or alternate the exercise performed in each bout. When performing outdoor exercises, it is advisable to choose uncrowded spaces and, when exercising near other people, it is recommended to keep an adequate distance to avoid droplets form air spray. Another important point is to observe hygiene recommendations when sharing equipment or materials. Exercise choice must consider safety and individual limitations to avoid injury risks and the potential hazards of poor exercise performance.Interval training involves many different variables (e.g., effort intensity, effort duration, recovery intensity, recovery duration, number of intervals, number of sets and exercise type) and their combination allows a wide possibility of adaptations [40, 42] . The present article discussed specific IT possibilities as potential strategies to overcome the barriers to exercise adoption during social distancing. Cardiorespiratory fitness, metabolic health, mental health and immunological improvements achieved after regular IT performance may contribute to improve general health and reduce the adverse effects and mortality risk due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Sprint interval training and Tabata protocols performed using minimal equipment in reduced spaces and requiring a minimal time commitment [67, 72, 107] may be attractive, feasible and safe alternatives to be implemented in face of the social distance measures adopted to control coronavirus dissemination.However, it is important to understand the characteristics of different IT protocols since different physiological and perceptual responses might impose health risks and detract adherence due to high cardiovascular stress or high neuromuscular demand [108, 109] . Additionally, some attention should be given to movement learning, since bad exercise techniques might lead to increased risk for injury, especially hamstrings and knees during running and jumping activities.

abdb37a72f601302bbb9d3c097eab6dc4241b779,Liver transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the early postoperative period: Lessons from a single center in the epicenter of the pandemic,"Brazil is currently one of the most affected countries in the world by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has become the epicenter of the coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) pandemic in Latin America. 1 The impact of COVID-19 in liver recipients remains largely unknown, as most data derive from case reports and small retrospective series. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Moreover, most of them address patients who were transplanted years ago. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [8] [9] [10] 12 Information regarding patients in the early postoperative period is very scarce.Many authors recommend weaning of immunosuppression and some even advocate its complete withdrawn. 2, 4, 9, 12, 16 Nevertheless, these suggestions are mostly based on patients in During the first months of the city quarantine (March 24th to May 31st, 2020), we performed 19 DDLT in 18 patients and di- Pathologists accredited) comprising an E gene assay as the firstline screening tool, followed by confirmatory testing with a N gene assay, as previously described. 17 Endogenous gene RNAse P was used as internal control of extraction and amplification, as well as positive and negative external controls. Analytical sensitivity was 40 copies/mL, and specificity in samples containing other respiratory viruses RNA was 100%. Table 1 depicts a summary of all cases, and Table 2 shows laboratory assessment at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. A 69 years old male patient underwent DDLT due to alcoholic cirrhosis and HCC. Postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on 8th POD. He returned to the emergency department on 10th POD complaining of fever, watery diarrhea, dry cough, and mild exertional dyspnea. A thoracic CT scan showed bilateral multiple ground-glass pulmonary opacities ( Figure 1C ), affecting less than 50% of the lungs. He was started on oseltamivir for 5 days, piperacillin/ tazobactam for 7 days, and oral metronidazole for 10 days. An RT-PCR in NO swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2.Shortness of breath worsened on the 10th day of hospitalization.Another thoracic CT scan showed increase in number and dimensions of ground-glass opacities, now affecting more than 50% of the lungs ( Figure 1D ). He could nonetheless sustain adequate levels of O 2 saturation on Venture mask 50% and did not require further interventions, being discharged home on 17th hospitalization day.A 59 years old male patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis underwent an uneventful DDLT. The patient was extubated on 1st POD, but A 34 years old male patient with sclerosing primary cholangitis and cirrhosis underwent DDLT with biliodigestive anastomosis. TA B L E 2 Laboratory assessment on COVID-19 diagnosis lobes. Almost total atelectasis of the right lower lobe due to adjacent pleural effusion was also noted, which was eventually drained via needle thoracocentesis ( Figure 1E,F) . Despite the more aggressive immunosuppression, the patient remained well with adequate O 2 saturation on oxygen catheter and was discharged home on 41st POD. Regarding the specify treatment of COVID-19, we followed our institution's protocol, in which most novel drugs, such as umifenovir, , showing bilateral multiple ground-glass pulmonary opacities, sometimes associated with thickening of interlobular septa and fine reticulate, affecting less than 50% of the lungs. D, Thoracic CT scan of the same patient on 20th POD, performed due to shortness of breath worsening, revealing increase in number and dimensions of ground-glass pulmonary opacities, now affecting more than 50% of the lungs. E and F, Thoracic CT scan of patient 5, showing numerous bilateral peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities, mainly in the upper lobes, some with thickening of the inter and intralobular septa. There is also a large pleural effusion on the right side with restrictive atelectasis of the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma (E-axial view, F-coronal view) lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab, 2, 4, 9, 12, 16 Therefore, it is reasonably safe to assume that we experienced a nosocomial spread of the virus, probably carried out by asymptomatic patients, or even by patient's visitors and healthcare personnel. Due to these events, infection control protocols were tightened, including a temporary ban on family visits, strengthening of barriers precautions, and mass SARS-CoV-2 screening for healthcare professionals. We also included the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in NO swab in the recipients screening. Although those infection control protocols with strict barrier precautions may reduce SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial spread even in immunosuppressed patients, 22 the challenge of maintaining large liver transplant programs in areas with high community transmission of SARS-CoV-2will remain until a vaccine is developed.In conclusion, we reported a case series of liver recipients who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early postoperative period, probably related to a nosocomial outbreak. Our experience highlights that COVID-19 may impact negatively the postoperative course, especially in elder and obese patients with comorbidities, and draws attention to COVID-19 nosocomial spread.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest with regards to the content of this manuscript.

8f1eb520cacf19c8b940405d2254cbeff5f27d80,"Post-infection depression, anxiety and PTSD: a retrospective cohort study with mild COVID-19 patients","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 8 million individuals worldwide (Kim et al., 2020) . Despite the efforts to limit viral spread, cases are increasing worldwide and deaths are continually occurring (Aljabali et al., 2020) . This pandemic is generating further mental issues such as insomnia, anxiety, depression, stress, anger, and fear (Torales et al., 2020) . Those directly or indirectly affected by the virus could be more disturbed by these symptoms (Torales et al., 2020; Vindegaard & Benros, 2020) . Word cloud studies indicate that uncertainties about lack of COVID-19 tests and medical supplies are common (Lwin et al., 2020) .There is still much uncertainty about the best treatment to be administered to individuals affected by the disease (Lwin et al., 2020) . Though highly transmissible, most cases present with mild symptoms (Aljabali et al., 2020) . However, having been affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a need to quarantine to mitigate viral spread (Fernández et al., 2020) . These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. It is unclear whether COVID-19 can produce psychiatric symptoms during or after the acute illness phase (Vindegaard & Benros, 2020; Sinanović et al., 2020) .In general, survivors of critical illnesses have a high level of mental symptoms after the condition improves. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are among the most reported events in patients with these conditions (Sparks, 2018) . Patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 had a high rate of depressive symptoms during follow-up after the acute phase of the disease (Cheng et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2007) . These symptoms lasted for an extended period, being reported up to a year after the improvement in SARS-CoV-1 symptoms (Lee et al., 2007) . Anxiety symptoms were also reported during the post-SARS-CoV-1 follow-up (Cheng et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2005) .Some studies in Asia investigated depression and/or anxiety in patients admitted in hospitals due to COVID-19 (Guo et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020 , Zhang et al., 2020 . In a case-control design, Guo et al. (2020) investigated the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 COVID-19 hospitalized mild patients, matching them with controls that were COVID-19 negative. Hu et al. (2020) carried out a cross-sectional survey with COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a COVID-19 designated hospital. Zhang et al. (2020) evaluated the prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety within patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, who were under quarantine. In Vietnam, Nguyen et al. (2020) carried out a cross-sectional study with individuals infected by COVID-19 attending outpatient departments of nine hospitals and health centers across the country. All these studies found increased levels of both anxiety and depression (6.8-21.0% and 7.4-31.5%, respectively). There was no follow-up study to investigate prospective symptoms of depression and anxiety in COVID-19 patients.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of many across the globe, resulting in an increased burden of physical and mental health consequences. Through this analysis, we investigated the association between COVID-19 symptoms and post-infection depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among a sample of patients diagnosed with mild COVID-19 in Brazil. There is a need for prospective studies assessing mental health symptoms in COVID-19 patients, evaluating the post-infection period in other regions of the world.The present study was approved by the local ethics committee (Comissão de Ética para Análise de Projeto de Pesquisa -CAPPesq, protocol No. 32293020.9 .0000.5510, approved on July 13 th , 2020).This was a retrospective cohort study. All people who tested positive for COVID-19 and classified as mild cases at treatment intake (baseline: April 6 th to July 15 th ) were considered for the presence of mental health disorders in a follow-up assessment (outcome: July 20 th to early August 7 th ). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depression, anxiety and PTSD in the follow-up assessment, adjusting for previous mental health status, and the time between the baseline and outcome, among other possible confounders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out where we excluded: (i) individuals with a short time between baseline and outcome assessment (≧ 14 days), because these individuals could be in the late active phase of the COVID-19 disease, and (ii) those who progressed to a more severe case of COVID-19.Residents of the municipality ≥ 18 years of age with suspected COVID-19 symptoms were encouraged to contact the dedicated Corona São Caetano platform via the website (access at https://coronasaocaetano.org/) or by phone (baseline: April 6 th to July 15 th ). They were invited to complete an initial screening questionnaire that included socio-demographic data; information on symptoms type, onset and duration; and recent contacts. People meeting the suspected COVID-19 case definition (i.e., having at least two of the following symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, coryza, or change in/loss of smell (anosmia); or one of these symptoms plus at least two other symptoms consistent with COVID-19) were further evaluated, whilst people not meeting these criteria were reassured, advised to stay at home and contact the service again if they were to develop new symptoms or the worsening of current ones. Patients were then asked by a medical student to complete a risk assessment. There were no refusals. All pregnant women, and patients meeting pre-defined triage criteria for severe disease, were advised to attend a hospital service -either an emergency department or outpatient service, depending on availability.All other patients were offered a home visit for self-collection of a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS -both nostrils and throat), which were collected at the patients' homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. More details can be found in Leal et al. (2020) . Due to shortages of some reagents, two RT-PCR platforms were used at different times during the study: ALTONA RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Hamburg, Germany) and the Mico BioMed RT-qPCR kit (Seongnam, South Korea) . For serology, we tested 10μL of serum or plasma (equivalent in performance) using a qualitative rapid chromatographic immunoassay (Wondfo Biotech Co., Guangzhou, China), that jointly detects anti-SARS172 CoV-2 IgG/IgM. The assay has been found to have a sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 99.1% in a U.S. study. In our local validation, after two weeks of symptoms, the sensitivity in RT-PCR confirmed cases (N=59) was 94.9%, and specificity in biobank samples (N=106) from 2019 was 100%. Patients testing RT-PCR negative were followed up by the primary health care program of their residential area. They were advised to contact the platform for additional consultation if they developed new symptoms.All patients testing SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive (N=1,757) were invited to participate in the retrospective cohort study (N = 895), in which we assessed depression and anxiety (outcome: July 20 th to early August 7 th ). We had a response rate of 50.9%. Table S1 presents differences a comparison between those that agreed to participate (N=895) and those that did not (N=862). People that agreed to participate in the study were younger and reported more headaches, anosmia and dysgeusia, and less tachypnea and joint pain than those that refused to be part of the study. More importantly, no significant difference was found regarding the total number of COVID-19 symptoms, which was our main exposure measure.Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR were followed up to 14 days (a maximum of 7 phone calls) from completion of their initial questionnaire. They were contacted every 48 hours by a medical student (supervised by a medical doctor) who completed another risk assessment and recorded any ongoing or new symptoms. Following the COVID-19 clinical assessment protocol of São Caetano do Sul (Leal et al., 2020), the following COVID-19 symptoms were assessed during these contacts: dyspnea; tachypnea; persistent fever (≥ 72 hours); mental health disturbance (e.g., changes in consciousness, thought, perception); fever (at any timepoint); cough; sore throat; nasal congestion; coryza; headache; fatigue; asthenia; lack of appetite; myalgia; joint pain; diarrhea; nausea; vomit; anosmia; and dysgeusia. The total number of symptoms during the treatment was the primary exposure investigated in the present study.The GAD-7 scale is an instrument for assessing, diagnosing and monitoring anxiety. It was created by Spitzer et al. (2006) . It was validated by Kroenke et al. (2007) , according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), for the assessment of signs and symptoms of anxiety disorder, and also to classify severity levels. This study uses the Brazilian Portuguese validated version (Moreno et al., 2017) . GAD-7 consists of seven items, on a four-point scale: 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half the days), and 3 (nearly every day). The total score ranges from 0 to 21, assessing the frequency of signs and symptoms of anxiety over a two-week period. No missingness was observed in any of the question items. A cutoff ≥ 10 was used for the categorical diagnosis of anxiety (Muñoz-Navarro et al., 2017) . In our sample, we found a Cronbach's alpha of 0.92 (Table S1 ).The PHQ-9 scale is an adaptation of the PRIME-MD (Sptizer et al., 1994) . It is a brief instrument for assessing, diagnosing and monitoring depression. It was validated by Spitzer et al. (1999) and by Kroenke et al. (2001) . The present study uses a version which has been translated and validated to Brazilian Portuguese (de Lima Osório et al., 2009 ). PHQ-9 was created based on the DSV-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, for the assessment of its signs and symptoms, and also to classify severity levels. It consists of nine items, arranged on a frequency four-point scale: 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half the days), and 3 (nearly every day). Its score ranges from 0 to 21, assessing the frequency of signs and symptoms of anxiety over two weeks. No missingness was observed in any of the question items. A cutoff ≥ 10 was used for the categorical diagnosis of depression (Levis et al., 2019) . In our sample, we found a Cronbach's alpha of 0.90 (Table S1) . Weathers et al. (1993) developed the PCL-C scale, which was translated, adapted and validated to Brazilian Portuguese (Berger et al., 2004; Lima et al., 2012) to assess the consequences of different types of traumatic experiences. It is based on the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The patient must report the levels of last-month disturbance by 17 items, using a severity scale ranging from 1 (not at all), 2 (a little bit), 3 (moderately, 4 (quite a bit), and 5 (extremely). No missingness was observed in any of the question items. A cutoff ≥ 44 for the categorical diagnosis of PTSD (Archer et al., 2016) . In our sample, we found a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94 (Table S1 ).Lifetime diagnosis of psychiatric disorder (yes vs. no), current psychiatric treatment (yes vs. no), age (continuous: 18-88 years), gender (male vs. female), education (up to high school vs. more than high school), civil status (married vs. single, which included previously married), income level (as defined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: up to three times the typical salary for a minimum wage job vs. more), current health treatment for any acute or chronic medical condition (yes vs. no) and time between the treatment intake and mental assessment (continuous: 6-116 days), were assessed as potential confounders.STATA software version 16.2 was used to run the analysis. Initially, we performed a comparison between those who attended the mental health follow-up assessment and were included in the present study (N= 895) and those who did not, using logistic regression models. This comparison was performed to identify any potential baseline difference between the groups, which could generate bias to our outcome analysis (e.g., higher number of COVID-19-related symptoms among those not included). Our final analytical sample included 895 participants. We first conducted a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 treatment intake profile, sociodemographic measures, and the health profile of included patients. Secondly, we described the mean and prevalences of anxiety, depression and PTSD in these patients. We then created scatterplot figures for continuous outcomes across time. Multivariate logistic regression models for categorical outcomes (binarized scales) were carried out. These models were adjusted for all aforementioned confounders listed in section 2.4.3. Two distinct models were carried out, one which included lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, and the other included current psychiatric treatment, due to significant correlation between these two variables determined via pairwise testing (p<0.05). We subsequently ran sensitivity analyses, where we excluded: (i) individuals with a short time between baseline and outcome assessment, as individuals could be in the late active phase of the COVID-19 disease (≧ 14 days), (ii) those who progressed to a more severe COVID-19 case, and (iii) those with a previous psychiatric diagnosis. In a final sensitivity analysis, we ran multivariate generalized linear models (GLM) for the continuous outcomes. Based on a previous study (Gustavsson et al., 2014) , gamma-family GLM with log link were the models of choice, because of a log-normal distribution of the continuous outcomes of depression, anxiety and PTSD in our sample (Figures S1, S2, and S3). Table 1 shows descriptive analysis of our sample (N=895). The majority were female (60.4%), married (51.4%), and had up to high-school education (60.4%) and three minimum salaries per month of income (58.9%). Around one in every five individuals have had a psychiatric disorder during lifetime (20.1%). Only about half of these individuals have been undergoing psychiatric treatment (10.5%). Current health treatment was reported by 43.1% of the sample. Regarding COVID-19 symptomatic profile, patients had a mean of 4.2 COVID-19-related symptoms. The most common symptoms were anosmia (51.9%), dysgeusia (49.6%), cough (43.1%), headache (41.3%), and fatigue (36.9%), being reported by more than 35% of the sample. Table 2 presents depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and disorders in the sample. Depression, anxiety and PTSD were reported by 26.2% (N = 235), 22.4% (N = 201), and 17.3% (N = 155) of the sample. Among these patients, 39.2% (N = 92), 37.8% (N = 76), and 50.3% (N = 78), had a previous psychiatric diagnosis during lifetime. On average, we assessed patient mental health almost two months after the treatment intake (mean = 56.6 days, 95%CI = 54.7-58.5), with the vast being assessed after the acute phase of the disease (78.7%, N = 840). Few patients (6.7%, N = 61) were referred for in-person consultation.Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C present scatterplots of mean scores of depression, anxiety, and PTSD (y-axis) by the time of the mental health assessment (x-axis). There were wide ranges of scores for all disorders, more concentrated in the lower severity levels during the entire period (from 1 week to almost four months). For all disorders, a similar pattern of distribution was found through the time of the mental health assessment. Table 3 presents the results of the logistic regression models of the exposure (previous total number of symptoms of COVID-19) for the outcomes (categorical diagnosis of depression, anxiety disorder and PTSD). The exposure was significantly associated with all the outcomes, after adjustment for all confounders.In the sensitivity analysis (Table 4) , these results remained significant after the exclusion of (i) individuals with a short time between baseline and outcome assessment (≥ 14 days), as individuals could be in the late active phase of the COVID-19 disease, (ii) those who progressed to a more severe COVID-19 case, and (iii) those with a previous psychiatric diagnosis. In the final sensitivity analysis (GLM for continuous outcomes), we found a significant relationship between number of COVID-19 symptoms and all the outcomes, with the exception of PTSD when adjusting for lifetime psychiatric disorder (p = 0.053).Four studies in Asia investigated depression and/or anxiety in COVID-19 patients using the same scales used in the present study (Guo et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020 , Zhang et al., 2020 . Prevalence of depression and anxiety varied between 7.4-31.5%.and 6.8-21.0%, respectively (Guo et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020 , Zhang et al., 2020 . All of these studies were conducted in Asia (three in China and one in Vietnam). The prevalence of depression in our study (26.2%) is included within this interval, but anxiety prevalence was greater (22.4%) than previously reported values (6.8-21.0%). Our results were more similar to those found by Zhang et al. (2020), who sampled home-quarantined COVID-19 patients. The lowest depression and anxiety prevalences were found in the Guo et al. (2020) (Lin et al., 2007) . Previous estimates of PTSD levels within Brazil were 8.5% (de Castro Longo et al., 2020) demonstrating that the prevalence of PTSD within individuals presenting with mild COVID-19 is increased in comparison to past estimates.Our results support the hypothesis that the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD were elevated in people with increased number of COVID-19 symptoms at baseline. These findings echo warnings from the previous SARS outbreak, wherein survivors of SARS infections experienced increased psychological distress, persisting one year or more subsequent to the outbreak (Lee et al., 2007) . Similar findings were observed following the occurrence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015, indicating that survivors experienced mental health consequences following the outbreak (Park et al., 2020) . Mental health supports should be strengthened, and healthcare systems must prepare for an influx of individuals experiencing psychological distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the PTSD model, these individuals should be referred to early interventions. Brief interventions of psychoeducation on coping strategies have been effective in promoting mental health among individuals who experienced traumatic life events (Oosterbaan et al., 2019) . Internet-based psychological intervention for acute COVID-19 patients has also been described, and could be an interesting early-intervention tool for those who experience psychological distress during this phase (Wei et al., 2020) .Assessing people for depression, anxiety, and PTSD at different timepoints should be noted as an important limitation of the present study. However, we adjusted all the logistic regression and GLM models to the time of assessment and also conducted sensitivity analyses, excluding those who could potentially be assessed during the acute phase of COVID-19 and testing whether the continuous or categorical version. We were also not able to assess other important behavioral disorders (i.e., substance use and sleep disorders). However, we were able to assess the most prevalent disorders following traumatic experiences in almost a thousand COVID-19 patients, with an acceptable response rate. The patients included in the present study were slightly different from those who did not attend the invitation. Despite being the latter being older, no significant difference was found for the total number of COVID-19 symptoms, which was our exposure measure.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-31,8
1bde9fe9448a43e2175853aaa56af5b046b56bc2,Complete Genome Sequence of an Alphacoronavirus from Common Vampire Bats in Peru,"viruses that naturally circulate in many vertebrates. CoVs are relatively common and genetically diverse in bats and include zoonotic species that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and CoV disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Due to the geographic origin of the most prominent zoonotic CoVs, most knowledge of bat CoVs is derived from Old World species. Nonetheless, comparatively limited sampling has revealed diverse CoVs among bats in North and South America (6) (7) (8) (9) . Additional knowledge of the diversity and distribution of CoVs in these species will aid efforts to understand virus ecology within bat reservoirs, anticipate zoonotic risk, and accelerate identification of reservoir hosts following emergence.We report the genome of an alphacoronavirus from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus, family Phyllostomidae), termed DesRot/Peru/Amazonas/CoV (isolate AMA_L_F). The genome was derived from shotgun sequencing of 10 pooled samples collected with noninvasive rectal swabs from D. rotundus bats from two colonies in Rio Escondido, Amazonas, Peru (ENA accession number ERR2756788) (10) . Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted using a BioSprint One-for-All veterinary kit (Qiagen) and a Kingfisher 96 Flex system. Following DNase I (Ambion) treatment, rRNA depletion (Ribo-Zero; Illumina), and cDNA synthesis (Maxima H Minus first-strand cDNA synthesis kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific), sequencing libraries were prepared using the KAPA DNA library preparation kit for Illumina (Kapa Biosystems). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 system (read length, 150 bp). A total of 17,760,709 raw reads were processed through an in-house pipeline, including quality filtering with Trim Galore v.0.4.0 and prinseq-lite v.0.20.4 (11, 12) , assembly with SPAdes v.3.10.1 (13) , and classification with DIAMOND blastx v.0.8.20 (14) , leading to a genome of 29,097 bp with a mean coverage of 226.7 reads. BLASTn analysis against GenBank showed that the most similar full genome was that of an alphacoronavirus from a microbat (GenBank accession number MK472070.1) (70.7% nucleotide similarity); that virus was used to determine genome termini. The two genomes were of similar initial size (MK472070.1, 28,009 bp; DesRot/Peru/Amazonas/CoV, 29,140 bp), and the new genome aligned over the length of the reference with relatively few gaps (final untrimmed alignment, 29,887 bp). DesRot/Peru/Amazonas/CoV had a GC content (42.9%) and genomic organization of major open reading frames (ORFs) (5=-ORF1a/ORF1ab-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3=) similar to those of other alphacoronaviruses.A 272-amino-acid section of the RdRp gene (5) was aligned with other representative CoVs using MAFFT v.7.017 (15) . Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis performed in RAxML v.8.2.8 (16) , using the LGϩIϩG substitution model identified by ProtTest 3 (17) , showed that the vampire bat sequence was more closely related to other neotropical bat CoVs (96.2% nucleotide similarity, over 816 bp, to the most similar sequence [GenBank accession number JQ731782]) and fell within a clade of alphacoronaviruses from other Phyllostomidae bats (Fig. 1) . Two Brazilian vampire bat sequences, which were within ORF1b but did not overlap completely with the RdRp section used for phylogenetic analysis, were compared to DesRot/Peru/Amazonas/CoV separately, displaying pairwise nucleotide identities of 69.2% over 52 bp (EU236685.1) and 98.1% over 572 bp (KU552072.1). In summary, DesRot/Peru/Amazonas/CoV is a genomic representative of neotropical bat alphacoronaviruses, providing a new resource for understanding the global diversity of CoVs.Data availability. The complete genome sequence for DesRot/Peru/Amazonas/CoV has been deposited in GenBank under accession number MT663548. Raw data were deposited in the ENA under run accession number ERR2756788, experiment accession number ERX2769781, and study accession number PRJEB28138. ",Peru,abstract,2020-08-20,8
3ed8bf25fd39ec959e934fbf26b700f4ecf2de26,Case report COVID-19 in a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient treated with alemtuzumab: insight to the immune response after COVID,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new disease that was first described in Wuhan China (2) and it´s abrupt spread has made the development of countermeasures an urgent global priority (3) . Clinical manifestation typically includes fever, dry cough, fatigue and often pulmonary involvement but these symptoms appears to be mild in the majority of patients. However, about 15% of affected individuals can develop a severe disease with respiratory insufficiency that may require intensive care management (4) . Elderly and patient with comorbidities may be at risk of developing complication (5) .The understanding of its immunopathogenesis is, till now, limited. There is a study on macaques that had shown that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced humoral and cellular immune responses and provided protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after 1 month of the initial infection (3) . At the beginning of the pandemic, different postulated about immunosuppressed patients were made, in one hand it was believed that patients under immunosuppression might be more susceptible to COVID-19 complications. On the other hand, it was proposed that immunosuppression might play a protective role by preventing the overly active immune response that, in some cases, might drive clinical deterioration (6) . Currently, there is evidence on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using ocrelizumab who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and had a similar behavior as general population (7) . The big doubt was if the patients could produce IgG and memory response if their MS treatment was based on depletion of B cells (8, 9) We report a case of COVID-19 in a patient with multiple sclerosis treated with Alemtuzumab (humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody).She is a 24-years old chilean female, left-handed, who works as engineer, her father had multiple sclerosis. In December of 2018 she developed subacute onset of vertigo, diplopia and ataxic syndrome. Brain MRI study was performed and showed multiple demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord that fulfilled criteria of dissemination in time and space with positive oligoclonal bands. Patient was diagnosed with remittent recurrent multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and categorized as highly active disease. She was treated with five days of intravenous methylprednisolone and started her first cycle of Alemtuzumab in January 2019. During April 2019 she had a mild relapse that was also treated with intravenous steroids. At this time, she was diagnosed with mild to moderate depression and started antidepressants. After that, she kept improving physically and mentally.August 2019, eight months after the first cycle of alemtuzumab she had her neurological appointment, her EDSS was cero (0) and the brain and spinal cord MRI showed no new lesions neither enhancing ones.On February 4th, 2020 she had her second cycle of alemtuzumab, well tolerated, no infusion reactions.On May 26th, 2020, the patient developed cough, sore throat and myalgia, she was remitted to the emergency department (ED) to be tested for COVID-19. She lives with her mother, who received the visit of her partner who was COVID-19 positive one week before. At this time she was having her regular blood test for Alemtuzumab that showed normal leucocyte count and grade 1 lymphopenia (4.5 x 10^3/ul, normal range 4.5-11 x 10^3/ul and 0.93 x 10^3/ul range 1-4.8 x 10^3/ul respectively), with a normal urine test. PCR for COVID-19 was performed by nasal swab and tested positive in one sample. Patient was discharged from the emergency department to homequarantine with symptomatic therapy of acetaminophen and levodropropizine for cough with resolution of symptoms in seven to eight days. No fever, dyspnea, diarrhea rash or other complication of this disease was presented. After her quarantine, she was tested for COVID-19 antibodies (qualitative test, immunochromatography) that showed negative IgM and positive IgG.In this report we describe the first case of a Chilean patient under treatment with alemtuzumab that developed COVID-19, without serious complications. We speculate that immunosuppression played a favorable role in this patient, especially because she experienced COVID-19 only 3 months after her second cycle of alemtuzumab, in a period where we know she can be starting to reconstitute the lymphocyte B population (9) , which are mainly naïve B cells, whereas the remaining T cell compartment should be memory cells with a regulatory profile (10) . From the pivotal alemtuzumab studies against interferon, infections were not the main concern thus the autoimmune phenomenon; especially respiratory and urinary infections were mild to moderate (11) . Also, when challenged for vaccines, the study done by McCarthy and her group (10) demonstrated that the circulating B and T cell pool had immunologic memory to common viruses in the form of IgG titers and normal responses to vaccination (T cell dependent and T cell independent recall antigens and a novel antigen) with a lack of evaluation of the T cell response to vaccine and immune response to live vaccines with the bias of the limited number of patients studied. It is important to notice that in this study a patient with ""seroprotective"" antibodies to varicella zoster developed meningitis despite protective IgG levels. Another lesson that we have to consider from the ocrelizumab trial (even though it is another type of treatment that only affects B cells) that patients with reduced population of B cells have a blunted humoral response to vaccines and neoantigen (12).In conclusion, we can say that the patient treated with alemtuzumab can produce IgG against COVID-19. In theory, and based on the studies done on macaques (3, 13) , these patients can deal with coronavirus if they are rechallenged after 1 month but it is uncertain how they will respond if they are rechallenged after 3 months or if they with have an adequate response to the COVID-19 vaccine depending of the type of immune response that this vaccine will need (T cell dependent or T cell independent)",Chile,first author,2020-08-10,8
6aed883b28dfad7beed8be76dde437b60d8234b9,Journal Pre-proof Adenovirus and novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) coinfection: A case report Adenovirus and novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) coinfection: A case report,"The novel coronavirus (SARS CoV2) disease was first reported in the Wuhan province of Hubei, China in December 2019 [1, 2] . This viral infection has affected a total of 6,931,000 population, including 400,857 deaths, across 5 continents and 187 countries (as of June 8, 2020) [3] It has a diverse clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4, 5] . The most important prognostic factors are age ( greater than 65 years), comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction [1, 6, 7] and altered tests such as D-dimer > 1 mcg / ml, LDH> 350 U / L, lymphocyte count less than 800, positive troponin and ferritin greater than 1000 [5, 6] .A 40-year-old man (a merchant by profession from Bogotá, Colombia) was admitted to the emergency department because of the history of odynophagia, dry cough, exertional dyspnea, fever of 39 degrees Celsius, arthralgias and fatigue for a week, without any gastrointestinal symptoms. These clinical symptoms did not improve with paracetamol, and hence he decided to seek further medical help. He had a history of poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin 10.8%), notwithstanding daily insulin treatment with 44 IU of glargine and 16 UI of lispro before each meal. No history of smoking or alcohol consumption was reported. On physical examination, he had a body mass index of 28.3 kg / m2 and vital signs were the following: heart rate 110 beats per minute, 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 82% at ambiance. Right lung rales were also found without cyanosis or lower limb edema. The patient did not have a direct contact with a coronavirus case, but he had worked with public as part of his business.Arterial gases showed moderate oxygen impairment (PAFI 190), and supplemental oxygen was required. Further examination revealed a normal blood count but increased CRP. Right basal ground glass opacity was found during chest x-ray. Later, a positive RT-PCR COVID-19 was reported, and adenovirus was isolated in the respiratory viral panel ( figure 1 ). Owing to poor prognostic factors, the patient had increased lactate dehydrogenase, markedly elevated ferritin, positive D-dimer adjusted by age (Table 1 ) and ground-glass opacities with multilobar involvement on chest tomography, a classic COVID-19 pattern according to the American Society of Radiologists ( Figure  2 ).On the sixth day after admission, he had increased dyspnea, tachypnea and desaturation despite supplemental oxygen, so he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Management with ampicillinsulbactam and clarithromycin was empirically started, and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily) was suggested according to national guidelines. Corrected Qt interval was monitored all the time. Hypotension and hypoxemia developed and did not improve despite using intravenous crystalloids and high flux oxygen, so mechanical ventilation and norepinephrine were started. Septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were diagnosed. Pronation and neuromuscular relaxation cycles were also required, and Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated on blood cultures. Antibiotic escalation to cefepime was indicated, and a 10-day treatment was completed.On day 18, successful extubation was achieved, and he was transferred to the general floor. The symptoms resolved, and the second RT-PCR SARS Cov2 report was negative. He was discharged on the twentieth day after admission, and the follow-up appointments revealed supplemental oxygen requirement at home.We report a case of SARS-Cov2 and adenovirus coinfection, which further developed into acute respiratory distress syndrome. ICU stay was required, and clinical improvement was achieved by using hydroxychloroquine as per the local guidelines, [11] . The exact time of coinfection could not be established, and additional poor prognostic factor to the development of severe disease added to patient´s comorbidities and reported tests [1, 6] .SARS-Cov2 and other respiratory viruses´ coinfection are unusual. It is seen in 3.2% to 22.4% cases [8, 10] . The most common coinfections reported are enterovirus / rhinovirus 6.9% and syncytial respiratory virus 5.2%. [10, 12] . A few case reports of influenza A, influenza B, metapneumovirus and seasonal coronaviruses such as Cov-HKU [9, 10] can also be found in the literature, but coinfection with adenovirus has only been documented in 2 patients [13] .The pathophysiological dynamics of SARS-Cov2 coinfection is not clear. There are some hypotheses about the relatively low presentation of SARS-Cov2 virus, , without a predisposing higher risk factor [8, 14] . It was documented in descriptive studies that with coinfection, a greater proportion of the patients had ARDS and septic shock and required an ICU admission [10, 14] .Chest tomography can show additional radiological findings, which are difficult to interpret [10] . Further laboratory findings revealed some differences such as greater lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in coinfected patients. It is not known whether it is the cause or consequence of this coinfection [10, 12, 14] .Although coinfection is not common, in cases with severe disease or CT findings that are not explained by COVID-19 infection [11, 14, 15] , additional studies such as nested PCR for respiratory germs are required to detect potentially treatable pathogens, such as mycoplasma or influenza virus [14] .Larger and better designed prospective analytical studies are required to determine further risk factors, clinical impact, prognosis, and the prevalence of SARS-Cov2 and another respiratory pathogen coinfection.Although SARS-Cov2 coinfection with other respiratory viruses is rare, it is associated with a worse clinical outcome. The possibility of treatable pathogens must always be ruled out even if it is a very rare coinfection such as Covid-19 and adenovirus.THAT we have contributed directly to the intellectual content of the manuscript; therefore we are in a position to make ourselves publicly responsible for it and we accept our names included in the list of authors.THAT the work is original and unpublished and that it will not be sent to other journals while awaiting the decision of publication of the editors after completing the editorial process of publication of the IDcases journal THAT for the creation of the article, no copyright or intellectual property rights of third parties have been violated.

eb446611f8c2a3c382a56d4ed65fc07238abeed4,O R I G I N A L R E S E A R C H Airway First-attempt intubation success and complications in patients with COVID-19 undergoing emergency intubation,"Conclusion: Emergency physicians achieve high success rates when intubating COVID19 patients, although complications are frequent. However, these findings should be considered provisional until their generalizability is assessed in their institutions and setting.COVID-19, emergency physician, intubationPatients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may become critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 1 Deciding when a patient with severe COVID-19 should receive endotracheal intubation is an essential component of care. 1 As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the world, teams must develop airway management strategies that protect both patients and staff. 2 In many settings, emergency physicians are responsible for airway management of acutely ill COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department. 3 Emergency intubation of critically ill patients carries complication rates of over 40% in some series. 4 An alarmingly high percentage of patients suffer an associated cardiac arrest. [5] [6] Numerous factors may contribute to this, including hypoxemia and arterial hypotension before intubation. 6 The current scientific literature reports on the additional difficulties that COVID-19 represents to securing the airway.Among the difficulties are performing the procedure using full personal protective equipment and reports of rapidly desaturating patients.Unfortunately, early data suggest high mortality in this subset of patients. 7ED intubation techniques for critically ill patients are largely extrapolated from operating room practice. 4 Despite insufficient or no data for many aspects, there are important differences between elective non-COVID-19 and emergency COVID-19 intubation, such as the risk to the patient of aspiration, desaturation, or hypotension and the risk of difficult laryngoscopy to medical personnel, who should wear personal protective equipment including an N95 respirator, goggles, and plastic face shields. 4,7The objective of this study was to evaluate the first-attempt success rates and complications of endotracheal intubation of COVID-19 patients by emergency physicians. We enrolled patients consecutively admitted to the ED with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 submitted to endotracheal intubation. We considered patients with compatible clinical and computed tomography findings suspect for COVID-19. We either confirmed COVID-19with nasopharyngeal or tracheal secretion reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We used a Macintosh laryngoscope blade, either direct or videolaryngoscopy. No patients were excluded.Our preoxygenation strategy consisted mainly of 5 minutes of tidal volume breathing of 100% oxygen with a tightly fitted nonrebreather shut down just before removing the mask to reduce aerosolization. All patients were intubated with SpO2 >93% after preoxygenation. Also, to reduce aerosolization, we avoided the nasal cannula for apneic oxygenation.We used wave capnography to confirm all intubations. If the initial intubation attempt was unsuccessful, we used a supraglottic airway fitted with a HEPA filter, connected directly to a ventilator, or bag-valve mask, for rescue ventilation in all cases.The primary outcome was first-attempt intubation success, defined as successful endotracheal tube placement with the first device passed (endotracheal tube) during the first laryngoscope insertion confirmed with capnography. If the endotracheal tube was not inserted into the mouth during the first laryngoscope insertion, the attempt was counted as a failure.Secondary outcomes included the following complications:hypotension, hypoxemia, aspiration, and esophageal intubation.Hypotension was defined by a decrease of 30 mmHg or more in systolic blood pressure or a mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg after the procedure. Hypoxemia was defined as an oxyhemoglobin saturation <90%.Unplanned subgroup analyses were performed for variables of clinical interest. These analyses were exploratory in nature, and a test of interaction for each subgroup was performed. Missing data were left as such; imputation was not performed.We used the 2-tailed Student's t test and Kruskal-Wallis test for parametric and non-parametric values, respectively. Data were analyzed using were in Stata 13 software (College Station, Texas, USA). The primary outcome, first-attempt intubation success, was achieved in 82% of patients. Among the 20 patients who were not intubated on the first attempt, 75% were intubated on the second attempt and 20% on the third attempt; cricothyrotomy was performed in 1 patient. The first attempt success rate was 85% in senior and 76% in junior physicians (P = 0.5). These subsequent rescue attempts used a bougie or laryngeal mask or were performed with the most experienced emergency physician available. This study has several limitations. First, as data were obtained at a single institution, findings may not be generalizable. Second, interpretation of the results of this study is limited by the small size of the cohort, the relatively short duration of follow-up, and potential missing data owing to the nature of the program, Third, there was no standardized approach to emergency intubation among attending physicians. Forth, studies show that videolaryngoscopy increases the rate of first attempt intubation in the ED; 8 however, in our study, use of the videolaryngoscope was not associated with first-attempt intubation. We believe this may have occurred because the device was first acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ED staff did not have enough practice, with team members still on the learning curve.We report a cohort of 112 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection or suspicion of COVID-19 (due to compatible clinical and radiological findings) who needed emergency intubation and analyzed success rates for firstattempt intubation by emergency physicians, as well as complications. Hypoxemia occurred in 52% patients. Patients who experienced hypoxemia received non-invasive ventilation and had a lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio post-intubation, which suggests that the indication for intubation was established late, with greater pulmonary impairment.Three patients (2%) had esophageal intubation. In the first case, performed under direct laryngoscopy, this was rapidly identified because of the absence of a capnography curve; a laryngeal mask was passed, the patient was ventilated, and the second attempt at intubation was successful. In the second and third cases, performed via videolaryngoscopy, the bougie passed through the vocal cords, but resistance was encountered when passing the tube over the tube introducer, presumably from the tip catching on the arytenoid cartilages. The bougie was inadvertently removed, patients desaturated and went into cardiorespiratory arrest, which was reversed after a second attempt at orotracheal intubation.In conclusion, first-attempt intubation success was obtained in 82% of patients. Emergency intubation of COVID-19 patients is associated with a high risk of complications. Most complications occurred when the airway was managed by trainees or less experienced physicians. However, these findings should be considered provisional until their generalizability is assessed in other institutions and settings.",Brazil,first author,2020-08-12,8
61b32ac8d0c4bc43cb9b22a58891a30bd540fd56,Disability inclusiveness of government responses to COVID-19 in South America: a framework analysis study,"During the initial phase of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the virus was often referred to as the 'great leveller' that collapsed differences between people, exposing them to the same risks. This myth was soon debunked: far from being a great leveller, the pandemic has exacerbated inequalities, with protection against the risk of infection, access to treatment, and impacts of public health measures disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations, including the poor, people in precarious employment, people living with chronic conditions, and people belonging to ethnic minorities [1, 2] . Disabled people are particularly exposed to the risks of the pandemic, as well as to the measures taken to address it, and their impact [3] [4] [5] . In this article, we examine official government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in four South American countries -Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peruwith the aim of exploring the extent and forms of disability inclusion in government responses to COVID-19. While the existence of a state discourse in the form of legislation, or other form of official government response, does not preclude the existence of disability-based discrimination, it affords disabled people legal recognition and protection of their rights, and as such, its importance cannot be underestimated.There are 1 billion disabled people globally [6] , including over a third of people over 60, the age group with the highest COVID-19 mortality. Disabled people face the effects of structural disadvantage, leading to increased barriers to accessing healthcare, despite increased health needs [7, 8] , and increased rates of poverty, lower literacy levels, lower insurance coverage rates, and lower employment compared with the general population [6] . Disabled people may be exposed to an increased risk of contracting the virus because they cannot always maintain the physical distancing measures, especially if they require personal assistance. They are at particular risk from responses to COVID-19, due to interrupted social support and lack of accessible communication, among other factors [1] . They are also more likely to become severely ill due to COVID-19, since many disabled people live with other underlying conditions, such as heart problems, diabetes, and respiratory illness. Nevertheless, there are widespread concerns that disabled people may be less likely to receive needed lifesaving treatment and that they may be disproportionately affected by the measures taken by several governments to control the pandemic [3, 4] .On May 22, 2020 , the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that the epicentre of the pandemic had moved to South America. COVID- 19 cases have now been detected in all countries in South America [9] , with Brazil and Peru being particularly affected [10] , putting already overstretched healthcare systems under particular strain [11] [12] [13] (see Table 1 ). More than 70 million disabled people live in Latin America and the Caribbean region, and they are among the most excluded parts of the population, with high levels of poverty and unemployment [14] . The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) highlights disabled people as being at increased risk of being impacted by the pandemic, and by the measures taken to address it [15] .Some governments in the region, and globally, have linked disability to an inherent vulnerability and poorer chances of survival, to justify discrimination in the form of differential access to services. Furthermore, there is a high gap in disability prevalence between income quintiles, with disability being more prevalent among poor people. This gap widens with age, which is when people might lose social protections associated with employment, such as insurance [16] . A large percentage of the population (over 30% in Brazil, and around 20% in Argentina) live in precarious or segregated housing, often in urban slums, such as favelas in Brazil or villas de emergencia in Argentina [16] . Public health recommendations for physical distancing and hand-washing are often not realistic for slum residents, including disabled people, who may lack personal space and necessities, such as clean water. Overcrowded prisons, where disabled people are overrepresented [4] , poorly resourced residential care (often acting as zones of social abandonment [17] ), and a large population of indigenous people suffering the effects of discrimination [18] , further complicate the situation, as does the ongoing dengue fever outbreak [12] , particularly affecting Brazil. All these factors might disadvantage even further people who already have limited ways to protect themselves.While article 11 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) stipulates that member states should take ""all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk"" [19] , there have been widespread reports of disabled people facing problems accessing treatment for COVID-19 while many of the public health measures implemented to contain the virus are not taking into account the needs of disabled people. Catalina Devandas, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, stated that disabled people feel that governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have nor considered their needs, leading to measures that might exacerbate disabled people's exclusion from society [20] .We conducted a documentary approach-based study [21] , using framework analysis to examine the official governmental responses to COVID-19 [22] . We focused on four South American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, which have a collective population of about 305 million people, accounting for over 72% of the total population of South America. Chile is a highincome country while the other three are upper middleincome countries [23] .We used sources published from February 1st until May 22, 2020, in the form of documents from the agencies coordinating the COVID-19 response and relevant governmental bodies. These documents were treated as raw data sources. We looked at decisions taken by national and federal governments, but not at those by local, provincial, or State governments. We included documents reporting measures that affected disabled people either directly (measures specifically designed for disabled people) or indirectly (measures not designed specifically for disabled people but that have an impact on their life). Information was accessed by reviewing reports, legislation, decrees, and other official documents that communicated measures taken in response to the pandemic. To locate these sources, we searched the websites of the ministries responsible for health, employment, social support, and transportation of the included countries, and also the COVID-19-related government websites for each country. Information was also accessed through the governmental bodies responsible for disability-related matters, and through the government gazettes.We also included sources in the form of reports and other communications by disabled people's organisations and reports by the WHO, the United Nations, and ECLAC. Information collated about measures implemented by each country was triangulated with information on country-specific measures collected by ECLAC. No discrepancies or omissions were noted as a result of this process.We accessed all sources in their original language, which was Portuguese for documents from Brazil, Spanish for sources from all other countries, and English or Spanish for sources from international organisations (see Supplementary material 1).We conducted a framework analysis of documents. This method is often used in applied qualitative research with the aim to influence policy. Based on a thematic framework identified from existing literature and informed by the data, framework analysis identifies commonalities and differences in the data, and then focuses on establishing patterns [22] . Analysis involved the following five steps:1. Familiarisation, preliminary reading/ research notes: In this step, we did an initial reading of the data set and also of related literature on disability inclusion. 2. Identifying a thematic framework: Ritchie and Spencer describe this step as ""beginning the process of abstraction and conceptualisation"" ( [22] :179). We developed a framework based on guidelines for disability inclusion during COVID-19 issued by the following organisations: ECLAC [3] , the International Labour Organisation [24] , the Ibero-American General Secretariat (Secretaría General Iberoamericana) [25] , the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights [4] , and the World Health Organisation [26] . Table 2 presents the thematic framework we developed from the synthesis of the different recommendations (see Supplementary material 2 for the full list). 3. Indexing: We applied the thematic framework to the entire dataset, looking for information for each of the areas, while carefully considering whether any adjustments needed to be made to the framework, based on the data. 4. Charting: In this stage, we extracted information that was relevant and inserted it into a matrix based on the thematic framework. We included both disability inclusion and exclusion-related information. 5. Mapping: In the last step, we looked at patterns across the dataset, focusing on the nature and extent of disability inclusion.We analysed 72 documents (Supplementary material 1). The findings illustrate the extent to which measures taken by four South American countries are disabilityinclusive. Table 3 presents the government responses in each country. There was a wide range of policies implemented as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic but not all of these policies explicitly considered the needs of disabled people. Peru was the only country that voted legislation specifically protecting the rights of disabled people during the pandemic and ensuring their equal treatment in health, employment, education, social protection and other areas, with explicit reference to the CRPD. Several countries published recommendations for a disability-inclusive response to COVID-19, but these often either remained recommendations (especially in Brazil), without being translated into policy, or they put the responsibility on individual rather than state actors, asking people to protect themselves and others, without addressing disabled people's needs. This is exemplified by policies in all four countries asking disabled people to shield, without always measures taken to ensure this is feasible. In Brazil and Chile, this was also evident for care home residents, who despite being particularly vulnerable to the risk of COVID-19 infection and death [27] , were not protected by legislation or decisions from the central government, but only by recommendations. Concerning health, Argentina and Peru took measures to protect disabled people's continued access to healthcare, through enabling telehealth and/or ensuring COVID-19-related services were offered free of charge. Peru introduced measures to monitor the well-being of disabled people in the community, thus ensuring not only access to health, but also protection from violence. Other countries either did not take any measures to Table 2 Thematic framework Area ExplanationProvision of all information in accessible formats, including sign language translation, Braile script, and easy read.Access to healthcare Removal of financial barriers to care, and measures taken to ensure equitable access to healthcare, including measures addressing disability-based discrimination.Measures taken to ensure remote learning is fully accessible.Provision of financial support (e.g. cash transfers or benefits), to disabled people and their family members, if they had to stop working, and measures taken to ensure access to financial support, including automatic extension of disability benefits.Measures taken to ensure people living in residential care are protected from infection.Adjustments to public health measures to accommodate the needs of disabled people, including flexibility in restrictions on movement in public spaces.Measures taken to protect disabled people who are in increased risk of social exclusion and poverty, such as women, children, homeless people and prisoners.Inclusion to decision making process Inclusion of disabled people and their representative organisations to advisory and decisionmaking bodies. unilaterally impose these measures 59 .Recommendations for:• Prohibition of all visits 14 .• Suspension of all therapeutic and recreative outings 14 .• Obligatory self-isolation in their room for those residents who return to the facility 14 .• Suspected cases need to be referred to health system within 2 h of identifying them, and residents need to be moved to secondary care 14 .• Recommendations for preventive actions in institutions for elderly people, including suggestions of visiting restrictions 37 .Recommendations for:• Prohibition of all visits 52 .• Suspension of health appointments, unless they are necessary 52 .• Suspected cases need to be referred to health system and remain physically isolated 52 .• Prohibition of all visits 68,69 .• Disabled people, who are registered as disabled, and their carers, are able to go for brief walks at a distance of up to 500 m from their houses up to three times a week, without needing a special permission 1, 9 .• Recommendations published by many organizations and universities, but no formal government policy. enable people' access, or took measures that could have a detrimental impact on healthcare access. For example, the Explicit Guarantees in Health (GES) programme in Chile, which removes financial barriers of access to health for people diagnosed with certain chronic conditions [28] , was suspended for one month, without a strategy to ensure continued access to healthcare. On a positive note, in Chile during the quarantine, people have been able to attend a doctor's appointment at a health establishment using a special permit with a time limit of up to 12 h; in this case, they can be accompanied by one person. Measures, such as ensuring priority access for testing of disabled people and their carers, were not widely observed.Regarding financial support measures, there was divergence between countries. We found examples of good practice, like the automatic renewal of disability registrations in Argentina and their inclusion in the extra cash transfers programme, and the possibility of self-certification in Peru, or remote registration in Brazil. In Chile, disabled people who received a disability pension were not entitled to the COVID-19 cash transfer that was meant to help the most vulnerable parts of the population. Furthermore, none of these four countries acknowledged the extra costs associated with disability, and how these might be further increased as a result of the pandemic (for example, due to the need to buy antiseptic products and face masks, or due to the inability to access usual ways of support).Concerning education, several countries attempted to ensure continuity of education provisions. A good example of such practice was the law regarding educational provision in Peru, which made explicit provisions for disabled students. We also observed the existence of measures with opposing effects; Argentina, for example, ensured continuity of education provision through the use of online platforms (or hard copies of educational material where necessary), but at the same time significantly reduced the hours of educational support students are entitled to. Furthermore, while some countries had cash transfer programmes to help with adjustments, like equipment needs, others did not, affecting continued accessible educational provision.Social inequalities and underfunded healthcare systems make South American countries vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic [29] . Disabled people are especially exposed to the effects of the pandemic, and to the ensuing socio-economic repercussions [15] . This study illustrates how the official government responses taken by four countries in the region do not fully address the needs of disabled people, thus further disadvantaging them. We have also seen positive steps that have been taken by these countries, in an attempt to protect the rights of disabled people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in some instances, there is a discrepancy between central government policy and actual practice at the state or local levels (e.g. in Brazil), where measures implemented for the benefit of vulnerable groups, such as disabled people, may be contrary to the central government discourse.Even where appropriate measures are available, they do not benefit all disabled people. In many countries in South America, disabled people need to be registered with a governmental agency, which certifies their status as disabled people, thus giving them access to an array of benefits. Such registration, however, is often incomplete and many disabled people are not officially registered, either because they are not eligible, the procedure is inaccessible, complicated (for example, requiring documents that people may not have), or for other reasons. Therefore, many people are excluded from several of the measures established by governments to protect disabled people. Already at increased risk to face multidimensional poverty [30] , disabled people in South America might be inadequately protected against the risk of further impoverishment as a result of the economic consequences of COVID-19.This study highlights how state mechanisms still consider disability as a personal matter. This is exemplified by measures in several countries, pointing to the need for disabled people and their families to protect themselves, to shield from the outside world, without always measures taken (e.g. cash transfers, continued access to social support, benefits, education, and health) to ensure their needs are met and their rights are protected. The different policies reportedwhile beneficial-do not constitute a collective matter of state responsibility. Disability becomes an individual responsibility; this individualisation exposes the most vulnerable parts of the population to the risk of poverty, and compromises their right to education, and lack of access to healthcare, by The barriers disabled people face when they seek to access healthcare are well-documented: long waiting times, discrimination, high costs, and transportation issues [32] , even in countries in the region with universal health coverage [33] . Neoliberal reforms in several countries have disproportionately affected access to health for disabled people [34] . These issues are likely to become more acute due to the pandemic, with a higher probability that disabled people across the world, who are often precariously employed, becoming unemployed [3, 15, 35] , and thus losing benefits such as insurance.The intersectional nature of the disadvantage many disabled people face has not been adequately recognised and it has not informed policy. For example, while the intersections between disability and poverty, and disability and indigeneity are well-known [6] , very few measures addressed this issue. Gender violence affects disabled women, but they might not be able to remove themselves from a dangerous situation, and assistance mechanisms may not be accessible to them. As illustrated by the few COVID-19-related welfare system measures implemented, social vulnerability is not at the top of the policy emergency agenda in South America. This is an indication of the historical presence of the neoliberal model in the region, according to which the role of the state should be minimal, thus leading to the formulation of poor policy responses for the protection of vulnerable groups, including disabled people, especially in the face of emergencies.The CRPD was signed by 163 countries around the world, including all countries in South America; most of them (including the four countries in this study) have ratified it. Despite positive steps taken by many countries, it is a matter of concern to observe that several years after the ratification of the convention, and in the face of a pandemic, the rights of disabled people are not fully respected, and their needs are not fully considered by those state mechanisms responsible for the welfare of all citizens. Furthermore, and despite an explicit recommendation by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (equality target 17.18) for data disaggregated by disability, there is still no data available about the impact of COVID-19 on disabled people, including serious illness and death rates. To ensure that the measures taken by governments do not actively discriminate or put at an increased risk disabled people, it is important to disaggregate data and attend to the circumstances of those constructed as 'vulnerable'.The existence of official government response in the form of legislation is important for two main reasons: firstly, it affords public recognition for the parts of the population that are included therein, in the sense that they are named and thus become visible; secondly, it provides recognition and protection of the rights of disabled people, giving access to disabled people to ways to claim their rights (exemplified by the increasing judicialisation of healthcare in Brazil and Chile [36] ). While there may be a gap between state discourse and actual practice, the existence of such a discourse provides disabled people with mechanisms to demand their rights.The methods of data collection via official channels of information dissemination (for example, government gazettes) ensured the authenticity of all documents. This method of data collection also provided information on the provenance of all documents, ensuring a clear audit trail. In this study, we only looked at the national or federal government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on legislation and other forms of state discourse. This meant that forms of disability exclusion (and inclusion) that were organised at the other levels of administration (e.g. by specific municipalities or states, in countries with a federal structure), or by the third sector, were not included. Furthermore, we did not look specifically at medical bias against disabled people and ableism in medical and scientific practice, neither to bioethical responses to disability and COVID-19. We only used documents that were available online. However, all four countries included in the study are legally obliged to publish online all legislation, official decrees, and other information that is considered as public.Most countries have published guides for disability inclusion in the COVID-19 response, but these often do not translate into practice. Action, in collaboration with disabled people, is needed. Disabled people and their representative organisations need to be involved in the decision-making process.As Kuper and Heydt argue [32] , a twin track approach is needed: disabled people need to be considered both in mainstream policy and in disability-specific policy, on issues such as communication and information sharing, education, health, employment, and social support.Disabled people need to be included in the medium and long-term plans once the immediate crisis subsides. Several countries in Europe have already announced plans to allow coffee shops and other food and drink business to use up public space, such as pavements, without special permit; if this were to happen it could further disadvantage disabled people, who will find that urban landscapes become even more inaccessible. Recovery efforts need to be inclusive [37] , so that disabled people are not further disadvantaged.Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s12939-020-01244-x.

b7f1cddcbebc2a0567aa495355db909ac03d6681,Journal Pre-proof The Use of Mouthwashes against COVID-19 in Dentistry The Use of Mouthwashes against COVID-19 in Dentistry,"Antiseptic mouthwashes have been widely used as a standard measure before routine dental treatment, especially before surgery. [1, 2] It plays an essential role in reducing the number of microorganisms in the oral cavity. [3] Recent publications have suggested that rinsing the oral cavity may control and reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. [4, 5] However, specific evidence for the safety and efficacy of the use of antiseptic mouthwashes in COVID-19 positive patients is lacking and unclear. Thus, this article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current recommendations on the use of mouthwashes against COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of most conventional antiseptic mouthwashes used in dentistry.Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped RNA viruses that present a typical structure with the ""spike protein"" in its membrane envelope. [6, 7] The interaction between this protein and Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors is responsible for the entrance of the virus into cells [8] .The distribution of ACE2 receptors in different parts of the body may indicate possible routes of infection. [9, 10] The membrane-bound of ACE2 is found in different tissue cells, including mucosal tissues, gingiva, non-keratinizing squamous epithelium, in epithelial cells of the tongue and salivary glands. [8, 11] Moreover, high SARS-CoV-2 viral load has been detected in saliva samples [6, 12] , and it has even been suggested its presence in periodontal pockets. [13] These findings agree with previous investigations that have suggested that virus transmission can be closely connected with saliva interactions [14, 15] making oral tissues a possible reservoir from which SARS-CoV-2 transmission may occur during coughing, sneezing, talking, and even during dental care. [1, 12, 16] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fMouthwashes are widely used solutions for rinsing the mouth, especially before oral surgery due to their ability to reduce the number of microorganisms in the oral cavity [1, 2] and colony-forming units in dental aerosols. [3] Although there is still no clinical evidence that the use of mouthwashes could prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the American Dental Association (ADA) [17] and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [18] have recommended the use of preprocedural mouthwashes before oral procedures.CHX is a broad-spectrum antiseptic that acts against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, aerobes, facultative anaerobes, and fungus by increasing the permeability of the bacterial cell wall, causing its lysis. [19, 20] It is used in dentistry to reduce dental plaque and treat periodontal disease. [21] Evidence indicates an in-vitro effect against lipid-enveloped viruses as influenza A, parainfluenza, herpesvirus 1, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B. [22] Although COVID-19 is an enveloped virus, 0.12% CHX gluconate was suggested to have less or no effect against coronaviruses when compared to other mouthwashes. [1, 23, 24] However, Yoon et al. [6] found SARS-CoV-2 suppression for 2 hours after using 15ml 0.12% CHX once, suggesting that its use would be beneficial for the control of COVID-19 transmission.H2O2 has been used in dentistry alone or combined with salts since the start of the century. [25] As a mouthwash, H2O2 is an odourless, clear, and colourless liquid. [26] Lack of adverse soft tissue J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f effect was found in many studies of 1% to 1.5% H2O2 used as a daily rinse over two years followup. [27, 28] An in vitro study found that 3% H2O2 within 1 to 30 minutes effectively inactivated adenovirus types 3 and 6, adeno-associated virus type 4, rhinoviruses 1A, 1B, and type 7, myxoviruses, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, strain long, and coronavirus strain 229E discovering that coronaviruses and influenza viruses were the most sensitive. [29] Since SARS-CoV2 is vulnerable to oxidation, preprocedural mouthrinses containing oxidative agents such as 1% H2O2have been suggested to reduce the salivary viral load. [4, 17] Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC)CPC is a quaternary ammonium compound that is safe for use in humans. [30, 31] 0.05% CPC has been used to reduce dental plaque and gingivitis [32] as an alternative in patients who develop mucosal irritation and stains related to CHX. [33] The antiviral effect of CPC has been demonstrated in influenza patients, significantly reducing the duration and severity of cough and sore throat. [31, 34] Hypotheses about a possible action over SARS-CoV-2 are based on its lysosomotropic mechanism of action and its ability to destroy viral capsids. [35] These findings indicate that CPC could be effective against other enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses.Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a water-soluble iodine complex that has been widely used as a presurgical skin antiseptic and as a mouthwash. [36] It is typically used in a 1% concentration [37] for mucositis, prophylaxis of oropharyngeal infections, and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Its antimicrobial action occurs after free iodine dissociates from polyvinylpyrrolidone.Then, iodine rapidly penetrates microbes to disrupt proteins and oxidizes nucleic acid structures J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f causing microbial death. [38, 39] Previously studies have shown that PVP-I has higher virucidal activity than other commonly used antiseptic agents, including CHX and benzalkonium chloride. [40] It is safe, reporting a prevalence of 0.4% allergy cases [41] , does not produce tooth/tongue discolouration or taste disturbances [42] and, unlike alcohol-based products, can be used when using electrocautery. [43] Its effectiveness has been well demonstrated through many in vitro studies against multiple viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus A (H1N1). [36, 40, 44] Recent investigations have proposed that 0.23% PVP-I mouthwash for at least 15 seconds before procedures may reduce saliva viral load [44] , indicating its use in COVID-19 positive patients. [4, 38, 45, 46] Gently gargles for 30 seconds in the oral cavity and 30 seconds in the back of the throat with: 15ml H2O2 at 1.5% [17] Error!

The virus has rapidly spread to almost every country in the world, causing more than 12 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 and over 500,000 deaths the first week of July 2020 (Coronavirus Resourse Center 2020). Severe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure is the most common adverse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults (Wu and McGoogan 2020) . Children are less infected by the virus compared to other age groups, and most of them are asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms (Castagnoli et al. 2020; Dong et al. 2020; Xia et al. 2020) .Recently, pediatricians from Europe (Riphagen et al. 2020; Verdoni et al. 2020; Whittaker et al. 2020 ) and North America (Kaushik et al. 2020 WHO 2020). Since then, several groups have reported a series of similarly affected children in different regions, albeit not yet from Latin America (Cheung et al. 2020; Feldstein et al. 2020; Licciardi et al. 2020 ).Chile is a high-income Latin American country (according to the current World Bank classification 2020) with a population of near 19 million inhabitants. As of July 4th, 2020, a total of 330,183 COVID-19 cases had been reported, representing the sixth and third highest incidence rate worldwide and in South America respectively (Coronavirus Resourse Center 2020), with a case fatality rate of 2.2%. Most cases (77%) have been reported in the Metropolitan Region (population near 8 million), where Santiago is situated, of which 4.8% have been children younger than 15 years (Ministry of Health (MINSAL), Chile, 2020). Chilean children, similar to other regions, have had milder symptoms and have been less likely hospitalized when compared to adults, representing less than 5% of the total hospitalization rate (MINSAL 2020). Total cases increased to over 4,000 per day during May (May 20th) and similar to other latitudes (Hennon et al. 2020; Verdoni et al. 2020; Whittaker et al. 2020) , pediatricians began to report severe cases of a hyperinflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in pediatric hospitals of Santiago two to four weeks after the peak of acute infections.The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of hospitalized children who met criteria for MIS-C in Santiago, Chile.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fOverall study design. This is an observational, retrospective and prospective study including After signed informed consent from parents and informed assent from children of 14 years or older, data collection was performed and managed by a researcher at each center, previously trained in data entry, using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile (Harris et al. 2009 (Harris et al. , 2019 . Variables recorded from admission to discharge were extracted from the clinical records assuring anonymity and confidentiality and included: a) demographics: age, gender, nationality; b) medical history for comorbidities e.g. chronic heart or respiratory disease, primary or secondary immunosuppression, diabetes, hypertension, allergies, obesity and cancer. Obesity was defined according to the WHO child growth standards: for infants using weight/age ratio and for children and teens with body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95 th percentile according to age and sex (Whitlock et al. 2005) c) physical examination: symptoms/signs at admission: vital signs, weight/height, fever, cough, runny nose, dyspnea, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea and myalgia; d) laboratory tests: Case definition. The MIS-C definition provided by the Center for disease Control (CDC) of the United States, was used in the study, which considers the following criteria: an individual aged <21 years presenting with fever (temperature > 38.0 ° C for ≥24 hours, or report of subjective fever lasting ≥24 hours), laboratory evidence of inflammation (including, but not limited to, one or more of the following): an elevated CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen, procalcitonin, D-dimer, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), or interleukin 6 (IL-6), elevated neutrophils, reduced lymphocytes and low albumin and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization, with multisystem (2 or more) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic or neurological); lack of an alternative plausible diagnoses; positivity for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test, or exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fA total of 220 pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were admitted in the hospitals included in our study between May 8 and June 24, 2020 (HRR= 92; HLCM= 62; HEGC= 66).During this period, 27 cases met MIS-C's definition (CDC 2020): 16 were hospitalized in the HRR, 9 in the HEGC, and 2 in the HLCM (Table 1 ). According to the national weekly surveywhich includes 25 Chilean hospitals and clinics-to date June 28, a total of 42 cases of MIS-C were reported. Thus, the 27 cases included in this study represented 64% of the national casuistic. (2020). The median age was 6 years, and 14 out of 27 cases were male (52%). The nationality of parents was Chilean in 85% of cases. Venezuelan (n=2), Haitian (n=1) andPeruvian (n=1) parents were also registered. A 26% had comorbidities including: overweight or obesity (n=4), asthma (n=1), primary immunodeficiency, GATA 3 deficiency (n=1), prematurity, gestational age of 33 weeks (n=1).Fever was the first sign in 22 cases (82%), and the median length of symptoms before admission was 4 days (2 to 9 days). Overall, in addition to fever -which is included in the definition of MIS-C-the most common clinical presentations were gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea (63%) and abdominal pain (63%); followed by clinical features of KD which were present in 18 patients. However, although 67% of patients presented at least one KD symptom, only 4 cases met the complete KD criteria. From the 18 patients presenting KD clinical features, 8 cases (44%) required vasoactive drugs, the same proportion that was detected in patients with no KD signs or symptoms (4/9, 44%). Similar clinical presentation was observed between cases that required admission to the PICU, and those who stayed in the basic ward units. From the 5 cases with negative SARS-CoV-2 study, 4 had been in close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 1 with suspected cases (family). After clinical anamnesis, 9 cases (33%) mentioned an epidemiological link with a COVID-19 patient.At admission, laboratory parameters were compatible with acute inflammation in most children, with increased D-dimer (>1.0 ug/mL) and CRP (>100 mg/L) in 16/20 and 20/27 individuals respectively. Also, lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count <1,500 per uL) was detected in 16/27 patients. As shown in Table 1 , after comparisons between cases according to the requirement of intensive care admission we found significantly lower albumin in the severe patients.More than half of the children (59%) required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). In those cases, disease was characterized by lower hemoglobin and albumin levels and platelet counts. Also, higher D-dimer levels were found in patients who required PICU (Table 2) .Antimicrobials were prescribed in 73% and 100% of patients treated in the hospital ward and PICU, respectively (Table 2) Additionally, in two cases a cytokine storm syndrome was suspected and interleukin-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab) was administered.Median hospitalization stay was 12 days for PICU patients and 6 days for children treated in the hospital ward of which 3 patients remain hospitalized at the time of this report. Oxygen support was required in 13 patients (all but one in the PICU), and mechanical ventilation was required in 12 cases. In the latter, duration of MV was a median of 5 days, ranging from 2 to 6. Also, 12 patients required inotropic support in the ICU. No deaths occurred in this group of patients (Table 2) .During the first day from admission, 26 patients were evaluated with echocardiography. Normal findings were achieved in 18 cases, but myocardial dysfunction (e.g. left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction below 60%, diastolic dysfunction, or regional wall motion abnormalities) and/or coronary arteries abnormalities (e.g. refringence or increased z-score) were detected in 8 patients (31%) ( Table 3) . Consecutive echocardiographic evaluations were performed in all patients and abnormalities were detected in 4 additional cases. Thus, a total of 12 patients (12/26; 46%), presented pericardial effusion (3/26; 11%), and/or myocardial dysfunction (4/26; 15%), and/or coronary arteries abnormalities (5/12; 19%): 9 from cases who required PICU, and 3 from the milder group.As shown in Figure 1A , most of the cases (23/27) occurred after the 22 nd epidemiological week (after May 30 th , 2020), with a similar increase slope to the rise in RT-PCR positivity rate that occurred 4 weeks before. Thus, the positivity of SARS-CoV-2 tests increased from 12% to near 30% between the 18 th and 21 st weeks and remained higher than 25% for 4 weeks. Moreover, 25 of the 27 MIS-C cases were children from the northern and southern areas in Santiago, who were hospitalized in HRR and HEGC, respectively ( Figure 1B) . This was coincident with the higher cumulative case rates observed in the northern and southern areas of the Metropolitan Region, as shown in Figure 1C .We report one of the first series of patients from a Latin American country with MIS-C, of which 59% required admission to a PICU with no deaths. MIS-C cases occurred approximately one month after the peak of COVID-19, similar to reports in the northern hemisphere. In France (Belot et al. 2020 ), a series of 79 confirmed cases of MIS-C were reported 4 to 5 weeks after the peak of COVID-19 cases, as observed in Santiago, Chile. In addition, two main clusters were observed, one in the north and the other in the south of Santiago, areas with the most vulnerable populations. The first report of a series of cases of multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in Latin America comes from Brazil. In ten children, no mortality was observed, they had a length of stay in the PICU of 5.5 days and only two of them were treated with corticosteroids and only one required invasive mechanical ventilation (Prata- Barbosa et al. 2020) . Another study that includes some Latin American countries (CAKE study) has reported preliminary results in 17 children admitted to the PICU in Chile and Colombia (González-Dambrauskas et al. 2020) .The children in our series had a relatively late consultation with the emergency department after the onset of MIS-C symptoms (median of 4 days), which reinforces the need to educate both parents and health teams on early diagnosis of the diseases. The median duration of hospitalization was 9 days (IQR 6-13.5) and the most frequent clinical presentation was fever, abdominal pain and features compatible with incomplete KD, similar to reports in Europe (Toubiana et al. 2020 ) and the United States (Feldstein et al. 2020 ). There were no deaths in our series, possibly due to the limited number of children, and/or the high index of suspicion within the health team due to MIS-C alerts coming from the northern hemisphere. Likewise, in our cases, 59% of the children required admission to the PICU, slightly lower than reported in the range of 67 to 81%, respectively. The median age of 6 years in our population is similar to other reports (Belot et al. 2020; Whittaker et al. 2020) , as is the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain, which have been most common, in addition to fever (Feldstein et al. 2020; Whittaker et al. 2020) .MIS-C is increasing during the winter months in Chile (MINSAL 2020), and the possible role of co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (Kim et al. 2020 ) is unknown. To date, more than 60 cases of MIS-C have been reported in Chile, several are ongoing, which may be reflecting an increase of episodes; incidence rates cannot yet be determined.MIS-C is an emerging disease (Verdoni et al. 2020 ) of unknown long-term impact and sequelae, especially related to coronary and or neurological disorders. In addition, suitable biomarkers for better management and monitoring of the disease are currently unknown. D-dimer, troponin, or interleukin-6 in serum can increase in MIS-C as in other non-infectious and infectious diseases, and specific cut-off values for MIS-C are unknown. Early suspicion, especially in developing countries, is critical for prompt and timely care to achieve a favorable clinical outcome. In Latin America, ethnicity might be determining higher incidence rates of MIS-C. In the USA (Feldstein et al. 2020; Godfred et al. 2020) , 31-40% of cases occurred in children of Hispanic ethnicity, and in France (Belot et al. 2020) , 11/21 (57%) of MIS-C cases had African ancestry. According to Belot et al., based on 108 children with confirmed, probable, and possible cases, MIS-C incidence rates would be less than two per 10,000 children. In the echocardiographic study, a cardiac compromise was found in 12 cases, and 5/27 (18%) children presented coronary arteries anomalies, slightly higher than that reported in US series that describe 8-14% of these findings (Feldstein et al. 2020; Whittaker et al. 2020) .Most children in our series received intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids, observing a relatively rapid positive response. Similar responses have been reported in France and the US, with universal use of intravenous immunoglobulin and 77%, and use of corticosteroids of 48% and 49%, respectively (Feldstein et al. 2020; Toubiana et al. 2020) . Only three of our patients (11%) received a second dose of intravenous immunoglobulin and an increase in steroid dose. In other series, tocilizumab has been used (Kaushik et al. 2020; Nakra et al. 2020) , while only two children in our series received this drug.Our study has limitations. We included roughly half of the cases reported to date in Chile, and several remain hospitalized (and thus lack a definite outcome) or are in the process of data collection. Furthermore, sequelae cannot be established as long-term follow-up with pediatric, cardiac, and neurological evaluations are needed. Underreporting is possible as MIS-C is not mandatory reporting, and there are no active or passive surveillance strategies. MIS-C can be seen in children and adolescents; in our study we included children only up to 14 years of age, since in the three pediatric hospitals in the study, 15 years is the age limit for hospitalization.Thus, cases that occurred in older adolescents were not considered. We mainly included an echocardiogram to assess cardiac involvement. Data on cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were available only in few children, as well as the study of possible arrhythmias. It would have been interesting to have a more extensive cardiological study. The serial assessment for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and its immune response (IgM, IgG) would have been desirable in all cases; however, this was not carried out in all patients, although it was done at patient admission. Finally, with the number of cases in our series, we cannot advance treatment recommendations for MIS-C.In conclusion, we describe the first series, of twenty-seven children with MIS-C, in a Latin American country, occurring during the autumn-winter season several weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 peak of cases. Episodes tended to occur within geographic clusters in the urban area of Santiago. Most children (60%) required PICU admission, and all had a favorable clinical outcome. During this pandemic, it will be relevant to emphasize in the health teams the early diagnosis and timely management of MIS-C in children.The authors declare no funding source for this studyThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each institution and by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Investigation in Humans, from the Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  Myocardial and coronary abnormalities 1 (4) Abnormal echocardiography throughout hospitalization 12 (46) ",Chile,abstract,2020-08-28,8
