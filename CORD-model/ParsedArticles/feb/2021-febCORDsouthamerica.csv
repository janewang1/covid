54f3910bb42e57441eace1379ae532ff3e228dbc,"""Stewards of the future: accompanying the rising tide of young voices by setting youth-inclusive research agendas in sustainability research""","In the public sphere, there is a growing global momentum behind social movements led by youth that demand bold action in the face of inequality, climate change and biodiversity decline. As a show of commitment to the younger generations, the United Nations (UN) Secretary General called the first ever UN Youth Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019. This meeting was one example of several efforts by international governing bodies to explicitly include youth perspectives into international policy agendas on societal transitions, another notable example being the wave of youth consultations underway to inform the post-2020 biodiversity framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).Research dealing with coupled economic, social and ecological systems is advancing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to address the major sustainability challenges of the Anthropocene [1, 2] . Guided by international policy agendas and frameworks, such as the Sustainable Development Goals of the Agenda 2030 [3] , transdisciplinary research on sustainability is exploring avenues for incremental and transformative change needed to achieve fair and equitable sustainable development across the globe whilst tackling the biodiversity and climate crises [1] . However, the explicit treatment of young people as stakeholders that are shaping and being shaped by social-ecological systems in the Anthropocene is still rare in sustainability literature, with some exceptions [4] . Here we reflect on youth as key agents of social-ecological change and present the emerging themes from youth-led social movements and international forums for youth voices. We then use these themes as a basis to reflect on how the research community can account for the perspectives of younger generations in their research.We need to set youth sensitive and youth inclusive research agendas to accompany global policy Youth are a group of special focus in sustainability policy, and feature in numerous SDGs; education (SDG4), job security (SDG9), reduction of inequalities (SDG11) and Climate Action (SDG14), as a part of the ""leave no one behind"" framework [5] . Several SDGs make a call to increase participation and capacity building of all at risk groups, including youth, and to ""Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels"" [3] . Broadening inclusion and participation are thus seen as a transformational goal key to accomplishing the Agenda 2030 [1] . Multilateral environmental agreements, such the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), also contain clauses specific to increasing youth participation in all areas of environmental governance (COP11 Decision XI/9) [6] .Firstly, if we are to understand the effects of sustainability-related policy implementation and guarantee evidence-based decision making, research agendas and policy frameworks must go hand in hand. Therefore, research should help facilitate a fuller understanding of the impacts of global change and sustainable development ""wicked problems"" on youth specifically [7] [8] [9] . Secondly, research into sustainability challenges requires reflexivity, and as researchers we must constantly examine the relationship between our research and the broader society [10] . Despite the existence of multiple frameworks within the sustainability research community to engage in socially responsible research, including tools for multi-stakeholder involvement [11] , the topic of youth-inclusive research has received very little attention in the equity and sustainability debate [8, 12] . A Web of Science search of the terms sustain* and youth (or young*) yields 0 hits in leading journals such as Nature or Science. Although pockets of literature exist within the environmental social science literature which address the vulnerability of younger generations to specific global sustainability challenges [4, 7, 9, 13, 14] , a collective recognition of the need to explicitly put youth on the research agenda is lacking.Lastly, the study of social-ecological transformation and sustainability transitions specifically might benefit from internationally targeting youth in research, a fact which has become ever more relevant since the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only are youth potentially impactful agents of social-ecological change through their influence in social movements [15, 16] , but also though driving changes in the economic system through changing values or consumption patterns [17] . Therefore, understanding the views, needs and concerns of youth in the face of global change should become an explicit research priority in fields concerned with the environment, equity and social justice.Young people's emerging concerns on the major sustainability challenges of the Anthropocene should provide a thematic roadmap to guide environmental sustainability and social-ecological transformation researchers (Fig. 1 ).Here we present our account of the major themes arising in international meetings for youth voices, such as the UN Youth Climate Action Summit (https://www.un. org/en/climatechange/youth-in-action) and the UN post-2030 CBD youth forums. We support our conclusions with the results of the recent Global Shapers Survey (GSS) conducted by the World Economic Forum (n = 30,000) [18] .The GSS showed that ""climate change/destruction of nature"" was ranked as the most serious global issue with 49.9% of votes, a trend uniform across age groups [18] . Numerous youth-led initiatives supported by international institutions aim to tackle and raise awareness of the environmental crisis and climate change, including the UN Summer of Solutions, the UN Climate Reboot Troops, the UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) youth network, and the Global Youth Biodiversity Network (GBYN). Grassroots movements have recently drawn global attention to the climate crisis, with youth climate strike mobilization statistics hitting an all-time high in September 2019, with an estimated 6 million strikers worldwide lead by youth organizations.Destruction of nature is ranked first as a global youth concern [18] . Youth have worked to be represented within major multilateral environmental agreements such as the CBD. In 2012, GYBN advocated to include a youth-specific clause in the Conference of the Parties meeting in Hyderabad (COP11) [19] . This clause promotes youth involvement in all stages of the planning and the implementation of national biodiversity strategies (COP11 Decision XI/9). Youth declarations published across youth networks [19] speak of the need to address the biodiversity and the climate crisis as one systemic issue, calling for transformative change which holds nature-based solutions at its centre.The GSS showed that ""Large-scale conflict/wars"" and ""inequality (income, discrimination)"" were ranked as the second and third most important global issues, with 39.10 and 30.9% of votes, respectively [18] . Youth demand that implementation of sustainability agendas must guarantee equitable and fair benefit sharing and be sensitive to the global south context. Sustainability initiatives must also empower and engage local communities and Indigenous peoples in all phases of planning and implementation. Additionally, there are calls for the mainstreaming of gender and minority equity, diversity and inclusivity within all sectors involved in sustainability policy planning and implementation [19] .The GSS ranked ""government accountability and transparency/corruption"" as a primary concern within their own countries (46.10% of votes) [18] . Multiple youth forums in 2019 stressed the lack of political will to implement concrete and transformative actions needed to address sustainability crises. There is also a clear call across youth organizations to increase representation of young stakeholders with capacity to influence policy and decision making. According to a 2019 study by the Inter-parliamentary Union, only 2.2% of members of parliament (MPs) are below the age of 30 worldwide, and a push to increase representation is seen as central to promoting youth decision making capacity and influence worldwide [20] .In addition to deeper systemic approaches, youth have been protagonist of innovation and technology-based solutions to tackle global sustainability challenges. Notable initiatives like the ""Summer of Solutions"" and the ""Climate Reboot Troops"", under the auspices of the UN Envoy on Youth, have kick-started youth-led projects using open data and tech concepts to solve a local environmental crisis unique to each location and community [21] . Youth discussions have also urged caution in this sector, pointing out that techno-fix pathways should not be prioritized as ""silver-bullet"" solutions to sustainability challenges, opting for deeper systemic approaches with economic, social and ecological transformation at their centre [19] .Education and outreach have been raised as central to achieving sustainability outcomes, stressing the need to fund and implement capacitation, upskilling and awareness raising schemes across the globe. Youth reflect a need for an education and research agenda that contemplates diverse knowledge systems, that promotes critical thinking and addresses power asymmetries. Additionally, youth call for an increase in cross-sectorial and interdisciplinarity platforms, which allow for emergent transdisciplinary collaborations and approaches to sustainability challenges. In the academic context, more than 80% of youth in the GSS disagreed with the statement ""Academics and scientific experts should not be involved in politics"" [18] , reflecting a need to close divides between sectorial silos, facilitate evidence-based policy and address the research-implementation gap.Although we have presented these six themes as separate, underlying them is a holistic mindset underpinned by two key concepts: systems thinking and transdisciplinary (Fig. 1) . In our personal experience facilitating youth forums, millennials are very comfortable dealing with overlapping layers of complexity, systems and networks. In the minds of many youth the environmental crisis cannot be separated from key drivers like inequality or poor governance. Therefore, youth movements are demanding from world leaders a mindset that can follow these complexities, and can provide perhaps not a solution, but an integrated ""crisis-management"" roadmap that aims for and is fully committed to systemic change. Youth are demanding that these systemic changes address the core of our development models, including the values and principles which underpin them. In the same way, transdisciplinary and cross-sectorial efforts must create new languages and approaches [22] , which are able to address the connections between inequality and unequal distribution of resources, concentration of power, failing governance systems and institutions, and the unprecedented environmental degradation, poverty and risks to young people and future generations.Last but not least, despite the simplistic presentation of these themes, it is important to acknowledge that youth are not a uniform group, and that Global North narratives have traditionally dominated global youth discourse [8, 18] . Thus, the importance of any of these concerns is strongly dependent on socio-economic and cultural context, which is in itself a research gap which needs addressing [8] .Researchers studying coupled social-ecological systems and sustainability, particularly those working in emerging disciplines within sustainability science, such as the the environmental social sciences (e.g. socioecology, ecological economics and political ecology), should labor to produce research which accounts for the role of younger generations in shaping the past, present and future of social-ecological systems. There are multiple avenues for scientific research to foster incremental and transformative social learning opportunities which account for youth, and here we point out three simple and complementary pathways:Remembering youth as essential stakeholders and utilizing appropriate participatory and social learning methods are key steps to producing youth-inclusive research. Potential practices include: (a) Involve youth in participatory processes such as horizon scanning [23] , participatory scenario building [24] , future-casting [25] and dialogue [26] processes which capture youth's concerns and contribute to collaborative research agendas. (b) Explicitly recognize youth more broadly as key stakeholders in conservation and sustainability projects, including them in the study sample as well as in planning, consultations, mapping exercises, and community follow-ups and monitoring. (c) Foster collaborations and empower young sustainability leaders from both academic and practitioner backgrounds, promoting youth-led initiatives and questions [14] . (d) Engage in responsible research practices following guidelines such as the Responsible Research and Innovation framework [27] . Ensuring fair multi-stakeholder initiatives also means remaining sensitive to local and historical contexts, being age and gender responsive, and aware of socio-cultural issues, including the role of power dynamics in knowledge coproduction [28] .In order to identify and address knowledge gaps we must: (a) Combine research synthesis with participatory and multi-stakeholder engagement processes in order to increase our baseline knowledge of the specific roles of youth as agents of change in social-ecological transformation [29] (b) Enhance the use of existing methods which capture the complex nature of youth as a both a passive and active agent in sustainability issues. For example, employing transdisciplinary methods used to study complex system dynamics [29] , such as: participatory action research, participatory scenario planning, participatory games, participant observation and dialogue workshops. (c) Advance new youth-friendly methodologies for capturing youth concerns and perspectives in sustainability research. This requires cross-sectorial and transdisciplinary collaborations, which facilitate method development that builds on existing techniques from the health and social sciences, utilizing emerging technologies when appropriate [30] .Facilitate engagement and build trust (a) Foster platforms for building trust and understanding (8) . Although the GSS showed that academic and research institutions were among the most trusted institutions by youth, continuing to work on building understanding and trust between the research community and younger generations is essential. (b) Facilitate youthtargeted science outreach and collaborative education programmes, essential to building an understanding amongst the younger generations of the role of science in a changing world. (c) Encourage alternative research outputs, which reach broader audiences and are accessible to younger generations. (d) Encourage reflexivity during the whole research process [10] . Create discussion spaces for selfevaluation where researchers can reflect and discuss on the impact of their research on the broader community, and facilitate learning from failure [31] .To conclude, we call for action to accompany youthinclusive sustainability policy with youth-inclusive research agendas. Thus, we hope researchers will foster inter-generational, multi-stakeholder and multidisciplinary forums that allow knowledge exchange, and that can function as opportunities for researchers to become sensitive to the needs and perspectives of youth. By doing so, we build the trust and understanding needed to move forward in setting research agendas which recognize the role of youth in our common future.",Chile,abstract,2021-02-10,02

Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) has established itself as a valuable biophysical approach offering meaningful insights into protein structure and dynamics. Recent efforts have aimed to integrate HDX-MS with computational approaches to provide atomistic interpretation of the structural dynamics information garnered. Recently, an HDX-MS based maximum entropy reweighting approach (HDXer) was developed to reweight computationally generated ensembles using HDX-MS data towards high resolution ensemble description of proteins. Here, HDX-MS is used together with enhanced molecular dynamics simulations and HDXer to characterize the structural dynamics of PhuS, a cytoplasmic heme binding protein from P.aeruginosa. Functionally, PhuS shuttles exogenous heme to Heme Oxygenase (HemO) for degradation. Although the crystal structures of unliganded (apo) and heme bound (holo) PhuS are nearly identical, HDX-MS of apo vs holo PhuS revealed large differences in deuterium uptake, notably in C-terminal proximal alpha helices 6, 7 and 8 (a6/7/8). These helices form part of the heme binding pocket and were observed to be mostly labile in apo-PhuS but were largely protected in holo-PhuS. In contrast, the predicted deuterium uptake of a6/7/8 in apo-and holo-PhuS obtained from MD simulations are highly similar to one another and in agreement with the HDX-MS data obtained for holo-PhuS, suggesting that the solution structure of apo-PhuS locally deviates from its crystal structure conformation. The combined use of enhanced sampling MD, HDXer and dimensional reduction reveals an apo-PhuS ensemble in which a6/7/8 are significantly rearranged compared to the crystal structure, including the loss of secondary structure in a6 and the rotation of a7 more than 60 o towards the HemO binding interface. The change in secondary structure was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy of apo and holo-PhuS.Thermal Transfer from the Surface Loop to the Iron Active Site of Soybean Lipoxygenase Jan Paulo Zaragoza. Department of Chemistry, Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. The rate-limiting chemical reaction catalyzed by soybean lipoxygenase (SLO) involves quantum mechanical tunneling of a hydrogen atom from substrate to its active site ferric-hydroxide cofactor. SLO has emerged as a prototypical system for linking the thermal activation of a protein scaffold to the efficiency of active site chemistry. Significantly, hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments on wild type and mutant forms of SLO have uncovered trends in the enthalpic barriers for HDX within a solvent-exposed loop (position 317-334) that correlate well with trends in the corresponding enthalpic barriers for k cat . A model for this behavior posits that collisions between water and loop 317-334 initiate thermal activation at the protein surface that is then propagated 15-34 Å inward toward the reactive carbon of substrate in proximity to the iron catalyst. In this study, we have prepared protein samples containing cysteine residues either at the tip of the loop 317-334 (Q322C) or on a control loop, 586-603 (S596C). Chemical modification of cysteines with the fluorophore 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Badan, BD) provides site-specific probes for the measurement of fluorescence relaxation lifetimes and Stokes shift decays as a function of temperature. While both loops exhibit temperature-independent fluorescence relaxation lifetimes as do the Stokes shifts for S596C-BD, the activation enthalpy for the nanosecond solvent reorganization at Q322C-BD (E a (k solv ) = 2.8(0.9) kcal/mol)) approximates the enthalpy of activation for catalytic C-H activation (E a (k cat ) = 2.1(0.2) kcal/ mol). This study establishes and validates methodology for measuring rates of rapid local motions at the protein/solvent interface of SLO. These new findings, when combined with previously published correlations between protein motions and the rate limiting hydride transfer in a thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase, provide experimental evidence for thermally-induced 'protein quakes' as the origin of enthalpic barriers in catalysis.Allosteric Regulation of the Activity of BY-Kinases, a Unique Family of Bacterial Protein Tyrosine Kinases Fatlum Hajredini 1,2 , Andrea Piserchio 2 , Rinat Abzalimov 3 , Ranajeet Ghose 2,4 . 1 Graduate Program in Biochemistry, the Graduate Center of CUNY, New York, NY, USA, 2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, the City University of New York, New York, NY, USA, 3 CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, the Graduate Center of CUNY, New York, NY, USA, 4 Graduate Programs in Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Physics, the Graduate Center of CUNY, New York, NY, USA. BY-kinases comprise a family of protein tyrosine kinases that are highly conserved in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but are without any eukaryotic orthologs. BY-kinases are involved in a variety of physiological processes, most notably in the production of polysaccharides involved in capsule synthesis or biofilm formation. BY-kinases are unique in that their catalytic domains are closely related to the P-loop ATPases and do not encode the dual-lobed architecture characteristic of eukaryotic protein kinases. BYkinases are proposed to function through an assembly/disassembly process regulated by the phosphorylation state of a cluster of tyrosine residues found on the C-terminal tail of their catalytic domains. Using the catalytic domain of a prototypical BY-kinase, Escherichia. coli Wzc and utilizing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics, solution NMR and complimentary biophysical approaches, we demonstrate the presence of a long-range allosteric network that connects the structural elements that facilitate the assembly (oligomerization) process to the kinase active site. This network regulates the conformational states of key catalytic elements and thereby influences nucleotide exchange. We further demonstrate that a single, highly conserved active site residue represents a key node within this allosteric network. Our results highlight a novel regulatory mechanism that enables the BY-kinases to transfer the g-phosphate of ATP to a tyrosine -OH moiety, rather than one on water, while deploying an ATPase fold.

Coronaviruses (CoVs), including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, have and continue to pose a major threat to human health. In October of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, surpassed one million global deaths. CoVs are enveloped positive strand RNA viruses that display surface spike proteins which recognize host receptors. The spike proteins then undergo conformational changes that allow for attachment to the host membrane and eventually facilitate membrane fusion and viral entry. Due to their exposure on the virus surface and their essential role in coronavirus infection, most antibody development strategies and many therapeutic development strategies have focused on the spike protein.While much focus has been given to the structure of spike, successful design of therapeutics requires understanding the conformational dynamics and alternative conformations not accessible using traditional structural methods. We have successfully applied Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX/MS) on this large (>400 kDa) glycosylated trimeric complex to investigate these important conformational changes; allowing us to identify the binding interfaces as well as the induced allosteric changes upon binding to the human receptor ACE2, neutralizing patient antibodies, and synthetic binders. We also compare the conformational flexibility of coronavirus homologues and naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 spike variants allowing us to connect changes in the conformational ensemble to functional, phenotypic differences in these variants. Understanding the native conformational ensemble, and interactions between receptors or antibodies with CoV spike proteins will not only improve our understanding of CoV biology and the host immune response to CoV but also aid in the design of therapeutics and vaccines for current and future CoVs.Wei Chen, Elizabeth A. Komives. Chemistry and Biochemistry, Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. The NF-kB family of transcription factor is a central mediator of immune and imflammatory responses. NF-kB functions as a dimer and recognize DNA through the two N-terminal domains (NTDs). Previous hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, stopped-flow experiments and molecular dynamics simulations suggested the two NTDs can undergo relative motions which plays an important role in the kinetics of DNA association and dissociation. Here we showed by single-molecule FRET the direct evidence of relative domain motions in the NF-kB RelA-p50 dimer. Surprisingly, the two NTDs underwent slow heterogeneous motions on the timescale of seconds to minutes. These motions are scaled down when NF-kB is bound to DNA and allosterically altered by the inhibitor protein IkBa, which is known to accelerate DNA dissociation and prevent DNA binding. A new DNA-bound conformation unexpected from crystal structure was also observed. Together, our results provide a direct visualization and quantitative characterization of large-scale domain motions of NF-kB and shed light on the understanding of the role of protein dynamics in protein-protein interactions.Insight Into Cullin Ring Ligase and Substrate Binding Philip R.

Ubiquitylation helps regulate protein degradation and maintain normal cellular function. E3 ubiquitin ligases facilitate the attachment of ubiquitin molecules to substrate proteins. The most common class of E3 ubiquitin ligase is the Cullin RING Ligase (CRL), which is a complex of proteins containing a Cullin protein as a scaffold. Cullin 5 associates with one of 18 Ankyrin-Repeat and SOCS Box (ASB) proteins, and the RING-box (RXB) protein, RBX2 which binds the ubiquitylated E2. When substrate binds, the ubiquitin is transferred from the E2 protein to an exposed lysine residue on the substrate. I am exploring the ubiquitylation of putative substrates identified in a proteomics pull-down study of the ASB proteins. I have assessed several putative substrates for ubiquitylation by the ASB CRL and have identified additional substrates. I have used size exclusion chromatography to assess whether the substrate binds with high affinity to the ASB CRL. Additionally, I have tested whether Nedd8 is necessary to activate the CRL to achieve ubiquitylation. Finally, I will present HDX-MS data to identify the interface between the ligase and the substrate.Disulfide Reduction Allosterically Destabilizes the b-Ladder Sub-Domain Assembly Within the NS1 Dimer of ZIKV Priti Roy 1 , Subhajit Roy 2 , Neelanjana Sengupta 3 . 1 Biological Sciences, IISER Kolkata, Kalyani, India, 2 Centre for Excellence in Basic SCIENCES (CBS), Vidyanagari, India, 3 Biological Sciences, IISER Kolkata, Mohanpur, India. The Zika virus (ZIKV) was responsible for a recent debilitating epidemic that till date has no cure. A potential way to reduce ZIKV virulence is to limit the action of the non-structural proteins involved in its viral replication. One such protein, NS1, encoded as a monomer by the viral genome, plays a major role via symmetric oligomerization. We examine the homodimeric structure of the dominant b-ladder segment of NS1 with extensive all atom molecular dynamics. We find it stably bounded by two spatially separated interaction clusters (C1 and C2) with significant differences in the nature of their interactions. Four pairs of distal, intra-monomeric disulfide bonds are found to be coupled to the stability, local structure, and wettability of the interfacial region. Symmetric reduction of the intra-monomeric disulfides triggers marked dynamical heterogeneity, interfacial wettability and asymmetric salt bridging propensity. Harnessing the model-free Lipari-Szabo based formalism for estimation of conformational entropy (S conf ), we find clear signatures of heterogeneity in the monomeric conformational entropies. The observed asymmetry, very small in the unperturbed state, expands significantly in the reduced states. This allosteric effect is most noticeable in the electrostatically bound C2 cluster that underlies the greatest stability in the unperturbed state. Allosteric induction of conformational and thermodynamic asymmetry is expected to affect the pathways leading to symmetric higher ordered oligomerization, and thereby affect crucial replication pathways.",Chile,first author,2021-02-12,02
2de31dea9fc2ef03c1c9b669bf08354ea75cd7d3,Psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S),"In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan (China), new cases of a virus from the coronavirus family, SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19), caused a variety of diseases (Li, Bai, & Hashikawa, 2020) . The infection spread rapidly and caused unprecedented effects in the world (Sloan et al., 2020) , leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to decree, on March 11, 2020, the pandemic state of COVID-19. This pandemic brought not only the risk of death from viral infection, but also a psychological overload (Duan & Zhu, 2020; Xiao, Zhang, Kong, Li, & Yang, 2020) , because of the implementation of widespread interventions of physical distancing (e.g., social isolation, quarantine, lockdown). Although such measures are vital to prevent the spread of the virus, together with the unknown scenario and the unfavorable prognosis, they can cause several psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and panic disorder (Qiu et al., 2020) , financial distress and loneliness (Tull et al., 2020) , and stress (Taylor et al., 2020) .In situations of continuous uncertainty, as the one lived in this pandemic, fear becomes a key variable for mental health, becoming chronic and mal-adaptive (Mertens, Gerritsen, Salemink, & Egelhard, 2020) . Therefore, despite being a self-preservation response, fear is harmful to the mental health of individuals when disproportionate, irrational, and/or chronic (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Sakib et al., 2020; Soraci et al., 2020) . It can also be a trigger for other problems, such as suicide (Mamun & Griffiths, 2020; . In the current situation, fear has been especially seen in individuals working on the front line (Lu, Wang, Lin, & Li, 2020) . Additionally, because of its emergency nature, the severity of the pandemic is shown daily on the media and social networks. This excessive exposure can provoke fear, leading individuals to constantly think on such information, having a negative effect on well-being (Satici, Saricali, Satici, & Griffiths, 2020b) , and being an additional risk factor for the development of generalized anxiety and depression (Gao et al., 2020; Huang & Zhao, 2020) .Research have found that demographic variables are important to understand the fear of COVID-19. For example, women and people of lower socioeconomic levels presented higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (Bitan et al., 2020) . These authors also indicated that fear is higher in people who reported having a chronic disease, being in at-risk groups, or having family members affected by the pandemic. Also, individuals report a higher level of fear of contact with people who may be infected, when considering the COVID-19 context (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Lin, 2020) .Therefore, it is clear the important role that fear has when it comes to face the challenges of the current global scenario, and it is essential to have measures to properly evaluate this variable. To cover this, a measure has gained prominence, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S; Ahorsu et al., 2020) . For its elaboration, Ahorsu et al. (2020) performed an extensive review about fear measures, gathering an initial set of 10 items. After using different psychometric techniques (classic and modern), results showed a one-dimensional structure composed of seven items (Cronbach's Alpha, α = .82). The measure has been quickly adapted in several countries and cultures, such as Turkey (Satici, Gocet-Tekin, Deniz, & Satici, 2020a; Satici et al., 2020b) , Italy (Soraci et al., 2020) , Saudi Arabia (Alyami, Henning, Krägeloh, & Alyami, 2020) , Greece, (Tsipropoulou et al., 2020) , and Russia and Belarus (Reznik, Gritsenko, Konstantinov, Khamenka, & Isralowitz, 2020) . All these cultures replicated the FCV-19S structure and presented reliable results. Additionally, to assess its convergent validity, research has shown significant associations to variables like depression, anxiety, stress, and specific phobias (Bitan et al., 2020; Soraci et al., 2020) .It is evident that the emergence of COVID-19 and its consequences have become one of the eminent global challenges (Ahorsu et al., 2020) , in which there is little importance given to mental health (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2020) . Currently (December 2020), Brazil is one of the epicenters of the pandemic (Menezes, Garner, & Valenti, 2020) , the third country in number of total cases worldwide. On the other hand, the Brazilian government is one of the most ineffective to combat the COVID-19 (The Lancet, 2020), with its public health system scrapped and not being able to contain the amount of infected people. Therefore, considering the chaotic situation in the context, it is essential to have measures to assess the effects of fear of COVID-19 on mental health (Satici et al., 2020a, b) , since this global reality will still be present for a long time. Moreover, tracking the levels of fear in different groups and their correlates can help to develop education and prevention programs, identifying more urgent needs in view of the condition of social invisibility, rapid transmission, and mortality rate of the virus (Ahorsu et al., 2020) , as well as how to deal with stigmatization and discrimination of those who have been or are contaminated (Pappas, Kiriaze, Giannakis, & Falagas, 2009) .Therefore, as the FCV-19S is theoretically grounded and has solid psychometric properties, having a Brazilian Portuguese version is important. Specifically, considering the current moment of pandemic, testing the psychometric properties of FCV-19S in Brazil may enable the conduction of cross-cultural studies, testing the effect of sociocultural variables or even verifying whether public policies implemented by national governments contribute to the lower level of fear and, consequently, better mental health of the population. Thus, the present research gathers evidence of validity (factorial and convergent), accuracy and individual parameters of the items (difficulty, discrimination, and psychometric information) of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. To achieve this goal, two independent studies were developed. In Study 1, we aimed to adapt the FCV-19S to the Brazilian context, assessing its factorial structure (i.e., Exploratory Factor Analysis) and individual parameters. Based on these individual parameters, we selected the best items and proposed a shorter version of the FCV-19S. In Study 2, we aimed to assess whether the structure could be replicated using an independent sample and more robust analysis (i.e., Confirmatory Factor Analysis), for both long and short versions of the scale. Also, we assessed convergent validity by associating the measure with mental health outcomes (e.g., anxiety, stress, and depression), variables widely used in the literature (Satici et al., 2020a, b) .Participants were 230 volunteers, aged between 18 and 71 years (M = 35.33; SD = 11.26). Most participants were women (76.1%), single (48.7%), and with complete higher education (34.8%). The survey was developed using Google Forms. To collect data, snowball technique was used. We started advertising the survey in social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram), and asked participants to help advertising. We considered a non-probabilistic sample composed of individuals over 18 years old. Those who agreed to collaborate were clarified the purposes and guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality.Fear of COVID-19 Scale -(FCV-19S; Ahorsu et al., 2020) . It is composed by seven items (e.g., ""Item 1. I am most afraid of coronavirus-19"" and ""Item 7. My heart races or palpitates when I think about getting coronavirus-19""), which globally assess the fear of COVID-19. Participants indicate their level of agreement with the items, using a five-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree; 5 = Strongly Agree).To translate the FCV-19S to Portuguese, we used the backtranslation method, following the procedure suggested by Borsa, Damásio, and Bandeira (2012) . Therefore, the scale was first translated to Brazilian Portuguese by two independent translators and then retranslated to English, through blind translations, to verify the equivalence of the items of the two versions (Portuguese and English). After that, with the preliminary version in Brazilian Portuguese, semantic validation was performed (Pasquali, 2016) , which sought to evaluate whether the items and the format of the measure were clear. No further change was necessary.To assess the structure of the FCS-19S, we used the software Factor 10.10.03 (Ferrando & Lorenzo-Seva, 2017) . To determine the number of factors, we considered the Hull method (CFI; Lorenzo-Seva, Timmerman, & Kiers, 2011), known as one of the best in estimating the dimensionality of a given set of items (Lorenzo-Seva et al., 2011) . After, the structure properties were assessed through a categorical exploratory factor analysis (Diagonally Weighted Least Squares; DWLS), implemented in the matrix of polychoric correlations. Also, we assessed complementary indicators of unidimensionality, following recommendations by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2018) . In addition, internal consistency (reliability) was verified using Cronbach's Alpha (α), based α on polychoric correlations, and McDonald's Omega (ω). Finally, we assessed the parameters of the FCS-19S items using Item Response Theory. For that, we used the package mirt (Chalmers, 2012) in R. Considering the ordinal polytomic nature of the items, we used the Graduated Response Model in our IRT analyses (GRM; Samejima, 1969) .Initially, we aimed to gather evidence of construct validity, assessing the factorial structure of the measure through a robust categorical factor analysis (500 resamples through Bootstrap). To allow the performance of an EFA, we first observed the adequacy of the matrix of polychoric correlations to the EFA [KMO = .88 (95% CI = 0.859-0.914) and χ 2 Bartlett (21) = 1012.8 and p < .001]. When assessing the dimensionality of the measure, results pointed to a single factor with eigenvalue greater than 1 (4.16), that explained 64.69% of the total variance. This structure was supported by the Hull method (CFI = 0.98; Scree Test = 59.73), in addition to additional indicators of one-dimensionality: UniCo (Unidimensional Congruence) = .98 (95% CI = .949-.994) and MIREAL (Mean of Item Residual Absolute Loadings) = .262 (95% CI = .207-.304).Therefore, we proceeded with an EFA (DWLS). As can be seen in Table 1 Additionally, Item Response Theory (GRM) was used to know, in greater detail, how the items of the FCS-19S differentiate people with distinct levels of fear of COVID-19, their thresholds, and amount of psychometric information provided by these items. Results can be seen in Table 1 . All items presented very high discrimination values (M a = 2.12; SD a = .35) ranging from 1.71 (Item 1) to 2.72 (Item 3; Baker, 2001; Baker & Kim, 2017) . The thresholds serve to identify the levels of theta (θ) necessary to select the next upper category on the response scale. These thresholds can be understood as the difficulty of the item, which should not be too easy nor too difficult (e.g., means across b1-b4 between −1.5 and 1.5; Rauthmann, 2013) . The lowest thresholds (b 1-4 ) were found in items 1 and 2, with means of b 1-4 of −1.26 and − 1.09. That is, these items require lower levels of fear of COVID-19 to be fully endorsed. Finally, the Item Information Curve and Test Information Curve were assessed and can be seen in Fig. 1 .When assessing the amount of psychometric information I(θ; −4/+4) of the items individually (Table 1) , an average information I(θ) of 5.08 (SD = 0.89) is found, ranging from 4.16 (item 1) to 6.33 (Item 3). The graphical evaluation of the Item Information Curves and Test Information Curve indicate that the measure covers a wide range of the latent trait (−2.56 to 2.04). Additionally, it is possible to identify items 2, 3, 6 and 7 as the most informative and, therefore, more central to the fear of COVID-19 measure. In this sense, a short version of the FCV-19S is suggested, also evaluated via EFA and TRI (see Table 1 ).For the EFA, we followed the same procedure used for the full version of the measure. Results indicated a one-dimensional structure (Eigenvalue = 2.55; Hull CFI = .997) composed by 4 items, with factor loadings above .50 (M = .72; SD = .09) and acceptable reliability (α = .81).The discrimination values ranged from moderate (Item Figure 2 shows the test information curves for the full and short version of the FCV-19S, indicating that the shorter version is a suitable alternative, without losing psychometric information. The sample consisted of 302 individuals (M age = 31.07; SD age = 9.28; ranging from 18 to 65), mainly women (75.8%), and with a postgrad (41.7%). For the data collection, the same procedure used in Study 1 was applied.Besides the FCV-19S, participants also answered the following measures:Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) Adapted for Brazil by Vignola and Tucci (2014) , 21 items are evenly divided into three factors: depression (e.g. ""I felt down-hearted and blue""), anxiety (e.g. ""I felt I was close to panic"") and stress (e.g. ""I found it difficult to relax""). Participants indicate to what extent the statements apply to them over the past week, using a fourpoint scale (0 = Did not apply to me at all; 4 = Applied to me very much or most of the time).Analyzes were performed using R. With the Lavaan package (Rossel, 2012) , a categorical confirmatory factor analysis (ordinal) was performed, considering the estimator Least Squares Mean and Variance-Adjusted (WLSMV; Muthén & Muthén, 2014) . This estimator is recommended for ordinal data that do not follow normal distribution (Asún, Rdz-Navarro, & Alvarado, 2015; Holgado-Tello, Chacón-Moscoso, Barbero-García, & Vila-Abad, 2010) . The following indicators were used to assess model fit (Byrne, 2010; Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2019; Sun, 2005; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013) : (1) Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and (2) First, we assessed whether the unifactorial structure of the FCV-19S would replicate using a different sample and through a robust statistical technique, CFA, using the WLSMV estimator. We considered both the full version, composed by the 7 original items (Ahorsu et al., 2020) , and the shorter version, composed by the items identified as most informative in our previous study To calculate the convergent validity, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used, considering the WLSMV estimator. Thus, we tested two models (Full ad Short FCV-19S) , with four latent variables each: one representing the FCV-19S and the other three representing depression, anxiety, and stress (each with 7 items). See Fig. 3 The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the groundbreaking events of the century, causing unprecedented damage (Sloan et al., 2020) , with hundreds of thousands of victims all over the world, in addition to the possibility of causing severe damage in people's mental health (Duan & Zhu, 2020; Xiao, 2020 ). An ineffective government (The Lancet, 2020) and poor conditions of the public health system might help to explain why Brazil is one of the epicenters of the pandemic (Menezes et al., 2020) . As a result, the effects of COVID-19 are higher in this context, and it is essential to have measures that allow the assessment of variables that can impact people's mental health and contribute to the development of intervention programs.The present research aimed to adapt the FCV-19S to the Brazilian context, gathering evidence of validity and accuracy.In Study 1, we gathered evidence for its one-dimensional structure, with items presenting high factorial loadings (Pasquali, 2012) . These results are in line with studies in different countries, indicating that the FCV-19S structure is cross-culturally consistent (e.g., Alyami et al., 2020; Satici et al., 2020a, b) . The measure presented acceptable levels of internal consistency, attesting its accuracy (Urbina, 2014) . Moreover, the items presented adequate discrimination (Baker, 2001) and information levels, covering a wide range of the latent trait evaluated.We also proposed a short version of the FCV-19S. Considering that COVID-19 and its effects will remain indefinitely, shorter, and precise measures are useful in contexts such as primary care or hospital, places that might not present much time available for questionnaires. In our analyses, we selected four items that proved to be as informative, valid, and accurate as the full-version of the FCV-19S. In other words, a useful alternative for screening people with potential for mental health problems because of the intense fear of COVID-19.In Study 2, we confirmed the structure of the full FCV-19S and its short version, with results indicating a good model fit (e.g., CFI and TLI ≥ 0.90 and RMSEA <0.08; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013) . Once again, the measures presented adequate levels of internal consistency (α and ω ≥ 0.70; Kline, 2013) .In addition to the evidence gathered about the internal structure of the measure, we verified the validity of the short and full versions of the FCV-19S based on their associations with external variables. For that, using Structural Equation Modeling, we developed models in which the Fear of COVID explained stress, depression, and anxiety. As expected, we found that both versions of the FCS-19S positively predict these three constructs. These models presented adequate fit (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013) , with the short version presenting slightly better results in comparison to the full version. These results endorse previous findings on the COVID-19 literature, indicating that its fear may be a risk factor for the development of mental health problems (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Sakib et al., 2020; Satici et al., 2020a, b; Soraci et al., 2020; Tsipropoulou et al., 2020) .Therefore, assessing constructs such as the fear of COVID-19, that can predict negative psychological reactions or effects (such as anxiety, depression, and stress), is essential. It is known that these psychological distresses can diminish people's well-being and satisfaction with life (Alyami et al., 2020) , especially at times like the present (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Mertens et al., 2020) . FCV-19S could still be useful in developing strategies to minimize the psychological impact that depression, anxiety, and stress might cause in individuals infected and non-infected by COVID-19, besides helping to work on the stigma associated with disease and the fear of contracting it (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).The present research brings the Brazilian adaptation of the FCV-19S, besides providing a shorter measure with comparable quality to the original version. In despite of the promising findings for the Brazilian context and research about COVID-19, this project is not without limitations. First, the use of non-probabilistic sample, not representative of the whole population of Brazil. This implies that is impossible to generalize the results reported (Markus & Borsboom, 2013) . Also, in despite of the limited and non-representative sample (Comrey & Lee, 1992) , it is important to highlight that our number of participants extrapolates known criteria to support the use of multivariate techniques. For instance, the recommended proportion of 20 participants per item (Clark & Watson, 1995; Hair et al., 2019; Gorsuch, 2015) . Another limitation is the gender imbalance across our studies. In both samples, around three fourths of our participants were women. Therefore, more heterogeneous samples are recommended in future studies.Both versions of the measure may be useful in future research, extremely needed. These studies can especially focus in the most vulnerable groups (e.g., with pre-existing diseases or elderly), people positively diagnosed for coronavirus, and professionals working on the front line. Another important point is to conduct longitudinal studies to assess the fear of COVID-19 and its effects over time. This is especially important in Brazil, which has no control of the spread of the virus. As the measures of social distancing and lockdown are not being met, it is expected a substantial increase in contamination in the coming months, especially considering that in many places of the country there has been a flexibilization of such measures. Therefore, verifying the fear of COVID-19 over time can help in preventive public health practices for the mitigation of the virus (Alyami et al., 20, 200) .Data Availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Ethical Considerations All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the 1975 Helsinki Declaration.Informed Consent Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

3b931c5b953a2b3f5440210d5ad6e3c6723f0b8b,Low Psychological Well-being in Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) During the Shelter-in-Place Orders to Prevent the COVID-19 Spread: Results from a Nationwide Study,"Due to its very nature, few health situations will impact the world in this century as the COVID-19 pandemic has. More than 60 million people had been infected worldwide by the end of November 2020 (WHO, 2020) , and its impact is apparent in all countries. The populations' psychosocial health has been significantly affected (Serafini et al., 2020) , especially among those who are acutely vulnerable to the virus, such as the homeless, migrants and refugees, the elderly, drug users, and indigenous populations (Xiong et al., 2020) . Brazil is currently facing a disheartening situation. It ranks third in the number of COVID-19 cases; by the end of November, Brazil recorded more than 170,000 deaths (Brazil, 2020a) .The COVID-19 pandemic has affected daily life, imposing changes beyond the health sphere, as social, economic, cultural, and political aspects have experienced impact that is unprecedented in the recent history of epidemics (Chakraborty & Maity, 2020) . The large number of people who have been infected and died from infection directly impacts the capacity of health systems, also challenging countries' economies and populations, in general (Araújo, Oliveira & Freitas, 2020) . Continuous and prolonged quarantine causes a strain on people's mental health, as it restricts access to essential goods, such as food, medicine, and transportation, among others . Such a context affects the individuals' psychological well-being, significantly decreasing quality of life (Serafini et al., 2020) . These problems are heightened by mandatory social isolation measures intended to control the virus' spread. The damage caused to human well-being is undeniable and has drawn the attention of researchers, lawmakers, health authorities, and public managers, who have acted to minimize its impact.The pandemic's harmful impact, heightened by social isolation, is quite noticeable in the individuals' physical, mental, social, and environmental spheres (Forte, Favieri, Tambelli & Casagrande, 2020) . In this context, sexual and gender minorities are subject to greater vulnerability, given the historical inequality they face in terms of health and violence, a conditioning factor (Gibb et al, 2020) . That is, these groups are relegated to a marginal position within the society, and, as a consequence, a safety net system and psychosocial support are not always provided or available to them.Hornet (Greenhalgh, 2020) conducted a global survey among men who have sex with men (MSM), revealing considerable levels of loneliness and depression associated with shelter-in-place measures. The impact of these measures on the individuals' mental health produces considerable impairment in terms of psychological and social well-being throughout the pandemic. The literature has addressed the pandemic's impact on the maintenance of affective and sexual practices, including the establishment of barriers impeding access to health services that are necessary to maintain therapeutic processes and care technologies (Sousa et al., 2020a, b, c; Carvalho et al., 2020; Torres et al., 2020) . From this perspective, there is a lack of concrete governmental action directed to MSM during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this population's context and the repercussions of the novel socio-historical phenomenon caused by the COVID-19 worldwide on the individuals' psychological well-being, this study's objective was to analyze the factors associated with low psychological well-being among MSM living in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic.This cross-sectional study addresses data from the ""40TENA"" project, conducted in all 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District from May to April 2020, when restrictive public health measures, such as social isolation and sheltering-in-place, were in force. Brazilian health agencies instructed the population to shelter at home, avoiding close/personal contact with people outside one's household. Essential activities such as trade and some services were maintained with restrictions. Up to the time of this study, none of the Brazilian states had imposed full lockdown.A total of 2646 Brazilian MSM participated in this study. Due to the pandemic, the participants were recruited online using snowball sampling. In this method, the participants themselves are responsible for recruiting other individuals with similar situations via social media. Following the method's criteria, 15 MSM with different characteristics were selected, namely, the state of residence (we chose the most populated state in each of the five Brazilian regions), race (Caucasian/non-Caucasian); age (young, adult, or elderly), and educational level (high school, undergraduate, or graduate studies). These were the first participants and were called ""seeds."" Each participant received a link to the survey and was instructed to invite other MSM from their social network until a significant sample was obtained. The seeds were identified through two geo-location-based dating applications (Grindr and Hornet) via direct chat with online users. The first individuals available online in each of the two applications and who met the inclusion criteria were included (Queiroz et al., 2019a (Queiroz et al., , 2019b Sousa et al., 2019) .The researchers also promoted the survey on Facebook, directing it to the MSM population aged from 18 to 60 years old (a Facebook-imposed age restriction), using a fixed post on the official page of the survey (https ://www.faceb ook. com/taafi mdequ e/), accompanied by an electronic link that granted access to a free and informed consent form and the survey's questionnaire. Facebook was used as an additional resource due to its ability to access people located in the countryside, which is absolutely necessary in the case of a continent-spanning country like Brazil. Only individuals who identified themselves as men (cisgender or transgender) and aged 18 + years old were included. Tourists and non-Portuguese speaking individuals were excluded.The instrument used to collect data was developed by this study's authors, considering the research variables and the participants' characterization. It was content validated by a panel of judges specializing in the topic and method. The instrument was divided into four sections with 46 questions. Most were multiple-choice questions, and some were mandatory; without answering those questions, the participant could not proceed with the questionnaire. The questions addressed:1. Sociodemographic data (age, gender identity, education, sexual orientation, type of relationship, country, state, place of residence); 2. Psychological well-being and coping strategies used during the shelter-in-place orders.The 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), validated for the Brazilian context (Souza & Hidalgo, 2012) , was used to assess psychological well-being. It comprises five items rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with a total score ranging from 0 to 25. WHO-5 was designed to measure psychological well-being for the 2 weeks prior to completing the scale. Scores below 20 indicate the presence of depressive disorder (Souza & Hidalgo, 2012) , and scores equal to or lower than 13 indicate impaired well-being (Bech, 2004) . Thus, psychological well-being was classified as low (≤ 13 points), moderate (14 to 19 points), or high (≥ 20 points).3. Sexual practices and activities during the pandemic, i.e., casual sex (Carvalho et al., 2020) , sex with the consumption of drugs (Sousa et al., 2020a, b) ' use of condoms, protection strategies, the strategy used to search for partners, frequency of sexual encounters, and protective measures against COVID-19. 4. Sexual practice and activities before the pandemic (use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis; strategies to search for partners; knowledge regarding STIs and testing), were assessed retrospectively. Adherence to social distance measures was defined as avoiding personal contact with people outside one's household for non-essential activities. ""Partial"" isolation was considered when an individual had direct and recurrent contact with people outside his/her household, and total isolation when there was no direct contact. The guidelines concerning the presence of signs and symptoms and other clinical variables provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health were used to define suspect cases of COVID-19 (Brazil, 2020b) . For security reasons, the form used to collect data was hosted by a specific site that enabled only one response per IP (Internet protocol).Data Analysis and Statistical Software (STATA), version 12.0 was used for data analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used. Bivariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test, estimating prevalence and crude prevalence ratio (PR), with a 95% confidence interval.Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson's regression analysis with robust variation. The outcome variable (psychological well-being) was included in the analysis, along with each of the associated independent variables with p value ≤ 0.20. The stepwise procedure was used. The sequence in which each term was inserted in the model was determined by a simultaneous analysis of theoretical relevance criteria and statistical significance obtained in the bivariate analysis. Each term was added or removed from the model after identifying the statistical significance (p value < 0.05), stability of the power of association, and Akaike information criterion (AIC), defining the useful subset of terms. All variables with a 5% statistical significance remained in the final model. To determine the best final model, the one with the lowest AIC value was selected.The research project was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and the University of São Paulo. All the users signed free and informed consent forms before proceeding with the questionnaire.A total of 2646 men who have sex with men participated, 1921 (72.6%) of whom were referred by their partners or friends from other social networks. A plurality of the men presented moderate psychological well-being (47.7%), followed by those with high well-being (44.4%), while a prevalence ratio of 7.9% experienced low well-being. Most were aged from 18 to 29 years old (69.9%), with an average age of 31 years old (min. 18 and max. 60; SD ± 8.4). Most were single (67.2%) and fully complying with shelter-inplace orders (72.1%), with a duration of social isolation between 30 and 45 days (58.1%), and decreased consumption of alcohol (43.1%) ( Table 1) .The bivariate analysis of factors associated with psychological well-being showed statistical association with age (p < 0.001), relationship status (p < 0.001), and social isolation (p < 0.001).Being 18 to 29 years old, in a polyamorous relationship, and not complying with shelter-in-place orders, the prevalence of low psychological well-being increased by a multiple of 3, 2, and 7, respectively. Social isolation increased the frequency of low psychological well-being by 47%. Other findings are presented in Table 2 .The variable ""type of partner"" was excluded from the multivariate analysis because it presented collinearity with relationship status (VIF = 7.37). The association between the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and testing for COVID-19 was not statistically significant but remained in the model as a confounding adjustment because the model presented a lower AIC.The following variables were associated with low psychological well-being: being in the youngest age group (PR 2.76; CI95% 1.90-4.01), being in a polyamorous relationship (PR 2.78; CI95% 1.51-5.11), not complying with social isolation measures (PR 6.27; CI95% 4.42-8.87), not using social media to find partners (PR 1.63; CI95% 1.06-2.53), having a higher number of sexual partners (PR 1.80; CI95% 1.04-3.11), having a reduced number of sexual partners (PR 2.67; CI95% 1.44-4.95), and group sex (PR 1.82; CI95% 1.23-2.69) ( Table 3 ).MSM living in Brazil experienced a lower sense of wellbeing during the shelter-in-place orders implemented to restrain the spread of COVID-19, as more than half of the participants presented some level of impairment in terms of psychological well-being. The variables that most frequently contributed to this outcome include those related to social isolation/distancing (adherence to social distancing measures and use of social media to find sexual partners during the sheltering-in-place period) and variables Presence of symptoms related to adopted sexual behaviors (with a variation in the number of partners, having a casual sexual partner, having a polyamorous relationship, or having group sex during the sheltering-in-place period). The declining indicators of psychological well-being among MSM are worth noting. In a devastating context, such as that of a pandemic, access to psychosocial support networks and the individuals' socioaffective network is considerably weakened and even absent in some instances, potentially intensifying these individuals' vulnerability from the perspective of mental health and social well-being. For instance, the sudden rupture in socioaffective networks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, not having access to nightlife or leisure activities, not meeting friends and not participating in groups of belonging, not having intimate and sexual encounters, not being able to maintain affective relationships, and the restriction of interactions to a virtual environment or small groups, may be quite challenging. For this reason, the context of the current pandemic requires we consider the quality or lack of social interactions and how these situations impact the psychological wellbeing of people as psychological triggers. Factors such as loneliness, change in routine, sense of abandonment, fear, loss of financial stability, or unemployment might be intensified (Schmidt et al., 2020) . This context is likely to cause anxiety, decision conflicts, decreased self-esteem and interest in life, suicidal behavior, eating and sleep disorders, and alcohol or drug abuse among MSM (Pedrosa et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020) . These individuals may become involved in risk practices and expose themselves to the SARS-CoV-2 because they are too distressed over the prolonged social distancing measures, miss social interaction with people, or find restricted mobility to be objectionable (Sousa et al., 2020a, c) . Additionally, opportunities to find affective and sexual partners decreased during the period of social isolation, with such efforts largely restricted to online platforms and social networks. This may also negatively affect these individuals' psychological well-being and impact their mental health (Sousa et al., 2020a; Carvalho et al., 2020) .In this study, a greater prevalence of low psychological well-being was found among MSM who did not report the use of social media to find partners, revealing that even though social media is considered to be associated with sex, it may play a protective role in times of social distancing by enabling social interactions, even if remotely. The results from a multi-center study show that 95% of its MSM sample was (totally or partially) complying with social distancing measures, which resulted in a drop in the number of partners and relationships. At the same time, though, there was an increase in online interactions (Sousa et al., 2020b) .The study also reports that MSM devised strategies to keep interactions during the social distancing measures, reinforcing this study's findings that interactions, whether to seek or exchange content, are essential for MSM's psychological well-being. The study mentioned above addressed only sexual interactions, though, so inferences concerning other types of relationships are not possible. Interestingly, having a polyamorous relationship (three people or more) was associated with low psychological wellbeing. One hypothesis is that polyamorous relationships do not always occur under the same roof, implying that those involved may have to deal with distancing measures; that is, their contact with each other may be limited for lengths of time. Additionally, polyamorous relationships allow new people, outside one's place of shelter and with a possibly different history of exposure, to be included. In the case of physical contact, all those involved are exposed, which results in fear, and decreased psychological well-being. Consensual non-monogamy or polyamorous relationships have become an increasingly accepted affective and sexual experience, which contrasts with monogamous relationship patterns that are usually considered ideal in stable and committed relationships (Costa & Ribeiro-Gonçalves, 2020; Jowett, 2020) . This context has been intensified among sexual minorities, including MSM. We believe that the fact these individuals are involved in polyamorous relationships and are currently experiencing the impossibility of maintaining the frequency of affective and sexual encounters during the pandemic (impaired affective and sexual dynamics) are coupled with reduced leisure opportunities usually afforded by these relationships, decrease these men's psychological well-being. One cannot rule out the fact that MSM in polyamorous relationships usually have to live with stigma. This experience may be heightened in a pandemic, considering that exclusion and stigma among LGBT populations usually starts at home, within the family. These individuals may experience rejection and be ejected from their homes, causing some even to become homeless (Conley, Piemonte, Gusakova & Rubin, 2018; Conley, Matsick, Moors & Ziegler, 2017) .In line with this hypothesis, this study shows that having a larger number of sexual partners and practicing group sex was associated with low psychological wellbeing, which reinforces the hypothesis that having sex with casual partners implies exposure, which now includes the risk of acquiring sexually transmissible infections and/or COVID-19 (Stephenson et al, 2020) . Sex is a pleasurable practice to satisfy one's desire and improves an individual's general well-being. Group sex, which is usually a source of satisfaction, in a pandemic context, can lead to psychological distress afterward due to a fear of having being infected by COVID-19 (Sousa et al., 2020a, b, c) . Although these sexual practices, in the context of COVID-19, may incur risks, we have to bear in mind that such practices are diverse and vary in terms of the configurations and relationships involved, which requires a positive approach considering the specificities of each MSM group. Exposure to often unknown partners, or familiar partners who do not effectively adopt preventive measures, including those against COVID-19, increases the fear of being contaminated or anxiety over the possibility of presenting signs and symptoms of the disease, leading to low psychological well-being (Newman & Guta, 2020; Suen, Chan & Wong, 2020; Brennan, Card, Collict, Jolimore & Lachowsky, 2020) .Increased levels of anxiety, stress, uncertainty, worry, and fear may result in having multiple sexual partners and/ or having group sex, considering the constraining role of affective and sexual practices coupled with the advent of a novel infectious disease, for which an effective treatment or cure has not been devised thus far. Additionally, the COVID-19 epidemiological curve in Brazil at the time of data collection was ascending, with an expressive number of new cases and deaths . Concomitantly, there was an increase in the amount of information provided by the media, exposing the complexity of the disease and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, which also negatively impacts the individuals' psychological well-being (Gao et al., 2020) .The prevalence of low psychological well-being was approximately six times greater among MSM who did not comply or could not comply with the social isolation measures, reinforcing the hypothesis that even though the individuals may not comply with social distancing measures to seek interactions, exposure still may cause concerns (Sousa et al., 2020c; Newman & Guta, 2020) . This finding should be interpreted with caution, as this study did not assess the context in which people violated social isolation measures, socialized with roommates, family, or co-workers, or how people interpreted the questions. Additionally, we should consider that seeking social interactions might not be a matter of choice but rather a compulsive behavior, even though it implies a subsequent decrease in psychological well-being (Sanchez et al., 2020) .Nonetheless, having a small number of partners also negatively affected these individuals' psychological wellbeing. If, on the one hand, the individuals want to decrease exposure to protect themselves, on the other hand, not having the social support provided by relationships and partners, which would decrease the pandemic's harmful effects, could negatively affect these individuals' mental health (Sanchez et al., 2020; Carrico et al., 2020; Newman & Guta, 2020) . Although we know that social support is not only provided by relationships and partners, in a context of restricted interactions as experienced in the current pandemic context, these individuals assume a prominent role.Variation in the number of affective and sexual partners may have influenced and decreased the psychological wellbeing of MSM and is associated with the low psychosocial support resulting the measures imposed by Brazilian agencies to protect people or minimize the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate this finding in more detail. In Brazil, stress has been intensified among minority social groups, as their ""invisibility"" has been exposed along with a denial of rights, cuts in budgets previously designated for the LGBTQIA + population, and naturalized institutional homophobia (Folha de São Paulo, 2020).A lack of directives in public policy mainly affects the youngest segment of the MSM population, which in this study presented the highest prevalence of low psychological well-being, almost three times higher than among older MSM. The World Health Organization has shown concern with the youngest population segment within the overall context of the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly because these are the most vulnerable from not adhering to social isolation measures. An increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases, agglomerations, and non-adherence to public health measures to control the spread of Sars-CoV-2 has been found in countries already in the summer season (Young minds, 2020; Cohen & Bosk, 2020) .The Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) has proposed specific guidelines to promote mental health and strengthen psychosocial support in emergencies, as is the case for the COVID-19 pandemic. These guidelines focus on promoting people's psychological well-being and preventing and/or treating mental diseases (IASC, 2007) . These goals are achieved by employing multiple approaches that take into account biological, sociocultural, educational, and community characteristics, which should focus on reducing harm, promoting human rights and equality, social participation, and valorization of local resources and competencies, work via integrated support systems, and rehabilitation (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020; Fukuti et al., 2020) . Socio-affective networks are a significant source of access to protection, sociability, exchange, and the maintenance of MSM's psychological well-being and health. In the pandemic context, and even after the pandemic, supporting, strengthening, and disseminating these networks may be an effective strategy to improve levels of psychological well-being, decreasing the impact of social isolation, such as feelings of loneliness, heightened anxiety, and stress. This study's limitations include its design. Crosssectional studies do not support conclusions regarding causality; that is, longitudinal studies would allow better evidence of associations. Additionally, due to the need to comply with social distancing measures, population-based face-to-face interviews were not possible, except for the MSM who did not have access to the Internet and could not complete the electronic form. Finally, a probabilistic sampling procedure was not adopted here, which impedes the generalization of results to other contexts or countries, though the results do provide a situational diagnosis of the MSM's psychological well-being in the pandemic context.The factors associated with the MSM's low psychological well-being were as follows: belonging to the youngest age group, being in a polyamorous relationship, not complying with the social isolation measures, not using social media to find partners, having multiple sexual partners, having reduced the number of partners, and group sex.The planning and implementation of public policies and actions generally to promote psychological and mental well-being, intended to increase resilience among MSM are needed. Safe sexual strategies and behavior need to be promoted, along with the use of digital technologies to facilitate social relationships by enabling remote interactions. These measures can alleviate the harmful effects of the intensified psychological needs accruing from the pandemic context, social isolation measures, and maladaptive coping strategies.Author Contribution Sousa AFL and IACM conceptualized the study.

33fe99291e3d30e306e3bee51c1a7e3e2a0b81b5,The evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile during 2020: a data perspective *,"In December 2019, a group of patients from Wuhan, China, developed a respiratory set of symptoms, including atypical pneumonia and respiratory failure. A novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2, was later found to be the cause of this new disease [11, 19] . It was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [35] . A warning on the risk that this disease could create to the global health was sent around the world as early as January 14, 2020 [20, 5] . The virus rapidly spread to most countries in the world. The WHO declared the COVID-19 disease a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 [34] . Most countries have suffered severely from the COVID-19 pandemic. Spreads of the virus shifted from its original epicenter in China, to Europe, then the US, and later to Latin America. In mid-July, just over five months after the virus emerged in Wuhan, the Latin America's death toll from coronavirus surpassed North America's one, with Peru and Brazil as the epicenters accounting for most of the deaths in the region.We utilized Python 3.8 to handle the data and generate all figures presented in this study.The Chilean Ministry of Health reports new cases on a daily basis. A new case is defined as a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 with an RT-PCR test. Since April 29, 2020 Chile began to report both symptomatic and asymptomatic positive cases separately. All of this information is available at the Github repository from the Chilean Ministry of Sciences [29] . We consider data corresponding since the first case was reported in the country, until November 30, 2020 . This data does not specify the number of tested individuals.Regarding to the nature of the data, we point out that both daily new cases and daily RT-PCR tests exhibit oscillatory behaviours. We ascribe this to the fact that many laboratories that analyze RT-PCR tests in the country do not operate during weekends. Hence, in order to facilitate the analysis, we smooth out the data by considering a 7day central moving average. Both the original and smoothed curves are shown in the corresponding figures presented throughout this article, the former in lighter tones.The notification system Epivigila is a surveillance system utilized by physicians and specialists in Chile. It includes the results for positive cases of all notifiable diseases in Chile. COVID-19 was considered a disease within this surveillance system by the Chilean law on February 7, 2020 [25] . Epivigila has received all RT-PCR positive results for COVID-19 in the country every day since then. New COVID-19 cases are only counted when the corresponding RT-PCR test results are positive. The identification of positive cases is managed with the personal identification number (or R.U.N. for its acronym in Spanish), preventing duplication. The statistics on fatalities, on the other hand, include not only RT-PCR confirmed patients, but also those who were suspected to have died from COVID-19 or those who had COVID-19 and died from other pathologies, according to the doctor that filled out the death certificate.During the following 8 weeks after the first reported case, only few more cases were found in the country. In Figure 1 we observe a first small outbreak during March and the first days of April, mainly in theÑuble, Arica y Parinacota, Araucanía, and Magallanes regions, with an incidence number greater than 5 per 100,000 inhabitants. Magallanes reached about 20 daily new cases at the beginning of April, then slowly decreased its incidence number during the following two months. Smaller outbreaks were seen in the Biobío, Los Lagos and Los Ríos regions, with an incidence number of less than 5 per 100,000 inhabitants. Meanwhile, the rest of the regions of the country experimented no significant rise in the number of positive cases.The country's main wave started within the first days of May. It affected principally the Metropolitan, Tarapacá, and Antofagasta regions. During this wave, Chile reached a peak of 35 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants at mid-June, the highest recorded up to date. The Metropolitan region reached about 60 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, whereas Tarapacá's maximum incidence number was roughly 35 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. On the other hand, the region of Antofagasta culminated during the second half of June in almost 40 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. By the end of May, the Arica y Parinacota, Valparaíso, Maule, and O'Higgins regions saw the beginning of their first important waves of infection, reaching a maximum incidence number of approximately 15, 15, 15, and 25 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants at mid-July, respectively. The Coquimbo, Biobío, andÑuble regions took a minor role in the country's main wave, all of them reaching around 10 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants starting June.During July, the incidence number grew in the Arica y Parinacota and Atacama region, and in a lesser extent in the region of Coquimbo. They reached about 45, 40, and 15 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants at the end of the month. Starting September, new waves were observed in Arica y Parinacota, and Maule regions. At the same time, at the beginning of this month, a considerable increment of daily new cases took place in the southern regions of Araucanía, Los Ríos, Los Lagos, Aysén, and Magallanes. As of November 30, 2020 the incidence number in the Araucanía, Los Ríos, and Los Lagos regions appear to have peaked at 15, 20, and 20 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. In the Aysén region, on the other hand, the incidence number decreased to under 10 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In the region of Magallanes the incidence number surpassed the 100 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants-the highest incidence number seen so far in a region of Chile-and appeared to have stabilized at around 40 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants starting mid-October.During the whole period of study, the incidence number inÑuble has remained low compared to other the regions mentioned above and erratically between 5 and 15 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants since mid-May, with no clear waves. The Biobío region, on the other hand, also presents a special behaviour, with an incidence number increasing slowly and consistently from 10 daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants at the end of June, to 15 by the end of November. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the evolution of both the testing capacity and daily new cases in Chile as a whole, and for each of the 16 major administrative regions in the country. In Figure 2 we observe that the testing capacity of the Chilean healthcare system remained under 0.5 daily RT-PCR tests per 1,000 inhabitants until the end of March. At the beginning of April, it started to increase steadily, and reached approximately 0.8 in the first days of June during the peak of new daily new cases in Chile (cf. Figure 1 ). The majority of these tests were made in the Metropolitan Region (cf. Figure 3 ). After remaining almost constant for about a month, daily RT-PCR started to increase rapidly again up to roughly 1.5 in mid-August. The testing capacity continued to increase slowly to reach a stable value of approximately 1.7 daily tests per 1,000 inhabitants in mid-October. There is a remarkable exception in the increase of number of tests performed daily during the national holidays, celebrated September 18 to September 20, 2020 where the testing capacity decreased momentarily. The northern regions Arica y Parinacota, Tarapacá, Atacama, and Antofagasta, and the southern regions, Los Lagos, and Magallanes, showed a rapid increase in testing capacity during July, surpassing 1.5 daily RT-PCR tests per 1000 inhabitants at the end of the month. Some of these regions, Arica y Parinacota, Antofagasta, Los Lagos and Magallanes were even able to keep over 2 daily RT-PCR per 1000 inhabitants until the end of the period of study. Of the latter, the Magallanes region has attained the highest testing capacity among all the 16 Chile has been one of the most affected countries in the world by the COVID-19 disease, in terms of number of cases and fatalities per capita. By July, 2020 Chile had the highest number of total cases per capita in the world. It was also the ninth country in the world in terms of fatalities per capita; [30] . In addition, Chile became the sixth country in the world by means of number of confirmed cases [13] . One of the reasons for this phenomenon could be the weather, since the first wave of COVID-19 arrived to Chile at beginning of the autumn season, similarly to what it was recently reported in Norway; see, e.g. [24] . From Section 3 it transpires that the epidemic in Chile can be described as asynchronous and diverse in nature in each of its 16 major administrative regions. These differences may be explained by several factors. Some of them are the great differences in geography, population density, and urbanization of each region. While the northernmost regions are mainly dominated by arid weather, the central regions enjoy Mediterranean weather. The rest of the country, on the other hand, is ruled by an oceanic and colder weather. Moreover, some regions are highly urbanized (e.g. Metropolitan region), whereas others still have a great amount of people living in rural areas (e.g.Ñuble region); see, for instance, [26] . Differences in transport connectivity between regions may have also played a major role in the evolution of the epidemic. The Chilean territory from the north to the Los Lagos region is well connected by land, whereas Aysén and Magallanes regions are virtually isolated in this sense. With respect to air traffic, the major airports of the country located in the Arica y Parinacota, Metropolitan, Biobío and Tarapacá regions. They have served as important focuses of infection at the beginning of the spread; the restrictions in international and domestic flights were only applied after 11 days after the report of the first confirmed case. We highlight that the Metropolitan region's main airport as the main source of imported contagions, as it is the principal international airport in Chile. Regardless of these restrictions, many routine flights, considered essential for the nation, continued operating during the whole period of study.The first contagions of the country were most probably of imported origin. In fact, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Chile was an individual returning from vacations in Southeast Asia. The majority of the subsequent cases along the country during March and April, 2020 corresponded to returning citizens, foreign tourists, and people who interacted with them. In mid-March, an outbreak was declared at a gymnasium in the city of Chillán, in theÑuble region [23] ; 21 people were confirmed to have been infected by a foreign visitor. Another 6 people were later linked to this same outbreak. By the end of March and the beginning of April, the Magallanes region suffered its first wave. The Chilean government soon conjectured that the outbreak was due to the arrival of several cruise ships transporting tourists of diverse nationalities [9, 7] . After the report of 155 confirmed cases in the country, the Chilean government acknowledged community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus along the country, and announced the closure of the Chilean borders in March 16, 2020 [15] .In mid-May, about two weeks after the beginning of the main wave in the Metropolitan region, the neighboring regions of Coquimbo, Valparaiso, O'Higgins and Maule also initiated their main waves. Much probably, they got heavily contaminated by the Metropolitan region due to land proximity and easy land connectivity, as they do not have important airports. The Coquimbo region, interestingly, was able to initially contain this outbreak during mid-June, which later resurfaced in July and August.Simultaneously to the aforementioned regions, the northern regions of Tarapacá and Antofagasta, distant from the Metropolitan Region, also suffered rapid outbreaks. This behavior is probably due to maintained air traffic with the Metropolitan region for mining activity issues, which did not stop for being considered essential. The Atacama region, also with important mining activity, was able to initially avoid rapid increments in daily new cases. Although, during July and August, a violent increment in new cases was seen.On the other hand, the northernmost region Arica y Parinacota also started to suffer a rapid increase in its daily new cases at the end of May. This outbreak was controlled during June, to then heavily reappeared during July and August. Despite not having important mining centers, the region possesses one of the fourth most important airports in the country, strongly connected with the one of the Metropolitan region and the virtually only way of passenger transport to central Chile. Most surely, the virus reached the region through this airport.The southern regions of Los Ríos and Araucanía managed to keep the incidence below 5 daily new cases per 1000 inhabitants until mid-August. The Los Lagos region accomplished similar results until the beginning of July. These behaviors are fairly impressive as winters there are usually rough. We assume this slow spread was due to better isolation and preparation, thanks to the experience gained from the central and northern Chile. The Aysén region, the least-populated and second vastest region of the country, had reported only 124 cases in total (about 0.1% of its population) until the beginning of September, when a rapid outbreak started. We consider that the region managed to practically seclude from the virus for a long period of time due to its virtual land-isolation and low rates of stranger arrivals. It is important to notice that, in pre-pandemic times, the region characterizes for receiving a great amount of foreign tourists every year.TheÑuble region, has evidenced the most erratic behaviour among all the 16 regions of Chile, with constant increases and decreases in the number of daily new cases. We explain this phenomenon based on the fact that approximately 30.6 % of the population in theÑuble region lives in rural areas, making it the most rural region of the country [26] . We speculate that great part of small waves presented during the period of study correspond to localized outbreaks, which were effectively contained mainly due to the facility in isolation that rurality provides. The fact that there is no airport in the region may have also served to prevent further spread.With about 9% of its population already infected and an incidence above 110 daily new cases per 1000 inhabitants during mid-September, the Magallanes region has been the most affected region of the country. The majority of the epidemic in the region is explained by its capital Punta Arenas, which concentrates approximately 75% of the population of the Magallanes region. We speculate that, after the recovery from the outbreak experimented in June-July-which was part of the national's main wave-and due to the consequent resumption of great part of flights connecting with the rest of the regions (especially the Metropolitan region), Magallanes received a considerable number of imported cases. This, combined with the fact that the principal trading and administrative activity of the region are concentrated in a few blocks of Punta Arenas, might have triggered the enormous outbreak.Chile has done an outstanding effort in enhancing the current molecular biology laboratories and opening new public, private, university-based laboratories. The country has shown a sustained increase in testing capacity during the whole period of study. As of October 23, 2020, this has allowed Chile to have the first place in testing per capita capacity in Latin America [8] , keeping over 1 daily RT-PCR per 1,000 inhabitants since the beginning of August and stabilizing in about 1.8 daily RT-PCR per 1,000 inhabitants during November (see Figure 2 ). At the same time, the utilization of the unified patient database notification system Epivigila, have made it possible to ensure a faithful and strong database.Nevertheless, we stress that much probably there was a significant subreport during the the beginning of the pandemic, especially during the main wave that took place in May-June; the testing capacity there was below 1 daily RT-PCR per 1,000 inhabitants. This initial deficit in testing capacity, due to lack of proper instalments and equipment, resulted in that testing was performed predominantly in symptomatic cases, leaving virtually apart close contacts and with scarce active search strategies.During the peak period of the first wave (mid May to end of June) the rapid growth in testing capacity caused delays in rendering times due to both delay in the processing of RT-PCR tests and the subsequent rendering of results to available centralized databases. For this reason, in this study we do not consider active cases for our reports due to the differences in waiting time for RT-PCR results, with delays that could result in many new cases counted as such only after their 14 days isolation period had ended.The results of containment strategies have varied significantly among the country. Most of the regions required lockdowns at a municipality level, with the exception of the Metropolitan Region that required an early complete lockdown for 2 months, and was even longer for certain municipalities within it. Highest population density and dense transportation system could explain the biggest outbreak in Metropolitan Region and the difficulty of containing/restraining it. We analyze outbreak dynamics at a regional level, so we cannot see inter municipality differences. According to [3] , different socioeconomic conditions and mobility can play an important role in differences in lockdown effectiveness that are seen when comparing municipalities from one same region. Despite the country's preparedness, and the good development status of ICUs in Chile, a high CFR was observed as of November 30, 2020 (see Table 1 )-the CFR of the A/H1N1 influenza epidemic in Chile in 2009 is estimated in 0.9 % [17] . The cause for this is probably multifactorial: High incidence of comorbidities such as overweight and obesity (about 74 % of the adult population are overweight or obese [14] ), hypertension (approximately 27.6 % of the population suspects of suffering hypertension [16] ), and smoking (33.3 % of the population smoke regularly [16] ), among others; health system saturation during peak period, especially emergency rooms, and delay in consultation of severe cases due to population's ignorance about the severity of the sickness. In [6] it was found that increasing COVID-19 caseloads were associated with countries with higher obesity, higher median population age and longer time to border closures from the first reported case and increased mortality per million was significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence. On the contrary, per capita gross domestic product and reduced income dispersion reduced mortality. Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people.We presented notable differences in behaviour of outbreak dynamics-incidence, testing capacity and fatalities-among all 16 major administrative regions of Chile. We argued on geographical and demographics differences as possible explanations to this behavior. We decided to leave out the data corresponding to December 2020 as the holidays impacted the behaviour of the pandemic in a great manner due to the holidays (including shopping, gatherings, travelling, and more).The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

3ad66a91f94a1b6ddb5fb4931a07dfe85893a5b9,Smart testing and critical care bed sharing for COVID-19 control,"Brazil has struggled deeply to curb the transmission of COVID-19. The first case in Brazil was officially reported in late February 2020, after which the number of daily deaths increased rapidly in April and May, plateaued for several months, and then slowly declined in October before resurging in November and December [1] [2] [3] . Meanwhile, the number of daily new cases has risen sharply, and more than 6 months into the crisis, the country has failed to control transmission. A key reason for this failure is the lack of testing strategies and infrastructure. For example, the total stock of RT-PCR test kits for the entire first month of the pandemic, March 2020, was 27,000 for a country with 210 million inhabitants [4] . At a similar stage of the pandemic, roughly the same number of tests were performed daily in Germany, with a population of about 83 million. A similar pattern of daily cases and deaths has been observed in other countries where the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds is limited and an efficient and organised testing program has been slow to come into effect.One major unresolved question is whether such a low testing capacity has any utility in helping to curb the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the need for restrictive social-distancing measures. Another handicap faced in many countries is the lack of reliable mechanisms for contact tracing. To be effective, tracing needs massive digital data integration as well as measures to ensure the training and safety of personnel [5, 6] . The heterogeneous society typical in developing countries adds another layer of complexity. In most countries, the requisite infrastructure is concentrated around hub cities, far from commuter towns. In this situation, nonlinear effects resulting from the high degree of population mobility makes the decision of optimal test distribution a real challenge [7, 8] . In their efforts to control transmission, policymakers struggle to choose where, when, and how many test kits should be distributed when only a limited number is available. In the present report, we describe a strategy based on readily obtainable data to assist decision-makers in this process.We designed a data-driven smart testing strategy capable of exploring population mobility patterns and ICU bed allocation methods to plan the spatiotemporal distribution of test kits throughout Sao Paulo, a state in Brazil. We integrate anonymised data from mobile devices, census records, and ICU bed usage across multiple areas of the state into an optimisation framework in a complex network of cities. The approach generates a city-to-city interaction model of COVID-19 transmission and uses testing to alleviate the intensity of social-distancing measures and to decrease the pressure on the healthcare system through ICU bed occupancy. Smart testing explores the heterogeneous evolution of viral transmission and can take advantage of mobility patterns in such a way that it efficiently controls spreading in large populations, even when little to no testing is done in population hubs. Indeed, we show that the smart testing strategy is far superior to hub-focused or on-demand testing at reducing the need for mitigation measures.We provide an analysis for the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil, where all relevant data were collected. Sao Paulo state has a population of 44 million, and as is common in developing countries, its inhabitants are heterogeneously distributed with a major concentration in and around its capital, the city of Sao Paulo. We first assumed that no tests were available and that spreading must be controlled solely by social distancing, thus requiring closure of nonessential services to attain the desired reproduction number. Then, we compared three testing strategies by analysing how each one could help to relax social-distancing measures while concurrently reducing the burden on the healthcare system. Smart testing was the superior strategy among those considered. Finally, we analysed a scenario similar to the experienced situation in many countries in which mitigation measures are abandoned after 5 months of control and inhabitants live freely but following sanitary measures. We found that while smart testing alone may be insufficient to completely safeguard the healthcare system, this could be achieved by introducing a policy of ICU bed sharing between three regions of the state (Sao Paulo city, metropolitan area, and state interior) and by exploiting the different rates at which the disease evolves in these regions. Thus, smart testing succeeds in maintaining an effective healthcare system in a control-free society.Assuming that a positive test for COVID-19 alters an individual's behaviour, testing programs affect the mobility patterns of infected individuals who commute between home and work and thus generates nonlinear interactions between regions of the state. Smart testing is capable of exploring the mobility network, heterogeneous stages of disease spreading, and ICU occupancy to plan timely targeted tests in areas that will benefit the whole state. To enable smart testing, we need data on: (i) epidemiological trajectories in each region, (ii) time series of ICU occupancy in each area, (iii) a mobility matrix between regions of the state, (iv) number of daily tests that can be performed, and(v) social-distancing criteria. Smart testing then solves an optimisation problem and the output of the algorithm is a spatiotemporal distribution of tests in the state. Supplementary Note 1 provides a flow chart of the required data, and more details on the input data and model are given in the Methods. While the data associated with items (i)-(iv)can be collected easily, the input (v) is flexible and can be tailored in response to specific situations. Mathematically, this translates into a certain objective function that mirrors the measures the government wishes to impose. Here, the objective function study was defined as follows.The main goal of mitigation measures is to prevent healthcare system collapse by decreasing the value of r i (t), the effective reproduction number in the ith area, for all areas. This can be achieved by applying various mitigation measures [9, 10] . The setting casts r i (t) as a control variable in an optimal control framework that is then approximated by an optimisation problem. We model each area of the state as an SEIQR model coupled via a mobility matrix (see Methods for details), and a variant of the SEIQR model where the effects of quarantine are described as an effective reproduction number is discussed in Supplementary Note 5.With the given data, the platform calibrates a time series to predict the fraction of infected individuals who will require an ICU bed for each day. Based on a probabilistically constrained approach with a confidence level of 90%, maximum ICU bed occupancy remains below the local capacity in all regions. The objective function combines different terms to achieve a balance that provides the most relaxed mitigation measures after the minimisation process.Typical terms are the mean deviation between r i (t) and r 0 (basic reproductive number), a total variation term to avoid too abrupt changes in the control, and terms promoting an alternation of strict measures in nearby cities (see Methods).To assess the impact of testing strategies, we calibrate the model to the region of interest, as described in Supplementary Note 2. Here, we provide a full analysis for the state of Sao Paulo, where we gathered all necessary data (see Methods). In Supplementary Note 3, we also discuss the impact of a smart testing strategy in the early stages of spreading in New York City (NY, USA).Sao Paulo is the largest and richest state of the Brazilian federation and declared full statewide social-distancing measures in late March, 2020. By the end of September, the government-driven testing infrastructure could perform daily COVID-19 RT-PCR tests at the rate of 750 per million inhabitants, which is about 50% of the capacity of most European countries. Thus, whether such a low per capita testing rate can help to reduce transmission is unclear. The healthcare system in Brazil is organised into local health administrative areas composed of several closely situated cities that share an ICU bed administration system to facilitate allocation. For our study, Sao Paulo state was divided into 22 local health care areas, and we estimated the flow of inhabitants travelling between them by using geolocalised mobile phone data between cities. Combined with demographic information, these datasets enable interactions between areas to be described in the context of COVID-19 spreading. The location of the administrative areas in Sao Paulo state are presented in Figure 1 , along with snapshots of the actual epidemic trajectory and actual ICU occupancy on the first day of our study, which spanned approximately 390 days between July 1, 2020 and July 31, 2021.The disease evolution within the state is captured by the epidemiological model in Figure 1 . At any given time, inhabitants are considered to be in one of five states: susceptible (green), incubating (pink), infected (red), quarantined (blue), and recovered (grey), and possible transitions between these states are also indicated in Figure 1 . During working hours, the flow of workers commuting into (or out of) the ith city can increase or decrease the effective population compared with the city's stable resident population. Other than those in quarantine, we assume individuals continue with their daily commutes between cities. See Methods and references therein for further details. quarantined (Q, blue), and recovered (R, grey). If the local health administrative area has been targeted for testing, inhabitants with COVID-19 symptoms who seek healthcare are isolated, tested, and only allowed to leave quarantine if the test result is negative or they regain health. (e) By optimising the distribution of tests together with targeted social-distancing measures, we succeed in alleviating the burden on the healthcare system and at the same time allow relaxing of travel restrictions throughout the whole state.The model assumes the basic reproductive number with sanitary measures is r 0 = 1.8 (the value observed for the second wave in Germany [11] ). We provide full model details and the parameter values in Methods. Supplementary Note 2 explains the calibration process. We assume that (i) individuals with COVID-19 symptoms seek healthcare and receive the RT-PCR test (if that local health administration is currently testing); (ii) the success detection probability of the test is 80% [11] ); (iii) individuals seek healthcare within 3 days after they become infectious (τ = 3); (iv) tested individuals await the test result in isolation and are allowed to leave quarantine only if the test result is negative or they regain health, in which case they join the recovered compartment; and (v) the proportion of false positive tests (uninfected individuals who tested positive) is negligible and has no impact on our results.The model assumes the basic reproductive number with sanitary measures is r 0 = 1.8 (this is the value for the second wave in Germany [11] ). We provide full model details and the parameter values in Methods. Supplementary Note 2 explains the calibration process. It is considered that individuals with SARS symptoms seeking the healthcare system take the RT-PCR type test if the local health area has been targeted for testing. We assume that the tests have an efficiency of 80%, that is, 80% of infected individuals can be detected [12] . We also assume that individuals seek health assistance τ = 3 days after they become infectious. Tested individuals wait for the result in isolation and are only allowed to leave quarantine either if the result is negative or once healthy again (in both cases, they join the recovered compartment). The size of the contingent of uninfected individuals who tested negative is negligible and has no impact on our results.Our key proposal is to coordinate social-distancing measures with the geographical and temporal distribution of tests. The base case, taken as reference, considers the evolution of the viral transmission rate if no tests are performed and the sole mitigation measure is social distancing [13] .In the absence of tests, we compute r i no test (t), the maximum value that the reproduction number attains while keeping ICU occupancy below 90% of the capacity in the ith area. When r i no test (t) = r 0 , the basal reproduction number of the new normal, there are no travel restrictions. Next, we compute the reproduction number r i test (t) of an area under a testing protocol. If testing reduces the need for mitigation measures (i.e., relaxing mobility restrictions without burdening the healthcare system), thenWhen the computed values of r i test (t) remain close to r 0 , this means that testing alone is sufficient to control transmission. However, this is still dependent to a large extent on the history of ICU occupancy and the time between infection and receiving a positive test result. We will address this scenario later by analysing synergy between smart testing and bed sharing.To compare different strategies, we define the efficiency of a testing protocol as follows. Given the reproduction number r i test (t) of the ith local health area under a testing protocol at time t, improvement (i.e., openning of nonessential services) due to testing can be measured in terms of an increase in the reproduction number, relative to the base case, without testing:. These values are weighed by the population N i of the local health area with respect to N state , the state population, so that the efficiencywill be positive if testing improves mitigation measures in the ith area at time t. It might happen that µ i (t) < 0 for a particular day t. However, the goal of the smart testing strategy is to increase the reproduction number of the state as a whole. Therefore, we introduce the efficiency q for the state. Suppose that K represents all regions and that the testing protocol was conducted during D days, totalling M months. The overall efficiency of the testing protocol is the mean of the individual efficiencies, averaged over the regions and months:In our calculations, each protocol is applied for M = 6 months and D is about 183. Since µ i (t) was weighted by the population, the overall efficiency q requires no further normalisation.We assume that the state of Sao Paulo performs 750 tests per million inhabitants per day. Under this cap we compare three scenarios: (i) smart testing; (ii) testing on demand; that is, the number of tests is proportional to the percentage of infected individuals in the local population; and (iii) testing only in large urban hubs. The last two configurations capture nonlinear effects induced by the concentration of the economic infrastructure in the large cities, which forces a large portion of the population to commute to work daily. Figure 2 summarises our results. Testing in all three scenarios leads to improvement; however, the efficiency q of testing only in hubs and testing on demand are both 35%, whereas the efficiency of smart testing is vastly superior at 65%.Testing on demand places the greatest pressure on the hubs such as Sao Paulo city, where the majority of cases are concentrated (Figure 2d -f), whereas smart testing exploits the mobility network and finds optimal solutions that require virtually no testing in the hubs (Figure 2a-c) . Instead, the smart strategy focuses on testing key areas while considering ICU occupancy. Remarkably, this strategy leads to an efficiency in the main hub Sao Paulo city as high as when only the hubs are tested. A notable effect of smart testing is that it synergistically generates a collective improvement in the efficiency of testing for the whole state. This results from exploiting the mobility between local health areas and the nonlinear effects emerging from the different stages of the evolution of the disease across the state. It is also striking that the decisions taken with smart testing are not straightforwardly explained by mobility alone.We now focus on a pressing societal issue by analysing whether it is possible to reduce or eliminate social distancing control measures, which often leads to the re-emergence of infectious diseases [14] . Here, we aim to control disease spreading after relaxing social distancing by deploying smart testing and coordinated ICU bed sharing alone.Starting from July 1, 2020, we impose mitigation measures for 140 days and then compare the epidemic trajec- Based on the low daily test capacity and the temporal lag between disease emergence in Sao Paulo city and the interior regions, the smart testing strategy would suggest that testing in rural areas can begin later than in the metropolitan area. Our experiments show that, even allowing for the lag in regional transmission, increasing the daily test capacity up to 7-fold would still be insufficient to prevent the overload of the health system. Thus, a mechanism in which ICU beds are shared between Sao Paulo city and hospitals in the state interior might offer a potential solution.Indeed, we observe a significant improvement in the ICU usage when simulating a partnership between hospitals to share ICU beds for exclusive use by patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection [16, 17] .The three macro regions of Sao Paulo state to be considered are: Sao Paulo city (population 11.9 million), Sao Paulo metropolitan area (9.4 million), and the interior of the state (23 million), which account for 27%, 21%, and 52%of the state's population, respectively (Figure 3a) . Under normal conditions, there are 4310 ICU beds in Sao Paulo state, of which 80%, 11%, and 9% are located in Sao Paulo city, the metropolitan area, and the interior, respectively.Considering this unequal distribution of total ICU beds available, we assume that (i) only ICU beds in Sao Paulo city are shared with the other two regions, which reduces the ICU capacity for Sao Paulo city itself; and (ii) the mechanism of ICU bed allocation from Sao Paulo city to the other two regions is based on demographic data. Thus, under the ICU bed sharing agreement, 71.2%, 13.4%, and 15.4% of the total ICU beds are available for Sao Paulo city, the metropolitan area, and the interior, respectively (Figure 3b, c) .In this ICU bed sharing scenario, smart testing with a low daily cap of 750 tests per million inhabitants suffices reduce a peak in the ICU usage for the metropolitan area. For the interior area, having shared beds is more relevant than testing, resulting in a 50% increase in the ICU capacity. Thus, combining smart testing and ICU bed sharing to accommodate the heterogeneous infrastructure of the state is not only beneficial to prevent the overload of the healthcare system but can control disease spreading without additional social-distancing measures.The results reported in Figure 3 were obtained under the premise that susceptible individuals seek healthcare assistance and are tested by RT-PCR τ = 1 day after experiencing symptoms. If, in contrast, there is a delay of τ = 3 days between symptom emergence and testing, our simulations show that testing and ICU bed sharing combined will not be sufficient to halt disease spreading. In other words, if τ = 3, restricting travel becomes mandatory. This analysis is in agreement with the efforts being made worldwide to urgently deploy rapid and reliable COVID-19 tests [18] .Control of COVID-19 transmission in low-middle-income societies has been hampered by a scarcity of key resources, including ICU beds, RT-PCR kits, and qualified testing facilities. Although the imminent arrival of effective SARS- Cov-2 vaccines is expected to reduce transmission, it is unlikely that they will be distributed worldwide until the end of 2021. In the meantime, vaccination distribution strategies will initially focus on reducing morbidity and mortality of key subpopulations (healthcare workers and older adults) while maintaining the most critical essential services (healthcare workers engaged in vaccine delivery, teachers, and school staff). Assuming these expectations are satisfied, smart testing strategies of vulnerable populations remain our best hope to curb COVID-19 transmission and preserve the economic health of these societies.The World Health Organization first called for massive COVID-19 testing in March 2020, and in line with this, we analysed the effect of smart testing in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Our study explored how smart testing can assist in reducing transmission despite challenges due to a low daily testing capacity, unequal healthcare infrastructure, and the evolution of COVID-19 in different areas of the state. Under these adverse conditions, it is critical that we determine how best to handle test distribution in terms not only of where to send kits but also how many and when. To be most effective, these scarce testing resources must be properly deployed. As described in this study, we proposed a smart testing strategy based on mathematical optimisation of test distribution and compared its effectiveness with that of other mitigation protocols.In all of the configurations considered, the contribution of testing to control of COVID-19 was significant. Interestingly, the smart testing option was far superior to the on-demand testing and hub-only testing scenarios, reaching an efficiency of 65% compared with 35%. This level of improvement was obtained by considering travel patterns, the state infrastructure, local heterogeneities in disease spreading, and stress imposed on different regional healthcare systems. Our analysis highlights the importance of tests that can deliver results rapidly and also reveals that, even with rapid and reliable testing, not all surges in infection could be controlled by increasing the number of daily tests alone, and that an ICU bed sharing policy may be necessary, especially if daily testing capacity is low. The results and conclusions of this study are robust across models.By employing data integration and optimisation over a complex network, smart testing provides a striking improvement in the quality of transmission mitigation measures, thereby allowing populations to more rapidly return to pre-pandemic activities. The methodology is applicable to any country facing similar challenges of limited testing capabilities and a highly mobile workforce. The approach can also be easily adapted to accommodate new waves of spreading, and can incorporate more precise medical data on the mechanism of COVID-19 transmission as that becomes available.In countries such as Brazil, where control of the pandemic is in the hands of local state and city administrations rather than the federal government, some relatively affluent cities invested heavily in testing as a means to curb local transmission. This effort was in vain, however, and our analysis using smart testing delivers a strong message; namely, it is better for all citizens if resources are shared with neighbours, and efforts to reduce transmission at individual and by the entries of the effective mobility matrix and the effective population, defined byrespectively. We consider ζ i = 1, which is the worst case and captures the fact that symptoms might appear after the individual becomes infectious [19] . Our simulations show that the results are stable in a range ζ ∈ [0. 8, 1] .Commuting modifies the population circulation, thus, we consider the productswhere:Next, considerNotice that F i is a nonlinear function of the state variables. Putting all these parameters together gives the following ordinary differential equations:ṠThe evolution depends on λ i (t), which determines the fraction of individuals identified as infectious when testing in the ith area at time t, supposing they are quarantined for T q days (we assume T q = 3T inf ).In practice, all patients with SARS need to be isolated thus going to the compartment Q while they wait for the test results. However, because of the initial conditions, at any given time S I, and the amount of susceptible individuals in the Q compartment is negligible when compared to the total susceptible population. Thus, we shall model the entry of infected individuals only in the Q compartment. In Supplementary Note 6, we discuss a variant of the model where the quarantine is captured as the time delay system of equations leading to effective reproduction number. We show that the results are robust across these models.To determine λ i (t), we note that out of the S sars individuals with COVID-19 symptoms who seek attention in the health care system, only C individuals will be infected with COVID-19 (with our data, C Ssars = 1/4). As a result, if there are #T i (t) tests performed in the ith area at time t and τ is the time in days elapsed between becoming infectious and seeking assistance, then the fraction of detected individuals iswhere η = 0.8 is the efficiency of the tests and where we shortened σ i (t) = C Ssars #T i (t). Other test-related constraintsand the relations i,t #T i (t) = T tot and #T i (t) ≤ T i cap , respectively limiting the total number of tests employed in the campaign, and setting the daily cap for each area. η Test efficiency 0.8 [22, 23] τ Time considered infectious before isolation 1 − 3 daysWe set a probabilistic constraint for the use of ICU beds in each area, considering that the percentage of infected population that needs intensive care at time t is uniform across the local health area. Based on the structure of the considered uncertainty, the constraint can be cast into a deterministic equivalent reformulation. The procedure is explained in details in [13] , we just mention a few key points here.Bed usage is estimated from the ratio v i I i k , where the numerator, a known data, is the capacity constraint v i t for the ith health area at time t. The denominator, an accumulation of sick individuals over ν days prior to t,represents the group among which a fraction may need critical care attention. Following [24] , the average number of days infected individuals typically spend in the ICU is ν ∈ [7, 10] and we use ν = 7 in our model.The ratio stochastic process is then approximated by a time series, whose parameters are calibrated using historical records of intensive care unit beds and new infected individuals in the region. With our data, the best fit was an autoregressive model of lag 2. Consequently, the ratio is approximated byIn this expression, the white noise ω t a random variable that is independent and identically distributed according to a normal distribution with zero mean and variance given by σ 2 ω . After calibration, the values for the parameters c 0 , c 1 , φ 1 , φ 2 , σ ω are known and can be used to make explicit the following constraintensuring the local hospital capacity will not be exceeded, with 90% probability. The explicit deterministic equivalent formulation of this chance constraint is an affine constraint on I, involving the inverse cumulative function of the standard Gaussian distribution, we refer to [13] for the complete development.Along the time horizon defined by the given initial and final times T 0 and T 1 , having K = 22 administrative health districts under consideration, the epidemiological state of the region at time t is characterised by the vector functionx(t) = (S, E, I, Q, R)(t) ∈ [0, 1] 5×K , for t ∈ [T 0 , T 1 ].As mentioned, the discretisation of the SEIQR system of differential equations is performed using a central finite differences scheme; see [13] . For Sao Paulo state specifically, this amounts to approximate the state function x(t) by a large-scale vector; for instance the component S(t) is replaced by S i t for i ∈ I = {1, . . . , K = 22} and t ∈ {1, . . . , 390}, and similarly for the control r i (t) and other variables, including the number of tests performed in each area, #T i (t). Accordingly, given the initial state x 0 and the basal reproduction number r 0 = 1.8, the mathematical optimization problem to be solved is a large-scale nonlinear program in the form The objective function ψ t depends on r t = (r 1 t , . . . , r K t ), and it can assess the control performance combining several terms.

807be319f83890bd6bb0b6521a46564a4445073b,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physicians Working in the Head and Neck Field,"Early reports on COVID-19 in China and in Iran, Italy, France, the UK and Greece soon recognized the occupational risk for professionals who deal with diseases of the upper aerodigestive tract. 1 The high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 reported in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx and oropharynx in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients suggest potential explanations for these high infection rates. 2, 3 Many institutions and medical societies in the fields of otolaryngology and head and neck cancer have suggested postponing non-urgent patient care, 1,4-8 leading to a reduction in the volume of outpatient appointments, exams and surgeries. 9,10 As a result, the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other non-COVID-19 progressive diseases may be delayed, thus impacting morbidity, mortality and treatment costs. [11] [12] [13] As the incidence curve of COVID-19 lowers, 14 resumption of elective care needs to be considered, taking into account challenges regarding the safety of patients and healthcare personnel (HCP), and the availability of proper personal protective equipment (PPE), specially within the context of care of underserved populations. The present study aimed to evaluate the current impact of the pandemic related to otolaryngology and head and neck cancer in Brazil, to compare results with those at the beginning of the outbreak, for trend analyses, and to identify difficulties in the resumption of elective care.Using the SurveyMonkey (SVMK Inc., San Mateo, CA, US) audience platform, a web-based survey was created to collect the demographic, professional and clinical-practice data of the responders. The target population consisted of otolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. The questionnaire consisted of 35 questions with different formats: multiple choice, dropdown lists, and text boxes, with the possibility of adding comments as open text in some questions. Specifically, data regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were collected on: 1) the number and type of outpatient appointments, surgeries and exams with the risk of generating aerosols; 2) the availability`of adequate PPE in different settings and practices; 3) the preparedness of the responder's health institution in developing strategies to manage COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients; 4) the economic and psychological burden on physicians; and 5) the measures planned for the resumption of elective care. Pilot testing of the survey was performed with members of the research team, and the questions were modified to improve readability and adequacy.A link to access the survey was distributed electronically, through email and social media, to members and participants of the Brazilian medical organizations ( The statistical analyses were performed using the Satistical Package for The Social Sciences (SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). Absolute and relative frequencies were reported for the qualitative data, and means, medians, standard deviations (SDs), interquartile ranges (percentile 25 [P25%]; percentile 75 [P75%]) or 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were used for the quantitative data. The categorical data were compared with Chi-squared (χ 2 ) tests, and the ordinal data, with the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney or Spearman tests (with the r s representing the correlation coefficient). Some analyses compared the present data with those of a previous survey, 9 with the same main questions, which collected answers five weeks earlier, while the number of cases were still rising in Brazil. The study was considered exploratory, and no sample size calculation or correction for multiple comparisons were performed.The survey was answered by 446 physicians; 145 head and neck surgeons, 224 otolaryngologists, 56 radiation oncologists, and 21 medical oncologists. The medical specialties were grouped in surgical and non-surgical specialties. The demographics and professional characteristics of the responders are shown in ►Table 1.Physicians self-rated their risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19: no risk ¼ 275 (61.7%); low risk ¼ 118 (26.5%); and high risk ¼ 53 (11.9%). The main reasons for the heightened perceived risk referred by 167 responders were: age (43%), hypertension (33%), obesity (16.2%), and pulmonary disease (13.8%).The survey showed a marked reduction in outpatient care. About 40% of the specialists mentioned a reduction greater than 75% compared with prepandemic levels, with no significant difference between the private and public sectors (Mann-Whitney test; p ¼ 0.68). Comparing the results to those of our previous survey, we noticed a trend toward a slight increase in the volume of outpatient care in the private sector, and a slight decrease in the public sector (►Fig. 1).The self-perceived risk on the part of the physicians of developing serious forms of COVID-19 correlated with the reduction in outpatient care, but only in the private sector (r s ¼ 0.208; p < 0.001). In this sector, a reduction of 75% or more in the volume of outpatients was mentioned by 54.9%, 46.9% and 31.6% of the responders in the high, low and riskfree groups respectively. Face-to-face appointments comprised more than 70% of the practice for 2/3 (67.5%) of the responders. Telemedicine was infrequently used: 75.0% of the physicians used it in less than 10% of their patient interactions. For 2/3 (67.7%) of he tphysicians, contact with patients by phone, email or social media corresponded to less than 20% of the appointments. These proportions did not change significantly since the previous survey.►Figs. 2 and 3 depict the percentage reduction in upperairway exams and surgical procedures in comparison to prepandemic levels. A pronounced reduction in exams and surgeries was observed, although a trend for improvement could be observed since last survey.Comparing the results from the previous and the present surveys, difficulties in scheduling elective surgeries decreased from 78.7% to 46.4% in the private sector (χ 2 test; p < 0.001), and from 75.5% to 73.3% in public services (χ 2 test; p ¼ 0.573). The limitations for the resumption of elective surgeries as referred by the interviewees include restrictions imposed by surgical centers, especially in the public sector, the lack of intensive care units (ICUs) for elective surgeries in non-COVID patients, and the patients' fear to get infected during hospitalization for surgery.There were 325 (72.8%) responders who reported owning a private office, 45.9% of whom had to dismiss or decrease the salary of employees due to reductions in income and the concomitant increase in costs with PPE and environmental cleaning material. The mean decrease in family income was of 47.4% (SD: 24.4%), with 4.1% of the colleagues reporting a drop of more than 90%. The decrease in income was lower in clinical specialties (mean: 25.6%; 95%CI: 20.6% to 30.6%) than surgical ones (mean: 51.9%; 95%CI: 49.5% to 54.2%) (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.001) and, as expected, for those professionals who work in the public rather than the private or both sectors (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001). The decrease in income was also positively associated with years of practice (r s ¼ 0.25 p < 0.001), as demonstrated in ►Table 2. The responders believe the pandemic will further impact their clinical practice for a median of 6 months (P25%: 6 months; P75%: 12 months).The psychological impact of the pandemic is depicted in ►Table 3. The percentage reduction in family income was Fig. 2 Distribution of the reduction in upper-airway exams after the COVID-19 pandemic in the present and previous surveys. 9 The numbers between parentheses represent the corresponding sample sizes in the previous survey. Fig. 1 Distribution of the reduction in outpatient volume after the COVID-19 pandemic in the present and previous surveys. 9 The numbers between parentheses represent the corresponding sample sizes in the previous survey. The survey investigated the availability of complete airborne PPE (N95 respirators, eye protection, gown and gloves) for exams that potentially generate aerosols. An availability limited to 0% to 10% of exams was mentioned by $ 15% and 19% of responders in the private and public sector respectively, with some interviewees already referring complete Fig. 3 Distribution of the reduction in surgical procedures after the COVID-19 pandemic in the present and previous surveys. 9 The numbers between parentheses represent the corresponding sample sizes in the previous survey. Availability of N95 respirators limited to 0% to 10% of patient interactions was reported by 10.2% and 17.3% of responders in the private and public sectors respectively. As for surgical masks, the corresponding values were of 8.5% for both sectors. Mann-Whitney tests comparing the whole dataset for the availability of masks and respirators showed that both surgical masks (p ¼ 0.027) and N95 respirators (p < 0.001) were less available in public services. Complete stock depletion was also mentioned by some interviewees. In total, 335 (75%) responders reported that they were reusing N95 respirators for a median of 10 days (P25%: 7; P75%: 15; minimum: 1; maximum: 60 days). The length of re-use was shorter in the private sector (Kruskal-Wallis test, p ¼ 0.006).Although the pandemic was already in its third to fourth month in Brazil, 42.5% and 41.0% of the responders in the private and public sectors respectively reported that they had not received training in the management of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Therefore, physicians are trying to keep up-to-dated regarding COVID-19 on their own, through the medical literature (77.6%), websites of medical societies (72.2%) and social media (59.2%).The presence of pretreatment screening areas for COVID-19 patients was similar in the private (62.3%) and public (65.0%) sectors. The presence of an isolated hospitalization area for patients suspected or confirmed for COVID-19 was reported by 80.4% of physicians in the public sector, and only by 65.2% of those in the private services (χ 2 Considering the decrease in non-COVID-19 patient care, we asked about the physicians' perception of the effect of the pandemic on the course of non-COVID-19 diseases in their patients. In a 10-point Likhert scale, the responders agreed that their patients' clinical status was deteriorating, with a median of 5 (P25%: 3; P75%: 8), and the risk of death was increasing, with a median of 5 (P25%:1; P75%:8). The concern with the deteriorating clinical status of the patients was higher among physicians from public services (54.3%) than among those from private ones (44.8%) (χ 2 test; p ¼ 0.012), and the active tracking of patients with risk of progressive non-COVID-19 diseases for reevaluation was reported by 28.1% and 22.9% of the responders in the public and private sectors respectively (χ 2 test; p ¼ 0.11). On the other hand, plans for partial and full resumption of non-COVID patient care were more frequent in private (56.5% and 19.5%) than in public services (43.1% and 8.5%). The differences were statistically significant for both partial and full resumption plans (χ 2 test; p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Clinical care still focused on COVID-19 patients was more common in public (33.3%) than private services (10.0%) (χ 2 test; p < 0.001). When asked about factors limiting the resumption of elective care, the fear of the patients to become infected was commonly reported by the interviewees.The responders believe that the volume of non-COVID-19 patient care after the pandemic will increase due to unmet demand during the crisis by a median of 40% (P25%: 30%; P75%: 60%). Nevertheless, they believe the median capacity of their services to meet the demand after the pandemic will be of 30% (P25%: 20%; P75%: 50%). The main resources needed to supply the demand were identified as: financial (49.6%), equipment (41.7%), human resources (57%) and physical area (37.5%).The present survey aimed to quantify the sustained impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians who work in the field of head and neck, when the death rates were reaching the plateau, 3 to 4 months after the diagnosis of the first COVID-19 case in Brazil. 14 Compared with the results of a previous survey, 9 we detected a trend toward a slight increase in the number of outpatient visits, exams, and surgical procedures. The tendency to resume elective care, however, is not evident nor homogeneous, as, in the public sector, the volume of outpatients seemed to decrease between the two surveys. In general, the clinical practice still shows a marked reduction compared with the prepandemic situation, and, according to the interviewees, the pandemic will continue to affect their practice for a further 6 to 12 months, with a relevant financial and psychological burden on physicians. The percentage decrease in family income was particularly higher among surgeons who work in private institutions and have more years of practice. The improvement of this scenario requires a diagnosis of the reasons behind this contraction.Fear of contagion probably plays an important role in the reduction in the clinical practice, as specialists in the head and neck field are more likely to become infected 1 and transmission may occur, even from asymptomatic individuals. 3, 15, 16 The reluctance of the patients to seek medical care due to the fear of getting infected has been reported, 7, 17 and was identified as one limiting factor for the resumption of elective care in the present survey. This fear also seems to influence the physician's side, as the reduction in outpatient visits in the private sector was associated with the responders' self-perceived risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19. Furthermore, almost all interviewees reported knowing a professional colleague with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. A total of 14% of the responders were infected, and, in 40% of these cases, this was associated to the infection of a family member living in the same house. Therefore, physicians may also fear getting infected if they cohabit with vulnerable family members. 18 Although most cases of COVID-19 among the acquaintances of the responders were mild, almost 20% needed hospitalization, and 4% died.Alternatives to face-to-face patient interaction could help overcome the fear of contagion. Although telemedicine has been recently regulated in Brazil, 19 and medical associations have provided online instructions on how to properly perform it, 6 75% of responders still use it in less than 10% of patient interactions. This number did not improve since the last survey. It is probable that the difficulty in reaching a proper diagnosis without physical or endoscopic examination, the lack of familiarity by both physicians and patients, thw difficulty to set up and comply with the telemedicine regulation, and the doubt whether its use will continue to be permitted after the pandemic may be influencing its adoption.Despite a slight increase as compared with our previous survey, 9 there was a sustained reduction in upper-airway exams, particularly nasofibroscopies and laryngoscopies. Fear of contagion will probably interfere with the prompt resumption of these exams as well, as the nasal cavities and pharynx are regions of high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, 2,3 and droplets and aerosols may be generated during these procedures. 2 Therefore, most experts recommend that airway endoscopies should be performed with airborne PPE, including: gowns with long sleeves, gloves, face shields, and N95 respirators, 1,5,6,20,21 regardless of case status, in contexts of sustained COVID-19 transmission. [22] [23] [24] [25] Although the role of aerosols in the transmission of COVID-19 is still not known, 2,26-29 and whether ENT endoscopies should be considered aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) per se is debatable, 2,21,30,31 the theoretical risk of transmission brings a practical challenge to comply with safety recommendations. Health agencies suggest that besides the PPE for airborne precaution, AGPs should be performed in negative pressure or well-ventilated rooms and that adequate time for the clearance of aerosols should elapse until reuse without PPE for airborne infection isolation is allowed. 29, 32 Without proper ventilation and exhaustion systems, the waiting time for aerosol clearance may take up to three hours, 33 which would make expedite clinical care unfeasible. In our survey, isolation of the room for at least 30 minutes after an airway endoscopy was reported by 42% of responders in the private sector, and only by 18% of those in public services. Difficulty to comply with engineering and environmental safety recommendations will probably hinder the resumption of airway endoscopies and exams.The present study revealed that the availability of PPE for exams and masks or respirators for outpatient care is still limited, especially in the public sector, with shortages of PPE already occurring. Most responders reported the reuse N95 respirators for an inadequately long interval (median of 10 days). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reuse of the same N95 respirator should be limited according to the instuctions of the manufacturer. If instructions are not provided, limiting the number of reuses to no more than five would ensure an adequate safety margin. 34 The resumption of elective care will increase the demand for PPE, worsening the problem of shortage, which, in turn, may slow down the recovery process.Elective surgeries showed a marked retraction as compared with prepandemic levels. Difficulty in scheduling elective procedures decreased in the private sector in comparison with the last survey, but the volume of surgeries did not improve at the same rate. The interviewees reported that the fear of getting infected on the aprt of the patients during hospitalization for surgery was one limitation for the resumption of elective surgeries. That is a real concern for cancer patients, as they have been associated with poorer outcomes if they become infected with 13, 35 Furthermore, the fear of contagion may be influencing surgeons to postpone elective procedures, as the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during surgeries in the upper airways is particularly high. 1, 5, 6, 11 Universal pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 testing could help increase the safety of surgical procedures, 11,21,31 but it is still scarce, especially in the public sector.Reduction in clinical care creates an unmet demand for patients with cancer and many other progressive diseases, whose diagnosis and treatment are being delayed, which may impact their morbidity and mortality. 13 However, active tracking of patients with risk of progressive non-COVID-19 diseases for reevaluation and treatment were restricted to less than a third of private and public services, and plans to restore elective care were limited. We believe that without the development of an effective vaccine, resumption of clinical care in our field will be hindered due to the difficulty to meet the demand, to comply with safety recommendations, and due to the shortage of PPE. Therefore, as elective care resumes, it may be useful to stratify patients and diseases according to categories that will define the urgency of the treatment. 12 Prioritization will be important in this context of slow resumption of clinical care. 21 Most institutions seemed concerned with their preparedness to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Pretreatment screening areas for COVID-19 are prevalent in both private and public services. It is interesting to notice that public services are better than private ones in regard to the presence of isolated COVID-19 inpatient areas. However, administrative and environmental controls for prevention of COVID-19 transmission as suggested by the CDC 29 and the World Health organization (WHO) 32 are still sub-optimal, especially in public services. Furthermore, communication and guidance of HCPs seems to be limited, at best. Close to 40% of responders in both sectors said they did not receive any kind of training about the management of COVID-19 patients, as suggested by regulatory agencies in Brazil. 25 This is a deeply worrying finding, given the high occupational risk of contagion in our field, and due to the fact that the survey collected responses while the pandemic was already in its third to forth months in Brazil.The present study has many limitations. Surveys are particularly prone to sampling bias, especially if they rely on open, digital recruitment, which may tend to select younger responders. However, age distribution in both our surveys were close to normal. Furthermore, web-based questionnaires have shown similar results in analyses of socioeconomic variables, with a lower amount of missing values, and they are much more cost-effective than traditional paper-based ones. 36 Our sample revealed a predominance of physicians from the Southeastern region of Brazil and from metropolitan areas. Moreover, surgical specialists (head and neck surgeons and ENTs) were older than medical and radiation oncologists. These characteristics are in accordance with the medical demographics in our country. 37 The sample of this survey was smaller than that of the previous one, reflecting a saturation of physicians to answer surveys during the pandemic. This fact was particularly important among medical oncologists. However, the constitution of the sample according to years of practice, geographic area, development environment and type of service (►Table 1) was not significantly different from that of the previous survey 9 (according to the χ 2 and Mann-Whitney tests, data not shown). If the characteristics of both samples were too different, the comparison between surveys for trend analyses would be invalid.On the other hand, this second survey deeply investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical practice of physicians in the head and neck field, enabling the identification of specific concerns and limitations that may help medical societies and institutions plan strategies to mitigate them, such as: 1) to stimulate the proper use of telemedicine; 2) to plan strategies to lessen the psychological and financial burdens on physicians; 3) to provide information about the risk of contagion and safety precautions to deal with suspicious or infected COVID-19 patients, including the adequate use of PPE and reuse of respirators; 4) to work with health agencies to define the risk of contagion in patient interactions specific to the head and neck field, to define the minimum PPE and environmental and engineering precautions needed; 5) to help institutions adopt proper administrative, environmental and engineering safety precautions; 6) to stimulate campaigns to raise the population's awareness that the risk of not seeking medical evaluation may be greater than the risk of contracting COVID-19; 7) to define strategies for prioritization when resuming non-COVID clinical care; 8) to prepare the administrative sectors within the institutions and public bodies about the expected increase in the need of PPE as elective care resumes in our field; and 9) to increase the availability of accurate tests for COVID-19 diagnosis for the screening of asymptomatic individuals before surgical procedures or even AGPs.The present survey revealed that COVID-19 impacted Brazilian specialists that work in the head and neck field, with pronounced reduction in outpatient visits, exams and surgical procedures. Resumption is occurring at a slow pace, with financial and psychological burden on physicians. Shortage of PPE and inadequacy to comply with safety precautions may hinder the resumption of elective care. The situation is creating an unmet demand regarding patients with non-COVID-19 progressive diseases, whose diagnosis and treatment are being delayed. ",Brazil,first author,2021-02-01,02
b9cc7f71d36c5537156c873b4e4118426d8648ea,Open Access,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strained or overwhelmed health systems across the world [1, 2] , with about 25.5 million COVID-19 cases and 850 thousand deaths as of August 31, 2020 [3, 4] . The first case in South America of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the cause of COVID-19, was reported on February 25 in São Paulo, Brazil, a travel hub in the region [5] . A few weeks later, countries in the region had imposed major epidemic control measures, such as closed borders, restricted travel, closure of schools and universities, and enforced lockdowns [6, 7] . Despite these measures, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has already imposed a high toll on most countries in South America, killing thousands in Brazil (121 100), Peru (28 800), Colombia (19 700) , Chile (15 700), Argentina (8700), Ecuador (6600), and Bolivia (5000), thus far [3] . In addition to alreadystrained healthcare systems, other factors have affected the dynamics of the pandemic in the region, including migration, sociopolitical crises, struggling economies, other infectious disease outbreaks, poor leadership, and challenges tied to the implementation of social distancing, hygiene, and lockdown strategies, due to inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure and precarious living conditions [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .The Ministry of Health reported the first COVID-19 case in Chile on March 3, 2020 [16] . The government activated a quick response effort, announcing restrictions on large gatherings on March 13 , and subsequently, closure of all daycares, schools, and universities (March 16), border controls, telework recommendations (March 18), closure of non-essential businesses (March 19) , national night curfews (March 22) , and a strategy of intermittent localized lockdowns in selected municipalities since March 26 [17] . Estimates for the early stage of the epidemic showed sustained transmission with an estimated reproduction number R 0 = 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-1.9] [18] . Research suggests that containment measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus in Chile [18] . Early models estimated that a surge in the number of ill patients could overwhelm treatment capacity by June unless aggressive control measures were implemented [19] . Control measures prevented the epidemic's growth in some regions, particularly during the first months of the epidemic [20] [21] [22] .Chile saw a rapid increase in reported COVID-19 cases during May, reaching a peak 7-day average incidence of about 6000 cases per day (31 per 100 000 population) by mid-June [16] . Health system capacity reached saturation levels by the end of June, with 95% intensive care unit occupancy in Greater Santiago and 89% at the national level [23, 24] . As of August 31, the Ministry of Health's surveillance system EPIVIGILA has recorded a total of 444 921 COVID-19 cases and 15 756 deaths [16, 25] . Most of these reported COVID-19 cases and deaths have been confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. However, these reported cases and deaths also include some clinically diagnosed COVID-19, particularly during the peak of the epidemic when the healthcare system reached saturation [23] , and laboratories could not satisfy the demand for diagnostic tests. In June, 7-day average positivity rates of the RT-PCR tests reached 33% nationally. Evidence shows that the circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, has been negligible in Chile and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere [26] . With 130 total RT-PCR tests per 1000 population by August 31, Chile has tested at a higher rate than any other Latin American country [27, 28] .During the first two months of the epidemic, the crude case fatality rate (CFR), the number of cumulative deaths over the number of cumulative cases, in Chile (1.2%) remained well below the global average (6.5%) [4, 16] . Because initial COVID-19 cases in Chile occurred among relatively low-risk groups (20-60 years of age), several infectious disease experts warned about authorities' excessive confidence over early success [29] . The CFR is a commonly used estimate of the severity of an epidemic [30] . It provides a reliable benchmark for public health officials to decide the intensity and duration of interventions to mitigate or suppress an epidemic [31] . Nevertheless, obtaining CFR estimates during an epidemic is challenging, as CFR is typically affected by right censoring and ascertainment bias [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Right-censoring occurs because of a time delay between the onset of symptoms and death, thus underestimating CFR. Underascertainment of cases occurs because mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases often go undetected by disease surveillance systems, which are not designed to detect all infections [33, 37, 38] . SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in a broad spectrum of clinical outcomes, including asymptomatic infection, mild symptoms, hospitalization, or death [39] [40] [41] .Here we provide real-time estimates of adjusted agespecific CFR during the COVID-19 epidemic in Chile, March through August 2020, to gauge the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. These CFR estimates could inform critical decisions by public health officials in Chile and Latin America.We obtained daily cumulative numbers of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths stratified by age group and gender from March 3, 2020, through August 31, 2020, from the Ministry of Health's surveillance system EPIV-IGILA [16, 25] . The datasets used are available from the Ministry of Science's COVID-19 repository [25] . COVID-19 death definition follows the World Health Organization's updated guidelines for COVID-19 based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) standards [42] . Different groups had different starting times in the time series, which correspond to the day when the first death was reported. For the estimation of CFR in real-time, we employed the delay from hospitalization to death, h s . We assumed h s = H(s) -H(s-1) for s > 0 where H(s) is a cumulative density function of the delay from hospitalization to death and follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days and standard deviation (SD) 5.4 days [43] . Let π a,ti be the time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio on reported day t i in area a, the likelihood function of the estimate π a,ti is where c a,t represents the number of new cases with reported day t in area a, and D a,ti is the cumulative number of deaths until reported day t i in an area a [44, 45] . Among the cumulative cases with reported day t in area a, D a,ti have died, and the remainder have survived the infection. The contribution of those who have died with biased death risk is shown in the middle parenthetical term. The contribution of survivors is presented inc a,t −D a,t i the right parenthetical term. We assume that D a,ti is the result of the binomial sampling process with probability π a,ti . We estimated model parameters using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method in a Bayesian framework. We evaluated the convergence of MCMC chains using the potential scale reduction statistic [46, 47] . Estimates and 95% credibility intervals (CrI) for these estimates are based on each parameter's posterior probability distribution and based on the samples drawn from the posterior distributions.All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) using the 'rstan' package. This research was considered exempt from ethical review because it is limited to secondary data analysis based on publicly available data [16, 25] , which contains no information that can directly or indirectly identify an individual. All data used in this analysis are publicly available [25] .The Fig. 1a , b). We found a similar pattern for women, except that most deaths were reported among women aged 80 years and older (44.4%).The proportion of male cases is higher than 50% across age groups, except for 10-19 year-olds, 70-79 year-olds, and those aged 80 years and above (χ 2 test, P-value < 0.0001, Fig. 1c ). The proportion of male deaths is higher than 50% except for those aged 80 years and above (χ 2 test, P < 0.0001, Fig. 1d ). Figure 1e presents the cumulative morbidity ratio by gender and age group. The ratio of illness among males is significantly higher than among females across most age groups (proportion test, P < 0.000), except for 10-19 year-olds (proportion test, P < 0.00) and 20-29 year-olds (proportion test, P = 0.01). We found no statistically significant differences for 0-9 year-olds (proportion test, P = 0.19).We found that mortality per 100 000 population directly caused by COVID-19 among males is higher than among females for all age groups 20 years and above (proportion test, P < 0.05, Fig. 1f ). We found no statistically significant differences for individuals aged 0-19 years.The reported cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths by age group and gender (A through J) over time are shown in Fig. 2 . The figure suggests cumulative cases of COVID-19 are growing faster than cumulative deaths. The growth curve for cumulative cases across all age groups increases exponentially after around day 30 (April 30, 2020) until around day 80 (June 19, 2020). Exponential growth in cumulative deaths for all age groups occurs approximately after day 45 (May 15, 2020).The observed and model-based posterior estimates of the crude CFR of COVID-19 by age group (A-J) and time-delay adjusted CFR by age group (K-T) are shown in Fig. 3 . Black dots show crude case-fatality ratios, and light and dark indicate 95% and 50% credible intervals for posterior estimates, respectively. Overall, our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well. Crude CFR for all age groups (J) increased at an early stage of the epidemic, and once peaked around April 25 and was followed by an increase in CFR. There is an increasing CFR trend across most age groups, starting around May 10, 2020. Our model-based posterior estimates for the time-delay adjusted CFR are substantially higher than the crude observed CFR at an early stage. Both values are converging as the epidemic progresses.The time-delay adjusted CFR results by gender and age group, as of August 31, 2020, are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4 . Time-delay adjusted CFR for men and women are 4.16% (95% CrI: 4.09-4.24%) and 3.26% (95% CrI: 3.19-3.34%), respectively, while overall national estimate is 3.72% (95% CrI: 3.67-3.78%). Among men, senior citizens appear to be severely affected; the adjusted CFR is 10.16% (95% CrI: 9.76-10.60%) for men aged 60-69 years, 28.35% (95% CrI: 27.49-29.35%) for those aged 70-79 years, and 56.82% (95% CrI: 55.25-58.34%) for those 80 years old and above. We observe a similar pattern for women. The adjusted CFR is 6.44% (95% CrI: 6.10-6.81%) for women aged 60-69 years, 18.18% (95% CrI: 17.40-18.93%) for those aged 70-79 years, and 41.10% (95% CrI: 40.02-42.26%) for women aged 80 years old or more.Few studies have estimated the time-delay adjusted CFR by age group for COVID-19 in Latin America [48] , a region with relatively little attention during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Consistent with other recent COVID-19 research [31, 33, 49] , our results show that the COVID-19 epidemic in Chile has disproportionately affected seniors, especially those aged ≥ 70 years. These results suggest that an aging population could exacerbate the fatality impact of COVID-19 [50] , similar to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus [51] , and consistent with data available from Italy [50] . The comparatively low CFR observed in Chile during the early stages of the epidemic [29] probably reflected the initial cases' age structure and socioeconomic status. During the first weeks of the pandemic, COVID-19 cases occurred among relatively young age groups, with most transmission occurring among individuals between 20 and 60 years of age, and in highincome communities with better access to healthcare and lower prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 [13, 14, 16, 21, 52, 53] .Our latest adjusted CFR estimates for those aged 80 and over reach values as high as 56.82% (95%CrI: 55.25-58.34) for men and 41.10% (95%CrI: 40.02-42.26%) for women. Adjusted CFR for men aged 80 years of age and older is 2.0-fold higher than our estimates for men aged 70-79 years and 5.6-fold higher than men aged 60-69.Adjusted CFR for women 80 years of age and older is 2.3-fold higher than our estimates for women aged 70-79 years and 6.4-fold higher than women aged 60-69. The large majority (68.4%) of COVID-19 cases occurred in Greater Santiago during the study period. As seen for the overall population starting in April until about day 75 (June 14), the upward trend in the crude CFR suggests that viral transmission was spreading to more vulnerable populations. Interestingly, throughout March, most transmissions occurred among relatively young, betteroff populations. In Greater Santiago, localized lockdowns were put in place starting March 28 through mid-April in seven municipalities, six of which are among the richest in Chile [54] . Viral transmission moved towards lowerincome municipalities during April [16, 21] . Among these economically disadvantaged populations, social distancing measures are harder to comply with due to a higher proportion of the population participating in the informal economy, greater population density and overcrowding, more deficient sanitary infrastructure, and lower quality healthcare [14, 21, 55] . Estimates of human mobility during the city-wide lockdown based on cellphone data across municipalities show that the lockdown was less effective in lower-income municipalities [14, 56] . The higher the rate of multidimensional poverty (based on education, health, labor, housing, and social capital), the less effective was the lockdown in reducing mobility, with up to a three-fold difference in mobility reductions between rich and poor municipalities in Santiago. The disproportionate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on lower-income or more vulnerable populations has also been documented elsewhere [5, 57, 58] . An upward trend in the crude CFR could also have resulted from an increasing number of unreported cases due to a saturated testing capacity [55] . Chile's testing capabilities were greatly expanded during the epidemic, partly as a coordinated effort from the Ministry of Science to include testing from public and private laboratories, including universities that converted research labs to PCR testing labs. Processing capacity grew from a few hundred tests per day to up to 35 000 per day (cumulative of about 130 tests per 1000 population) so far [25] . Despite this massive increase in testing capabilities, the 7-day average test positivity (positive tests/total tests) reached 33% nationally and 48% in Greater Santiago during the mid-June peak of the epidemic. This dramatic increase in positive test rates suggests there may be a substantial proportion of under-diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Chile, at least during the peak of transmission in Greater Santiago [59] .The health system capacity also reached saturation levels during the pandemic's peak by the end of June, with 95% intensive care unit occupancy in Greater Santiago and 89% at the national level [23, 24] . A major disease outbreak, such as COVID-19, can strain the healthcare system and hospital resources [19] . This excess demand may potentially degrade treatment quality or lead to sub-optimal treatment decisions, such as diversion from hospitalization or early discharge, and cause delays in laboratory work and reporting, as has been observed in other public health emergencies [60] [61] [62] . However, our data do not allow us to test this hypothesis.The downward trend in the adjusted CFR at the early stage of the study period may have been influenced by reporting delays. The observed differences in our crude and adjusted CFR estimates are directly due to the timedelay, which we assume fixed during the epidemic.The small proportion of men (39.2%) among COVID-19 cases in people aged 80 and over is probably attributable to the relatively small male population size for that age group; men represent only 37% of the population > 80 in Chile [63] . Life expectancy at birth in Chile is 77.2 years for men and 82.1 years for women. Life expectancy at age 60 is 21.8 years for men and 24.9 years for women. China and the United States have reported higher mortality among men [64, 65] ; our data provide the opportunity to examine the CFR by gender and age. Our study has limitations. First, our CFR estimates are probably affected by under ascertainment, as has been estimated elsewhere [33, 37, 38] . Under ascertainment may have pushed our estimates upwards if the surveillance system captured the most severe cases. This bias may be particularly problematic during the peak of the epidemic from mid-May through the end of June. Infectious diseases with a substantial share of asymptomatic or mild infections, such as COVID-19, may be more accurately characterized by infection-fatality risk (deaths / infected people). However, those data are not yet available in Chile. Second, we used laboratory-confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases in our analysis, which may result in an overestimation of COVID-19 cases and thus may have pushed our CFR estimates downwards. The demand for diagnostic tests exceeded laboratory capacity in Chile during the peak of the epidemic, as suggested by high rates of positive tests [16] . Test positivity reached a 7-day average of 33% nationally and 48% at the peak of the epidemic in Greater Santiago, suggesting that a substantial proportion of cases were left without testing. In our favor, the circulation of other respiratory viruses has been of no importance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile and elsewhere [26] in the southern hemisphere.Using real-time epidemiological data from a high COVID-19 testing setting in Latin America, we found that the COVID-19 epidemic in Chile has disproportionately affected seniors, especially those aged ≥ 70 years, suggesting an aging population could exacerbate the death toll brought by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is already imposing a high death toll in Latin America. These real-time estimates may help inform public health officials' decisions in the region and underscore the need to implement more effective measures to ameliorate mortality, especially among those facing the highest risk of death.

2aac0d65084c854fdc2ee13547fa932f2d59c398,"Mental Health, Coping, and Social Support Among People Living with HIV in the Americas: A Comparative Study Between Argentina and the USA During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","Since its first description in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , has spread rapidly around the world and has caused over 34 million infections and 1.5 million deaths [1, 2] . The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) pandemic is a global public health crisis posing numerous increasing health and economic challenges. At the time of this writing, October 2020, the epicenter of the pandemic lies in the Americas. Across continents, the response to the epidemic has varied from country to country [1] . In Argentina, the first case was diagnosed in March 2020 [3] , and the government declared an enforced COVID-19 lockdown on March 20, 2020 [4] , when there were 158 confirmed cases [5] . The lockdown extended over 4 months and resulted in slowing the progression of the epidemic in the country, with 903,730 total cases on October 12, 2020 [1, 3] . Conversely, the USA by March 2020 had already faced an exponential increase in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and related deaths [6] . This surge led to many states and localities to issue stayat-home orders, including orders for many nonessential businesses to close [7] . Today, after months of the initial outbreaks the epidemic continues to advance in both countries, placing them among the most affected nations by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Americas [1].The first descriptions of the disease established that the infection could cause severe respiratory distress and illness [8, 9] . High-risk populations for severe forms included people ≥ 60 years, those of any age with underlying medical or chronic conditions, and those immunosuppressed (e.g., HIV, chronic lung disease, asthma, heart conditions, etc.) [10] [11] [12] . As such, people living with HIV (PLWH) are considered to be at greater risk for adverse outcomes due to COVID-19 [13] [14] [15] . Although recent retrospective analyses of hospitalized PLWH with COVID-19 do not appear to show higher rates of infection or severity among PLWH, the literature is scarce and lacks longitudinal follow up [16] [17] [18] .The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented public health threat, and mitigation strategies such as enforced lockdown and physical distancing combined with anxiety about potential infection, recently dubbed 'coronaphobia,' can have a profound impact on mental health [19] . In Argentina, adherence to restrictions have decreased lately, primarily due to its significant financial impact in a country with a fragile economy where more than 35% of the population are living under the poverty line [20] . In the US, the economy has suffered its most severe contraction since the Great Depression, as more than 26 million people have filed for unemployment in March 2020. As a result, the US government approved a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill to reactivate the economy. However, uncertainty regarding the eventual impact of the pandemic remains.National surveys have described the mental health challenges of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic [21, 22] . Both surveys reported that the mental well-being of the general population has been adversely affected by COVID-19. Younger individuals, and racial and ethnic minorities were found to be disproportionately impacted. However, the long-term consequences of lockdown and economic disruption on mental health among PLWH around the world are unknown. Mental health, social support, and substance use are predictors of HIV-related health outcomes, including treatment adherence [23] , and having a psychiatric diagnosis has been associated with increased mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [24] .Resilient coping has been found to buffer the negative impact of stressors on mental health [25] . Resilience-related factors such as social support and interpersonal resources have shown to be important for mitigating health challenges and stressful situations [26] . However, there is limited information on the use of strategies that could mitigate the impact of the pandemic on PLWH such as resilient coping and social support, and there have been no comparisons between nations affected by the pandemic in the Americas. Thus, this study examines the experiences of PLWH living in Argentina and the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores the role of social support and resilient coping on mitigating the pandemic's mental health impact.Data collection for this cross-sectional study of PLWH in Argentina and the US was conducted during the first six months of mitigation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (April-May 2020 in Argentina and April-September 2020 in the US). Following approval from the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at the study sites, candidates were contacted regarding the study, provided with information on the study, and consented, before being administered or completing an adapted version of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) [27] COVID-19 survey in English or Spanish. At the Argentinian site, the questionnaire was translated and adapted to Argentine Spanish by the Argentina team prior to administration and back translated by the US team. Individual study site procedures are described below.Data from adults (> 18 years) PLWH receiving HIV care at the participating sites, were collected from collaborative studies located in Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Miami (USA).PLWH candidates were identified using the Helios Salud database, derived from information obtained as nongovernmental providers of HIV outpatient healthcare services for more than 10,000 PLWH residing mostly in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. Study staff contacted potential candidates via WhatsApp or email and notified candidates they could decline participation with no interference to their clinical services. The survey was self-administered and accessed through a web link using the REDCap© (Research Electronic Data Capture) [28] data capture platform. After creating the survey, it was sent to selected participants by WhatsApp or e-mail. Each message contained a description of the study and a unique, REDCap survey link that participants were able to complete at their convenience. Study staff did not confirm whether the link was functioning or not. Participants were not offered an incentive for completing the survey.PLWH candidates were identified through the Miami Center for HIV Research in Mental Health (CHARM)/Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) patient database and enrolled in the ACTION study (A Comprehensive Translational Initiative on Novel Coronavirus Cohort) which was approved by the University of Miami (UM) IRB prior to study start. Participants resided in Miami, Florida, a city with one of the highest numbers of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US [29] . Due to local IRB regulations, participants in Miami could not be contacted by email or messaging app and were contacted by phone by the study personnel to explain the study. The survey was administered by phone by the study personnel or self-administered via a unique web link using REDCap© [28] if participants preferred. Participants were offered $15 as an incentive for completing the survey.The COVID Survey was adapted from the MACS/WIHS-CCS survey, which was developed to address the experience of individuals living with, or at risk for, HIV infection [30] . The survey included a total of 49 items and lasted 15-30 to complete. The survey included sociodemographics (e.g., age, sex, living arrangements), COVID-19 preventive behaviors and disruptions, psychosocial factors and mental health, including depression, perceived stress, loneliness, resilient coping, and social support [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .We used a 10-item shortened scale version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), previously used in PWH. Depression symptomatology measurements were retrieved from the questions: ""I felt lonely,"" ""I felt depressed"", ""I was bothered by things that don't usually bother me,"" ""I have trouble keeping my mind of what I was doing,"" ""I felt uneasy,"" ""I felt fearful,"" ""I felt that everything I did was an effort,"" ""I could not get going,"" ""My worries overwhelmed me"", and ""I was happy."" using responses on a 4-point Likert-type ordinal scale from 1 = Never to 4 = Always [31] . The reliability coefficients for both samples were in the acceptable range (Argentina: α = 0.83; US α = 0.88).Perceived Stress included 4 items and was assessed using an adapted measure of the Perceived Stress Scale [32] . How often have you felt that: ""Difficulties were piling up so high that I could not overcome them?"" and, ""you were unable to control the important things in life?"" ""things were going your way"" ""you were confident about your ability to handle your personal problems"". These items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale 1 = Never; 2 = Almost Never; 3 = Sometimes; 4 = Fairly Often; and 5 = Very often. The reliability coefficients for both samples were adequate (Argentina: α = 0.74; US α = 0.78).Loneliness [31] included 3 items and was measured using a 3-point Likert-type scale from 1 = Hardly Ever 2 = Some of the time, and 3 = Often. Items included, ""How often do you feel that you lack companionship?"", ""How often do you feel isolated from others?"", and ""How often do you feel left out?"". The sum of three items was used to calculate this score. Internal consistency in both samples was acceptable (Argentina: α = 0.67; US α = 0.74).We defined resilient coping as the capacity of an individual to positively adapt and recover from adversities [36, 37] . It was measured by an adaptation of the Brief Resilient Coping Scale [38] . There were 3 items included asking ""I look for creative ways to alter difficult situations"", ""regardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it"", and ""I believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with difficult situations"". A 5-point Likert scale was used for item responses (1 = Does not describe me at all, 2 = Does not describe me; 3 = Neutral; 4 = Describes me; 5 = Describes me very well). The sum of 3 items was used to calculate this score. Reliability in both samples was also acceptable for this scale (Argentina: α = 0.77; US α = 0.73).Social support [35] included 2 items and was measured using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = Very Dissatisfied; 2 = Dissatisfied; 3 = Neutral; 4 = Satisfied; 5 = Very Satisfied (""In the last month, how satisfied are you with the social support that you have received from others?"").Descriptive analyses included mean and standard deviation for key study variables. Analyses for multiple linear regression assumptions were carried out to ensure that none of the assumptions of linear regression modeling were violated. Comparisons by Argentina and USA were performed using t-tests, chi-square tests, or non-parametric alternatives. A three-way interaction of social support × resilient coping × study site predicting depressive symptoms was tested using the Model 2 PROCESS macro by Hayes for SPSS [39] . To prevent multicollinearity between variables, mean centering was performed on all variables. To establish statistical significance, a threshold cutoff value of p < 0.05 was applied. All statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26. With regards to COVID-19 preventive behaviors and disruption, there was high social distancing compliance reported but a greater proportion of participants reported practicing social distancing in Argentina (99%) than in the USA (95%) (χ 2 = 18.27, p < 0.001). Rates of participants who quarantined due to having symptoms or an exposure were low. A greater proportion of participants in the USA reported being quarantined due to COVID-19 symptoms (13% versus 2%, respectively; χ 2 = 85.54, p < 0.001), contact with someone with COVID-19 (12% versus 1%; χ 2 = 111.30, p < 0.001), or due uncertainty about whether they were positive for COVID-19 (12% versus 4%; χ 2 = 31.54, p < 0.001). There was a greater proportion of participants who had lost a job or worked less hours due to COVID-19 in Argentina (62%) than in the USA (42%; χ 2 = 28.66, p < 0.001), but a greater proportion of participants in the USA had difficulty paying for basic needs (66%) than in Argentina (59%; Table 1 .A test of three-way interaction of social support × resilient coping × study site was shown to be significant, (b = −0.63, p = 0.043, 95%CI [−1.24, −0.02]). In Argentina, higher levels of social support and resilient coping were associated with lower depressive symptoms. Lower levels of social support and resilient coping were associated with higher depressive symptoms. The three-way interaction is plotted in Fig. 1 . Full details of the model are in Table 2 .This study evaluated mental health and social support factors among PLWH in Argentina and the USA during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and examined the interaction among depression, social support, and resilient coping. Results reveal that PLWH in the USA had higher levels of depression and resilient coping than those in Argentina. In Argentina, not in the US, social support and resilient coping contributed to lower levels of depression.Directives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, such as national lockdowns and social distancing, pose significant wide-ranging effects on population mental healthparticularly among vulnerable populations who may be more likely to comply. Previous studies have found that pandemics, including COVID-19, are associated with an increased risk of developing stress, depression, anxiety and loneliness [19, 40, 41] , with up to 31% of people reporting at least one episode of depression related to the COVID-19 pandemic [21] . In addition, having mental health diagnoses is more common among PLWH [19] , and has been associated with increased mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [24] . This study found that PLWH have high levels of depression, loneliness, and low levels of social support, which may negatively impact their overall health and HIV outcomes. Thus, this could shed light on the effect of the regional pandemic among the vulnerable population of PLWH. However, the longerterm consequences on mental health are largely unknown and will need to be evaluated among PLWH and vulnerable populations.Social support, an important predictor of resilient coping, may play an important role in buffering the impact of major life challenges on emotional distress and behavior, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It has been previously reported that among PLWH in Argentina, resilient copying strategies mitigated emotional distress and was hypothesized that strategies to developed resilience skills could facilitate coping with the effect of the coronavirus pandemic in this population [42] . However, this effect was not identified among the PLWH in the US population in this study. It is possible that this may have been influenced by individualistic values may support this. [43] A better understanding of how coping and social support relate to depression among PLWH in different regions may help to facilitate the implementation of regionally specific appropriate mental health treatment and support services. The financial impact of the pandemic can be a risk factor for psychological disorders and poor health outcomes. [44, 45] Yet, Argentine PLWH in this study were able to cope and develop resilience in spite of widespread financial stress. It is conceivable that the severe economic crisis in Argentina in recent years has stimulated a greater adaptive response to job insecurity and financial hardship [46] , or that financial assistance from the government during the pandemic has alleviated the stress due to financial burden [47] . In contrast, while PLWH in the US received financial assistance, many had higher levels of stress and depression. A previous study of people quarantined due to Ebola in Senegal found that, although participants received financial aid, some felt that the amount was inadequate, or it arrived too late; others felt that the help they received did not cover their continuing expenses [48] . As such, vulnerable individuals Fig. 1 Interaction of social support, resilient coping, and study site predicting depressive symptoms during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The y-axis represents depressive symptoms. The x-axis (social support) represents ± 1 SD above/below the mean. Different colors represent different ± 1 SD levels of coping (blue = -1 SD below the mean; red = mean; green = + 1 SD above the mean). A test of three-way interaction of social support x resilient coping × x study site was significant, b = -0.63, p = .043, 95% CI [-1.24, -0.02]. In Argentina, but not in the US, at high levels of social support and resilient coping, depressive symptoms were the lowest. At low levels of social support and resilient coping, depressive symptoms were the highest in the USA who were quarantined and had low household income or income loss may need other support to manage pandemic-related stress and depression in addition to financial assistance. As hypothesized, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and this effect was strengthened by resilient coping, which differed by region. In Argentina, depressive symptoms were the lowest when having high levels of social support and resilient coping, whereas in the US, though the association between depressive symptoms and social support was present, it was not strengthened by resilient coping. Though not measured in this study, cultural differences associated with nationality and levels of collectivism and individualism may have influenced the perception of stress and the benefit of resilient coping skills in each region. Social support and adaptive coping that be regarded differently in different cultural contexts [45] . Previous studies have found that Hispanics tend to have better resilient coping mechanisms than non-Hispanic due to a trajectory of overcoming stress through character traits, cultural values, and larger social support [49] . However, ethnicity was not assessed in our sample. Exploring cultural factors that promote resilience may enable a better understanding of the coping process, and with it, comprehensive interventions that maximize protective factors among the most vulnerable populations could be developed.The primary limitations of this study include its crosssectional design, which prevents causal inference. In addition, surveys were both online and self-reported and there is the potential of respondent bias. Furthermore, the comparisons between the countries may be influenced by the duration of the data collection period as well as the administration method (i.e., online versus telephone), which may have biased results. Finally, participants were primarily drawn from two cities in each country (Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Miami, Florida), which might limit the generalizability of the results. As the severity of the pandemic and the availability of medical services varies in each country, these findings may not represent the impact of the pandemic in other settings. Future research is needed to address the longitudinal effect of resilience and long-term outcomes.This early study in the USA and Argentina suggests that resilient coping may act as a protective factor against the array of challenges and adversities associated with SARS-CoV-2 among PLWH. Previous studies have shown that resilience needs to be fostered early to prevent the development of depressive symptoms. [45] As PLWH are a vulnerable population already at higher risk of mental health burden and of severe COVID-19, understanding the drivers of COVID-19 infection in this population is pivotal for developing timely and effective public health interventions and mitigate risks.The psychological impact of a pandemic for PLWH can be extensive and long lasting. Understanding the aspects of support that promote positive coping among vulnerable individuals living with HIV is important to supporting mental health and optimizing health outcomes. Initiatives are needed now to promote health and to empower PLWH with strategies to cope with stress and adversity.Author's Contribution All authors had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the accuracy and the integrity of the data analysis.

8dcd97089cb316f3d6e769cfc920c227947ea907,"Population-Based Study of anti-SARS-CoV-2, Social Distancing and Government Responses in Joinville, Brazil","Since March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 infection became a disease with great concern for the Brazilian public health care system. In the first months, the country was more severely affected by the disease in the regions Southeast and North, with the cities of São Paulo and Manaus having a high death toll 1 Government responses to COVID-19 have varied worldwide, including enforced social distancing, testing, and contact-tracing, with varying drees of success [3] [4] [5] [6] .During the early pandemic phase, the Brazilian Health Ministry's leadership was unstable, and there was a change of minister of health in April and another in May.Decisions about social distancing were the responsibility of governors and mayors.There was a serious concern with the possibility of pandemic spreading and uncertainties about when and how restrictive public measures could impact each city's epidemiological situation.Considering the high uncertainty about the prevalence of exposure to the virus in developing countries, and that comprehensive testing can contribute to a better understanding of the local epidemiological scenario and the planning of public health care interventions, we developed a study to evaluate the serial prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing practices in representative samples of Joinville, Brazil.JoinCOVID was a serial study composed of eight weekly cross-sectional studies that estimated the prevalence of contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through serologic tests from June 17 to August 7, 2020, in Joinville, a city in southern Brazil. Joinville is the third most populous city in the three southern states of Brazil. According to the last census, the city had about 598 thousand inhabitants in 2020 7 .Every week, health care professionals and trained volunteers made telephone calls to households previously randomly selected. A resident was invited to answer a questionnaire that included social distancing practices and symptoms of COVID-19and perform a serologic test in one of 13 health care centers. The study was approved by a local ethics committee (protocol number 37962620.6.0000.8062).The epidemiological scenario and social distancing interventions before the study The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was registered on February 25 1 . In a provisional measure taken by the federal judiciary in March, the state's and city's governments were considered responsible for social distancing decisions 8 public transportation, and other public services considered ""non-essential"". The use of face masks was made mandatory for work and commercial activities 9 . There was no prohibition of people's circulation in the city (what is often called ""lockdown"").From March 23, the Municipal Health Secretariat started to offer medical evaluations to all inhabitants through telephone calls and messages, for suspicion of or any other medical reason, without out-of-pocket costs. A substantial part of Family Health Units and emergency departments' activities were directed for caring for people with symptoms of COVID-19, services that are also provided without cost.Multi-stage sampling was used to select participants for the study. We used information provided by the city public institution that supplies water and sewage to define a sampling frame of the households. The institution contains data about 98,3% of the city's households 10 , being the most reliable database for the researchers.The households were divided among the strata that correspond to the eight regions of the city and randomized proportionate to the number of inhabitants in each region.A team composed of volunteer healthcare students performed telephone calls, questionnaires, and serological test scheduling, supervised by healthcare professionals from the Health Secretariat. The questionnaire followed a protocol proposed by the World Health Organization 11 , with the addition of some questions to explore aspects related to social distancing practices. The questionnaire included symptoms, self-reported comorbidities, and practices of social distancing. In case the participant reported coughing, anosmia, coryza, or fever in the last three days, a new interview was scheduled after ten days to avoid exposure to other people during the transportation and serological testing. If the individual continued to present any symptoms in the follow-up call, the participant was excluded from the study and oriented to seek medical evaluation.The tests were performed in 12 Family Health Units and the Center for COVID-19Screening of the city.The prevalence of positive cases for COVID-19 was adjusted using the formula 13 :where the crude prevalence was the proportion of positive results, specificity was 99.57%, and sensitivity was 86.43%.We performed deterministic sensitivity analyses to assess the extent to which the results were modified by changes in the test's sensitivity or specificity.The chi-square test was applied to evaluate the difference between participants' characteristics with positive and negative tests. We considered p values below 0.05to be statistically significant.The crude prevalence of positive tests varied from 1.63% in the first week (margin of error [ME] 0.05% to 3.22%) to 11.94% in the eighth week (ME 8.92% to 14.95%).The proportion of individuals that referred leaving home without a mask oscillated between 3.39% (ME 1.81% to 4.98%) in the first week and 1.69% (ME 0.59% to 2.78%) in the final week, reaching a maximum of 3.78% (ME 2.43% to 5.13%) in the third week (Figure 2) . The proportion of people that referred going to bars, restaurants, or non-essential shopping was 20.56% (ME 17.02% to 24.1%) in the firstweek. This proportion started to reduce in the fourth week, reaching 8.61% (ME 6.23% to 10.99%) in the last week. Figure 4 displays the ICU bed occupancy and the date of governmental decrees with restrictions related to social distancing. The restrictions were imposed with the primary objective of avoiding a demand for ICU beds higher than the city's supply.The first five weeks indicated a low prevalence of antibodies, with a rapid increase in the last three weeks. This increase accompanied a change in the epidemiological scenario observed through the number of new cases and deaths for COVID-19 and the demand for ICU beds.A quarter of the participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 did not report COVID-19 symptoms since March 2020, and only 15.49% had a previous laboratory diagnosis. Only 17.37% had sought medical consultation, even though they were available without out-of-pocket payment through various services. Also, less than one in every four participants who tested positive stopped leaving their homes to work or study when they had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.The current study provides evidence that most people did not stop leaving their homes to work or study, even when they had symptoms of COVID-19. This finding may be explained because a high proportion of infected patients are asymptomatic, have unspecific symptoms, or because patients do not recognize mild symptoms as suggestive of COVID-19. Another significant issue is that workers may be concerned about stopping to work because of mild symptoms, either because they are paid per service or are worried about losing their jobs. Those concerns may be aggravated during an economic crisis. Of note, official estimates report that around 40% of workers in Brazil are informal 29 .Our study also provides an example of the weekly use of an epidemiological study for decision-making at the municipal level in a developing country. In a scenario where the mayors have a high degree of responsibility for social distancing practices and the funding, management, and provision of health care resources, JoinCOVID was a useful tool for better understanding the city's epidemiological scenario.The information that we still had less than 2% of people exposed to COVID-19 by the end of June, three months after the first case, was critical in providing a picture of the long-term necessity of resources and that the worst period of transmission had not arrived yet. The proportion of positives also helped in estimating a benchmark for the number of recovered, allowing for the creation of more reliable Susceptible-Exposed-Recovered (SIR) models used for the estimation of ICU bed occupancy in the following weeks 30 .By the end of June and during July, an increase in the transmission rate led to a maximum occupancy of ICU beds, and the region adopted new social distancing measures (Figure 4 ). Municipal and state public transportation was suspended on July 20. The city also imposed restrictions on activities in restaurants and limited the operation of commerce. The peak in diagnosis occurred on July 28, when JoinCOVID indicated that 8.37% of the sample had developed antibodies. On August 7, when the present study indicated a prevalence of 13.38%, the total number of deaths for COVID-19 was 158 2 . The efficacy of each government response implemented in the city is beyond the present article's scope. However, having longitudinal populationbased data about the prevalence of antibodies and the population's behavior was crucial in the decision-making process.A limitation was that the scheduling process was carried out through telephone calls.In a population-based study of seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, we found a prevalence ranging from 1.4% in the first week to 13.38% in the eighth week of testing.Most residents who tested positive did not seek medical attention and continued leaving their homes to work or study. These data indicate a substantial difficulty in controlling the disease's spread through strategies targeted primarily at diagnosing and isolating residents with suspected disease, justifying more comprehensive measures that increase the social distance between all individuals.JoinCOVID was a valuable tool to provide a clearer picture of the local epidemiological scenario for decision-makers and to justify the need and timing of decrees related to social distancing practices. The study follows all the recommendations from the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the corresponding ethics committee by the number 37962620.6.0000.8062.The anonymized data supporting the findings of the study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.",Brazil,first author,2021-02-10,02
4ff6673938965a9b0add40630d66ed329444f99f,"Active Surveillance of Asymptomatic, Presymptomatic, and Oligosymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-Infected Individuals in Communities Inhabiting Closed or Semi-closed Institutions","COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged on December 12, 2019 with 27 cases in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly, surpassing 45 million infected people and one million deaths all over the world in October 2020. Its symptomatology was classified in six groups that might correlate with illness severity (1, 2) . Elderly, and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of developing serious illness. Meanwhile, others can become infected and develop moderate symptoms or even carry the infection asymptomatically. Such asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and oligosymptomatic (APO) people represent a great concern for health system since they may go unnoticed while contributing to SARS-CoV-2 circulation (3) (4) (5) . In addition, APOs cannot be detected by passive surveillance, which diagnoses only suspicious cases.Mitigating SARS-CoV-2 circulation necessitates continuous tracking, detection, and isolation of cases, for which active surveillance with massive and opportune APO detection methods is required. A possible strategy may be pooling individual samples for molecular diagnosis. This strategy, which was used successfully for syphilis, HIV, HBV, HCV, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) , consists of mixing several samples together and then test the pooled samples in one reaction. If the pool test is negative, it may be presumed that all patients are negative, while if it is positive, each sample is separately tested to find out which is responsible for that result. Thus, fewer tests are run overall, saving time and testing supplies, allowing faster return of results in most cases. As expected, when prevalence is low, pooling is usually cost-saving regarding testing samples individually. Using certain algorithms (i.e., dividing positive pools into halves, testing each of the two new smaller pools and continue subdividing positive pools, or 2 two-dimensional array with master pool testing etc.), 60-80% savings were calculated (14) (15) (16) .SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and described (17, 18 ) enabling molecular-diagnosis, which is performed mostly by retrotranscribed quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (19) . With this technique, the pooling-strategy was assayed with different algorithms, particularly in asymptomatics, since low prevalence is expected there. By implementing the linear eight-sample Dorfman clustering to test 26,576 samples from asymptomatic individuals, 31 (0.12%) SARS-CoV-2 positives were identified, thus achieving a 7.3-fold increase in throughput (20) . Moreover, by using a Shiny application (https://www.chrisbilder.com/ shiny), efficiency of the pool size was assessed (21) .Special concern exists for SARS-CoV-2 dissemination in closed or semi-closed institutions such as residential care homes, neuropsychiatric hospitals, prison houses, police stations housing prisoners, etc. because they are inhabited by people in close contact that, in addition, have one or more risk factors. If the disease gets access to these vulnerable high-density communities, the demands for hospitalization, complex treatments, and assisted breathing could suddenly increase. To cope with this risk, in this study we implemented an active surveillance through a pooling-strategy aimed at early APOs detection in closed or semiclosed institutions in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina (population: 17.5 million, 38.5% of Argentina population) at different moments of the pandemic. The study is part of the active surveillance carried out by the Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires, and complements the passive surveillance that is being performed from the beginning of the pandemic.Swabs (Britania or any rayon or dacron swab approved by the Argentine regulatory body) from both nostrils and the throat were collected by healthcare providers, and placed immediately into a sterile transport tube containing 2-3 ml of either viral transport medium, Amies transport medium, phosphate buffered saline, or sterile saline. For processing, all samples were properly labeled with the patient's filiation data and accompanied by their corresponding notification forms. Samples thus conditioned were shipped to the VacSal laboratory in refrigerated safety containers, and stored at 2-8 • C for a maximum of 3 days, after which they were processed and analyzed.Sample inactivation and RNA extraction were done using certified class-II biological safety cabinet. RNA was extracted from five-sample and 10-sample pools, as well as from individual samples, using the same RNA extraction kit (RNA Mini Kit Genaid RT300, Geneaid Biotech Ltd) following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 200 µl of individual or pooled samples in viral transport media were used for RNA extraction. The individual samples, as well as the pools, were included in the same extraction batch, and the same aliquot was used. Negative pools with 3, 5, or 10 negative samples were included in the assays.Retrotranscribed Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, E, ORF1ab, and N Genes Single-step RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 targeting the RdRp, E and N genes (GeneFinder TM COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp Kit) and ORF1ab and N genes (DisCoVery SARS-CoV-2RT-PCR Detection Kit Rox) was performed on the extracted RNA from individual and pooled samples immediately after RNA extraction.To assess the sensitivity of the pooling strategy, we arbitrarily chose positive RNA samples with different Ct previously quantified, to prepare ad hoc diluted mixes with negative RNA samples. RT-qPCR was performed according to the procedure for individual samples in the clinical laboratory, with identical thermocycler and program (Applied Biosystems R 7500 fast), and with reagents used at the VacSal and Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales labs. Reaction mixtures using GeneFinder kit were heated to 50 • C 20 min for reverse transcription, denatured at 95 • C 10 min, and then 50 cycles of amplification were carried out at 95 • C 15 s and 58 • C 60 s. Fluorescence was measured using the FAM (for RdRp gene), Texas Red (for E gene), JOE (ABI)/VIC (CFX96) (for N gene), and Cy5 (for internal control) channels. Reaction mixtures using DisCoVery kit were heated to 50 • C 10 min for reverse transcription, denatured at 95 • C 30 s, and then 45 cycles of amplification were carried out at 95 • C 5 s and 58 • C 34 s. Fluorescence was measured using the FAM (for ORF1ab gene), VIC (CFX96) (for N gene), and Rox (for internal control) channels.Concordance between individual and pooled sample testings was calculated, and expressed in percentages.The limit of detection for the pooling method was assessed following the protocol already described (22) . The test material was RNA obtained from anonymous SARS-CoV-2 negatives and positives, which were collected at Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS). First four independent positive RNA extracts with Ct ranging 31-34 were analyzed in 10 replicates of 1:20 pools. Then, one positive RNA sample (Ct 31.7) was analyzed in 20 replicates of different pool sizes (1, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160). Negative RNAs were used for dilution. RT-qPCRs were performed as described above. The limit of detection for RT-qPCR methods was estimated from analysis of replicate standard curves.This strategy was implemented since the end of May 2020 as part of surveillance activities coordinated by the Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires following national and provincial guidance (https://www.argentina.gob.ar/salud/ coronavirus-COVID-19/laboratorio, https://www.gba.gob.ar/ saludprovincia/noticias/la_provincia_de_buenos_aires_impuls %C3%B3_los_testeos_por_pool_para_evitar_brotes). Informed consent for these diagnostic activities (Public Health activities) is not requested. The VacSal laboratory was chosen to validate and carry out the pool strategy based on the clinical samples obtained from the residents or healthcare workers from closed or semi-closed institutions. At the beginning of the pandemic and when the prevalence of COVID-19 cases was low, sample groupings were performed using a square matrix array (columns and rows). To this end, sample groupings were done in two ways: on the one hand, a group of samples represented a row of the matrix and on the other hand, the samples were grouped again to represent a column of the matrix ( Figure 1A) . Thus, if only one row and one column tested positive, the positive sample could be identified within the pools (Figure 1A) . When the prevalence of COVID-19 cases increased (after June) or when it was unknown, we used the linear grouping array. In this case, if all pools gave negative results in the RT-qPCR, the experimentation was concluded. In contrast, if a positive result was obtained for a pool of samples, then each sample that is included in the pool was tested individually (Figure 1B) .In a 3-month period, 4,936 clinical samples from 153 institutions distributed in 29 municipalities of the Province of Buenos Aires were evaluated.From 526 independent anonymous SARS-CoV-2 positive RNAs stored at −70 • C for setup studies, 20 representative samples were systematically chosen. Samples were ordered in an equispaced manner by initially measured Ct as depicted in Figure 2 , alongside a second measurement of them after being defrozen, and the respective 1:20 pools prepared from original samples.To determine the probability of detection near the positive/negative detection boundary, 10 replicates of samples #17 to #20, which possessed the lowest Cts, were analyzed in 1:20 pools. Figure 3A indicates that pools belonging to the samples with original Ct 32.4 and 33.3 were detected at 100% rate, while samples with Ct 34.0 and 35.1 were detected at 70 and 50% rate, respectively. To determine the suitability of the pooling method for a range of dilutions, a study was conducted by comparing 20 replicates of different dilution pools, previously known to be near the edge of the detected/undetected result for ORF1ab and N genes. The result indicated a high rate of detection in pools <1:20 ( Figure 3B) .From the comparison of detection probability and the complete clinical samples Ct histogram, the pool method robustness may be estimated. Figure 4A shows the histogram of all 526 samples ordered by N gene-Ct. Despite samples corresponded to initial diagnostic tests, a bimodal distribution is apparent. This two-peak histogram was as previously reported for SARS-Cov-2 infection (23), although, to our knowledge, no explanation was provided yet. Preliminary results indicate that the bimodality is unrelated with symptoms severity, since asymptomatic individuals also present similar histograms. Cts corresponding to high and low viral loads are rather evenly distributed along samples. The line indicates the probability of positive detection of a single sample in a 20-samples pool. Figure 4B shows detectable and undetectable samples in the histogram. The coincidence value is 95.3%. It is important to note that the 5% that is lost is not evenly distributed among the samples but corresponds to the lowest specimens' viral loads.The impact of pooling clinical samples aliquots (nasopharyngealswabs) prior RNA extraction was tested. To this end, clinical samples with Cts in the ranges of either 20-23 or 30-33 were employed. By combining these samples with negative clinical samples, 1:5 and 1:10 pools were formed. From them, RNA was extracted and RT-qPCR was performed to obtain the Cts. Regardless of individual Ct of the positive RNA extract included in the pool, Cts increased 1.9 ± 1.1 units in 1:5 pools with respect to individual RNA extract, and 2.2 ± 0.3 units in 1:10 pools. Regarding clinical samples whose individual RNA extracts possessed Ct ≥ 36, they turned out negative when pooled together with four or more negative samples. On the basis of these results and considering that contagiousness of individuals with Ct ≥ 36 would not impact on COVID-19 epidemiology (24) (25) (26) , the Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires decided to apply this methodology to analyze health situation in closed or semi-closed facilities.The first confirmed case in the Province of Buenos Aires was detected on March 8, 5 days later than the first case detected in Argentina. From this date on, the rate of increase in the week average of total number of cases (N) as well as in the daily reported cases (n) was fast until the end of May, although few cases were still reported. The pooling-strategy was started on May 28, when a significant increase was evident, and data presented here are until August 31. From the slope of plots of log 2 N against time, N duplication time was deduced for this whole period as 16.1 days; however, N duplication time was increasing from 12.4 days between May 28 and July 7 to 29.9 days between August 18 and 31.From May 28 to August 31, 4,936 samples were received from 153 institutions distributed in 29 municipalities in the Province of Buenos Aires. Between May 28 and July 7 (duplication time 12.4 days) the prevalence of positives in the analyzed samples did not exceed 4% (40 positives out of 1,052 clinical samples analyzed). In these cases, the clinical samples were pooled mostly applying a matrix clustering where samples are arranged in a square matrix with each row and each column tested in a different pool ( Figure 1A) . Therefore, samples whose row and column are both positive are retested individually. Notice that if there is only one positive sample there will be only one positive row and one positive column. In this scenario the positive sample can be identified at this stage without additional individual testing. So, although this strategy involves more reactions than linear clustering when the number of samples to be tested is small, it allows frequent positives identification without opening pools when prevalence is low. This strategy allowed saving time and kits (66% in average). During a second period comprised between July 8 and August 2 (duplication time 16.9 days) the growth rate in the number of cases was still accelerating for both n and N values. Hence, given that higher percentage of positivity was expected in this epidemiologic context, the advantage of avoiding opening pools through matrix clustering was lost, so linear clustering (Figure 1B) was implemented. Although at the beginning of this period pools of five samples for RNA extraction and 10 samples (two pools of five) for RT-qPCR were used, during most of the period analyses were done with pools of five clinical samples for both RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. During this second period 1,730 samples were processed, from which 481 were positive (27.8% prevalence). Finally, during August, when duplication time raised to 22.1 days in the first fortnight, and to 29.9 days in the second 1,262 samples were processed, with 358 positives (28.4%) in the first fortnight and 892 samples with 135 positives (15.1%) in the second Thus, the number of people tested per kit (kit saving) ranged from 2.0 to 7.4 depending on the place of origin, with an average of 3.0. Given the high prevalence, this level of savings is quite better than the values predicted by usual mathematical models. This is because pooled samples are not independent of each other since they were obtained from the same closed or semi-closed facility. In other words, since positive samples are unevenly distributed among facilities, pooling-strategy is more effective than predicted.Because the strategy was used mostly with samples from care homes, the majority were from elderly population. In the group >75-year-old, 30.2% positive cases were detected (1,415 positives in 4,682 clinical samples). Furthermore, there were 44.7% positives in the group 10-14-year-old, and 42.8% in the group 5-9-year-old, albeit from smaller samples (17 positives out of 38 and nine out of 21, respectively). Almost all positive cases were APO, irrespective of age. Interestingly, in asymptomatic cases, the elder group tended to possess lower Ct than younger groups (Figure 5A) , being the lowest Cts the most frequent among asymptomatic elders ( Figure 5B ).Tracing of infection foci and outbreaks was possible in institutions from which samples were received repeatedly. A first example is a women psychiatric hospital at Temperley (Municipality of Lomas de Zamora) from which 216 samples from 210 people distributed in different rooms-including health workers and resident patients-were received and processed on June 19, 23, and 30, July 3, 6, 14, 23, and 28, and August 14 and 20. Analyses were carried out in 106 reactions with a kit saving of 2.6 ± 2.0.Until June 23 all samples were negative. On June 30 there were five positives, one of which corresponded to an ambulance driver. Therefore, samples from the other drivers and his close family contacts were asked, all of which, as well as a nurse, resulted positive on July 3 (seven positives). Meanwhile, the other samples, which included 17 healthcare workers and 29 residents, were all negative. In view of this situation, isolation procedures were launched and as result, there were no positives 20 days later. However, three new positive cases were detected on July 28, including a nurse. Epidemiologic investigation showed that this nurse has recently been concluded her preventive quarantine because of being close contact of a symptomatic case. Therefore, all patients that were in contact with this nurse were isolated, and analyzed on August 14. It turned out that all 26 patients were positive, and 21 of them developed symptoms. Strict isolation was undertaken, but one of the patients that had comorbidity conditions deceased. Stringent isolation measures were undertaken because focus dissemination to other rooms of the hospital was detected. On the next survey, carried out August 20 among 18 asymptomatic health workers with close contact among them, only 2 were positive.In another example, a total of 123 samples from 105 different people were received from a disabled center. This center has two sieges, one at Bernal and the other at Quilmes (both in the Municipality of Quilmes). Samples were from young patients, with mean age 24 ± 4 years in Bernal and 23 ± 9 years in Quilmes. From Bernal, 35 samples from 28 different patients were processed on July 16 and 21, and August 11 (kit saving: 2.0 ± 1.0). On July 16 there were 7 positives out of 15 total samples (47%), while on July 21 all 13 samples analyzed were positive. Therefore, isolation protocols were applied and all negatives from July 16 were re-analyzed. In this second analysis all patients were negative again.In turn, 88 samples belonging to 77 different patients were received from Quilmes, which were processed in 28 reactions (kit saving: 3.4 ± 1.4). Eleven samples were received twice each; consecutive analyses of these samples resulted either negative in both instances (three cases) or negative in the first analysis and positive in the second (eight cases). RT-qPCRs were carried out at June 30, July 23 and 30, and August 11. On June 30, all results were negative. The first positive was detected on July 23 in a girl that had cardiac antecedents and presented odynophagia, who was negative in the first analysis on June 30. Therefore, samples were obtained from other patients and analyzed on July 30. All these samples, which amounted 37, were positive. At this moment, several of these patients were hospitalized and prevention measures were further stressed. In the new sampling carried out on August 11, positivity was reduced to four positives detected among 11 samples (36%). Three of the negatives observed at August 11 were previously negative on June 30, showing the control of the focus.Pooling effectiveness depends on the prevalence of positive samples (27) . Therefore, batch sizes for pool testing or even the decision of pool testing should be taken at the laboratory or regional levels, considering positivity rates, specific groups, and categories being tested. Groups with high pre-test probability or serious manifestations are inadequate for pool testing.Pooling up to 5-10 samples increased test capacity with existing equipment and test kits and detected positives with Cts ≤ 36 with sufficient diagnostic accuracy (2 Cts increase on average). Remarkably, the use of this strategy in the Province of Buenos Aires allowed early outbreaks detection, and evidenced that APOs may present Cts as low as those of symptomatic individuals. The role of APOs in virus transmission must be further studied.The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.Ethical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.

94e0f96d0cd37ab98fa0735e972c2ad6bdb18ea4,Proposals of drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment Clinical Trials,"has shown very positive results in the treatment of other lung diseases, which may be related to its rapid 23 onset, low metabolic activity at the site, lower risk of adverse effects, among others [10] [11] [12] . 24Thus, this article aims to present possible drugs that are candidates for repositioning via a 25 pulmonary formulation for the treatment of COVID-19, the scientific basis for its use, as well as the 26 related technological and regulatory aspects. It is expected to stimulate the debate and, mainly, to present 27 a preliminary evaluation model for the selection of drugs with a view to repositioning in a pandemic 28 situation and the need for emergency actions to attendant public health demands. 29 30Methods 31The present study constitutes a literature integrative review [13] , which aimed to identify 32 repositioning drugs candidates for pulmonary administration for the COVID-19 treatment. 33Clinical trials drug selection residues [35, 36] . 123The article by Chandra and coworkers [27] , 2020 target the EndoU protein and reported 124 interactions with all the amino acid residues that are part of the active protein site (His235, Thr341, 125Tyr343, His250, Ser294 and Lys290) [37, 38] . 126In addition to the mentioned criteria, the 3D structures used for in silico tests were evaluated, as a 127 non-excluding criterion, comparing them with the 3D conformation that performs the biological function. 128The Mpro enzyme has biological activity in its dimeric form [32] , however only the work published by 129Elmezayen and corworkers [8] performed the in silico simulations using the native form of Mpro. The 130 other evaluated articles just cited the use of the enzyme in its monomeric form. Likewise, the enzyme 131EndoU performs biological function in its hexameric form [38] , however Chandra and coworkers [27] 132 used its dimeric form (PDBid: 6W01) to perform the simulations. Tariq and coworkers [15] uses RBD as 133 a molecular target in monomeric form, its biologically active form [39] (PDBid: 6Y84). 134 135Drug repositioning approaches using in silico tools, such as molecular docking studies, virtual 137 screening, and dynamic simulation accelerate the identification of promising drugs to treat specific 138 pathologies [12, 13] . However, analyzing the results obtained in this work is possible to realize that this 139 strategy does not seem to be sufficiently explored by the pharmaceutical industry. Among 291 drugs 140 currently evaluated in clinical trials, only 12 were also indicated by in silico studies: argatroban, 141 artemisinin, atovaquone, bicalutamide, chloroquine, deferoxamine, doxycycline, estradiol, mefloquine, 142 montelukast, oseltamivir and remdesivir ( Figure 2 ). This demonstrates that applying the results from 143 academy to the clinical practice is still a challenging process. 144It was also observed that different strategies were used to select drugs in the two cases evaluated 145 herein. While in silico trials consider the particularities of the virus and possible drug-receptor 146 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7 interactions to deduce which drugs would be suitable for the treatment of COVID-19, the drugs on 147 clinical trials focus on symptomatic treatment of the disease. Thus, in silico studies mainly indicate 148 antivirals, capable of inhibiting virus replication, while clinical trials explore the most diverse 149 pharmacological among classes, such as antibiotics and anticoagulants, others. 150 A combination of the aforementioned strategies is probably more recommended, since antivirals 151 could be particularly viable in moderate cases, preventing the worsening of the disease and reducing 152 overcrowding in health care systems [40, 41] . However, for patients in severe conditions, it is necessary 153 another strategy treatment due to the associated immune dysregulation [42] . 154After searching for the names of each drug previously mentioned combined with keywords that 155 relate them with pulmonary drug release, no results were considered relevant for the following drugs: 156 argatroban, artemisinin, atovaquone, bicalutamide, chloroquine, deferoxamine, mefloquine, and 157 remdesivir. For doxycycline (DOX), estradiol, montelukast (MLK), and oseltamivir the search returns the 158 results described in Figure 3 , identifying 278 research articles. After applying the eligibility and exclusion 159 criteria, 19 papers were included in this review. 160The four selected drugs belong to two main pharmacology groups: drugs with a systemic target, 161with an antibiotic or anti-inflammatory action, and drugs with a specific viral molecular target. The drugs 162in the first groups are: doxycycline (DOX), estradiol and montelukast (MLK). The only drug in the 163 second group is oseltamivir. 164 DOX is a broad-spectrum antibacterial drug commonly associated with an anti-inflammatory 165 effect. Its ability to reduce the inflammatory processes associated with cystic fibrosis and chronic lung 166 diseases has been documented [43, 44] . Regarding COVID-19, its ability to interact with the viral SARS-167CoV-2 was evaluated in silico through molecular docking studies, showing that this drug could interact 168 with specific sites of both main viral replication protease (Mpro) and S1 protein (Table 1) [15] . 169For some decades, estradiol (17β-estradiol), has been evaluated as a safer alternative to the use of 170 artificial hormones [45] . Concerning COVID-19, Pant and corworkers [15] , through computational 171 methods, proposed that estradiol has a potential for interaction and inhibition of the main protease of 172 SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . 173 MLK, a cysteinyl-leukotriene type 1 (CysLT1) receptor antagonist, inhibits the inflammation 174 process, especially the ones caused by leukotriene D4 [46, 47] . It is used, not only in asthma treatment, but 175 also to prevent wheezing, chest tightness, cough, and exercise-induced bronchospasm in adults and 176 children [47, 48] . Besides that, it could be used to treat other neutrophil activation diseases, such as 177 seasonal allergies [49] . Virtual screening and molecular dynamics studies identified that MLK could 178 function as a protease inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 (Table X) [14] . 179Oseltamivir phosphate is a prodrug that is converted into its carboxylate derivative, recommended 180 by the World Health Organization as the first-line treatment against influenza virus. It is available for oral 181 administration and was first registered as Tamiflu ® by Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd [50] . Al-Khafaji and 182 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 coworkers evaluate the covalent docking of several antiviral drugs and oseltamivir showed a good ability 183 to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Table 1 ) [17] . 184 185COVID-19 is a disease that affects the respiratory tract. Evidence suggests that the angiotensin-187 converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry cells [51] , and as a healthy lung 188 tissue has alveolar epithelial cells expressing ACE2 [52] , it is highlighted that the lungs can be considered 189 a primary target to promote viral invasion and replication. Therefore, the use of pulmonary drug delivery 190 could be considered a promising alternative to fight against this disease and considering the main findings 191 of academia that were discussed herein, the technology developed could be rapidly transferred as to 192 enable the clinical treatment of COVID- 19. 193 It is quite evident that the pulmonary route is an extremely important target for distinguishing 194 diseases, likewise asthma and DPOC. Clearly, not only COVID-19 motivates investments in this segment, 195 but also could be an acceleration force for new research and even a redirection of several companies' 196 portfolio. At this moment, pharmaceutical laboratories are facing a concrete demand, with a profound 197 impact on public health. Investment in research and development of formulations for pulmonary release 198 could bring to these institutions a character of innovation that has not been verified for a long time. 199Drug delivery systems prove to be a highly favorable path in incremental innovation [53] , 200 essential for the development and registration of numerous drugs currently available clinically. Faced 201 with an international scenario in which the pharmaceutical sector has been envisaging serious difficulties 202 to launch innovative drugs, delivery systems can be an excellent opportunity both to attribute new 203 pharmacokinetic profiles to existing drugs and to lead them to new uses. 204A successfully application of drug repurposing as pulmonary route is the asthma disease 205 treatment. The review published by Anderson brings several examples of drugs that were administered by 206 oral or intravenous route and became available as inhaled in order to reduce side-effects, dose, and allow 207 a prophylactic treatment [54] . A classic example was budesonide, where the oral and aerosol formulations 208 were compared and only the inhaled form showed antiasthmatic effect, proving that its local action in the 209 airways was better than systemic activity after absorption [55] . The repurpose of iloprost (Ilomedin ® ) was 210 also interesting. This drug is a prostacyclin analogue used for severe forms of peripheral arterial disease 211 that was repurposed for aerosol therapy of pulmonary hypertension (PAH). Nowadays, iloprost is 212 recommended as class I monotherapy in patients with PAH [56] . In addition, the agencies contribution 213 with documents such as the Food and Drugs and Cosmetic Act 505(b)(2) facilitates the regulatory 214 approval of drugs with changes in dosage form, strength, formulation, dosing regimen, or route of 215 administration [57] . Thus, reducing costs and time to new formulations market launching. As numerous 216 cases, COVID-19 can be a lever in the innovation process in this area, as can be concluded by everything 217 previously exposed in the article. 218 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 In this context, considering the potential benefits of pulmonary route for COVID-19, a literature 219 search was conducted to find possible pulmonary release formulations with the drugs previously selected. 220The relevant information of the 17 analyzed papers of pulmonary delivery of these drugs are summarized 221in Table 2 . For DOX, dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations are the most reported in the literature, being 222 the spray drying (SD) the most applied technique to produce this powder. It was used for producing 223 microparticles [58, 59] and also, as a drying process combined with other methodologies [60, 61] , to 224 provide the powder for the DPI. In addition to solid formulations, DOX nebulizer solutions have also 225 been reported [62] (Table 1) . 226 SD was the most used technique also for estradiol formulations and the most used excipients to 227 formulate this drug were albumin, lactose, and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) [63] (Table 1) . 228This last one is the major phospholipid present in pulmonary surfactant, which is essential for mammalian 229 breath because its ability of solubilize poorly water-soluble molecules and reduce the surface tension in a 230 water solution [64, 65] . Due to this, the role of lung surfactant to optimize pulmonary drug delivery and 231 distribute poorly water-soluble drugs over the respiratory air-liquid interface has been reported for other 232 drugs and has been applied in pulmonary formulation of estradiol [64] . 233Due to the lower expression of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme in the lungs [66] , when MLK is 234 administered via pulmonary route its metabolization is reduced compared to the liver [67] . So, the 235 pulmonary route can improves its bioavailability [68] in comparison with the oral route, for which is 236 approximately 64%, due to the first pass effect [46, 69, 70] . As MLK is used for asthma treatment, there 237 are plenty of investigations for its pulmonary administration. Probably, because of that, 6 of 8 studies 238with MLK presented in vivo experimental data ( Table 2 ). The majority uses DPI, as microparticles, but it 239 was also possible to find one study with pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) ( Table 2 ) [68] . The SD 240 technique was widely used and several strategies were applied to increase drug release and reach the deep 241 lung, such as porous particles [67, 71] . Distinguish works evaluate the mucoadhesiveness characteristic of 242 the obtained particles, since this property could increase the formulation retention time in the pulmonary 243 region [44] . It is relevant to point it out that some of the strategy applied for this drug could be applied for 244 other ones accelerating the investigative process. 245On the other hand, only two oseltamivir pulmonary formulations are proposed in the literature, 246and they are presented as DPI or nebulizer solution. Both present an increase in AUC when compared to 247 other administration routes (Table 2) . Tables 2 and 3 , it is possible to observe some peculiarities of the studies with the selected 251 drugs. The first one concerns the type of device most commonly used, in up to 78.9% of the studies, 252 which is DPI. Its preponderance is superlative compared to 10.5% of solutions/suspensions for 253 nebulization. This is an excellent indication of how a given technology is more promising in terms of 254 therapeutic application. This data, in a way, agrees with the literature that, in fact, places DPI as one of 255 the most viable approaches for pulmonary drug administration [83] . The technology for obtaining the 256 release systems, in turn, accounts for 57.9% of cases using the spray drying technique. This approach is 257 already foreseen, since it is a type of processing that is commonly used for obtaining spherical shaped 258 particles, which are very useful for pulmonary administration [84] . In addition, it presents a high 259 scalability, and it is already a traditional process in the pharmaceutical industry [85] . 260On the other hand, a parameter that is imperative for the proper understanding of the systems is No. 33, on April 17, 2019), which is the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, recommend evaluating 267 aerodynamic particle size distribution by cascade impactor test for formulations intended for pulmonary 268 release [86] [87] [88] . In addition, in many of the articles in which this trial was conducted, the method was not 269 adequately described or properly justified. Anyway, when the particle size results are mentioned, they are 270 below 12 µm, except for one article, which showed 26.3 µm in size [60] . These values are in accordance 271 with the general literature on pulmonary delivery systems [89, 90] . 272Regarding the excipients use in pulmonary formulations, EMA guide emphasizes the importance 273 of using excipients with well-established use for pulmonary release and, if this is not possible, safety 274 studies for such application must be carried out [86] . The FDA provides a list of the excipients used in the 275 approved for various administration routes, which can facilitate the development or repositioning of drugs 276 via the pulmonary route [91] . Among them, lactose [73, 78, 79] , mannitol [46, 76] , and lecithin [50, 75] (Table 2) and that could bring some hurdles in terms of registration, especially in the case of the 279 development of a new drug product. It was possible to find, for example, papers that used albumin as an 280 excipient [63, 69, 79] , which is commonly used to induce asthma in animal models [92] , so is an dangerous 281 excipient for pulmonary delivery. Albumin was also employed (Table 1 ) and is not on the list of 282 excipients approved by the FDA for the inhalation route [91] . 283Concerning in vitro and in vivo evaluations, there is also insufficient data, as might be expected. 284In both cases, only about 50% of the studies make some evaluation in this regard. This means that half of 285 the reports develop formulations, but do not assess them properly to confirm the expected effects. In 286 addition, even fewer are the articles that performed both in vitro and in vivo tests (Table 3) , a sign that the 287 majority did not seek a correlation between them. With this gap, it appears that the correlation between 288 the physicochemical characterization of formulations and their biological impact is not a standard goal in 289 academic work. It should also be noted that in the case of in vitro tests, there is no standardization 290 between them, either in terms of the type of study, or in relation to the parameters used in the 291 measurement (Table 2) . 292It is important to stand out that the dissolution test, which is extensively used for oral 293 administration drugs, does not have a standard pharmacopeial methodology or aerosols' regulatory 294 requirements. One of the main difficulties in standardizing an effective dissolution method for inhaled 295 formulations is that the drug dissolution process in the lung has many peculiarities, such as the extremely 296 low volume of pulmonary fluid (10 to 30 mL), the variable amount of particles reaching the lung, which 297is not equivalent to the total amount of particles inhaled, the pulmonary fluids, which are composed of 298 several surfactants, among others [93, 94] . Therefore, an ideal method should perform, before the 299 dissolution itself, the collection of the relevant dosage respirable fraction (RF), in addition to using the 300 appropriate components to simulate the lung environment in vivo [94] . 301However, among studies evaluated in this paper, less than 30% investigated RF, and for both 302 doxycycline and oseltamivir, none of the proposed formulations were evaluated regarding this parameter 303 (Table 3) . On the other hand, the fine particles fraction (FPF) was assessed in more than 65% of the 304 studies (Table 3) . This parameter deals with the percentage of particles smaller than a certain size, in 305 micrometers, according to the type of impactor used for the test. [94] . Beside de FPF has been measured 306 in 65% of the articles, the use of theses information for in vitro and in vivo study are not sufficient, since 307 RF refers to the ratio between FPF and the recovered dose [94] . So ideally, it is necessary to calculate 308 both parameters. According to the FDA, the isolated assessment of MMAD, GSD or FPF values cannot 309 be considered appropriate, so, the acceptance criteria should be based on the amount of drug retained in 310 each one of all the stages of the cascade impactor [87] . 311It is important to highlight that advances in academic and scientific scenarios do not always 312 follow the regulatory scope and vice versa. There are many studies showing promising results but that do 313 not detail important aspects that would be necessary in the case of registering a drug product. On the other 314 hand, the legislation already available on this subject does not always present a more detailed framework 315 in the light of scientific advances in the area. These divergences are usually more common in developing 316 countries, whose regulatory scenario is still in consolidation [95] . 317Thus, at least in the universe of drugs defined in the present study, scientific articles do not 318 always consider the current regulatory guidelines, that standardized tests in pharmacopoeias are not 319 followed and that there is a considerable range of articles with insufficient results to prove their 320 assumptions regarding the benefits of the formulations developed. It can be concluded, therefore, that 321 although there has been some progress in the development of formulations for the pulmonary route with 322 12 potential impact in the treatment of COVID-19, there is still a lot to be done, especially regarding projects 323 that reflect the regulatory scope and that aim industrial application of the results. 324 325 4.The pulmonary administration of drugs is a route that presents quite satisfactory results for 327 respiratory diseases and, since that region is the gateway to the new coronavirus, the repositioning of 328 drugs for administration throughout this route is an interesting strategy. 329However, the present study showed that pulmonary formulations containing promising drugs for 330 the treatment of COVID-19 are still scarce and almost all of them are not always based on current 331 regulatory guidelines. In addition, many of the articles found did not perform a complete evaluation of 332 their effectiveness, lacking results that prove the benefits of the formulations in question. 333It is important to highlight that based on emergency of COVID-19 pandemic, which needs some 334 fast solution, this paper focused on molecules who were already being evaluated in clinical trials. 335However, in the future it is necessary also evaluate molecules with potential for specific anti-coronavirus 336 molecular actions that are not necessarily in ongoing clinical trials. 337Despite this uninspiring scenario, it is believed that the pandemic represents an opportunity for 338 investment in research into alternative routes of release, stimulating the research and the investment by Docking score Glide score [17] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Decrease of total proteins and proinflammatory 0,5The produced particle showed good powder flow.

Improvement at the histopathology and growth of the respiratory flow with 68% resistance to methacholine.effective in treating air model animals. The presence of PEI increases the particle size, but also the porosity and, thereby, improves the flow and aerodynamic size. Due to their larger size, these particles are also not recognized by macrophages. Finally, the particles formed with PEI had a greater release of the drug. Even with a 20x lower dose via the lung than the commercial oral dose, the particles were more effective in treating air model animals. The study did not present results of effectiveness of the use of the formulation in the treatment. however, it shows that the formulation did not present toxicity to macrophages in the pulmonary airways of rats or in human lung cells.

37a50e090e25ff4fc261e67562cba9cca0d7a74e,Journal Pre-proof Glycemic control metrics using flash glucose monitoring and hospital complications in patients with COVID-19 Glycemic control metrics using flash glucose monitoring and hospital complications in patients with COVID-19,"Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the world, affecting almost 460 million people (1) . Large trials have shown that diabetes is highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients, and confers a worse prognosis (2) (3) (4) . A recent meta-analysis reported that hyperglycemia and diabetes are associated with higher mortality (RR 2.12 [1.44, 3.11] , p < 0.001), severe COVID-19 (RR 2.45 [1.79, 3 .35], p < 0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (RR 4.64 [1.86, 11 .58], p = 0.001), and disease progression (RR 3.31 [1.08, 10 .14], p = 0.04) (4)(5) compared to patients without hyperglycemia.During the COVID-19 pandemic, critical shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) has resulted in increasing hospital use of CGM to minimize bedside encounters (6, 7) . The result of preliminary studies have indicated that CGM readings correlates well with point of care capillary glucose testing in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and provides an attractive option to for the management of general medicine and surgery patients with diabetes (8, 9) .Several randomized controlled trials have reported that treatment with a basal-bolus regimen results in significantly lower mean daily blood glucose (BG) with a higher percentage of BG within target range in patients with type 2 diabetes (10, 11) . No previous studies; however, have reported on the glycemic response to basal bolus insulin therapy in patients with COVID-19. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective study to examine the glycemic control metrics using flash glucose monitoring including time in range [TIR], time above [TAR] and below [TBR] range, coefficient of variation and glucose management indicator during basal bolus insulin treatment, as well as we report on the frequency of a composite of complications including ICU admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury in patients with diabetes and COVID-19 infection.We conducted a pilot, prospective, single center cohort study in patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia treated with basal bolus insulin regimen at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio (HUSI) from July 1 to September 30, 2020. We included patients older than 18 years with type 2 diabetes or non-diabetics with two point of care (POC) capillary BG greater than 180 mg/dl, and with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with active neoplasms, drug dependence, poorly controlled psychiatric illness, pregnancy, or those using continuous real-time glucose monitoring prior to admission were excluded. The protocol was approved by the ethics and research committee of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio; all patients filled out informed consent.After patients accepted to participate, an interstitial glucose sensor was implanted for intermittent glucose monitoring (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA). Education was provided to patients and the nursing staff, and were asked to take at least 3 scans a day. The CGM were cover with lead apron during diagnostic radiology images. Demographic variables and clinical outcomes during hospitalization were collected through the electronic medical record. According to the institutional protocol, the total daily dose of insulin (TDD) was calculated as 0.3-0.5 units per kilogram according to age, blood glucose at admission and creatinine (10) . Half of the total dose was given as basal insulin and the other half as prandial doses. The doses were adjusted for a glycemic goal of 100-140 mg/dl fasting and 140-180 mg/dl postprandial. In patients with a fasting glucose of 140-180 mg/dL, the daily basal insulin dose was increased by 10%, whereas in those with a fasting glucose >180 mg/dL, it was increased by 20%. CGM data was downloaded using the Libreview online platform. Critically ill patients were switched to intravenous insulin according ICU guidelines.A confirmed case of COVID-19 infection was defined by a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. De novo diabetes was defined by hyperglycemia > 180 mg/dl and HbA1c ≥6.5% in patients who had no previous history of the disease. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined as an increase in serum creatinine level by 0.3 mg/dL from the admission value or an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline. Acute respiratory distress (ARDS) was defined by hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 <300) and bilateral opacities on chest x-ray not explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload.The metrics provided by the CGM included time in range (TIR), which represented the percentage of time between 70 and 180 mg/dl, time below range (TBR, < 70 mg/dl) and the time above range (TAR, > 180 mg/dl) as the percentage of time outside these values. Clinically significant hypoglycemia was defined as a glucose <54 mg/dL. Values of CV >36% were defined as high variability; the coefficient of variation (%CV) results from the division between the standard deviation and the average glucose multiplied by 100.The quantitative variables were described through means and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. Comparison were performed using a t test or Mann Whitney test according with variable distribution. For the exploratory bivariate association analysis, a logistic regression model was used. ROC curves were performed to assess the discrimination capacity of each variable as a predictor of adverse outcomes. A composite outcome of acute kidney injury, admission to the ICU, and acute respiratory distress syndrome was established.This prospective cohort included a total of sixty patients with type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia and Covid-19 infection. Of them, 44 had known diabetes and 16 patients had new onset hyperglycemia. A total of 190,080 data points of CGM were available. The clinical and sociodemographic characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The average age was 60.2 ± 14.1 years. Almost half of the patients had de novo diabetes (no previous history of diabetes, glucose > 180 mg/dl and HbA1c >6.5%). Most patients had an HbA1c greater than 7% on admission (58.9%). Almost half of the patients had lymphocyte counts below 1000 and PAFI (relationship between the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and alveolar oxygen gradient) below 200 as severity markers of COVID-19. The median length of hospitalization was 11 days (IQR 8-16).The mean admission blood glucose and HbA1c was 9,03%. The mean BG during the hospital stay was 146,9 mg/dL. During treatment, the median time in range by CGM was 72.5% (IQR 54-87.5). The hypoglycemic times (TBR) of the different groups of patients were low (Median 3%, IQR 1-6). The median of coefficient of variation was 30.0 (IQR 25.8 -37.8). Average device readings per patient was 5,7 time per day.Of the 60 patients included, 21.6% required ICU admission, 25% had a diagnosis of ARDS and 21.6% had AKI. The composite outcome of complications was reported in 36.6% of patients. There were no differences between the values of TIR, TAR, TBR, CV or GMI in patients with or without admission to ICU, ARDS or AKI ( When a subgroup analysis was done for patients with hyperglycemia, a higher TAR was found in patients with AKI (18 vs 1%, p=0.01), and in those with the composite outcome (22.5 vs 16%, p=0,04) ( Table 3 ). This is the first study that describes the glycemic response to basal bolus insulin using flash glucose monitoring in patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia hospitalized with COVID-19. The results show that most patients treated with our standard hospital hyperglycemia management protocol improved their metabolic control, reaching times in range, low glycemic variability with low rates of hypoglycemia similar to previous studies in general non-COVID populations (12) . We found no association between adverse outcomes and poor glycemic control in patients with known diabetes, however, patients without a history of diabetes, a statistically significant difference was found in the composite of complications and time above range.The time in range between 70 and 180 mg/dl was achieved in 72.5% of values and 22% of values were above range >180 mg/dL. The frequency of hypoglycemia was 3% (<70 mg/dL). The percentages of the coefficient of variation indicate low variability, which is positive given its relationship with hypoglycemia. Similar to our findings, a study conducted by Gómez et al (12) in non-COVID patients hospitalized using a similar treatment protocol in the general ward reported a TIR in 89% of readings, with very low incidences of clinically significant hypoglycemia are reachable. In addition, we observed that in patients admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19 complications experienced good glycemic control, with a level of hypoglycemia similar to that reported in a non-COVID ICU study from the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, that showed 7.5% of patients with hypoglycemia events < 70 mg/dL after cardiovascular surgery (13) .Among patients with a known history of diabetes, we found no association between glycemic metrics by CGM (TIR, TAR, TBR, glycemic variability) and the rate of complications. In contrast, a clear relationship was found between percentages of TAR (hyperglycemia > 180 mg/dL) and the development of complications in patients without a history of diabetes, in particular acute kidney injury. Previous report by Zhang et al. also found significant higher rates of mechanical ventilation, admission in ICU and death in patients with new-onset hyperglycemia without diabetes compared to normoglycemia patients (14) . Likewise, Copelli et al. found higher mortality in hyperglycemic patients without diabetes compared with normoglycemia, with hyperglycemia on admission been an independent predictor of mortality after the multiple adjustments (15) . Hyperglycemia is common in patients with COVID-19 infection (16) and reported in 10-40% of patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes (17) . Several factors may contribute to hyperglycemia in our patient population including an average age of 60 years, the presence of overweight and high waist circumferences, and the use of steroid therapy. In addition, the metabolic stress of acute illness and the tropism of SARS-Cov-2 to the beta cells of the pancreas through ACE2 receptors, which could generate apoptosis of beta cells and insulinopenia (18) .The main strength of the study is the evaluation of glycemic control of hospitalized patients using the flash glucose monitoring. There are no previous trials in the literature showing the association between metrics of glycemic control including TIR, TBR and %CV and adverse outcome in patients with diabetes and hyperglycemia and COVID-19. Most of the patients had an adequate use of the device, which allowed obtaining enough data for the calculation of the metrics. Similarly, the hospital stay of the patients was generally long, which made it possible to have a good amount of data for a reliable analysis. The main weakness of the study is the small sample size of this pilot study. The sample size limits the power of the present study to find associations between COVID-19 metrics and complications, however the confidence intervals were narrow enough to state that if there is a relationship between glycemic control and complications, this association is not of great magnitude.Our results indicate that most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with diabetes and hyperglycemia had a good response to a standard basal bolus insulin regimen. Glycemia metrics using CGM in our study was similar to TIR, TAR, TBR and glycemic variability reported in previous non-COVID patients with diabetes. In addition, our results suggest an association between TAR the development of complications in patients with hyperglycemia without a history of diabetes. The association between TAR and complications indicates the need for close glucose monitoring and improved glycemic control in hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19.",Colombia,first author,2021-02-10,02
dca727f353fbf8215a3f4e008adc329daa13c1ea,Is there scientific evidence of the mouthwashes effectiveness in reducing viral load in Covid-19? A systematic review,"A recently published article mentions that dentists are the health professionals most at risk of being infected with COVID-19, with risks greater than that incurred by nurses and doctors; this is mainly due to the close relationship between professionals and patients (1) . The transmission of the virus mainly occurs through inhalation/ingestion/ direct contact of the mucosa with droplets of saliva, as it is known that this has an important role in the transmission of COVID-19 between people; these droplets are emitted during speech, coughing and/or sneezing (2, 3) . Given the large number of infected people and the lack of effective treatments to combat COVID-19 thus far, measures have been taken to contain the spread of the disease based on past epidemic experiences with similar viruses, through hand hygiene, mask use, social distancing and oral hygiene by mouthwashes (4) (5) (6) . According to the latest information on COVID-19 (7), special attention has been given to dental risk, in which the asymptomatic patient has been mentioned many times, since the epithelial cells of the salivary glands, even the smallest ones distributed throughout the oral cavity, have high expression of the ACE2 receptor for COVID-19, surprisingly higher than the others found in the lungs. The contact between dental professionals and human fluids through direct or indirect contact shows a higher risk of infection since the oral mucosa is one of the first sources of contamination by coronavirus (8) .Considering this form of transmission, some substances can be effectively used to decrease the viral load in saliva and oral mucosa, minimizing the risk of respiratory infections 1, 5.Since the viral load contained in human saliva is very high, reaching up to 91.7% (9) , mouthwashes with antiseptic rinses can not only reduce the amount of infection but also eliminate the virus in saliva and therefore facilitate the fight against oral transmission (7, 8, 10) . In some patients, SARS-Cov2 RNA was detected only in saliva and not in the respiratory tract. This form of infection is particularly relevant for health professionals who work in intensive care units and offices and professionals who perform bronchoscopies, endoscopies, or exams with close proximity to the patient, e.g., dentists (11) (12) (13) . Infection control measures are needed to prevent the virus from spreading and to help control the epidemic. There is still no systematic review that addresses the effects of mouthwashes against COVID-19, and it has been suggested that this virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic infection originating from contaminated saliva (9) ; therefore, this study aims to verify whether there is evidence in the literature regarding the effectiveness of three types of mouthwashes in decreasing the viral load present in the oral cavity; the three types of mouthwashes are used in dentistry:, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine (PVP-I).This review was carried out by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Checklist (PRISMA) (14) , and the protocol was registered on the website PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Review -Centre for Reviews and Dissemination University of York) -CRD42020182213. -Eligibility criteria The acronym ""PICOS"" was used to consider the eligibility of studies for this review: • P = population (individuals infected with coronavirus or the contaminated saliva of these individuals) • I = intervention (Mouthwashes -Chlorhexidine, Hydrogen Peroxide and PVP-I) • C = comparison (compared to a control group through a cross-sectional evaluation or compared to the same individual/saliva at first through a longitudinal evaluation) • O = outcomes (viral infection or % of virus inactivation) • S = study design (clinical trials or in vitro studies) -Inclusion criteria Clinical or in vitro experimental studies that used mouthwashes as a form of intervention as a hypothesis for decreasing the viral load in saliva were included. There was no restriction on gender, age, ethnicity of individuals, language of the study or time of publication. -Exclusion criteria The following exclusion criteria were applied: a) studies that have not evaluated coronavirus-infected individuals/saliva; b) studies where the evaluation was not carried out using saliva or where the evaluation was carried out on uncontaminated surfaces; c) studies that have not used mouthwashes as a form of intervention or that have used another treatment added to the use of the mouthwash; d) studies that have not evaluated the outcome of interest or that have incomplete data; and e) descriptive studies, such as reviews, letters, conference abstracts, expert opinions, and case reports.-Information sources and search strategy Combinations of words and appropriate truncations were adapted for each of the six electronic databases selected as information sources: PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS), Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library.

An expert on the subject was consulted via e-mail to verify any possible publication on the subject and indication of any relevant articles that could be included.-Study selection The selection of articles was carried out in two phases.In the first phase, two reviewers (B.L.C.L. and A.G.D.S.) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of all references. All articles that did not meet the eligibility criteria previously established were excluded at this stage.In the second phase, the same reviewers independently read the full text of the articles selected in the first phase. Whenever there was some disagreement and a lack of consensus persisted even after discussion, a third reviewer (G.C.R) was involved in the final decision.To facilitate reading independently in both phases, the website Rayyan (http://rayyan.qcri.org) was used, where the reviewers were shielded in all evaluations and a third member of the team (C.M.A.) acted as a moderator.-Data collection process Two reviewers independently (B.L.C.L. and A.G.D.S.) collected information from the included studies, and this information was discussed with two other team members (G.C.R and B.S.Z.). The collected data consisted of characteristics of the study (e.g., author, year of publication, country and study design), characteristics of the population (e.g., mouthwash used and protocol used), results and conclusion. When data were missing or incomplete in the article, attempts were made to contact the authors to obtain relevant unpublished information.-Risk of bias in individual studies For the evaluation of experimental studies in humans (clinical trials), the tool ""Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias"" was used (15) . This tool covers seven domains: 1) generation of the random se-e184 quence; 2) concealment of allocation; 3) blinding of participants and professionals; 4) blinding of outcome evaluators; 5) incomplete outcomes; 6) report of selective outcome; and 7) other sources of bias. The judgment regarding the possible risk of bias in each domain was made based on the information extracted from the study and was classified as ""high risk"", ""low risk"", or ""not clarified"" when there were not enough details reported in the study.As there is no standard tool for risk assessment of bias for in vitro studies, the risk of bias analysis was performed based on an adaptation to another previous study (16) . Two reviewers (I.B.B. and R.S.S.) independently assessed the included studies, classifying the quality of the report, performance bias, selection bias and detection bias. The risks of these different domains were labeled as having a low, unclear or high risk of bias. -Summary measures Any outcome measure was considered, provided that the outcome of interest was assessed.A total of 1222 articles were retrieved from the six electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature -LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library). After removing duplicate articles, 1133 references were maintained. Subsequently, applying the eligibility criteria, 1124 studies were excluded, resulting in 9 articles. A search was performed in the gray literature, and one study was selected, thus totaling 10 articles for a complete reading. After the complete reading (second phase), eight articles were excluded (Table 2) , resulting e185 in two studies included for the qualitative synthesis of the results (Fig. 1) . No additional articles were selected from the list of references or as indicated by the expert. Kappa coefficient of agreement index was > 0.8, indicating excellent agreement between the reviewers. The culture medium in these studies consisted of 0.3 g/L BSA bovine serum albumin for the clean condition and 3.0 g/L BSA + 3.0 ml/l erythrocytes as interference substance for the dirty condition.No analytical study evaluated the virucidal action of chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide on coronavirus in saliva, and no included study evaluated the action of one of the 3 rinses on SARS-cov2.-Risk of bias within studies Of the 13 items assessed for risk of bias, the 2 included studies were categorized as having a low risk of bias for 8 items. The domains that obtained the highest ""unclear risk"" rate (2 in each domain) were the quality of the report and the performance bias. None of the items in the e186 domains evaluated in the two studies received a ""high risk of bias"" (Fig. 2 , Table 3 ).-Results of individual studies Eggers et al., 2015 (4) and Eggers et al., 2018 (5) It is known that COVID-19 is a disease easily transmitted by droplets of saliva from an infected individual, by direct contact on the oral, nasal or ocular mucosa, or indirectly on surfaces where small particles are spread in the air through coughing or sneezing., as well as via instruments that produce aerosols in rooms and enclosed spaces, such as in dental offices (1, 5, 8) . It should also be noted that the virus can survive on hands, objects and e187 surfaces that have been exposed to infected saliva for up to 9 days 1. Due to the characteristics of dental environments, the risk of cross-infection can be high between patients and dentists. For dental offices and hospitals in areas affected (potentially) by COVID-19, rigorous and effective infection control protocols are urgently needed (7) . Based on the available literature, studies were sought to assess the efficiency of mouthwashes based on hydrogen peroxide, chlorhexidine and PVP-I as a way to decrease the viral load in saliva and thus to reduce the risk of contagion. Preoperative rinses reduce the number of microorganisms in the oral cavity (8) , and several types are commercially available; their action on the chemical control of dental plaque is already well known (17) . Some studies suggest that the use of mouthwashes is the best method for preventing the transmission of viruses and bacteria (2, 18) . Among these chemical agents, not all have bactericidal or virucidal efficacy, and others have undesirable side effects (19) .To prevent the spread of the virus, the governments of some countries have recommended, among the methods of cleaning the environment, the use of hydrogen peroxide (20) . This solution is already widely used as an environmental surgical disinfectant and as an oral disinfectant in the treatment of gingivitis, as reported in the literature (21, 22) . Another study performed in 2016 18 in hospitalized patients and under mechanical ventilation showed that the use of 3% hydrogen peroxide mouthwashes significantly reduced the incidence of pneumonia in these patients. Despite this finding, there are no studies to date that prove the efficiency of this substance in decreasing the viral load in saliva, despite its ability to serve as an excellent bactericide in patients with pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation in hospitals (18) . As instructed by the Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (5th edition) released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, chlorhexidine, which is commonly used as a mouthwash in dental practice, is not effective in reducing the viral load of COVID-19 8.Since this virus is vulnerable to oxidation, pre-procedure mouthwashes containing oxidizers are recommended, such as those with 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% PVP-I, to reduce the salivary viral load, including the potential transport of COVID-19 (8) . This result is in line with the results obtained in the present systematic review, which point to the effectiveness of mouthwashes based on 1% PVP-I (without dilution) and 7% (diluted at 1:30), which significantly decrease the viral load in saliva. The in vitro study conducted by Eggers et al. (4) demonstrated that the use of 7% PVP-I in the dilution of 2 ml to 60 ml of water (1:30), thus making the concentration 0.23%, even for 15 s, is already sufficient to ex-terminate the bacteria and viruses present in the samples analyzed with the MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov viruses. Furthermore, oral care products based on PVP-I do not irritate the oral mucosa during prolonged use (5) . A standardization of protocols in the dental clinic is necessary to improve the quality of care for patients seeking treatment. The use of a mouthwash is essential to reduce COVID-19 person-to-person transmission. The mouthwash with a PVP-I solution with a concentration of 1% (without dilution) and one of 7% (diluted at 1:30) examined in this systematic review has a killing effect on bacteria and viruses. The results of this systematic review, based on in vitro studies, indicate that the use of PVP-I at concentrations of 1% (without dilution) and 7% (diluted at 1:30) is more effective in reducing the viral load of the family coronavirus than other products, such as chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide. However, it is worth noting the limitations of this study design, requiring more research (mainly randomized clinical trials) using different concentrations, times of use, and effectiveness of such products on the COVID-19 virus.-Conclusions and Practical Implications Based on the evidence currently available in the literature, PVP-I at concentrations of 1% (without dilution) and 7% (diluted at 1:30) for 15 s seems to be the most effective mouthwash for reducing the viral load of COVID -19 present in human saliva. However, the guidelines for dental care refer to the use of hydrogen peroxide but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support this recommendation. The level of scientific evidence, related to the use of PVP-I mouthwash, is very fragile because it is two in vitro studies.",Brazil,first author,2021-02-01,02
1ab6bc9e63ee108ec0f0636f573d8c7ad691007c,To appear in: Intelligence-Based Medicine,"2019 witnessed the outbreak of a new virus, named COVID-19, caused by a coronavirus strain identified as SARS-CoV-2. In March 2020, the situation evolved to a global health crisis, as the WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. Timely identification of COVID-19 patients became a priority to fight this pandemic and several methods, such as molecular tests, are at the front line to detect positive cases. While reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has an accuracy of around 90% (week 3 after symptoms) (Deeks et al., 2020) , the need to provide proper identification of affected people calls for alternate methods such as CT scans analysis, especially in hospitals that lack molecular tests 1 but may have a CT scan readily available (Rubin et al., 2020) , thus mitigating said shortage. Medical professionals are resorting to this method to determine the presence of COVID-19 infection. Radiologists have reached an accuracy of around 90% with this method on low-dose CT scan (Dangis et al., n.d.) . Nevertheless, other studies suggest a lower accuracy, less than 80%, and a mean recall value of 80% (Bai et al., 2020) . Reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models have come to show accuracy levels higher than 80% in most cases as will be detailed later. However, most of these models require a huge amount of CT scans images to be trained on. Yang et al., 2020 present a dataset collected from different data sources and proposes a model with an accuracy of 89%.AI's performance and benefits in medicine have been demonstrated time and again (Lu et al., 2017) . Transfer learning, widely used for pattern recognition tasks, has been recently applied to design intelligent systems capable of accurately identifying COVID-19 patients through CT Scan imagery. Mei et al., 2020 developed artificial intelligence algorithms to identify positive COVID-19 patients by combining CT imaging and clinical information reaching an accuracy of 83.5%. Additionally, Zhang et al., 2020 proposed an AI system that can diagnose novel coronavirus pneumonia to assist radiologists performing diagnosis, achieving 92.49% accuracy on the test set. Regarding ensemble methods, one approach used chest X-Ray images to develop a transfer learning-based ensemble classifier for pneumonia identification. The authors emphasize the higher performance achieved by these when compared to individual models (Chouhan et al., 2020) . A similar approach for COVID-19 identification was developed, also showing significant results, on ensemble techniques (Loey, Smarandache, et al., 2020) .The advantages of using ensemble methods are analyzed and discussed in this article. By exploring the differences in performance levels between soft, hard and weighted voting schemes, we demonstrate the superior accuracy provided by a weighted voting scheme, which resembles a generalized linear model with a binomial link function.Additionally, valuable findings were obtained while tuning the decision threshold. We found evidence of a performance boost in reducing the decision cut-off point by less than 0.05. Moreover, the use of raw output scores, instead of a binary classification, was found to be more effective by enabling the prioritization of critical cases and setting a risk status for cases near the threshold.Starting with the results by , this work expands on the use of transfer learning and ensemble methods to achieve three main tasks. (1) Build a model using transfer learning technique on state-of-the-art ImageNet pretrained models combining them into an ensemble than can be easily replicated by researchers and deep learning practitioners that may benefit from the current work helping to fight the novel coronavirus outbreak. (2) Achieve competitive performance by reaching an accuracy of at least 85%. (3) Present the limitations of dealing with small datasets in visual recognition tasks and expanding on how to overcome them.As deep neural models require a great amount of training data, pattern recognition models are not an exception. Since CT scan images do not suffer generally from rotation or vertical flips, we took as transformations random resized crop and random horizontal flip. The first one randomly selects a multiplier (from 0.08 to 1) to apply to the original size to select the cropping window size and an aspect ratio (from 0.75 to 1.33) before being resized. Random horizontal flip randomly flips horizontally an image with a probability of 0.5. Besides data augmentation, it is important to preprocess images to specific parameters as previously trained models are optimized for data normalized in a specific range. For this reason, images are resized to 256x256 pixels to be later resized to 224x224 in the random resized crop transformation. Finally, images are normalized from 0 to 1 by dividing their pixel channels' values by 255 (RGB 8-bit images are represented by pixels values ranging from 0 to 255 on each of their 3 channels). To keep original quality of validation and test set, images were only resized and standardized, with no augmentation involved.The selection of the data augmentation methods presented are based on the proven effectiveness and the simplicity in interpretation of such methods (Géron, 2019) . Also, as we do not expect images to be presented, for example, with a 90 degrees rotation or with sharp variations in brightness or contrast, such transformation techniques could lead to an increase in irrelevant augmented data. Finally, the parameters from the transformations are the ones commonly used in pretrained models such as Inception v3.Our model is comprised of a 2-stage transfer learning training process and a stacked ensemble method. For this we used six ImageNet pretrained convolutional neural networks: VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) , ResNet50 (He et al., 2015b) , WideResNet50-2 (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) , DenseNet161, DenseNet169 (Huang et al., 2016) and Inception v3 (Szegedy et al., n.d.) . The classifier and fully connected layers are replaced by custom build layers. Specifically, VGG16 (with batch normalization) last fully connected layer was replaced by a layer consisting of 128 neurons with ReLU activation and a 0.5 dropout rate 2 before being finally connected to a single neuron, responsible for the binary classification. Remaining neural networks had their fully connected top layer completely replaced by layer consisting of 256 neurons (except for the case of the DenseNet161 model which was initially fully connected to a layer containing 512 neurons) followed by a single dimension batch normalization function, ReLU activation and 0.5 dropout rate. Finally, output is connected to a layer consisting of 64 neurons with ReLU activation and 0.4 dropout rate to fully connect them to the decision neuron. It is important to underline the usage of the batch normalization layer. Batch normalization not only speeds up the training process and improves model generalization, but also helps reduce sensitivity to bad parameters initialization which could undermine models' training process (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) . Table 2 shows the different classifier architectures per pretrained model.Ensemble models have the advantage of leveraging the information from several classifiers and combining them into a more robust model. Variance and bias are also reduced, thus minimizing the expected error. Additionally, a feature space region that may have been incorrectly learned by a classifier can still be correctly classified by using the pattern learned from another classifier, leveraged by the ensemble model. These characteristics make ensemble models a solid option for approaching complex classification and regression tasks (Géron, 2019) . The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is an activation function commonly used in artificial neural networks training tasks. It is responsible for emitting the output signal of each neuron from one layer to the next one. Dropout regularization technique aims to reduce overfitting by randomly (probability given by the dropout rate) turning off neurons within a specific layer.These configurations of classification layers were chosen after performing hyperparameter optimization runs, this includes the number of neurons per layer (powers of two) and dropout rate. It was found that more than two hidden layers led the model to overfitting. It is especially important to recall that the dataset has a low number of images to train on, making our model prone to overfitting. We also find it important to emphasize the difference in architectures between the pretrained models.The added layers are defined as the classification block of the neural network; that is, they are fed by the final pooling layer on each neural network. One difference, as shown in Table 2 , is that the VGG16 model has a shorter configuration. This is due to the fact that the added layer is actually part of a larger pretrained classification block (consisting of more than one layer) and a deeper block would make the model prone to overfitting. The remaining pretrained neural models have a single layer as part of their classification block, this is why we replaced the whole block with the proposed configuration. Regarding the number of neurons, we aimed to keep the second to last layer as small as possible without any reduction in performance, further avoiding overfitting. Finally, as shown in Fig. 2 , we concatenate outputs from each model to create a stacked ensemble model. Since each output is a single node, we are now left with a 6dimensional vector which is connected to a single neuron activated by a sigmoid function. Training runs with one and two hidden layers comprised of 6 and 16 neurons were held, only to show a clear overfitting of the ensemble model.As mentioned earlier, the proposed model was trained on a 2-stage process detailed by Algorithm 1. First, each pretrained model was replaced by the previously mentioned architecture, their feature's layers were frozen, leaving only the fully connected layers available for training, and parameters were randomly initialized by He uniform J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f initialization (He et al., 2015a) . This model configuration was trained for 30 epochs in its first stage. An epoch refers to one whole training cycle through the training set. Within each epoch, the data is fed by batches. Once all of the batches are fed and training is executed, an epoch is completed. Immediately after, the second stage, also known as fine tuning, unfreezes the whole model and trains it for 20 epochs (Inception v3 model was trained for 30 epochs due to higher complexity and overall demonstrating better performance). Neural networks are fed by batches for training and testing, preprocessing 3 and feeding them to the neural networks with a batch size of 32 images. As a single output node for binary classification activates a sigmoid function, the loss function is binary cross entropy. A two-stage training method helps prevent the randomness from the initialization in the output fully connected layer to disrupt the already learned parameters from the pre-trained models. This is done by allowing those parameters to be only fine-tuned after the first stage has optimized the output layer. Regarding the optimizer for ensemble model, the method used included the Adam algorithm with decoupled weight decay (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) , also known as AdamW optimizer. It has been proven that the Adam optimizer with L2 regularization 4 generally fails to converge to a global optima, since its regularization term fails to be equivalent to weight decay as in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization, instead converging quickly and uniformly to a local optima. This is why the SGD with momentum optimization has been the optimizer of choice for many state-of-the-art neural networks. On the other hand, the AdamW optimizer correctly adds the weight decay after the moving averages are calculated. This greatly prevents models to overfit (the model no longer being able to generalize enough to accurately predict from new data), especially when dealing with small datasets.Learning rate was set to 1e-3 for the first stage and 1e-4 for the second stage, to account for fine tuning, avoiding taking large gradient descent steps to prevent feature layers values from varying significantly. This is one of the most important hyperparameters in neural networks: learning rate controls how much the model's parameters are updated in response to the network's error. Selecting a proper learning rate is of utmost importance since a value too high could cause the objective function to diverge while a value too low could make learning too slow and the loss function could converge to a local optimum. To ensure a more robust control of the learning network, we set a learning rate scheduler for both stages, based on validation accuracy behavior, with a patience value of 10 and a reduction factor of 0.1. In this way, when the training reaches a point in which after 10 epochs no improvement is seen, the learning rate is reduced to 10% of its original value. This further improves the training, avoiding overfitting by gradually reducing learning rate when the increase in validation accuracy seems to have come to a stall.It is important to note that we tested cosine annealing learning rate scheduler on both SGD with momentum (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2016) and AdamW optimizers, but found no significant improvements over the initial learning rate scheduler. Further testing on these schedulers and optimizers combination is recommended to properly find evidence (or lack thereof) for improvements under the trained dataset. Finally, to avoid training for excessive epochs, we set a best model checkpoint based on validation accuracy for the second stage, this way the trained parameters which led to the highest validation accuracy while training, are the ones used by the model once the training is over.The aforementioned training specifications were applied to each of the six individual models. Finally, after the second stage is completed, outputs concatenated and all models frozen, the ensemble single output neuron is trained for 15 epochs, using an AdamW optimizer, learning rate of 1e-3 and best model checkpoint. It is important to note that while some initializations required the model to be trained on more than 15 epochs to reach convergence, most of the time it was quickly achieved within the first 10 epochs.To test this model against an ensemble baseline, we built a voting classifier based upon the results from the six models. For this, we provided two voting methods: hard voting, in which final class label is predicted by a majority rule voting of all six estimators predicted labels; and soft voting, where scores from all six estimators are averaged and rounded to the nearest integer to give out the final prediction (Géron, 2019) . In both methods, a progressive validation of estimators in an ensemble was produced: models were sorted, based on their validation accuracy from highest to lowest, and their ensemble's new accuracy was registered. The highest validation accuracy ensemble was selected, and performance metrics were calculated on the holdout test set.The proposed model was trained on an instance with 61GB RAM, four Intel Xeon vCPU running at 2.7 GHz and one NVIDIA K80 GPU with 12 GB of memory. Deep learning library PyTorch was used for data preprocessing and model training on Python 3.6.6. 5Initial hyperparameters for models, including construction of fully connected layer, number of epochs per stage, learning rate, scheduler configuration and optimization method, were found through controlled iterations on each model based on reported final performance on the validation set.The metrics recorded to evaluate our model's performance were accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, F1 score and area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Goutte & Gaussier, 2005) . Accuracy and loss plots (see Fig. 3 ) show interesting results when combining the two stages in a single plot. Both plots show the evolution of accuracy and loss on each epoch. These plots are used while training a neural network to assess the fitting behavior of the model. For example, a model with a validation accuracy plot which stops increasing, while the training set's accuracy continues to increase, can be evidence of overfitting. This kind of behavior should be avoided by the use of generalization techniques such as the ones previously described. As soon as the second stage starts, both training and validation accuracy show a performance bump of around 10% on average, this can be explained by the fine tuning of the pretrained feature layers adjusting to the new layers. However, loss plots show a different behavior. Training loss shows a decrease of up to 70% when comparing convergence achieved in the first versus the second stage. Nevertheless, validation loss shows little evidence of decreasing, remaining almost stationary during training. This is due to the scarcity in validation data, where scores near the decision threshold (0.5) are correctly adjusted at the expense of highly confident correct scores nearing the threshold, farther away from the true label. Binary cross entropy loss function penalizes higher differences between model output and true value more strongly, due to the log function behavior. For example, for a positive label sample, a change in model output from 0.45 to 0.55 represents a decrease of 0.09 in loss and an increase in accuracy of almost 1%, while a change in model output from another positive sample from 0.9 to 0.7 means an increase of 0.10 in loss with no change in accuracy. Changes in individual samples have a more profound effect when dealing with small validation sets. As it can be seen from Fig. 3 , the second stage was key to reach the performance levels achieved. At this point, the pretrained model parameters are finely adjusted along with the classification block which was already trained in the first stage. This allows for each of the ensemble models to shift from the pretrained classes to the new classes, by learning the features from the latter ones. The effect is finally reflected on the performance increment obtained. Table 3 shows the metrics for each of the six models, the ensemble baseline model and the proposed model. As we can see, although the best of the six pretrained models, based on accuracy is DenseNet161 deep convolutional neural network, the ensemble soft-voting baseline method fails to overcome performance metrics from the best pretrained model. Moreover, the ensemble hard-voting baseline method yields less encouraging results, remaining 0.5% below the soft-voting ensemble. It is important to bear in mind that this voting scheme averages the scores from each model, thus giving an equal weight to each of these. We can infer that, to make the soft-voting method at Epochs Epochs least as good as the single best pretrained model, a weighted average should be taken into account. This leads us to the proposed model previously described, where besides applying a weighted average with an offset constant, the final result is normalized by a sigmoid function. Since this is a binary classification model, confidence intervals with a confidence level of 95% by binomial proportion are obtained following the Wilson method (Agresti & Coull, 1998) , as shown in Table 4 . AUC confidence intervals are determined using the DeLong method (DeLong et al., 1988) . Further experimentation on raw model output, before the classification threshold is applied, showed interesting results when setting a slightly greater range for positive classification. As the raw output is the product of a logistic regression, it can also be used to assess patients at risk of being infected, considering patients with a score slightly below the threshold of 0.5 to be possible COVID-19 positive. Furthermore, setting the classification threshold to 0.45 yields an accuracy of 87.19%, a precision of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 87.50%, a recall of 85.71%, a specificity of 88.57% and an F1 score of 86.60%, proving that the use of a threshold range (scores from 0.45 to 0.5 being considered COVID-19 risk cases) can improve model performance, including recall, to increase beyond any previous models. For the present article we will be considering the standard threshold of 0.5 to avoid any bias by fine-tuning the classification cutoff point with the test set. Finally, the proposed model's accuracy overcomes all other models', reaching 86.70%. The confusion matrix and ROC plot are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . To better understand each convolutional model individually, we can identify the regions from CT scan images off of which the model was based to finally infer the label. Grad-CAM (Chattopadhyay et al., 2017; Selvaraju et al., 2016) is a technique which produces visual explanations for decisions by taking the values from the gradients in the model's final feature layer, for highlighting the important regions taken by the model in their prediction. Fig. 6 . Grad-CAM++ activation regions visualization for the first five pretrained models. The areas with higher intensity in the generated heatmap (second and third columns) are the ones with the highest activation response from the last convolutional layers on each pre-trained model. This provides a better human-interpretable explanation of the decisions taken by the classifiers.As can be seen in Fig. 6 , models often identify regions from the CT scan mainly described as hazy, ""ground glass"" white spots which are the main indication of the presence of COVID-19 in a patient. Although not in all cases, a model manages to resort to the correct regions for inference (as the VGG16 model on Fig. 6 ) the ensemble method we propose takes into consideration the decision of other models that, as an alternative, have been proven to detect correct regions from which to base their inference. For instance, while DenseNet161 and VGG16 were the best fitted models, based on accuracy and F1 score, the latter's last layer is seen to be poorly activated by the sample presented, contrasting with other models which, working as an ensemble, provide the advantage of correctly boosting performance. Indeed, this specialization of some models to detect better certain CT scan images regions provides a robust classifier when ensembled into a stacked model: contribution from each output can be optimized to finally obtain a more accurate prediction by weighting each model's output for each case to finally agree on a prediction.Nevertheless, activation heatmaps are not only useful for model interpretation. Zhou et al., 2015 demonstrate a useful application for activation heatmaps in discriminative localization. In their research they show a CNN activation heatmap effectively localizing specific image regions, based on the classification classes. This feature can be used by physicians to not only detect positive COVID-19 cases, but to also infer the affected region. By having a visual interpretation of the classification results, as seen in Fig. 6 , physicians could avail themselves of this information to focus treatment in the affected area. Moreover, this could potentially be used in further investigation of the effects COVID-19 has in the human body.In this study, an ensemble deep learning architecture was used to design a classifier to diagnose COVID-19 cases following a 2-stage algorithm. Our findings now provide evidence that support the superior results yielded by the use of an ensemble approach. It can be inferred from the models' performance metrics (Table 3) that the proposed ensemble model outperforms each of the single pre-trained models. Furthermore, voting ensemble models were developed and showed that there is not enough evidence that regular hard and soft voting ensembles best the individual pre-trained models. It is important to note that the main difference lies in the fact that the proposed model assigns coefficients to each of the pre-trained models' outputs in the same way as a generalized linear regression model, following a binomial link function, does. This allows the ensemble to assign weights to each pre-trained model based on their own effectiveness. Despite the fact that we didn't expect the regular voting ensemble method to fail to outperform the individual models, it revealed the effect that weighted coefficients applied to each output had.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Most of the studies that motivated the present research demonstrated similar accuracy levels with different architectures (Table 5) Additional approaches that combined clinical information also were found to reproduce competitive results. Mei et al., 2020 combined CT imaging and clinical information to reach an accuracy of 83.5%. Furthermore, overall our method was the one that obtained superior performance in terms of accuracy, compared to other studies in the literature.Recall metric provides us a way to measure and understand the model's capacity to correctly identify positive COVID-19 patients. This metric is of much importance given that each false negative can have a detrimental effect on the patient's health, rendering him or her as healthy, while actually being infected. Although the proposed model achieves a lower recall than the VGG16 model, this comes at a bigger cost for the latter: precision and specificity abruptly fall below 80%. On the other hand, the proposed model reaches an 89.52% level of specificity, reducing the occurrences of false positives. Whereas a higher recall is desired, since the reduction of false negatives is of primary concern to adequately identify all COVID-19 cases, the proposed model achieves a considerably greater increase in precision and specificity. We will exemplify how with absolute values from the test set: the decrease of 1% in recall and increase of 10.5% in specificity can be understood as 1 less positive COVID-19 case correctly identified, while 11 more negative COVID-19 cases are correctly classified. This evidenced the importance of recall-precision trade-off analysis even in cases where false negatives need to be diminished.Our findings on the use of a threshold range for classification revealed an increase in the proposed model's performance. Reducing the classification threshold by as little as 0.05 boosted the performance significantly, increasing recall to over 85%. This evidences that the use of raw output scores can be effectively used to adequately prioritize high risk patients.One of the main limitations of the present research was the small dataset available. The results show that despite of this limitation, our proposed model was capable of achieving an accuracy level over 85% by the use of techniques such as regularization, learning rate schedulers and data augmentation agreeing with the existing literature. Loey, Manogaran, et al., 2020 compares the difference of using transfer learning with augmented data versus non-augmented data within the same dataset. The authors found that data augmentation proved to increase model accuracy in four out of the five models tested. Although these methods helped the model to avoid overfitting, one of the pretrained models, Inception v3, showed an overfitting pattern on its accuracy plot (Fig.  3) . However, the model checkpoint implementation retrieved the parameters before the overfitting took place.Another limitation of this study was the fixed dataset split configuration used. As described in the Dataset section, images gathered from papers were used for training and original CT scan images donated from hospitals were used for testing and validating the model. This prevented us from applying cross-validation to construct confidence intervals for the performance metrics. Nevertheless, we determined confidence intervals from binomial classification, as shown in Table 4 , providing statistical significance to the metrics obtained.Lastly, although procedures already exist for proper identification of brain or lung injuries by CT scan, this is not the case for COVID-19, being the reason why PCR tests are preferred for such diagnosis. Nevertheless, in the absence of said tests, diagnosis by CT scan is possible and accurate, when combined with information from the patient's medical history. This assessment was supported by a radiologist, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed model in hospitals suffering from a shortage of test kits.Future research should focus on the use of ensemble methods as a way to enhance stateof-the-art architectures' performance. Although several advances in neural networks for COVID-19 diagnosis have been made, an ensemble method would lead to a boost in performance, which could become significant. Also, as more data is generated, training should be performed on a larger number of samples, helping overcome one of the limitations mentioned in this article, and leading to a more robust classifier that could be deployed and made publicly available for hospitals that are lacking PCR tests to effectively provide a COVID-19 diagnosis.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fWith the novel coronavirus outbreak now a global threat, the timely identification of positive COVID-19 cases became of main concern, helping ensure early treatment and proper pandemic control. The use of transfer learning and ensemble architectures for training artificial neural networks, as presented in this paper, provided a sound and effective method for detecting COVID-19 cases based on chest CT scan images.Although state-of-the-art pretrained models are capable of attaining high performance, the addition of ensemble methods has proven to boost models' metrics. The proposed model achieved performance levels above those reached by radiologists (Bai et al., 2020; Dangis et al., n.d.) , and are competitive with current literature's artificial intelligence models, ranging from 80% to 90% in most cases, proving its effectiveness. We trained six pre-trained ImageNet models in two stages, feeding each classifier with a dataset comprised of 746 CT scan images, 349 being COVID-19 positive and 397 being COVID-19 negative. The ensemble was finally built by concatenating the models' outputs into a final activation neuron. We found that the use of threshold ranges to assess the risk of a COVID-19 positive case yields a higher performance without reducing specificity and precision. We also found important to emphasize the added potential capacity of automatizing CT scan analysis, greatly reducing its lead time and giving out a probability of COVID-19 presence for the patient. This, enhanced by integrated applications, could speed up COVID-19 testing, providing results in a very small timeframe and deriving only scores close to classification boundary to a specialist.If we cannot provide timely and proper COVID-19 diagnosis, our efforts to hinder the expansion of the coronavirus could be thwarted. This is especially relevant in developing countries where shortages of PCR test kits can disrupt the efforts to combat the pandemic. We encourage researchers in artificial intelligence to further improve on current literature's methods, contributing in a joint effort to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic.",Peru,abstract,2021-02-18,02

In general, the determination of the presence and magnitude of a specific memory T-cell response to this coronavirus infection is performed with an ELISPOT assay by establishing the number of lymphocytes that produce IFN-γ after stimulation with disease-specific antigens or peptides (Ni et al., 2020 , Pai et al., 2014 , Abate et al., 2013 , Braun et al., 2020 , Grifono et al., 2020 , LeBert et al., 2020 , Sekine et al., 2020 . For this technique, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have to be isolated from fresh heparinized blood by density gradient centrifugation, and the secretion of cytokines by individual T cells is quantified with a microscope or with a special apparatus-the ELISPOT plate reader. The ELISPOT assay is a ""for research laboratories only"" technique that is highly laborious, technically demanding, relatively expensive, and cannot easily be used in a clinical laboratory or be applied in population-based studies.Due to the cost, infrastructure, and laboratory requirements needed to perform the assay, its use in resource-limited settings such as Ecuador may be minimal.Cellular immune responses can also be determined with a simpler assay: an interferongamma release assay (IGRA). This assay, an in vitro blood test, quantifies T-cell secreted cytokines (i.e. gamma interferon (IFN-γ) but other cytokines like TNFα or IL-2 can also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f be quantified) upon stimulation of the whole blood (not just the isolated lymphocytes) with specific antigens (Pai et al., 2014 , Abate et al., 2013 . The secreted cytokine IFN-γ is measured with an ELISA assay, a readily available technique in most laboratories, and the results are read out with an ELISA plate reader. IGRAs have found an application in the clinical laboratory and are used to determine a latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) as well as to measure cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific cell-mediated immunity and predict CMV infection in transplant recipients (Pai et al., 2014 , Abate et al., 2013 . These IGRA tests have been extensively evaluated and compared with the ELISPOT assay and have been shown to display similar capabilities for predicting MTB or CMV infection. Moreover, several commercial and FDA or CE marked assays to detect immunity against TB or CMV are available and are broadly performed.In the present study, we explore the use of a COVID-19 IGRA and assess the magnitude of IFN-γ release in convalescent COVID-19 patients and healthy COVID-19 naïve controls in response to specific antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: the RBD protein; the S1 part of the Spike protein; or the Nucleocapsid (N) protein. Additionally, we determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in those participants with an ""inhouse"" ELISA (Amanat et al., 2020 , Guevara et al., 2020 . We show that a significant percentage of unexposed donors possess SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells and we discuss these results.The study was conducted in Quito, Ecuador, in September 2020. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 32 patients in this study: 13 convalescent COVID-19 patients, all with non-severe COVID-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f healthy controls. These healthy controls had been extremely cautious during the pandemic, avoiding contact with other people and self-reported none of the typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic, such as fever, a persistent cough, or a loss of smell or taste. In addition, two asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers were included in this study. These two subjects never showed any symptoms or signs of COVID-19 disease but the RT-PCR technique was carried out on them as a requirement for a work permit in June 2020 and resulted in positive diagnoses.Serology and IGRAs for all patients and controls were performed during the last two weeks of September 2020, three months after the RT-PCR diagnosis of the convalescent patients. In order to determine the presence of coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in our study group, an ""in-house"" SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgG ELISA (9, 10) was used.For the IGRA, a heparinized blood sample was taken (4 ml) and divided into aliquots of 250 µl and stimulated with respectively 2 µg/ml of the RBD protein (isolation procedure from reference 9) or 2 µg/ml of the commercially available Nucleocapsid (N) protein or Spike (S1) protein (ViroGen, www.virogen.com, Catalog Numbers: 00221-V and 00226-V respectively). A dose concentration response curve with blood of IGRA positive and IGRA negative patients was used to determine the optimum concentration of the antigens for stimulation in the IGRA. At 2 ug/ml a maximum IFN-γ response in blood from COVID-19 subjects was found without a stimulation in the uninfected controls. For each participant an unstimulated control (NIL) was included and we assayed a 250 µl blood J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sample with the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), a positive control to assess the cytokine response rate of the blood sample. Stimulation was realized in a 96-well flatbottom ELISA plate at 37°C for 24 hours. Plasma was harvested and IFN-γ production was determined with a Human IFN-γ ELISA (MaxTM Standard Set Biolegend cat. No.The RBD IgG ELISA showed that all COVID-19 symptomatic patients (RT-PCR positive) were positive for IgG antibodies against the RBD protein 3 months after the RT-PCR diagnosis. The two asymptomatic RT-PCR positive patients and all healthy unexposed control patients were seronegative with this ELISA (See Table 1 ). The results of whole blood stimulation in the COVD-19 IGRA assay are shown in Figure 1 . A strong induction of IFN-γ production was found in 80% of the COVID-19 symptomatic patients with all three antigens, but the N protein and S protein were the most potent stimulators of an IFN-γ response (Figure 1 A, B , C). The two asymptomatic but RT-PCR positive patients (patient 14 and 15), both without specific SAR-CoV-2 antibodies, also showed a strong inducible T-cell immunity response. Of the COVID-19 naïve patients, 45%showed inducible T-cell immunity. The response in these healthy unexposed controls with a T-cell response was statistically not significantly different in magnitude from the convalescent COVID-19 patients for any of the stimulating antigens (p-value = 0.271, 0.437 and 0.719 for RBD, N and S1 proteins respectively).Using an easy-to-perform whole blood assay that assesses T-cell responses, we found that most convalescent patients but also a significant proportion of healthy unexposed individuals had a specific and strong T-cell response, as determined with the production of INF-γ after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens ( Figure 1 ). Several studies, all using the ELISPOT assay, have reported the presence of a T-cell response in most or all convalescent COVID-19 patients (Braun et al., 2020 , Grifono et al., 2020 , LeBert et al., 2020 , Sekine et al., 2020 , Moderbacher et al., 2020 , Mateus et al., 2020 , Peng et al., 2020 . However, concerning a T-cell response in healthy unexposed controls, response rates between 28 and 50% have been reported (de Vries 2020 , Lipsitch et al., 2020 , Sagar et al., 2020 , and several studies report no T-cell response in COVID-19 naïve control patients (de Vries 2020 , Moderbacher et al., 2020 , Schwartzkopf et al., 2021 . Most of these studies were performed with the ELISPOT assay but in Italy and the USA, an IGRA has also been used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response (Petrone et al., 2020 , Murugesan et al., 2020 . In both studies, a specific T-cell response was detected in convalescent patients; however, the IGRA did not detect an INF-γ response in healthy unexposed subjects.Pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 naïve subjects has been reviewed in several publications (Altman et al., 2020 , Dosho et al., 2020 , de Vries 2020 , Sette et al., 2020 . The reason why a specific COVID-19 T-cell response might be detected in a healthy unexposed subject remains unclear and is the subject of suppositions.Most ELISPOT studies with COVID-19 naïve subjects used human blood samples derived before the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered in 2019, thus before any chance of exposure. For this reason, these ELISPOT studies concluded that the T-cell response in unexposed healthy subjects probably comes from prior contact with circulating ""common cold"" coronaviruses (Grifoni et al., 2020 , Matheus et al., 2020 or previous exposure to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f flu and/or CMV viruses (Mahajan et al., 2020) or other viral or microbial antigens (Tan et al., 2020) . In our study, we used blood taken during the pandemic from volunteers who self-reported zero contact, were seronegative for the COVID-19 antigen RBD and had never shown any signs or symptoms of COVID-19. We therefore cannot exclude that the T-cell response in some of our COVID-19 ""naïve"" healthy controls comes from an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Patients 14 and 15 of our study are an example of this. These individuals were classified as COVID-19 patients because of a positive RT-PCR; however, they were asymptomatic and did not develop an antibody response against the RBD protein but both showed a strong T-cell response. It is possible that, after SARS-CoV-2 colonization of the nasopharynx, the immune system of these two asymptomatic patients left them with a memory T-cells only response and no SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were induced. Another explanation is that the T-cell response comes from a previous corona-like infection and the pre-existing T-cell immune response protected these two patients against the development of a more invasive disease pattern.Pre-existing cross-reactive T cells could be important in explaining some of the differences in infection rates or pathology (Le Bert et al., 2020 , Sagar et al., 2020 .Concerning the cohort of naïve controls, we exclude that this group contains a considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with an undetected asymptomatic infection, basically because all the integrands of the control group are IgG seronegative for the RBD antigen. Another reason is that the infection prevalence in Ecuador is relatively low. At the time of this study, September 2020, Ecuador had reported a total of about 200,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases (about 1.1% of the population). Of course, the real infection prevalence could have been several times higher, but even so, it is very unlikely that 45% of this control group got infected and thus that we are looking at a T-cell response specific for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.In conclusion, the finding of a high percentage of unexposed healthy subjects with a preexisting immunity in Quito, Ecuador, raises the expectation that a significant part of our population is likely to have SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells because of prior exposure to flu, CMV viruses or common cold-causing coronaviruses. Future investigations should aim to determine whether the pre-existing immune response is protective and/or is able to overcome a more severe COVID-19 disease or contributes to a faster recovery.Our study showed that the COVID-19 IGRA is a useful and sensitive new tool that can assess exposure to coronaviruses or cross-reactivity to similar viruses by determining the release of IFN-γ after stimulation with virus-specific antigens. The technique is simple, relatively cheap and can be used in a clinical laboratory. This is certainly not the case with the ELISPOT assay. Moreover, the IGRA assay can be easily scaled up for population-based studies and investigations where high numbers of patients are needed.Together with serology, the IGRA can be used to screen both antibody and T-cell responses of individual patients in order to better understand population-level immunity and determine pre-existing immunity in seronegative individuals.An important limitation of our study is that the study sample is not representative of the population. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. Furthermore, our assay didn't differentiate between IFN-γ production of CD4+ or CD8+ cells, but stimulation with defined CD8(+) and CD4(+) peptides can be considered (Grifoni et al., 2020 , Peng et al., 2020 and has been used in the IGRAs described in Petrone et al., 2020 and Murugesan et al., 2020. In addition, the induction of other cytokines can be measured with this IGRA (Petrone et al., 2020) . Likewise, the IGRA J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f can be employed for follow-up on vaccination to determine the development of a T-cell response in vaccinated individuals or can be used to determine if the presence of crossreactive memory T cells is associated with protective immunity and can diminish the disease manifestations from SARS-CoV-2 infection (Sagar et al., 2020) .Blood was collected following informed written consent. The Ethics Committee of the Health Ministry of Ecuador approved the study protocol 004-2020.The authors declare that they have no competing interests. The results of stimulation of convalescent patients and controls with respectively the RBD, N or S1 protein are shown in Figure 1A , 1B, and 1C. In Figure 1D , the INF-γ responses of each patient and to the three antigens are grouped together. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection are numbered 1 to 15, of which patients 14 and 15 were asymptomatic. Subjects 16 to 33 are COVID-19 naïve patients. After 24 hours of stimulation, IFN-γ concentrations in plasma were determined using a commercially available human IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based kit (Biolegend cat.No. 430101). The magnitude of the stimulation was expressed as the optical density at 450 nm (OD450) for blood stimulated with antigen minus the OD450 for blood without antigen stimulation. An OD of 1.0 corresponded with approximately 400 pg/ml IFN-γ.Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was used as the mitogen at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in the IGRA to assess the quality and response capacity of the blood. All patients and controls showed a maximum production of the cytokine with this mitogen with a mean optical density (OD450) of 2.54 (SD = 0.13), representing approximately 1000 pg/ml of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",Ecuador,abstract,2021-02-12,02
1eed286b49b400f6ef2de47de3c575e2cf153745,"The unexpected dynamics of COVID-19 in Manaus, Brazil: Herd immunity versus interventions","In December 2020, a vicious second wave of COVID-19 erupted in Manaus, Brazil, resulting in >100 residents dying per day, and triggering yet another collapse in the country's rundown healthcare system 1 . Awkwardly, this contradicts the recent Science paper of Buss et al. (2020) 2 which suggested that any second wave would be highly unlikely. The authors estimated that the first wave infected ~76% of the city's population by October 2020 (see also 3 ). With an Attack Rate (AR)~76%, it appeared that herd immunity had been reached, and no further epidemic should be expected, assuming reinfection is relatively rare. Currently there are only speculations as to why a major second wave then appeared (Sabino et al, 2021) 4 . For example, measurements of AR via seroprevalence testing could possibly be inaccurate given the biases of the blood donor data 5 they used. It is therefore useful to explore alternative and complementary epidemiological modelling analyses of publicly available mortality datasets to help understand why the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak suddenly ""crashed,"" and why a secondary wave later unexpectedly appeared in Manaus in December 2020. Elucidating the underlying processes that took place is of central importance for planning future interventions appropriately, not only for the benefit of Manaus which is currently experiencing the full fury of SARS-CoV-2, but also for numerous other potentially high-risk locations worldwide.We first mention that it is not uncommon for potentially large-scale epidemic outbreaks to die out well before predictions of conventional epidemiological models, and well before herd-immunity can develop 6 . For example, the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone Guinea 2014 7 began with an initially susceptible population of 5,364,000 residents. While a conventional SEIR-type model predicted 5,157,000 Ebola cases 6 , the epidemic resulted in ""only"" 14,124 infected individuals. We documented a similarly perplexing account of a catastrophic epidemic outbreak 8 in WW2. Brauer (2019) 6 showed that the early demise of an epidemic can occur in the presence of: i) heterogeneous transmission and super-spreader-like events 6,9 ; ii) human behavioural responses which reduce the size of epidemics by reducing the reproductive number ܴ ሺ ‫ݐ‬ ሻ over time 6, 8, 10, 11 , creating a ""herd-protection"" effect based on behaviour rather than immunity. Brauer (2019) 6 modelled behavioural interference by assuming that (See also 11 ). Other studies of cholera and influenza use similar parametric approaches 11 . Here we generalise this principle by fitting a ""flexible""Exploring this more deeply, we fitted an SEIR-type epidemiological model (see Appendix) to COVID-19 mortality datasets and estimated ܴ ሺ ‫ݐ‬ ሻ as it changed, as shown in Figures 1&2 (blue). The model is described in the Appendix and in Refs.7,9&13. In all states, and in the cities of Manaus and Sao Paolo, we found evidence that ܴ ሺ ‫ݐ‬ ሻ fell substantially with time over the first wave as the epidemic proceeded, and it thus appeared to be a regional phenomenon. In line with Brauer (2019) 6 , the reduction in ܴ ሺ ‫ݐ‬ ሻ is likely to be due to behavioural reactions such as state-wide NPI's, individual behavioural changes, and possibly also combined with seasonal and/or climatic factors. In addition, it was impossible to fit SEIR-type models to the mortality data with a constant ܴ , as might be a reasonable assumption if interventions or seasonality had little impact, as has been suggested. Any such fit yielded outcomes that did not appear meaningful. For example, for Manaus, the best fit in Figure 2a ‫ݐ‬ ሻ decreased rapidly in April, thereby allowing a low stationary endemic state to be maintained data from July to November, as had been the case. The model estimated an AR~30% until October 2020 in Manaus, which would appear to be reasonable given the large ongoing second wave that followed. Mellan et al. (2020) predicted a smaller AR. In summary, the first wave of the Manaus epidemic appeared to crash due to a reduction in ܴ ሺ ‫ݐ‬ ሻ , rather than because of a large attack rate and the attainment of herd immunity. Buss et al. (2020) showed that their estimate of a high AR~76% implies that the infection fatality rate (IFR) must be extremely low for consistency (on average IFR~0.018-0.26%) -but they did not mechanistically model the epidemic trajectory over time as done here. We were unable to fit the mortality dynamics sensibly with such a low IFR (see Figure S1 ). Our results indicate that intervention activities implemented in Manaus played an important role in the crash of the first wave seen in early May 2020, as also argued by Mellan et al. (2020). . Although no national lockdown had officially been set early in the epidemic, states and cities adopted their own measures. Buss et al (2020) 2 document that physical distancing increased during March. By March 23, a state of emergency was declared in Amazonas and in fact all of Brazil. Soon after, Manaus introduced a range of NPI's. There have been valid criticisms concerning how well these NPIs were enforced, their late implementation, and the levels of compliance; some sectors of society generally associated with the far-right, deliberately flouted the most basic rulings. In addition, those sectors most severely suffering from inherent structural inequalities had also showed a lower adherence to lockdowns initially, as many lacked financial security to survive for over a week without income. Yet quarantine was generally favoured in these sectors, and with increasing financial and social aid, adherence rose. Generally, in Manaus, the NPIs were implemented often with the strong support of the Mayor, who was often undermined by the Brazilian President Bolsarano. By the beginning of April, health systems were reaching dangerously close to their threshold of collapse. Nevertheless, by mid-May the hospitals were back on their feet, and the epidemic was declining rapidly (Figure 2 ), although only after many lives were lost. Similar NPI's were implemented in nearly all other Brazilian states, roughly synchronously to combat the newly emerging countrywide epidemic, although they have been subject to criticism for poor organization, compliance, and disregard. Nonetheless, these results strongly suggest that the implementation of NPIs was sufficiently effective to provide ""herd-protection"", despite the notable political and infrastructural challenges faced by the residence of Manaus.Our work highlights the difficulties policy makers face when attempting to predict herd immunity, as well as the need for developing and using complementary mechanistic epidemiological modelling tools and datasets.We fit a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered type model with a flexible time-varying transmission rateto the reported Severe Acute respiratory syndrome (SARI) mortality data 1 :where the compartments S, E, I, and R denote the conventional susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals, respectively. The variable N is the total population size of the city or state, H denotes the hospitalized cases (or severe cases), and D denotes the total of SARI-deaths. Parametersdenote the transmission rate, the infectiousness emergence rate, the infectiousness disappearance rate, and the removal rate (due to death or recovery) of hospitalized cases, respectively. Parameters ߠ and ߨ denote the ratio of hospitalized cases out of all infected cases and the proportion of deaths out of hospitalized cases, respectively. Thus, the overall case fatality rate (or infection fatality rate) equals Here, ߬ denotes the overdispersion, and accounts for the measurement noise due to surveillance and heterogeneity among individuals.The parameter values of ߪ , ߛ , ߢ are taken as 365/2, 365/3.5, and 365/12 per year, respectively. Thus the mean latent period and mean infectious period (the reciprocals of ߪ and ߛ )) are 2 and 3.5 days, respectively. The generation time GI, the sum of mean latent period and mean infectious period 5 , equals 5.5 days, which is in line with three key studies which provided estimated GI 6, 10 . From the SARI data we noticed a delay between the first symptom onset and the death at 14 days, which justifies the choice of 12 days (the reciprocal of ߢ ) from loss of infectiousness to death. Namely the onset of infectiousness is 2 days ahead of first symptom onset.Although we do not explicitly model age-class structure here, the model nevertheless has direct relevance for two reasons:1) The important Science paper of Earn et al 8 was designed especially to show that the changes in R 0 (t) have much more impact on the epidemic trajectory than age-structure and should be the first consideration, while the effects of age-structure are in comparison far smaller.2) Manaus can be qualitatively approximated as a two age-class system. Some 20% of the population are older than 45 years of age and contributes significantly to COVID-19 related deaths, while the remaining 80% of the population are under 45 years of age and have such low IFR that they barely contribute to the deaths. (In fact <7% of total COVID-19 deaths.) Yet the infection dynamics is far more homogeneous. (Buss et al. suppose all age classes have the same uniform prevalence.) It can be shown that the homogeneous system found from averaging two age classes (themselves homogenous in transmission) can explain the epidemic dynamics of the two age-class system (as shown in eg., Magpantay et al. 2019 9 ).We used the Euler-multinomial simulation approach to simulate our model with a time-step size 1 day. We use the popular iterated filtering method (note that at least 25 applications use this method, see a list at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_filtering) to fit our model to the observed data and yield the maximum likelihood estimates of unknown parameters, including values of nodes in ߚ ሺ ‫ݐ‬ ሻ and ߨ while holding ߠ =0.1. Namely, we assume 10% of cases are hospitalized (or severe cases), as widely reported. Namely in this work, we only fit death data rather than case data. The fitting is insensitive to the choice of ߠ , but sensitive to the product of ߨ and of ߠ , which is equivalent to the infection fatality rate (IFR). We assume uniform prior for all parameters. We hypothesized that the infection fatality rate (IFR) lay in the interval (0.006, 0.01), and fit the daily SARI mortality data with a flexible transmission rate. The method finds the best fitting parameters including IFR.For each dataset we plotted For Amazonas and Manaus, we also arrived at estimates for the initial reproductive number in the first phase of the epidemic, using standard techniques 7 . This is shown in Figure S3 which is based on the COVID-19 mortality data from Amazonas government health department reports (Boletim Diario de casos COVID-19 no Amazonas. http://www.fvs.am.gov.br/publicacoes) 12 .Ethical approval and consent to participate are not applicable.Not applicable.All data used are publicly available.DH was supported by an Alibaba (China) Co.

This contagious disease emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and hastily spread, first all over the China and then overseas causing a universal epidemic [6] . This respiratory malady that can be deadly in patients weakened by age or another chronic disease such as Diabetes, Cancer, or arterial hypertension, breadth via adjoining with infected human. The disease also transmitted by asymptomatic patients, which makes the control of the disease a difficult task for health care staff [31] . Symptoms of the COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough, pain, stuffy and runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhoea. Pneumonia is the most common complication of COVID-19 [36] . There is no vaccine avowed by the World Health Organization to prevent coronavirus infections. On the other hand, the fight is focused on the barrier measures decreed by the WHO (regular washing hand with soap or an alcohol-based solution, respect for distance, cover the mouth with the bend of the elbow, or a disposable tissue, during a cough or a sneeze, wearing a mask in public places, ...) [35] . For those presenting the symptoms, the treatment although there was no consensus from the start among the virologists, is based on hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin [5] .The first case of COVID-19 swelled in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Feb 26. It was a 61-year-old individual presenting the symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, after returning from the Italian city of Turin. The disease quickly spread in the country due to the failure to take the alert level seriously by the country's high authorities. Indeed, Brazil is one of the last countries to have set up barrier measures, which has favoured the expansion of the virus in the various cities of the country, thus leading to an upsurge in the number of deaths. The total number of confirmed cases has increased exponentially: from 1 case as of February 26, it quickly reached 28,320 confirmed cases on April 15, 2020, with nearly 1,736 deaths [30] . From the date of its origin, this virus continuously grows in the population and infected more than 17,476,105 with 676,759 deaths and 10,939,473 recoveries on July 31 all over the world. In this concern, United States which is the unduly infected nation by this epidemic with 4,634,985 cases, 155,285 deaths and 2,284,965 recoveries on July 31. Brazil and India are also present in this series where the COVID-19 confirmed cases are increasing sharply day by day. In Brazil, there are 2,613,789 confirmed cases with 91,377 deaths and 1,824,095 recoveries. Hundreds of articles have been come from researchers to record the effects of coronavirus via mathematical modelling [10, 15, 16, 19, 23, 24] . Non-integer order Calculus has a very long history which is more then 300 years old and current day thousands of real world problems are being solved by the application of non-integer order calculus. Atangana et al. [1] have given some analysis on the connections between non-integer order Calculus and fractal Calculus. Some credible analysis related to the consequence, importance of the Bode diagram in calculus including integer and non-integer case by using Caputo-Fabrizio derivative are given in [2] . To elevate the stability and accuracy of numerical techniques, a new method to discretize (fractional sense) an integral or differential equation is evaluated in [3] . A concern related to hilfer non-integer neutral stochastic systems is analysed in [7] . A study on the coronavirus model by a effective fractional computational method is established in [9] . Some analysis related to existence of unique solution for non-classical non-linear hybrid impulsive system are estimated in [11] . In [12] , the authors organised a study on Hilfer noninteger order difference operator. Some more results on existence of hilfer non-integer order neutral equations are given in [14] . In [17] , authors solved a malaria model via CF and ABC derivatives. Kumar et al. [18] solved a time-delay coronavirus non-integer order model in Caputo sense. A model of COVID-19 is also proposed in [21] by the help of mittagleffler kernel. Some existence results for non-classical differential equations are given in [22] . Some other results on existence of solutions for fractional Atangana-Baleanu type differential equations are established in [28] and a study on new technique of non-integer order derivative of AB type is given in [29] . Some important results on non-classical neutral differential systems are stated in [32] . A study related to solutions to non-integer order neutral delay equations is established in [33] . Mathematicians have proposed so many different kind of non-integer order derivatives like Atangana-Baleanu in Caputo sense, Caputo, Caputo and Fabrizio etc. which are the very common derivatives in the view of the implementation in real world problems. In our study, we are exemplifying the dynamics of a coronavirus non-linear model by the application of a recent non-classical derivative named generalized Caputo fractional derivatives, which nature is similar to Caputo type derivative [25] . To find the solution of the given system, we are applying the modified version of the P-C algorithm. The major difference of the P-C algorithms in the Caputo and recent Caputo derivative is the uses of a non-uniform grid in the modified version. The newly generalized fractional Caputo integral operator is mainly supported by the two parameters α and ρ, which gives a considerable equipment to control and do mathematical modelling in fractional order sense.

In these predictions, we used different sets of the parameter values which make this study more credible. The article is distributed as follows. In Section 2, we given some necessary definitions related to generalisation of Caputo derivative. We described the given non-linear SEIR model in ODE and fractional sense in Section 3. We derived some theorems for supporting the existence and uniqueness solution of the model in Section 4. We also derived the solution of the given non-linear model via modified P-C method with stability analysis in Section 5. The all graphical results for the peak predictions of COVID-19 are exemplified in Section 6. A conclusion gives the mark to the paper.Definition 1. [26] The description of the Caputo definition of fractional derivative of Ω ∈ C k −1 is given asDefinition 2. [13] The generalized Riemann-type derivative of non-integer order, R D α,ρ a + , of order α > 0 is defined as:where ρ > 0, a ≥ 0, and n − 1 < α ≤ n. Definition 3. [13] The description of generalized Caputo-type derivative of non-integer order, C D α,ρ a + , of order α > 0 is given by:where ρ > 0, a ≥ 0, and i = α .The recent generalization of Caputo-type derivative of non-integer order, D α,ρ a + , of order α > 0 is defined as:where ρ > 0, a ≥ 0, and n − 1 < α ≤ n. Lemma 1. [20] If 0 < κ < 1 and β is an integer (non-negative), then there exists the positive constants C κ,1 and C κ,2 only dependent on κ, s.tThere are lots of non-linear mathematical models have been developed to study the COVID-19 disease in all over the world. In this series, to study the COVID-19 epidemic peaks in Brazil, we express the model proposed by Kuniya et.al in [19] . The author formulated and defined the given non-linear model in the classical derivative sense as follows:where S(ζ), E(ζ), I(ζ) and R(ζ) indicate the susceptible, exposed, infective, and removed classes of population at time ζ, respectively. β, 1/ and φ define the infection rate, the incubation period, and the removal rate, respectively. We set S + E + I + R to be 1 and let one infective human is recognised at time ζ = 0 among the total population of Brazildefines the number of infective persons which are recognised at time ζ. Thus, I(0) = 1 p × 2.10 × 10 8 and we assume that at ζ = 0, E(0) = R(0) = 0, and hence,We fixed the range of p from 0.01 to 0.1. The expected value of secondary cases organised by one infective person (known as the basic reproduction number R 0 ) is formulated as the largest eigenvalue of the next generation matrix F V −1 [34] , whereThus, we evoluteNow to analyse the outcomes of the projected system (5) in the sense of fractional derivatives, here we are using a newly proposed fractional derivative called new generalised Caputo type fractional derivative (4) . In this regard, system (5) can be organised in the new generalised Caputo fractional derivatives sense as follows:where C D γ,ρ ζ denotes the new generalised Caputo fractional derivative operator. For comfort, the compact form of the above system of equations can be expressed as the given initial value problem (IVP)The initial conditions are taken asNow here we do the analysis of existence of unique solution for the given non-linear COVID-19 model in terms of theorems. We show the analysis only for S(ζ) class and for other equations of the model, analysis will be similar. Now consider the first equation of the model in the following compact formand the corresponding Volterra integral equationTheorem 1. [8, 13] Then, a function S ∈ C[0, T ] is exist that solves the IVP (9a) and (9b).Lemma 3. [8, 13] By the assumption of the statement of Theorem 1, the function S ∈ C[0, T ] is a solution of the IVP (9a) and (9b) iff, it is a solution of the non-linear Volterra integral equation (10) .Theorem 2. [8, 13] (Uniqueness). Consider S(0) ∈ R, K > 0 and T * > 0. Also, let 0 < γ ≤ 1 and m = γ . For the set G as in Theorem 1 and let G 1 : G → R be continuous and agree a Lipschitz condition with respect to the second variable, i.e.for some constant V > 0 independent of ζ, S 1 , and S 2 . Then, a unique solution S ∈ C[0, T ] exists for the IVP (9a) and (9b).Now we derive the solution of the given SEIR model in the framework of modified version of the P-C method for the IVP (9a) and (9b) by following the procedure as given in [25] with some necessary changes. After that we will discuss the stability of the given method. To fulfil this requirement, we start from the above mentioned Volterra integral equation (10), which providesNow we assume that a unique solution of the given problem exists for the functionwhere h = T ρ N . Now, we are trying to analyse the approximations S k , k = 0, 1, ..., N, to solve numerically the given IVP. The basic step, supposing that we have already estimated the approximations S j ≈ S(ζ j )(j = 1, 2, ..., k), is that we want to estimate the approximation S k+1 ≈ S(ζ k+1 ) by means of the integral equationdoing the substitution z = ξ ρ , we getThat isNow, to evaluate the integrals seen in the right-hand side of Eq. (16), if we use the trapezoidal quadrature rule with respect to the weight function (ζ ρ k+1 − z) γ−1 then shifting the function G 1 (z 1/ρ , S(z 1/ρ )) by its piecewise linear interpolant with nodes chosen at the ζ ρ j (j = 0, 1, ..., k + 1), then we getThus, putting the above approximations into Eq. (16), we established the corrector formula for S(ζ k+1 ), k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1,whereThe final attempt of our method is to change the quantity S(ζ k+1 ) appeared on the right hand side of the formula (18) with the predictor value S P (ζ k+1 ) that can be calculated by using the one-step Adams-Bashforth technique to the integral equation (15) . In this case, by changing the mapping G 1 (z 1/ρ , S(z 1/ρ )) by the quantity G 1 (ζ j , S(ζ j )) at each integral in Eq. (16), we getTherefore, our P-C scheme, for finding the approximation S k+1 ≈ S(ζ k+1 ), is totally evaluated by the formulawhere S j ≈ S(ζ j ), j = 0, 1, ..., k, and the predicted value S P k+1 ≈ S P (ζ k+1 ) can be evaluated as given in Eq. (20) with the weights a j,k+1 being calculated according to (19) . So by the above manner, we can derive the approximation formulae for the whole system (7) . So, the approximation solution formulae for the given SEIR COVID-19 system (8) can be established as:whereLet the Lipschitz condition satisfied by G 1 (ζ, S) in (9a) and S j (j = 1, ..., k +1) are the solutions of given Predictor-Corrector algorithm (22) and (23) . Then, the given fractional numerical scheme (22) and (23) is conditionally stable.Proof. LetS 0 ,S j (j = 0, ..., k + 1) andS P k+1 (k = 0, ..., N − 1) be perturbations of S 0 , S j and S P k+1 , respectively. Then, the following perturbation equations are established by using Eqs. (22) and (23)Using the Lipschitz condition, we obtainwherewhere γ 0 = max{ζ 0 + ρ −γ h γ m 1 a k+1,k+1 Γ(γ + 2) η 0 }. C γ,2 is a positive constant only depends on γ (Lemma 1) and h is supposed to be small enough. Applying Lemma 2 concludes |S k+1 | ≤ Cγ 0 . which ends the proof.To establish graphical simulations, we use parameter values cited from a real data, summarized in Table 2 . We also use the following initial conditions S(0) = 1− 1 p × 2.10 × 10 8 , I(0) = 1 p × 2.10 × 10 8 , E(0) = 0, and R(0) = 0. These parameter values were estimated using COVID-19 real data in Brazil, between 25 February (ζ = 0) to 30 March 2020. For the model (5), the basic reproductive number is given bywhere the identification rate p ranges from 0.01 to 0.1. We estimated basic reproduction number R 0 for different values of infection rate β and removal rate φ given as follows: where the identification rate p ranges from 0.01 to 0.1. We denote the coronavirus epidemic peak ζ * for the exposed and infected individuals attains its maximum in 1 year. We first set p = 0.1. In this case, we obtained the following figures ( Figure 2 that the estimated epidemic peaks for exposed and infected individuals are ζ * = 145 near about γ = 1. That is, starting from 25 February (ζ = 0), the estimated epidemic peaks are 19 July (ζ = 145). We can also observe that in Figure 2 if we shifted to γ = 0.95, the peak shifted to t ≈ 162 (5 August). We observe from Figure 3 that the estimated epidemic peaks are ζ * = 145 for both exposed and infective individuals near about γ = 1. That is, starting from 25 February (ζ = 0), the estimated coronavirus peak is 19 July (ζ = 145). We can also observe that in Figure 3 if we shifted to γ = 0.95, the peak shifted to ζ ≈ 152 (26 July) and ζ ≈ 160 (3 August) respectively. From Figure 4 , the estimated coronavirus peak is ζ * = 152 for exposed and ζ * = 162 for infected near about γ = 1, respectively. That is, starting from 25 February (ζ = 0), the estimated epidemic peak are 26 July (ζ = 152) and 5 August (ζ = 162), respectively. When we shifted to γ = 0.95, the peak shifted to ζ ≈ 165 (8 August) and ζ ≈ 172 (15 August), respectively. Table 2 ), R 0 = 3.14.We next set p = 0.01. In this case, we obtain the following figures ( Figure 5-Figure 7 Figure 5 that the estimated epidemic peaks for exposed and infected individuals are ζ * = 130 (4 July) and ζ * = 132 (6 July) respectively near about γ = 1. We can also observe that in Figure 5 if we shifted to γ = 0.95, the peak shifted to ζ ≈ 138 (12 July) and ζ ≈ 145 (19 July). We observe from Figure 6 that the estimated epidemic peaks are ζ * = 122 (26 June) for exposed and ζ * = 125 (29 June) near about γ = 1. We also observe that in Figure 6 if we shifted to γ = 0.95, the peak shifted to ζ ≈ 130 and ζ ≈ 135. From Figure 7 , the estimated epidemic peaks are ζ * = 132 for exposed and ζ * = 140 for infected near about γ = 1 respectively. That is, starting from 25 February (ζ = 0), the estimated COVID-19 peak are 6 July (ζ = 132) and 14 July (ζ = 140,) respectively. When we sifted to γ = 0.95, the peak shifted to ζ ≈ 142 (16 July) and ζ ≈ 150 (24 July), respectively. Table 2 ), R 0 = 3.14.After the successful study of epidemic peaks, here we do some graphical simulations of the nature of the given classes respect to each other. In Figure 8 , we show the nature of susceptible, infected and removed classes versus exposed individuals for β = 0.5869, φ = 0.2004 and p = 0.1 at different fractional order γ. In Figure 9 , we show the nature of susceptible, infected and removed classes versus exposed individuals for β = 0.6043, φ = 0.2004 and p = 0.1 at different fractional order γ. In Figure 10 , we show the nature of susceptible, infected and removed classes versus exposed individuals for β = 0.4869, φ = 0.1552 and p = 0.1 at different fractional order γ. Table 2 ). Table 2 ). Table 2 ).Similarly, we do the graphical simulations of the nature of the given classes respect to each other for p = 0.01. In Figure 11 , we show the nature of susceptible, infected and removed classes versus exposed individuals for β = 0.5869, φ = 0.2004 and p = 0.01 at different fractional order γ. In Figure 12 , we show the nature of susceptible, infected and removed classes versus exposed individuals for β = 0.6043, φ = 0.2004 and p = 0.01 at different fractional order γ. In Figure 13 , we show the nature of susceptible, infected and removed classes versus exposed individuals for β = 0.4869, φ = 0.1552 and p = 0.01 at different fractional order γ. Table 2 ). Table 2 ). Table 2 ).From the all above simulations, we can say that there are so much uncertainties of epidemic peaks for the given real data range. Given new generalised Caputo derivative works well to study these different natures. All simulations are done by the use of Mathematica software. Also, we have fixed the parameter ρ equal to 1.2 for all simulations, which can make more varieties in the simulations for different numerical values. The calculative value of the basic reproduction number R 0 in our study is different for specific data. In Table 2 , we gave some estimated values of basic reproductive number but for graphical simulations we studied only three sets of values for R 0 = 2.93, 3.02 and 3.14. In this study, the estimated values of the basic reproduction number R 0 are not so different from some estimations given in [4] .In this paper, by using a compartmental mathematical non-linear model to the reported cases of Coronavirus in Brazil from 25 February to 30 March, we have evaluated that the basic reproduction number R 0 has so many possible values for the specific range of infection rate and removal rate when identification rate assumed between 0.01 to 0.1. Of course, such type of long range peak prognostication would ally the necessary suspicion due to the event of some large transformations in the social and natural conditions. We have observed that the basic reproductive number R 0 (essential epidemic size) would not be dominance by the identification rate p in a parameter range 0.01 − 0.1. After giving the theory of necessary definitions and the description of the non-linear model, the proposed time-fractional non-linear model is studied by the applications of modified version of Corrector-Predictor algorithm in the sense of recent generalised version of Caputo non-integer derivative. The given method stability is also concerned by the application of some specific well known lemmas. The framework of existence of unique solution is also given. Our results are rich for making a full idea of epidemic peaks of coronavirus cases in Brazil. All necessary calculations for plots of the data are given to specify the nature of the given solutions at various fractional order values. We concluded that there are a lot of uncertainties in the given peaks for the mentioned data range. The given method is strong and highly reliable in finding the solution to non-integer order models of physical, biological, and medical point of view. The given numerical approach exemplifies the uses of the given scheme and considered non-integer order operator while analysing real world problems.This work does not have any conflicts of interest.All authors equally contributed to this work.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-04,02
3138c6062f9be70465da6a4806f6b2398fe5742a,Discontinuation of isolation for persons with COVID-19: Is 10 days really safe?,"In June 2020, the Center for Diseases Control (CDC) updated the information about the time of isolation for COVID-19 patients that would prevent transmission to a susceptible individual. For exposed persons with no SARS-COV-2 confirmation, 10 days quarantine would be sufficient to reduce the transmission risk to 1% [1] . For confirmed mild and moderate COVID-19, the isolation can be also discontinued after 10 days after symptoms onset considering resolution of fever for at least 24 hours. This period however, would be extended in case of severe COVID-19, in patients presenting immunological conditions or in case the patient still reports symptoms [1] .Criteria for discharge patients without a negative RT-PCR involve risks but some issues were taken into consideration for the new resolution; in particular, the amount of accessible laboratory supplies for molecular SARS-COV-2 tests as well trained and available lab technicians in some areas. Such demand makes the initial recommendation of two negative RT-PCR tests for discharging nearly impossible to be done, especially in regions with high number of cases.The primary recommendation of 14 days isolation for COVID-19 was based on initial description that patients with moderate/severe disease could remain RT-PCR positive until day 12-14 [2, 3] . More recent studies revealed that positivity at upper and lower respiratory tract can last longer than 14 days with highest peak at day 3-5 of illness, with consistent decline over time [4, 5] . However, despite viral RNA detection by RT-PCR no replicationcompetent virus (RCV) has been recovered from samples collected after 8 [6] or 9 days of the onset [5, 7] .Given the isolation interruption at the 10 th day after the illness onset is becoming widely adopted and the presence of viable particles at this time was little evaluated so far, we explored the presence of replicating-competent viruses (RCV) in RT-PCR positive nasopharyngeal (NP) samples from patients with mild COVID-19 at day 10 th of the illness onset. We also analyzed the relationship of the viral load in the NP samples with the presence/absence of viable particles in cell culture.This study was part of an umbrella project developed in Araraquara, a medium size city from São Paulo State (Brazil) that broadly evaluated the household transmission of SARS-COV-2. For further estimates, we considered gene S since it is the specific for SARS-COV-2.Twenty-three of the 53 recruited patients were female (43%) and the median age was 39 years (range 17-60). Forty from the 53 patients were SARS-COV-2 positive at D10 (79%)with the median C T in S gene of 25.7 (range 12-32). From these, 29 had sufficient wellpreserved material and were submitted to viral isolation in Vero cell culture.After two cell-passages, eight samples presented cytophatic effect and positive RT-PCR in Vero cells and 21 did not. However, only seven (24%) filled the criteria CPE plus lower Ct than the original sample in the second passage. Three of the 8 patients with visible CPE at D10 had NP sample also collected at D13, and the material was submitted to virus isolation.However, no RCV was recovered at this time (Table 1) .Regarding the symptoms, three of the seven patients with confirmed RCV presented some symptom at the D10, though all of them reported that the symptoms were milder than those experienced during the acute phase (i.e. headache, loss of smell and tiredness -data not shown). It is noted that two patients with viable particles reported no symptoms at all at D10 (Table 1) , and two patients did not answer the question.It has to be mentioned that NP sample from one COVID-19 patient presented no increase in viral load at the second passage in cell culture in comparison to the original NP sample (ID #86088), though CPE was observed. It is possible that only a few particles of the original sample were actually replication-competent and therefore, two passages were not sufficient to observe a significant increase in the viral load. Thus, we should be hesitant to state that this particular sample was actually infectious at D10. Limitations of this study include the limited volume of clinical sample that precluded the viral isolation of all positive samples in D10 and the absence of successive clinical samples that would allow us to determine how long the individuals were still infectious.",Brazil,first author,2021-02-01,02
75f6ec79899d63be89b877583ea01a33377ca550,To appear in: Public Health in Practice,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, was initially detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and subsequently spread to Brazil in March 2020. [1] Municipalities in Brazil had to respond to the public health emergency in a context of limited resources and mounting logistical and procurement challenges. In Brazil, the public health system is part of the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) national network, which is provides universal and free health care.[2,3] In Ribeirão Preto (population 704,000), a city in the state of São Paulo, the public health network is made up of 52 health clinics, varying in size and complexity. [4] This network is run by 3100 healthcare workers, who, due to COVID-19, suddenly required a large additional volume of personal protection equipment (PPE), including face masks, to reduce infection risks. [5, 6] Face masks are essential items of PPE and can be classified into the following three main types: (1) N95 masks confer the most protection from viral spread for both the wearer and others, but are also the most expensive; (2) surgical masks confer partial protection for the wearer and others; and (3) cloth masks offer limited protection to the wearer, primarily protecting others from viral spread, but are much more affordable. [7] A serious municipal budgetary crisis and worldwide shortages of PPE compounded the difficulties facing health authorities in Ribeirão Preto.[8, 9] In response, nurses linked to the health secretariat of Ribeirão Preto organised a network of volunteers and mask-making production commenced in April 2020. Government guidelines were followed for the recommended materials and designs for making face masks. [10, 11] Two initiatives were launched: the first, producing single-use masks for healthcare workers to act as an emergency substitute for surgical masks; and the second, creating reusable community/cloth masks for distribution to SUS users. [12, 13] This study documents the response in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, to the lack of PPE during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic; these results are in the context of a developing country, where affordability and functionality play an important role. Independent test results are presented on samples of the masks produced, estimating their filtration efficiency and breathability (pressure drop).In the public health system of Ribeirão Preto, the normal demand (i.e. burn rate) for surgical masks was approximately 300 units/month prior to the pandemic. After the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020, this rose to 3000 units/month. The municipal stocks of surgical face masks, which were scheduled to last for 6 months, unexpectedly ran out within a few days.Previous studies have shown that health-related public procurement in Brazil is notoriously slow, limiting rapid government responses to pandemic-induced PPE shortages. [14] In this context, and given the scarcity of N95 or surgical masks, a group of volunteers produced masks for use in the municipal public health system.The organisers used social networks and work channels to recruit 50 volunteers and used workspace available at the, then-idle, industrial sewing facilities at the Servico Nacional de Aprendizagem Comercial (SENAC), a national vocational school with units in RibeirãoPreto. [15] Masks were sewn in a controlled environment, following protocols for workplace sanitising and personal hygiene. Work was carried out 5 days a week, in two shifts, following official guidelines. [10, 11, 16] Complementing reference standards, volunteers received constant guidance from infection control professionals on workplace safety and on the design of surgical masks. The materials used to create the masks for healthcare workers were (see figure 1 ):• Inner and outer layer: TNT (tecido-não-tecido / non-woven fabric, spunbond) 100% polypropylene, 40 g/sqm.• Middle layer: TNT SMS (tecido-não-tecido spunbond / non-woven fabric -meltblownspunbond) 100% propylene, 50 g/sqm.• Coated aluminium wire (for the nasal clip).• Standard sewing material (thread and industrial machines borrowed by SENAC).The inner and outer layers of TNT 40 were cut to 34 x 21 cm and the SMS middle-layer filter was 21 x 17 cm. In making the mask body, TNT 40 was folded in half in its largest dimension and the SMS filter was placed between the two layers of the folded TNT. A seam to join the three layers was made in an overlock machine at the top of the mask. The coated aluminium wire was embedded in a fold of about 1cm at the top, which was subsequently sewn on a straight machine. Three pleats were made, from top to bottom, so that the height of the mask was between 8 and 9 cm. Two side seams were made to maintain the pleats. Then, an 80 cm strip of TNT 40 g was sewn on each side (for upper and lower lashing). The mask had three layers in total.The three-month project helped supply the PPE requirements of the city's public health units and some other public institutions, such as nursing homes, blood banks, public hospitals, the local police force and the Mobile Emergency Care Support team (SAMU) ambulances. While the specific roles of mask performance and usage frequency factors in reducing COVID-19 community transmission are still being actively researched, mask usage is now widely recommended [17] . This initiative helped to safeguard local healthcare workers until accelerated public procurement and the improvement of market conditions allowed stocks of conventional PPEs to be replenished. In total, 58,551 face masks for healthcare workers were produced.The majority of users of the public health system in Brazil are economically or socially vulnerable. [18] While substantial labour reallocation from garment industries to mask-making business occurred in 2020, many users of SUS are still struggling to afford general-use face masks. [19] In April 2020, the city of Ribeirão Preto made the use of face masks compulsory in public spaces, which prompted demand for low-cost and reusable face mask options. [20] In response to this situation, a second project was launched, named Máscaras do Bem for Ribeirão Preto -Comunidade, focusing on the production of community masks for lowincome and/or vulnerable users of SUS.In order to identify volunteers and raise funds for the purchase of materials, groups were set up on Facebook and Whatsapp. Approximately 170 individuals responded to the volunteer requests, some helping in mask-making activities, others split among support roles, such as transportation logistics, fundraising, donors and process administration. While traditionally nurse-led initiatives primarily involve females, this volunteer group included 21 men who collaborated in the construction of moulds, the cutting and distribution of masks, and other tasks.Masks were distributed, at no-cost, by health service managers. Beneficiaries were patients, family members and caregivers. Similar to the initiative for healthcare worker mask production, the community masks were also based on recommended designs and materials. [10, 11] The community face masks had two layers and the materials used were (see figure 1 ):• Outer layer: 100% cotton tricoline 100g/sqm.• Inner layer: TNT (tecido-não-tecido / non-woven fabric, spunbond) 100% propylene, 80g /sqm. Unlike the masks for healthcare workers, the delivery of community masks to the population posed challenges. For optimal impact, the reusable masks needed to quickly reach families and people with the greatest social vulnerability. This problem was, once again, tackled through social media, by the establishment of a support network. The volunteer group facilitated both upstream (bringing materials to seamstresses) and downstream (taking masks to beneficiaries by car, bicycle or interpersonal channels). In April 2020, the group produced 9906 masks, in May 9616 and in June a further 948 masks were produced. In total 20,524 reusable community masks were produced, all of which were distributed to those in need. The initiative ended in June 2020, with production results far exceeding initial goals.other Brazilian cities, such as Araçatuba, Porto Feliz, Curitiba, Xaxim and Colina. [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] While all initiatives were based on designs and materials recommended by authorities, a common feature among the initiatives is the absence of independent testing. Few centres with testing capabilities are available to the public in Brazil, with the exception of the Respire! consortia at the University of São Paulo. [26] Given the large uptake of mask production (of similar design) within Brazil, mask performance data are essential. In this study, independent performance data, according to parameters accepted in the literature, for the healthcare and community masks are presented. Masks were tested for FE with particles of 0.3μm, which is the standard used by NIOSH tests and is considered the particle size that is most likely to pass through filter materials. [30, 31] Smaller and larger particles get trapped more easily because of dominating diffusion and impaction. [32] Particles larger than 1.0µm tend to be affected significantly by gravity, while particles under 0.1µm are most affected by Brownian motion, which causes adherence of small air particles to the fibres in the filter material. [33] Results J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Test results indicated that masks produced for healthcare workers, labelled Surgical Mask (BR) in Figure 2 , had filtration efficiencies ranging from 40% to 60%. This was lower than industry-produced ASTM-certified masks which were used as comparators. ASTM level 2 masks had filtration performances close to 90% (Fig 2, label Lab Surgical Mask). Pressure drop readings also indicated superior breathability performance for the ASTM comparator.FE results for the community masks from Ribeirão Preto were around 10%, which is equivalent to the comparator (Lydia May cloth mask, Figure 2 ). This is expected, since Lydia May masks are made very similarly, having one layer of cotton and the second layer of non-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f woven shopping bag material (e.g. TNT). Previous studies indicate that even low FEperforming masks can be useful for infection control, especially when coupled with handwashing and social distancing. [34] The second measurement made was pressure drop, which measures breathability. Higher pressure drop values indicate more resistance to airflow and increased difficulty breathing.[35] Pressure drop results indicate that the community masks had the best breathability performance, which could translate into more regular usage. This study describes a community response to produce face masks for healthcare workers and the community during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Amid a context of market scarcity for industry-made equivalents, volunteer-led efforts, organised by local nurses, produced significant numbers of face masks to compensate for the lack of conventional PPE supplies. Rapid organisational results were achieved through the establishment of social network groups and through the mobilisation of assets, such as production sites, machinery, and specialised labour, which and who were rendered idle due to pandemic-related restrictions on vocational schools and stores. In total, 79,021 masks were produced based on official standards. N95 masks and high-quality surgical masks are undisputedly the best face masks for health care settings. However, when such masks are not available, masks with observed FE ranging from 40-60% at 0.3µm and better at larger particle sizes can provide a degree of protection, especially in settings where healthcare workers are not involved in aerosolgenerating procedures.Test results show that the masks produced for healthcare workers had performances inferior to the industry standards, but in an acceptable range for FE and pressure drop with selected comparators. Results were broadly in line with what was expected, given test parameters and materials available. Breathability results suggest a slightly better performance for community masks, indicating a level of comfort in their use. The results from this study will be useful for ongoing efforts to improve community-based responses to future health emergencies, as well as for the further development of official guidelines on artisanal PPE production.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-08,02
adaaf7dfe5cc99da423622b4de8b9b5cdbc32467,"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on air pollution in Lima metropolitan area, Peru in South America","The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection generated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease manifests clinically as a severe acute respiratory syndrome with symptoms of fever, dry cough, dyspnea, respiratory disorders and pneumonia that can lead to progressive respiratory failure and death (Gorbalenya et al. 2020; WHO 2005; Zhou et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020) . Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in Wuhan (China) on January 20, 2020 (Kucharski et al. 2020) . However, global mobilization of infected people in advance of the implementation of control measures (Jenson 2020; Kenyon 2020) resulted in numerous epidemic chains that produced new outbreaks in different nations. SARS-CoV-2 has inevitably spread throughout South America (WHO 2020). The first confirmed case in Latin America occurred in Brazil on February 26, 2020 (WHO 2020 . In the following days, cases were reported in Mexico (February 28), Ecuador (February 29), Argentina (March 3), Chile (March 3) and Colombia (March 6). The first confirmed case in Peru occurred on March 6, 2020 (MINSA 2020) .Air pollution has decreased in cities around the world because of restrictions (""closures"") imposed to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Coccia 2020; Kucharski et al. 2020; Muhammad et al. 2020; Saadat et al. 2020) . Recently, researchers have reported that partial or complete lockdowns implemented in response to the pandemic have caused decreases in air pollutant concentrations in different cities and megacities in China (Bao and Zhang 2020; He et al. 2020 ; Wang and Su 2020; Xu et al. 2020a, b) , India (Mahato et al. 2020; Sharma et al. 2020) , Malaysia (Abdullah et al. 2020) , Brazil (Dantas et al. 2020; Nakada and Urban 2020) , Australia (Sánchez-García and Leon 2020), Canada (CBC 2020), Italy (Collivignarelli et al. 2020) , Spain (Tobías et al. 2020 ) and the United States (CNBC 2020). In several cities in China, measures to suppress the spread of COVID-19 have led to a remarkable improvement in air quality. (He et al. 2020) reported that the PM 2.5 (particulate material smaller than 2.5 μm) concentration decreased by 25% from that over the same period in 2019 and that this pollution reduction is beneficial to public health in the short term as long as the measures implemented by COVID-19 are maintained. Within a few days of forced restrictions, reduced pollution levels were observed in cities across India (Mahato et al. 2020) . Also, reductions were observed on the order of 60% and 40% in the PM 10 (particulate material with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 μm), e.g. Sale, Morocco (Otmani et al. 2020) , New Delhi, India (Mahato et al. 2020) , Milan, Italy (Collivignarelli et al. 2020) , and PM 2.5 levels, e.g. Milan, Italy (Collivignarelli et al. 2020) , Zaragoza, Spain, Shanghai, China, New York, USA, Rome, Italy, Los Angeles, USA (Chauhan and Singh 2020). On the order reducctions of 53% and 30% for NO 2 levels were observed, e.g. Milan, Italy (Collivignarelli et al. 2020) , Sao Paulo, Brazil (Nakada and Urban 2020)) and CO levels, e.g. Milan, Italy (Collivignarelli et al. 2020) , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Dantas et al. 2020) , New Delhi, India (Mahato et al. 2020) . The results of another study in India showed that reduced PM 2.5 levels resulting from lockdown measures have counteracted increased pollutant concentrations from unfavorable weather conditions (Sharma et al. 2020) . In Malaysian cities, reductions of between 30 and 60% in PM 2.5 have been observed (Abdullah et al. 2020) . In Sao Paulo, Brazil, drastic reductions in the concentrations of NO (nitrogen monoxide, up to 77%), NO 2 (up to 54%) and CO (up to 65%) have been observed in urban areas during partial lockdowns compared to the five-year monthly means (Nakada and Urban 2020) . Also, in other studies, spaceborne NO 2 column observations from two high-resolution instruments (TROPOMI and OMI), reveal unprecedented NO 2 decreases over China, South Korea, western Europe, the United States (Bauwens et al. 2020) and Spain (Petetin et al. 2020 ) as a result of public health measures enforced to contain the coronavirus disease outbreak . These decreases observed have mainly resulted from reductions in urban road transport in many regions, with additional contributions from decreased industrial and commercial activity.The highest infection rates have been reported in areas of high population density (Chauhan and Singh 2020) . Over 30% of the population of Peru is concentrated in the Lima metropolitan area (LMA) (INEI 2020). The government of Peru implemented a complete national lockdown that drastically reduced anthropogenic activities (ED 2020). In this study, the impact of the sanitary measures implemented in the LMA to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 on the air quality are quantified by comparing the concentrations of particles (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) and NO 2 during pre-lockdown period (February 1 and March 15 of 2020), historical period (March 16 to April 30 2017-2019) and lockdown period (March 16 to April 30, 2020) . The results of this study can provide indicators of compliance with measures against COVID-19 and are therefore useful for both air pollution and public health regulatory agencies.The LMA is made up of the provinces of Lima (capital of the Republic of Peru) and Callao ( Fig. 1) , forming an extensive and populous urban area; it is one of the five megacities of South America, with a population of approximately 10 million inhabitants (population density of 3278.9 inhabitants/ km 2 for Lima and 6815.8 inhabitants/km 2 for Callao). It is located in the central and western zone of the South American continent (longitude 77°W and latitude 12°S) in a large alluvial plain formed by the valleys of the Chillón, Rímac and Lurín rivers (IGN 2014). The LMA climate is subtropical, with a mean annual temperature of 19 °C and a relative humidity of 80% (SENAMHI 2016). The amount of rainfall barely reaches 10 mm per year, but cloudy skies are common throughout the year.For each station, data from February, March and April from 2017 to 2020 were used to calculate the mean levels of each pollutant at different time scales. The period between 1 February 1 and March 15 of 2020 was considered the prelockdown period and that between March 16 and April 30 of 2020 was defined as the lockdown period. Likewise, the mean of the data from March 16 to April 30 in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was used for the historical period. Hourly mean concentrations were used in the analysis. The relative change (%) in the concentrations was assessed by calculating and comparatively analyzing the concentration variations over the pre-lockdown, lockdown and historical periods. Before analysis, the data were validated to rectify duplicate entries and gaps.The LMA has a real-time air quality monitoring network (AQMN) (SENAMHI 2020). The data from the monitoring network are the responsibility of the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología-SENAMHI), an entity attached to the Ministry of the Environment (Ministerio del Ambiente-MINAM). These stations measure atmospheric pollutant concentrations of PM 10 , PM 2.5 NO 2 and O 3 on an hourly basis. PM 10 and PM 2.5 are monitored at five of the six stations in the network under study while ozone and NO2 is only one stations (see Table S1 for more information related to station names, measurement principles and instrumentation in supplementary material). Meteorological variables (that is, the temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction) are also measured. The stations are located in urban environments that are mainly impacted by emissions from vehicular traffic and residential emissions (Silva et al. 2017 (Silva et al. , 2018 .In addition to the temporal analysis, a spatial distribution analysis of NO 2 levels was performed for in pre-lockdown and lockdown periods using satellite monitoring data. The data are obtained from remote sensing provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (S5p/TROPOMI), developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) (ESA 2018), at a spatial resolution of 0.01° × 0.01° and daily temporal resolution. In both cases, the data were downloaded in NetCDF format and then processed in the software R (Team 2020) and/or Python (Python 2020) . Table S1 of the supplementary materialThe descriptive statistical analysis was performed in MS-Excel (Excel® 2017) and using the open source software programming language R (Team 2020) with the Openair package Ropkins 2012, 2020) . The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a well-known statistical approach for analyzing differences between group means (for air pollutant concentrations and meteorological variables). Different time series during the lockdown and non-lockdown periods were compared using ANOVA to statistically test whether the means were the same across the groups.After the first confirmed COVID-19 case, occurred in Peru on March 6, 2020 (see Fig. 2 ), the government, through the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de la Salud-MINSA), put into operation a National Preparedness and Response Plan for the Risk of Introduction of the Coronavirus to strengthen surveillance, containment and response systems (MINSA 2020). On March 11, a state of health emergency was decreed at the national level (see Fig. 2 ). From March 12 to 15, the number of positive cases in Peru increased to a total of 71 cases and were concentrated in the LMA (MINSA 2020). On March 15, a state of emergency was decreed (ED 2020), making Peru the first country in South America to take strict measures to prevent an increase in positive cases (see Fig. 2 ). These measures included mandatory social isolation (via a national lockdown) and a complete lockdown of the border, starting on March 16. On March 18, a national curfew was enacted to tighten the mandatory social distancing measures because people were not conforming to the lockdown restrictions, and the use of private vehicles was prohibited from March 19. Despite all the sanitary measures implemented, the number of confirmed cases in Peru surpassed 100,000 on May 20 (MINSA 2020).The impact of the measures implemented during the state of emergency was to freeze production activities, as reflected by electricity consumption (COES 2020). Figure 2 shows the mean daily electricity consumption in Peru: the application of isolation and immobilization measures is coincident with a clear decrease of approximately 40% in the energy demand. This decrease in production activity is not counteracted by overconsumption by people forced to stay at home. The decrease in the electricity demand reflects the freezing of production activities and attendant potential sources of air pollutant emissions.By April 30, 2020, that is, six weeks after the declaration of the national state of emergency on March 16, 2020, LMA contamination, in terms of the PM 10 , PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentrations, had decreased (Fig. 3, Table 1 ). Likewise, compared with the historical period (the three previous years), similar behavior was observed. These observed changes are analyzed in the following sections.A 40% decrease in the PM 10 level between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods was observed. A similar trend was observed for the PM 2.5 level, in terms of the magnitude of the relative change. The ANOVA results revealed a statistically significant decrease in the PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations from the pre-lockdown to the lockdown: the p-value was smaller than the significance level of 0.01 at a 99% confidence level. The highest decrease for both PM 10 and PM 2.5 levels was observed at the STA station. The smallest relative changes were observed at the CDM stations, which are located in a commercial area with large malls, small businesses, restaurants, etc. and are therefore highly impacted by emissions from vehicle traffic. Sustained commercial activity produced a smaller decrease in PM concentrations because of the lockdown for the CDM area than other zones. These other zones are mainly residential areas with unpaved streets, for which the reduction in vehicular motion reduced vehicle emissions as well as particle resuspension. Thus, the lockdown produced a decrease in the PM concentration of approximately 50%, which is similar in magnitude to the decrease in the NOx levels. This reduction can be explained in terms of the decrease in vehicular emissions by the lockdown measures, considering that the 2.2 million motor vehicles in the LMA make a total of nine million trips a day.Ozone (O 3 ) is the only pollutant for which an increase in concentration (of 59%) was observed during the lockdown period compared to the non-lockdown period, at the CDM station. This increase was shown to be statistically significant using ANOVA (the p-value was smaller than the significance level of 0.01 at a 99% confidence level). The increase in the O 3 concentration can be explained in terms of the complex chemistry of O 3 formation from mixtures of CDM  28  15  -22 26  15  -53 19  13  -59 -32  -13  -170 -24  -14  -11  SBJ  52  15  --32  14  --24  11  ---54  -23  ---26  -19  --CRB  98  27  --90  22  --50  12  ---49  -55  ---44  -45  --SJL  -31  ---17  ---11  ----64  ----37  --STA  82  -19  -33  -19  -22  -10  --73  --48 --45  --46 -VMT  182 27  21  -129 29  --71  20  ---61  -26  ---34  -31  --AVG  88  24  20  22 62  20  19  53 37  14  10  59 -58  -43  -48 170 -40  -31  -46 11 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx (Finlayson-Pitts and Pitts 2000) . A reduction in NOx concentrations leaves a higher number of OH radicals available to react with VOCs, promoting ozone formation. O 3 is also eliminated via rapid reaction with NO. Thus, a reduction in available NO increases O 3 atmospheric levels. This behavior is consistent with a previous report that O 3 formation in the LMA is hydrocarbon-limited (Silva et al. 2018) . The variability in the PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO 2 and O 3 concentrations over the historical period (March 16 to April 30) from 2017 and 2019 was similarly analyzed. The same general trends were observed as compared to the pre-lockdown period of 2020, albeit with more extreme concentration decreases. The highest decreases in the PM 10 , PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentrations were 73%, 64% and 48%, respectively. A significant increase in variability was observed at the CDM station for O 3 (166%) during the lockdown compared with the concentration for 2017-2019 and 2020. A comparison of the concentration values for the pairs of each pollutant and station for 2017-2019 and during the lockdown period in 2020 using ANOVA showed that the differences between these periods was significant (p-value < 0.01 at a 99% confidence level).No statistically significant differences were found between the temperatures, relative humidity and surface winds recorded during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods in the present study. In general, in LMA the highest PM 10 concentrations are observed in the summer and early autumn (February-April). On the other hand, regarding the PM 2.5 concentrations, the highest concentrations are recorded between late autumn and winter (May and September). This could be explained by the subsidence thermal inversion weakens in the middle of spring and early fall and because the humidity decreases, which is detrimental to the formation of secondary particulate matter and contrary to what occurs during the cold and humid period (May-September) (Silva et al. 2017) . Figure 4 shows the spatial variability in the NO 2 column (µmol/cm 2 ) obtained from remote sensing provided by the lockdown periods, as well as the corresponding relative change (%). NO 2 distribution in LMA is influenced by its proximity to the sea and winds, see Fig. 4a . In general, in the coastal area of the city, there are lower concentrations due to the coastal wind that blows from the ocean to the mountains (Silva et al. 2017) . The main sources of outdoor air pollution are automotive fleet for these the reason the area of greatest impact turns out to be the downtown of the city where most vehicle traffic is focused and where important economic activity takes place (Romero et al. 2020; Silva et al. 2017) . Likewise, the wind disperses the atmospheric pollution emitted in the downtown area towards the mountain slopes. Restrictive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 clearly reduce the sources of NO 2 emissions in the city (see Fig. 4b ).The relative changes in the LMA NO 2 concentration are on the order of -40% and are homogeneously distributed over the domain, which is consistent with the surface records from the STA station (see Table 1 ). Significant decreases in NO 2 levels in the 40% to 30% range are evident over most of the urban area of the domain. The decreases in NO 2 levels are on the same order of magnitude and exhibit the same trend as the surface records.The LMA has experienced significant reductions in air pollution since a complete national lockdown was decreed during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results confirm the effects of the measures of social confinement and the suspension of productive activities on the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants observed in others in urban areas around the world. This article shows that a strong lockdown, such as that implemented in Peru, produces significant improvements in air quality. It is important to incorporate the effects of the local and synoptic meteorological factors that could influence the observed variations in this type of analysis.These relative changes in air quality have also been shown to have positive impacts in reducing the possible impact of air pollution as a cofactor of morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases (Anjum 2020; Pradhan et al. 2020) . Although the lockdown has had demonstrably positive effects on the control and prevention of the spread of COVID-19 and the reduction in air pollution, there have been strong economic and social impacts in countries that have implemented restrictive measures. It is also important to mention that in part of South America, the winter period is beginning, with a reduction in temperature and a worsening of ventilation conditions and dispersion of pollutants, which are factors to consider in the management and assessment of the pandemic and its impact on the environment and vice versa. Other factors, such as weather conditions and the territorial distribution of infections, should be investigated in detail during the total lockdown implemented due to the pandemic to provide effective physical distancing with a lower socioeconomic impact.",Peru,abstract,2021-02-04,02
69225a8468c929c05353d96155559139ad111355,"Evaluation of Depression, Anxiety and Sleep Quality in the Brazilian Population During Social Isolation Due to the New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: the DEGAS-CoV Study","Since December 2019, after the first report in China (1), the new strain of Coronavirus, prompter of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), designated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (2), has caused and unprecedent, worldwide distress. Public health measures are taken in many cases, in an improvised fashion and within a blink of an eye. In short intervals social restrictions might be lifted, just be implemented again later, due to the erratic behavior of the virus and oscillations in its transmission ratio and also the evidence of secondary waves of outbreak (3) .In an unsteady scenario of a deadly virus outbreak, with massive misinformation, added to the negative effect of social restrictions, a rise in the prevalence of mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, and disruptions in the normal, physiological sleep are widely expect to occur, with possible short-and long-term consequences (4) (5) . Previous studies with data from past epidemic disorders, such as in H1N1 influenza in 2009 (6), SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (7) attest this fact.One of the first to access mental and sleep issues during the outbreak of COVID-19, Huang and Zhao applied an online questionnaire in 7,236 people living in China, finding anxiety, depression and bad sleep ratios of 35%, 20% and 18%, respectively (8) .Several other studies conducted in countries in all continents, showed an increase of anxiety, depression, bad sleep quality and/or stress as well (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . One study from the United Kingdom (12) found that higher levels of anxiety were associated with more somatic symptoms, like gastrointestinal disturbances or fatigue, hence impoverishing life quality in such cases. In Brazil, one study accessed mental and sleep complaints during COVID-19 in more than 45,000 people, surveyed through an online form, and found 52.6% of possible anxiety, 41.4% of possible depression and 43.5% of bad sleepers (18) .This study intended to measure the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, and bad sleep quality in the second trimester of 2020, among people living in Brazil, while moderate to severe social restrictions were in place, and compare rates between different groups, according to social, financial, educational, health and economic status.We conducted a cross-sectional study, called DEGAS-CoV, an acronym for ""Depression, General Anxiety and Sleep Disorders during COVID-19"". The study was based on an online survey from April 30 th to May 31 st 2020, when measures establishing some degree of social distancing -governmental advice or imposition of restrictions like closure of commerce, surveillance of circulation of cars and pedestrians, and even lock-down in more critical areas were in place, in Brazil.Before commencing, ethical approval was granted by the São Leopoldo Mandic Medical College Ethical Committee. Dissemination and recruitment of participants was made entirely online, through snowball sampling (19) , keeping in mind the current scenario of social restrictions. Participants were approached by the researchers either directly, via social medias (i.e., WhatsApp, Facebook and others), or indirectly, when other participants, in their turn, shared the link to the survey with their acquaintances.Participants were required to be at least 18 years old, and to be currently living in Brazilian soil. No physical or mental conditions/disorders were considered as exclusion criteria. Both people who already contracted or did not contract COVID-19 were included as well.Before answering, the participant was presented with a consent form and was required to check that he/she had read and agreed with all conditions.The online form was divided in three questionnaires, and was created using Google Forms (20).The first questionnaire consisted of interrogations formulated by the researchers, and meant to access geographical, educational, financial, and health status of participants, as well as habitual behaviors, such as social activities (SA) -phone or video calls/conferences and in-person interactions with familiars, friends or other people -and instrumental activities (IA) -care of offspring/parents/relatives, pet sitting, preparing meals, cleaning the house and other inhouse daily activities, shopping, religious/spiritual worship -and time spent watching or reading news. Lastly, patients were required to answer two questions regarding COVID-19. First, if they already contracted COVID-19 and, if not, how afraid they were of contracting -possible answers were ""already contracted"", ""no or little fear"", ""moderate fear"", and ""intense fear of contracting"". Secondly, they were asked to grade, in a Likert scale fashion, from 1 to 5, how severely COVID-19 had affected their lives, in general, being 1 ""no/very low interference"" and 5 ""total interference"".The second questionnaire was composed of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale -HAD (21), consisting of 14 multiplechoice questions, 7 for the evaluation of possible depression and 7 for possible anxiety. The Brazilian Portuguese validated translation (22) was used. The higher the frequency and/or intensity of symptoms, the higher the punctuation. A cut-off of 9 points for each symptom was considered for tagging the responder as a bearer of those conditions. For the last questionnaire, researchers used a modified version of Brazilian validated translation (23) of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index -PSQI (24) , what was called mPSQI. This instrument is designed for the triage of people with sleep of bad quality, regardless of etiology. The PSQI score is calculated by the sum of components (subset of questions), each receiving a determined weight. For most authors, a cut-off score of 5 points is adequate for the identification of bad sleepers (25) .The original version of the PSQI consists of 10 questions, being the first 4 open questions dealing with a free estimate of time of going to bed and getting up, sleep latency in minutes and effective hours of sleep, and the last 6 questions of multiplechoice; the higher the frequency and/or intensity of symptoms, the higher the punctuation. In the original version, the maximum score is 21 points (24) .For the mPSQI, we opted for suppression of the first 4 and also of the 10 th question, leading to a maximum possible punctuation of 15 points. For the first 4 questions, we felt that calculation and estimation of time could offer some difficulty to some responders, particularly those with lesser education years, given that no presential support could be offered. Question 10 was not included because, besides not being considered for scoring, it required the participant to have a partner or other roommate to attest snoring, and given the unusual circumstances, a considerate fraction of people enrolled could not have an informant. The cut-off commonly used value of five points for the PSQI was maintained for the mPSQI, as there was no certainty of sensitivity/specificity by adopting a lower cut-off for the mPSQI.Statistical Analysis was conducted in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) suite (26). Categorical variables were compared by Chi-Square test, with adopted significance level of 95%. For contingency tables with more than 1 degree of freedom, a Post-Hoc analysis was conducted, being the p value (⍺) modified by Bonferroni correction (27) , for a contingency table of i lines and j columns,. Odd ratios were calculated by univariate logistic regression. When needed, correlation was made by Spearman 2-tailed Correlation index (ρ), since data was non-parametric.Results from the statistical analysis are displayed in Tables 2a, 2b , 2c, 2d, 3 and 4.Prevalence of mental and sleep disorders were higher in younger people, especially in the first quartile (ages 18 to 22). Meanwhile, the oldest quartile (ages 39 to 79) was statistically less anxious and depressed than expected.Anxiety and depression were significantly higher in mestizos, and significantly lower in whites. There was no significance in differences of sleep quality among ethnicities.There were no statistical disparities of mental or sleep issues when people who lived alone were compared to people living with more people during the pandemic.People with less years of education tended to have more anxiety, depression and bad sleep symptoms, while those who had postgraduation degrees were significantly suffering less from those conditions.(regardless of being discharged more or less recently) and students had a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression and bad sleep quality than freelancers, workers of public or private sectors or those who were retired or received pension.Rates of possible conditions were similar among non-health workers and health workers (regardless of dealing or not with COVID-19 cases).Caregivers were significantly more prone to mental and sleep disorders than noncaregivers, especially depression.Responders of families with lower monthly incomes and/or whose income had dropped during the pandemic were more prone for those conditions. Also, those who did not contribute to the family budget, or were not the main contributors were also more prone to possible anxiety and depression.Sleep quality did not vary significantly among people with different family income, drop in family budget or among providers and non-providers.Weight did not seem to interfere in rates of disorders. Having or not comorbidities and being or not a smoker also did not interfere with anxiety and depression rates. People with no comorbidities were less prone to be bad sleepers than otherwise. Rates of bad sleep quality in smokers up to 10 cigarettes per day (65.6%) and in smokers of more than 10 cigarettes per day (73.3%)Rates of anxiety and bad sleep did not vary greatly among those who did not drink and alcohol consumers. The rate of depression was higher than expected in non-drinkers (49.6%), and lower than expected in those drinking up to twice a week and did not consume in the evening (41.6%). In general, alcohol drinkers were 27% less likely to be diagnosed with depression, in our sample. Nocturnal drinking did not play a statistically significant difference in rates.Participants who did not had symptoms of COVID-19, by the time of the survey, were less likely to be anxious, depressed or bad sleepers than those with symptoms, regardless of confirmation of infection by the virus.People who watched and/or read more than 3 hours per day of news were 71% (CI 1.12-2.59) more likely to be in the anxious group, and 61% (CI 1.07-2.42) more likely to be in the bad sleepers' group, when compared to those who did not follow news. They were also 39% more likely to be in the depressed group, although in this case, the CI of 0.92-2.09 did not allow a concrete confirmation of this trend.The three disturbances had the highest ratios in those who were exercising much less than before the pandemic and in those who were sedentary by the time of the collection of data, regardless of being active or not before the pandemics. For those who were active, responders that preferred exercising in the morning had the lowest ratios of anxiety, depression and bad sleep, although only depression reached statistical significance.In this survey, we found global rates of 56.5% for possible anxiety, 46.1% for possible depression and 49.2% for bad sleep quality.A meta-analysis conducted by Salari et. al (28) found, among 17 studies conducted in 2020, anxiety rates varying between 6.33% and 50.9% (mean of 32.9% for Asian and 23.8% for European studies) and depression rates from 17.17% to 53.5% (mean of 35.3% for Asian and 32.4% for European studies). Assessment for those conditions was heterogeneous. The most frequent used instruments were the DASS-21 -Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (29) , the GAD-7 -Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (30) , and the PHQ-9 -Patient Health Questionnaire (31) .Rates of anxiety and depression in our survey were higher than the averages of the aforementioned meta-analysis, however some factors must be bore in mind: first, none of those studies used the HAD scale for anxiety and depression, adopted in this study. Secondly, and in particular regarding anxiety rate, studies that used the DASS-21 scale also assessed stress levels. Some of the stress questions are of resemblance with anxiety questions of the HAD scale -for instance: ""I found it hard to wind down"" is accounted for stress in DASS-21, and ""I feel tense or 'wound up'"" is accounted for anxiety in HAD. This raises a possibility that, in studies based on the DASS-21, anxiety rates were lower due to a split caused by the stress group. Thirdly, none of those studies included were from Latin-American countries. Another Brazilian study (32) , with 45,161 participants, intended to evaluate sadness/depression, anxiety/nervousness and sleep problems. Data was collected online between April 24 th and May 24 th , 2020, a time window very much similar to ours. Although using a much simpler form, consisting of a few questions -i.e., not using standardized, validated questionnaires, this survey found rates of 52.6% of anxiety/nervousness, 43.5% of sadness/depression and 43.5% of an onset of sleep issues, percentages that resemble ours.Studies conducted out of a pandemic scenario shows lower rates of the same disturbances. A Brazilian, multicenter survey of 2014 (33), was conducted with data from 1,857 participants who were assessed when using primary healthcare, from four Brazilian cities. This study also used the HAD scale as instrument to access mental disorders. Anxiety rates oscillated from 35.4% to 43%, and depression rates ranged between 21.4% and 31%. In our survey, anxiety and depression rates (see Tables 2a-d) are higher. Another study (34) estimated, by analysis of 12,000 people that responded to the 2011 National Health and Wellness Survey in Brazil, the prevalence of Major Depression to be 10.2%, again much lower than what we found.Mestizos were more likely to be possibly depressed. Although rates of one or both disturbances were also higher in blacks and native Brazilians (indigenous), this did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to low sampling. The disproportional high rate of whites (74.1%) and low rates of mestizos (19.4%), blacks (4.4%) and other ethnicities responding (latest Brazilian census shows 47.5% of auto-declared whites, 43.2% of mestizos and 7.5% of blacks (35)) are clear evidence of the social and economic inequality in our local reality (36).BMI did not influence rates of anxiety, depression and bad sleep, while the absence of comorbidities was a protective factor for better sleep quality, but not for anxiety and depression. Sedentary people (regardless of being or not active before the pandemic) were more prone all those conditions, and those who already practiced before and kept practicing more than 3 times a week showed the least tendency to mental and sleep disturbances, showing that exercising played a role in preventing worsening of mental and sleep status in our sample. Also, of note, people that preferred to exercise early were less depressed. That could be due a bidirectional relationship, as depression is commonly linked with morning fatigue and unwillingness to engage in energetic activities (37).Curiously enough, those who did not consume alcohol had a significant higher rate of depression than alcohol consumers. We do not propose a logical explanation, but researchers should pay attention to forthcoming articles, to see if this pattern replicates, or if it could be merely coincidental. Conversely, despite not reaching significant differences, but towards what is traditionally more expected, alcohol consumers, especially those with nocturnal consumption, had higher rates of anxiety and bad sleep quality. Smokers had greater incidence of bad sleepy quality, especially those who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day. This is expected, as smoking is known to be disruptive to good sleep (38).Apart from snowball sampling, there were other limitations. By lowering by 7 points the maximum punctuation possible of the PSQI, the authors acknowledge that sensitivity might have been diminished for detection of bad sleepers, but a necessary cost, given the facts already explained in methodology. Nonetheless, we consider that the specificity of the diagnosis of bad sleep remained unharmed, and the high proportion of bad sleepers, with the mPSQI, is by itself a fact worthy of consideration.The DEGAS-CoV study, in accordance to many published papers so far, shows high rates of anxiety (56.5%), depression (46.1%) and bad sleep quality (49.2%) during COVID-19. These rates reflect the time of data collection, in the second trimester of 2020, in the Brazilian population. Some groups were more prone to those disturbances, such as: younger people, women, mestizos, people with lesser years of education, of lower income or whose income dropped significantly during the pandemic, unemployed, caregivers, people who followed more hours of news of COVID-19, sedentary or those who engaged less in physical activity, and those less engaged in social and instrumental activities. More studies, especially longitudinal, could provide more information on if the prevalence of mental and sleep issues remains constant during the pandemic crisis or suffer changes related to different aspects, like adaptation to the situation, social restriction relaxation and improved treatments or vaccines. We also intend to conduct further sub-analyses of our data, in search of more significant statistical findings.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-03,02
d8de140749601e06fc8a2a6c8eaaccf7a6e01c8d,Exploratory study on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the general Brazilian population,"a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111In a pandemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak, people tend to be more susceptible to physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional changes (which are not necessarily related to the clinical condition of the disease) [1] . The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the main international concerns regarding its impact on mental health. Specific stressors related to the pandemic are affecting the general population, professionals working in direct patient care, and professionals who are not directly on the front line (configured as indirect trauma) [2, 3] . There is an increase on the demands relating to mental health, and moreover, there is the need to find ways to address the outbreak's consequences. The growing information on contamination and lethality rates associated with the absence of effective treatment or means of prevention such as vaccines may corroborate with the increase in demands on mental health [3, 4] .To flatten the virus's transmission curve and prevent a collapse in health systems, quarantines have been adopted as a public health measure in many places worldwide and often involve isolation and varying degrees of restrictions in people's movement. However, this form of protection has necessitated changes in people's lives such as in how schooling and work are conducted (e.g., homeschooling and home office, respectively) and also harms the economic sector due to the closing of most ""non-essential"" commercial stores [5, 6] . It has also necessitated changes in the habits of people, such as reducing social contact, adopting new standards of hygiene, and having flexibility regarding new forms of adaptation to the situation, since it requires a commitment to self-care and care in relation to others. At the same time, quarantines may also have an important impact on the mental health of the population, the extent of which, a priori, is unpredictable.A study of cancer patients in isolation reported psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, abstinence, regression, and hallucinations; it was also observed that children seemed to respond better to isolation [7] . Focusing on COVID-19, a study in China showed that more than half of 1,210 participants expressed some level of depression, anxiety, and stress [8] .In Lebanon, the imposition of quarantine measures was found to be related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the second week of isolation, with symptoms worsening in the fourth week [9] . In more specific populations, such as university students in Spain, 2,530 students and workers of the University of Valladolid had moderate to extremely severe levels of symptoms of anxiety (21.3%), depression (34.2%), and stress (28.1%) [10] .As the COVID-19 crisis is permeated by more doubts than answers mainly in relation to effective treatments, its impact on mental health could be a continuous phenomenon, crossing the quarantine period, and thereby becoming a new clinical condition of the pandemic. Given the above, it is clear that the development of mental health care and psychosocial well-being programs is as necessary as physical health care. The Mental Health and Psychosocial Support for Staff (MHPSS) [11] have already highlighted the need for support and understanding programs as such programs will make coping more appropriate and safer for the population, which will certainly result in mitigating mental health problems.As if the peculiar complexity of COVID-19 in Brazil, for example, territorial extension and great social inequality, was not enough, the pandemic emerged amid a political and scientific conflict, which notably divided federal management on one side and state and municipal management on the other regarding the understanding of quarantine as an indicated measure. This polarization puts in risk the actions to address the spread of COVID-19, which is mainly affecting people living in regions and houses that are in an increased vulnerability to contamination and dissemination.During the survey (May 22-June 5, 2020), Brazil reached further than 820,000 confirmed cases and almost 40,000 deaths. According to Coronavirus Resource Center-Johns Hopkins University (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), currently, five months after the first case of contagion registered (Jan 26) in the country, there are over 3,669,995 infected and almost 116,000 deaths for COVID-19. The first death was registered on March 12, 2020 (covid.saude. gov.br).In light of all of this, this study aimed to verify the prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the use of coping strategies and adaptation on behaviors amidst quarantine measures. This study also aimed to obtain general health data regarding COVID-19 in a Brazilian population. Our main hypothesis was that the pandemic situation of COVID-19 would be accompanied by the presence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, besides changes in the coping behavior of the general Brazilian population.We developed an anonymous online questionnaire, using the Google Forms platform, which allowed us to reach people across the country. The research was disclosed on Facebook, Instagram, in the media sector of the Institute of Psychiatry of the Hospital das Clínicas at the University of São Paulo and of the Health Psychology program at the Methodist University of São Paulo. Cross-sectional data were collected between May 22 and June 5, 2020, covering the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District to be filled by quarantined persons. The information on this study is posted for public access on ""Plataforma Brasil"" (https://plataformabrasil.saude. gov.br), which is the national and unified base of research records involving human beings linked to the National Health Council, an organ of the Ministry of Health.This study used a quantitative cross-sectional design through non-probabilistic sampling using the ""snowball"" method. An online questionnaire was created via a Google Forms link; the link was also made available on social media to be filled out by people in quarantine. The inclusion criterion was being �18 years. Exclusion criteria included forms sent after June 5, 2020. Thus, a total of 3,031 anonymous participants answered the online survey and thirty-one was excluded once they were sent on after the June 5 deadline, and therefore, 3,000 participants with an average age of 39.8 (SD = 13.0) were included in this study and there was no missing data.We applied an online questionnaire consisting of 108 questions organized as follows: Twentyone issues addressed to sociodemographic data (age, sex, marital status, Children, educational level, Number of people living at the residence), information about the general health conditions of the participants, about the COVID-19 contagion, death of relatives or friends, and behavior in the face of the demands generated by the pandemic. These alternatives were related to quantity formats (for example, the number of children), yes or no answers, or list of categories, such as the symptoms of COVID-19, which could be checked. To assess psychological symptoms, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used, which had been adapted and validated in the Portuguese language [12] . This instrument consists of 21 questions, divided into three subscales, which are scored on a 4-point Likert scale. Each subscale is composed of seven items, which assess symptoms related to depression, anxiety, and stress. The total score is obtained by adding the scores of the seven items for each of the three subscales and multiplied by two.The DASS-21 provides three scores (one per subscale), with possible scores having a minimum of ""0"" and a maximum of ""21"", expressing the levels normal, mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe. Higher scores on each scale correspond to more negative affective states. According to the results of the DASS-21, we organized the sample into two groups: asymptomatic (normal level) and symptomatic (levels from mild to extremely severe). For the coping strategy data, we adapted the questions from the Coping Strategy Inventory [13] also to the online format, which assesses the efforts made by people in coping with stressful, chronic, or acute situations. It consists of 66 items that include thoughts and actions, and whose intensity is measured using a scale from 0 (not used) to 3 points (uses in large quantities).The questionnaire was constructed in a way that did not allow closing the page without all the alternatives having been answered. Once it is an online survey and without the possibility of physical signature, all participants only accessed the online form after reading the Informed Consent and having accepted it by clicking on the button that configured the voluntary participation agreement in the survey.Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23 (SPSS 23.0) software. Categorical variables were represented by frequency and percentage (%). The anxiety, depression, and stress scores did not present a normal distribution when the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was performed (p-value = 0.001), resulting in the execution of nonparametric tests for later analyses. The Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis H tests were used for consolidated comparison between demographic variables and symptomatic and asymptomatic groups and inter-and intra-group analyses. The Chi-square test was used to verify differences in the proportionality of frequencies to the analyzed variables and the respondent groups' (i.e., asymptomatic and symptomatic) depression, anxiety, and stress scores with a significance level of p <0.05. The p-value <0.05 was considered significant in this study for all statistical analysis. Spearman's correlation was used to analyze the association between variables, with the magnitude of the coefficients interpreted as either weak (0.1-0.3), moderate (0.4-0.6), or strong (�0.7), both for positive and negative significance (cf. Dancey & Reidy [14] ).All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. This study was approved following the procedures of mental health research protocols for COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) by the National Council of Ethics in Research (CONEP) of Brazil (CAAE: 30503920.5.0000.0008). As it was an online survey and without the possibility of a physical signature, the participants only had access to the form after reading and accepting the Free and Informed Consent Terms (ICF) that was available at the bottom of the online page. Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics and behavioral aspects of the participants.Most respondents were women (83%; see Table 1 ). Ages ranged from 18 to 82 years, with 31 to 40 years (28.1%) being the most frequent age group. The criteria used for dividing the participants into age groups was based on Brazilian study by Pinheiro et al. [15] which analyzed stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in a situation of social distance. Most participants were married (50.6%), had college education (70.1%), and had children over 16 years old (24.4%). Most lived in houses of three to five people (61.1%), and most were either employed (46.7%) or self-employed (38.4%). A majority were reported to be in good health conditions (94.8%) and 25.9% reported chronic illness. As for COVID-19, 35.2% reported contact with someone infected, 22.7% had relatives or friends who died, 6.4% contracted the virus, and 69.5% of the participants remained at home for 20 to 24 hours. Regarding the use of a mask and hygiene measures, 77 and 86.8%, respectively, reported always following these procedures. Regarding coping strategies, 61.3% reported an increase in hours of sleep, 40.8% perceived an increased intake of food, alcohol, drugs, tobacco, and medication. Table 2 shows the results of the DASS-21 scale according to the sample distribution in two groups: ""asymptomatic"" (people who did not refer symptoms indicative scores for anxiety, depression, and stress) and ""symptomatic"" group (people who referred indicative scores of symptoms for anxiety, depression, and stress). Table 2 shows that 46.4% of the participants showed symptoms of depression, 39.7% anxiety, and 42.2% stress. Analyzing the proportionality differences in frequencies in the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, only the moderate level of stress was significantly more prevalent (p <0.01, Chi-square). As for the distribution of symptoms according to age, participants between 18 and 30 years old showed higher frequencies regarding depression and anxiety with mild to extremely severe levels, and moderate to extremely severe concerning stress. Tables 3, 4 , and 5 show the analyses of the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups in relation to the variables gender, children, professional situation, presence of chronic disease, contact with people infected with COVID-19, and participants diagnosed with COVID-19.As shown in Tables 3, 4 , and 5, the levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Regarding to p-value for characteristics, it was for sex, children, occupation, and chronic disease 0.000 (depression) and 0.001 (anxiety and stress); close contact with infected people 0.000 (depression), 0.001 (anxiety), and 0.020 (stress); diagnostic of Covid 0.000 (depression), 0.001 (anxiety), and 0.008 (stress).Concerning higher levels, it was similar group characteristic for both. For depression were higher in women (median 8; 95% CI 10.0-10.7), people without children (median 10; 95% CI 11.1-12.1), students (median 12; 95% CI 13.0-15.3), patients with chronic diseases (median 10; 95% CI 10.8-12.2), and people who had contact with others with COVID-19 (median 10; 95% CI 11.6-13.3) or properly diagnosed with the virus (median 14; 95% CI 14.4-19.5). Regarding to anxiety were higher in women (median 12; 95% CI 13.0-13.6), people without children (median 14; 95% CI 13.9-14.8), students (median 16; 95% CI 15.4-17.6), patients with chronic diseases (median 14; 95% CI 13.5-14.8), who had close contact with infected (Table 3) , the prevalence of previous results is maintained (p2 = 0.001; p3 = 0.001). Regarding anxiety (see Table 4 ) in the symptomatic group, only participants with or without children and different professional situations have significant differences, with couples without children and students presenting a higher level of anxiety symptoms (p3 = 0.001). For stress (see Table 5 ), there was no significant difference in stress levels in relation to gender (p3 = 0.904), presence of chronic disease (p3 = 0.068), occurrence of contact with people close to the virus (p3 = 0.495) or have a diagnosis of the disease (p3 = 0.210).From the analysis of the frequency distribution between the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, women, people without children, the unemployed, students, people with chronic diseases, and people who had contact with people who were diagnosed with the virus or who were diagnosed with COVID-19, expressed a higher proportion of depressive, anxious and stress symptoms in relation to their own classification within the set of variables (p4 in Tables  3, 4 , and 5). Table 6 presents the results of the correlation between studied variables. Depression was shown to have a moderate positive result with anxiety and stress; weak positive with an occupation, sleeping more and using drugs, drugs or eating more to feel good; and moderate negative with age. Whereas anxiety was positive strong with stress; weak positive with chronic illness, COVID-19 diagnosis, sleeping more and using drugs, drugs or eating; weak negative with age and education level. Stress had a weak positive correlation with sleeping more and using some substance to feel better, and weak negative with age.This study aimed to examine the psychological impact of COVID-19 in an adult sample in Brazil and had the participation of people from all regions of the country. Verifying the pandemic's impact on mental health may provide the needed information to promote policies to assist affected populations.Our sample was characterized by more women and married people, ages ranged from 18 to 82 years, with those between 30 and 40 years having greater participation. Most had some college education, were working, and were in good health condition. A third of respondents disclosed that they had contact with people with COVID-19 and a small proportion contracted the virus. The few studies exploring the pandemic's psychological impact had a similar prevalence of women [2, 8, 10, 16, 17] , except for a study that investigated the psychological symptoms of ordinary Chinese citizens in the early stages of the pandemic, which had more men [18] . Women in many cultures assume overly broad responsibilities: besides their professional role, they often end up being at the heart of household chores and childcare [19] . Also, it must be noted that among women, there is a high prevalence of violence and abuse, which has been exhibited in other epidemics such as the Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks in 2013-2016 and 2015-2016, respectively. A field in which the majority of workers are predominantly women is that of health and social services, which necessitates the urgency to not only train women professionally but also to provide them with more resources when they assume primary responsibility for work domestic [19] . The sociodemographic variables observed in this study, such as the number of married people, educational level, and the number of residents in the house, are similar to those identified in a recent study in China [8] . However, for the participants in that study, the largest age group comprised those between 20 and 30 years and more than half were students.Regarding psychological impact, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mild to moderate stress, were found in almost half of our sample, which was in accordance with the presence of symptoms experienced less than a week before the conducting of the survey [12] . According to the DASS's foundation, the presence of depressive symptoms is associated with hopelessness, low self-esteem, and low incentive. So, as for anxiety is associated with physiological hyperstimulation and stress, which is an emotional state that varies according to an individual's assessment of situations experienced as a threat, damage, or challenge, coupled with increased irritability and limitation of frustration [18] . The presence of depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms may at some point cause emotional changes or physiological changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, for example, as highlighted in past studies [20] .In this sense, one must consider that biological models have shown that hypo-sensitivity or hypersensitivity may be markers of ""trait"" of individuals with affective disorders and temperament characteristics similar to those found in patients with mood disorders (affective Table 6 . Correlation of among sociodemographic variable, coping strategies, depression, anxiety, and stress (N = 3000). 11. Slept more than normal 0.246 �� temperament), have a higher probability of suffer from hopelessness and this is a predictive aspect for suicide risk [21, 22] . Thus, research that addresses behavioral signs related to anxiety, depression and mild to moderate stress associated with COVID-19 raise an important alarm for public health services, which need to be prepared for the increased demand and urgency in the treatment of new cases of mental disorders. These findings corroborate the results of Wang et al. [8] , who surveyed 210 Chinese people using the DASS-21 and IES-R (Impact of Event Scale-Revised) questionnaires. Their findings revealed severe levels of depressive symptoms (30.3%), anxiety (36.4%), and stress (32.1%). Our indexes were also of a serious level; however, they were higher on the DASS-21 scale compared to the study by Wang et al. [8] . The risks of the COVID-19 pandemic's psychological impact on the mental health of the general population have been discussed in previous studies, although these have been mostly theoretical in the form of editorials, letters to the editor, and comments [3, 4, [23] [24] [25] .Other studies exploring specific populations also show a psychological impact that corroborates our findings. A study assessing 460 Portuguese university students (with an average age of 20.14 years) using the DASS-21 observed high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress in this population [26] . In Spain, 2,530 students and workers of the University of Valladolid, presented moderate to extremely severe levels in terms of symptoms of anxiety (21.34%), depression (34.19%) , and stress (28.14%) [10] . Another study, which evaluated psychopathological symptoms online through the Self-Report Symptom Inventory (SCL-90) in 1.600 participants, had more than 70% of participants expressing moderate to severe indices of anxiety, compulsions, and psychoticism [17] . Researchers in Lebanon using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PTSS) among 950 civilians, demonstrated that 33.2% of respondents had symptoms of PTSD.As for depression, there was a higher prevalence in women than men in our study. Past studies have emphasized that depression is twice as prevalent in young women as in men, although it decreases throughout life and as triggers, women tend to have more internalizing symptoms [27] . Also, it is possible that regardless of age, professional status, marital status, education, and maternity, a condition such as a pandemic imposes an even greater burden on one's duties during confinement, causing greater psychological distress. These aspects also extend to stress anxiety levels.It is well known that the pandemic has an emotional burden relating to concerns about contamination rates, people who need treatment in intensive care units, risk of death, and vulnerable populations [11] . Therefore, it was expected that participants who had contact with people close to or diagnosed with COVID-19 would express high levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, which corroborates the findings of other studies [2, 8, 9, 28, 29] .Although the majority of the population works, has a degree, and is married, our results suggest that these variables are not protective factors for mental health and that the pandemic does indeed have an impact and magnitude that is difficult to measure. In the case of students, they probably feel more threatened and insecure about the future, in addition to having their mobility and social contact being reduced. In this population segment, research in Spain and Portugal showed indications of the pandemic's psychological impact [10, 26] .Despite the number of unemployed being less than 10% in our sample, there was an observed increase in psychological suffering. Although it was not verified whether unemployment resulted from the pandemic or not, the indicators of elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress corroborate previous findings on psychological processes and unemployment. Studies have highlighted that unemployed people were more likely to experience depressive symptoms, more stress, and less well-being compared to employed individuals [30, 31] .Also, unemployment is associated with an increased risk of mortality for those in the early and middle periods of their careers, compared to those at the end [32] .Coping strategy behaviors can be either positive or negative [33] . A little less than half of our sample reported an increase in sleeping hours, food intake, alcohol use, drug use, tobacco use, and medication because of the pandemic. These behaviors denote the participants' adoption of a negative escape-avoidance strategy, and such a strategy usually involves people imagining possible solutions to a problem without, however, taking actions to change them [33] . This finding corroborates with previous studies, since, in situations of high pressure and stress, people tend to adopt more negative strategies [34] . That said, the symptoms of stress may be associated with feelings of threat, harm, and challenge in the face of changes in behavior that the COVID-19 pandemic imposed on the population, aspects that have already been reported in past studies [35, 36] .The use of face masks and hand sanitizer was evidenced to not happen all the time, thus presenting a risk factor for contamination and the spread of the virus. This points out the need to develop programs that enable people to adopt healthy habits and behaviors, translated into concrete measures to reduce the contamination of COVID-19. In primary care, a method for prevention is through ""counseling,"" which represents the directed use of communication and problem-solving techniques capable of stimulating people to change behaviors and adopt safer and healthier lifestyle habits. According to Oliveira et al. [37] , the relevance of counseling for the promotion, prevention, and control of diseases is such that it is no longer possible to provide complete and technically correct primary care programs without the inclusion of counseling for healthy habits and behaviors.In the scope of psychological impact, research thus far, even if still quite small, is quite suggestive of the possible damage of the pandemic to mental health, emphasizing the need for public health policies that value encouraging not only physical care but also emotional care, with programs that can stimulate and teach techniques for handling emotions, to reduce anxiety and stress [38] . In addition, it is necessary to consider that the occurrence of depressive, anxious, and high-stress symptoms in adults, which can also result from trait markers [21, 22] , raises the concern that directing attention to children and adolescents is fundamental.Children and adolescents depend on the care of protective figures, who are fragile and end up failing to provide the necessary support and care, leaving them in a situation of vulnerability and, therefore, very susceptible to stressful experiences [39] .This study has limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results. As the sample composition was voluntary and online within a short period, we were unable to perform randomization, and so, for example, most participants were with a higher level of education, making the sample more selective. We also did not verify, in the cases of the unemployed, whether they lost their jobs during the pandemic. We also did not verify the presence of a previous history of mental disorders, which would certainly produce a clearer picture of the psychological impact in the face of the pandemic.Despite these limitations, our findings showed the presence of important psychological changes in the general population. Women, people without children, the unemployed, students, people with chronic diseases, and participants who had contact with close people infected or diagnosed with the virus, were more susceptible to its psychological impact. This may suggest the existence of a group of greater vulnerability for situations with a high-stress load and which requires greater attention in terms of society's proposals for its management. The fact that women and people without children, as well as unemployed people, present higher levels of psychological changes raises the hypothesis that the situation of the pandemic may put them in a condition of lack of perspective, as the uncertainty about the future and other uncertainties tend to cause uncomfortable sensations, anguish, and anxiety, in addition to the possible feeling of helplessness. Therefore, expanding psychiatric care services, training more qualified professionals in the management of psychological impacts in the face of the pandemic, within the scope of cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychoeducation, for example, will certainly reduce the mental health problems in this population.That said, it should be emphasized that these findings are preliminary and portray a moment still being faced by many people amid the pandemic and quarantine measures. Therefore, we understand that the magnitude of the impacts on mental health will only be more specific with continuous studies after total relaxation of the quarantine.(XLS)",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-03,02
7ba919465a9ca9ba1ebd34e1fc5e1a1e58ca5636,Standard and anomalous second waves in the COVID-19 pandemic,"One year after the first death by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), on January 11, 2020, in Wuhan, China, the direst predictions about the danger and severity of the ensuing pandemic have been confirmed. As of this writing, more than 100 millions of cases of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus haven been identified worldwide and over 2.2 millions of deaths have been attributed to the disease (COVID-19) caused by the virus 1, 2 . The response strategies to counter the propagation of the virus have varied widely from country to country, and even within countries. Notwithstanding their different approaches to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, a great deal of countries have suffered a significant loss of life to the virus. The widespread severity of the pandemic is reflected in the fact that, as of this writing, 54 countries have registered more than 50 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, with half of them showing a death rate above 100 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants 3 . A particularly interesting but troublesome development in the course of the pandemic is the fact that many countries were able to control somewhat the spread of the disease during the first few months after its onset, only to see a subsequent increase in the rate of infections and deaths. This resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic, commonly referred to as a second wave of infections, has in some cases been even more severe that the so-called first wave. Hence it is a topic of special relevance, from both the mathematical modelling viewpoint and the public health perspective.In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, a second wave of infections can, broadly speaking, appear via two main different dynamics. First, in a standard or textbook second wave, the resurgence of infections appears after the epidemic curves for the cumulative number of cases and deaths have reached a near-Brazil, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Serbia, and US. As our main aim here is to analyse the second waves of the COVID-19 epidemic in different countries, we have not included mortality data that may be attributed to third or subsequent waves of infections. For example, for Iran, Japan, Morocco, Serbia, and US, we used mortality data up to a maximum date (typically in September or October, 2020) that excludes a third regime of accelerated growth that has been observed in the epidemic curves of these countries. For Australia, we analysed data up to November 6, 2020, because at this point the second wave had nearly reached a plateau, after which no resurgence of COVID-19 deaths has so far been observed. For Austria, Brazil, Germany, and Italy we used recent data (January, 2021), because in these countries the respective second waves are still developing as of the time of this writing.The data used in this study were obtained from the database made publicly available by the Johns Hopkins University 1, 23 , which lists in automated fashion the number of the confirmed cases and deaths per country. The specific time periods comprised in the mortality datasets for each country considered in the presented study are given in Sec. 4.In the present paper we are mainly interested in modelling epidemic curves that display second-wave effects, as indicated for example by the presence of two regimes with strong positive accelerations, corresponding to the first and second waves of infection, respectively. Because our model for such cases is a generalisation of a single-wave model, we shall start by reviewing the basic one-wave model (i.e., with constant parameters), after which the general model with time-dependent parameters is discussed. Subsequently, we also discuss the numerical methods used to analyse the empirical data.We model the time evolution of the number of deaths in the epidemic by means of the beta logistic model (BLM), defined by the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) 21, 24 :where C(t) is the cumulative number of deaths at time t. We assume for the time being that the model parameters {r, q, α, p, K} are all constant in time, in which case they can be interpreted as follows: r is the growth rate at the early stage; q controls the initial growth profile and allows to interpolate from linear growth (q = 0) to sub-exponential growth (q < 1) to purely exponential growth (q = 1); the exponent p controls the late-time growth rate, with p > 1 implying a slow-decaying polynomial rate, whereas p = 1 yields a fast exponential decay (see below); the exponent α controls the degree of asymmetry with respect to the symmetric S-shape of the logistic curve, which is recovered for q = p = α = 1; and, finally, K is the final size of the epidemic, meaning that C(t) = K for t → ∞. Equation (1) must be supplemented with the initial conditionfor some given value of C 0 . The BLM described in (1) is one of the most general growth models, from which many other known models emerge as special cases 21, 24 . For instance, for q = p = α = 1 we recover the standard logistic model, as already mentioned. In addition, for q = p = 1 we obtain the Richards growth model 25 , with the case p = 1 corresponding to the so-called generalised Richards model 26 ; while setting α = 1 in (1) yields the Blumberg's equation 27 ; for other special cases see 24 .In the case where the parameters {r, q, α, p, K} are constant, the BLM admits an analytic solution 21 in the following implicit form:wherewith 2 F 1 (a, b; c; x) being the Gauss hypergeometric function. Equation (3) describes a sigmoidal curve, whose only inflection point is located at the time t c obtained by substituting the value C c = K[q/(q + α p)] 1/α in (3) . The small-and large-times asymptotic behaviour of the growth profile C(t) are as follows:. (For q → 1 and p → 1, one obtains exponential growth and exponential decay, respectively.) Growth models have the mathematical advantage that they often admit analytical solutions, as we have shown above for the BLM, which is a very useful property when fitting models to empirical data 28 . Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that there is an intrinsic connection between growth models and mechanistic epidemic models of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) class of models. For instance, it is possible to construct a map between the Richards growth model and SIR-type models 29, 30 . Thus, when properly applied and interpreted, growth models are useful tools for understanding the spreading dynamics of infectious diseases 21, 22, 26 . Although in the present paper we restrict our analysis to the BLM, it is important to bear in mind the aforementioned connection between growth models and compartmental models. We therefore thought it was worth including here a brief discussion about a map between the BLM and a generalised SIRD model.As mentioned above, it is possible to put the BLM in correspondence with a SIRD-like model, but in this case the target SIRD-type model has to be modified by the inclusion of a power law in the incidence term, owing to the power-law behaviour exhibited by the BLM, as shown below.We start by recalling the standard Susceptible (S)-Infected (I)-Recovered (R)-Deceased (D) epidemiological model 31, 32 where S(t), I(t), R(t), and D(t) are the number of individuals at time t in the classes of susceptible, infected, recovered, and dead respectively, while N is the constant total number of individuals in theAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.We then consider a modified SIRD model, where in (6) and (7) we replace N with only the partial population in the S and I compartments 29 . Furthermore, we follow Refs. 33, 34 and replace the term I(t) on the right-hand side of all equations above by [I(t)] p , to obtainAlthough this model is still not general enough to accommodate all the phenomenology of the intervention biased dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemics, it does nonetheless exhibit subexponential behaviour for both short and large time scales in all compartments. In order to show this, we define y(t) = S(t) + I(t) and divide (11) by (10) to obtainwhere R 0 = β /(γ 1 + γ 2 ). Integrating both sides of (14) , and inserting the result into (10), yields an equation of the BLM type:where r, K > 0, q = 1 + (p − 1)/R 0 and α = 1 − 1/R 0 . It follows from (15) , in comparison with model (1), that S(t) exhibits power-law regimes (for both early and large times) akin to those described by the BLM. Furthermore, it is easy to see that all other compartments, I(t), R(t), and D(t), inherit from S(t) the power-law behaviour, even though their respective equations of motion are not of the BLM-type. Note that the parameters q, p, and α in (15) are not all independent of one another-in fact, the conditions q < 1 and p > 1 are mutually incompatible. Nonetheless, the preceding qualitative argument shows that the power-law dynamics of the sort predicted by the BLM can in principle be accommodated by compartmental models. We are currently carrying out further research to establish a more complete map between the BLM and a generalised SIRD model where the exponents q, p, and α are all independent of each other. The BLM with constant parameters has been show to describe remarkably well the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic for several countries in Europe and North America 21 . However, after the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in many countries (most notably after the Summer of 2020 in the Northern hemisphere), their respective epidemic curves started to exhibit more complex patterns that cannot be captured by the standard BLM. In the next subsection we introduce a generalised version of the BLM with time-dependent parameters, which is much more adequate to describe growth processes with two or more distinct growth phases, corresponding to different waves of infection.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Our two-wave model is still described by the ODE given in (1), but now we assume that all parameters depend on time, that is, r = r(t), q = q(t), α = α(t), p = p(t), and K = K(t). To capture the two distinct growth regimes (""waves""), we propose that these parameters, here generically represented by the symbol ζ (t), obey the following logistic-like equationwhose solution, with the condition ζ (t 0 ) = (ζ 1 + ζ 2 )/2, is of the following form:where ζ (t) stands for any of the parameters r, α, q, p, and K, with ζ 1 and ζ 2 representing the corresponding parameter values for the first and second waves, respectively. A schematic of the generic parameter ζ (t), as defined in (17), is shown in Fig. 1 . The parameter t 0 determines the transition time between the first and second wave; whereas the parameter ρ characterises how rapid this transition is, so that the larger the parameter ρ the quicker the transition towards the second-wave regime. Note that the characteristic time scale t 0 and the corresponding transition rate ρ are the same for all parameters. This is justified because an overall change in the epidemic dynamics, brought about, say, by a relaxation of control measures or by a change in the population behaviour (or both), is expected to affect simultaneously all epidemiological parameters, which are in turn described in an effective manner by the growth model parameters 22 .It is worth pointing out, however, that although the parameter t 0 in (17) sets the time scale for the transition between the first and second waves, it does not, in itself, represent the time where second-wave effects begin, as the onset of the second wave also depends on the parameter ρ. This can been seen more clearly in Fig. 1 , where we also indicated a piecewise linear approximation (dashed line) to the function (solid line) described by (17) . Under this linear approximation, one sees that a better estimate for the onset of the second wave is given by t 0 − 2/ρ. The linear transition region, t 0 − 2/ρ < t < t 0 + 2/ρ, thusAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.As an analytical solution for the theoretical curve C(t) for the BLM time-dependent parameters is no longer possible, one must resort to a numerical integration of the ODE (1), with the parameters {r(t), q(t), α(t), p(t), K(t)} described by their respective transition functions of the form given in (17) . A schematic of the cumulative curve, C(t), for the two-model upon numerical integration (for an arbitrary choice of parameters) is shown in Fig. 2a . In this figure, the dashed line denoted by K 1 represents the plateau level if only the first wave had been present, whereas the parameter K 2 is the actual final plateau corresponding to the total number of deaths at the end of the epidemic (assuming that subsequent waves of infection do not occur). In Fig. 2b , we show the time derivative, dC/dt, of the cumulative curve shown in Fig. 2a , which corresponds to the daily number of deaths as a function of time. In this figure one clearly sees the distinct ""peaks"" of the two waves, whose maximum values are indicated by M 1 and M 2 , respectively.At face value, our two-wave model has 12 free parameters, corresponding to the initial and final values for each of the five BLM parameters {r, q, α, p, K}, together with the parameters t 0 and ρ describing the transition between first and second waves. Blindingly trying to fit a given empirical epidemic curve with a model containing such a large number of parameters is not an efficient procedure, as one is bound to incur into over-fitting issues. Next, we describe a two-step fitting procedure that aims at circumventing, at least partially, these difficulties.In the first step of our fitting procedure, we give an initial educated guess for the possible location of the transition t 0 . We then fit the data up to this time with the one-wave model, as given by its analytical solution (3) . At this point, it is important to recall that the parameters r, q, and α in the one-wave model (1) are restricted to certain allowed ranges. For example, the exponent q is limited to the range 0 ≤ q ≤ 1, as q > 1 would imply a super-exponential growth which is not justified on epidemiological grounds. Furthermore, it is expected by biological reasons (see, e.g., the discussion in Refs. 22, 29 ) that the asymmetry parameter α should also be within the interval (0,1). Similarly, we restrict the values of r to the range (0,1), as we observed that values of r outside this interval tends to be an indication of possible over-fitting. In other words, we assume here that the restrictions 0 < q ≤ 1, 0 < α ≤ 1, and 0 < r < 1 are useful empirical criteria to reduce over-fitting.The second step in our fitting procedure comprises the numerical fit of the entire empirical curve using the two-wave model. In this case, the values obtained for the parameters r 1 , q 1 , α 1 , p 1 , and K 1 in the first step described above are used as initial guesses for the respective parameters describing the first wave in the full two-wave model. The initial guesses for the second set of parameters, r 2 , q 2 , α 2 , p 2 , and K 2 , characterising the second wave as well as for the rate of transition ρ are chosen somewhat arbitrarily within their ranges of definition.In all numerical fits, for both the single-wave and two-wave models, we employed the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to solve the non-linear least square optimisation problem, as implemented in the lmfit package for the Python language, which has a built-in routine for estimating the errors of the fitted parameters via the covariance matrix 35 . The results of the fitting procedure are deemed acceptable when the errors in the parameters were smaller than the values themselves estimated for the parameters. (In most cases reported here, however, the errors are much smaller than the maximum allowed tolerance of 100%.) We noticed, however, that in order to control the errors and minimise overfitting issues, it was necessary to apply the restriction α 2 = 1 and p 2 = 1. This is because these two parameters control the bending and approach towards the second plateau, and since there are generally fewer points in this final portion of the empirical curve (at least for the datasets selected here), estimating these two parameters is more difficult and usually leads to large unacceptable errors. Hence it proved convenient to set α 2 = p 2 = 1.As our main aim in this paper is to illustrate the application of our two-wave model, we have chosen a representative sample of fatality curves that present a clear, extended second region of accelerated growth, which can be unmistakably associated with a second wave of COVID-19 infections. We have furthermore been careful to avoid including mortality data that may be attributed to possible third or subsequent waves. With these goals in mind, we have analysed the COVID-19 fatality curves for ten selected countries, namely: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Serbia, and US. As discussed before, for some of countries we have included data only up to a maximum earlier date in 2020, so as to exclude third-wave effects; while for others we have include data up to the present time (up to January 2021), because in such cases the second wave of infections is still developing as of the time of writing. (We remark parenthetically that our model can in principle be extended to include any number of subsequent waves, but this requires greater numerical effort, and so this task will not be pursued here; see below for further discussion on this topic.)In the left panels of Figs. 3-5, we show the cumulative number of deaths (red circles) attributed to COVID-19 for the selected countries, as a function of time counted in days since the first death in each country. Also shown in these figures are the corresponding best fits (black solid curves) by the two-waveAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.In the right panels of Figs. 3-5 we show the daily numbers of deaths for the selected countries, where the red circles represent the empirical data and the black solid curves correspond to the time derivative of the theoretical curve C(t) predicted by the two-wave model, as obtained from the fits shown in the left panels of the respective figures. One sees that theoretical daily curves are also in very good agreement with the empirical data. In particular, the model predicts remarkably well the location and general shape of both peaks (in the daily empirical curves) associated with the first and second waves, respectively. It is worth emphasizing that the numerical fits are performed only for the cumulative curves, so that the good agreement between the theoretical daily curves and the empirical daily data represents a further consistency check of the model.As already discussed in the Introduction, a second wave of infections can, broadly speaking, take place in two main different ways. First, a ""standard"" second wave pattern can be said to occur when the epidemic curve re-embarks on a rapid acceleration regime after the first wave of infections had nearly 'died out.' This means that the cumulative curve has reached a near-plateau, before it surges up again. Examples of standard second waves can be seen in Figs. 3-5 for the cases of Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Morocco, and Serbia. Note that the two peaks in the respective daily curves are well separated by a shallow valley, corresponding to the intervening plateau between the two waves in the cumulative curve. In another possible scenario, an ""anomalous"" second wave can develop well before the first wave has significantly subsided, causing the cumulative curve to change trend at some point in time (before it reaches a plateau) and re-accelerate again. In such cases, there is a sort of ""superposition"" of the two effects in the sense that a second wave-like surge appears when the daily deaths (of the first wave) are still relatively high. This implies that the two peaks in the daily cases are not quite far apart, with a relatively high valley between them. Examples of this situation can be seen in Figs. 3-5 for the epidemic curves of Brazil, Iran, Japan, and US.We have seen from Figs. 3-5 that our two-wave model is capable of describing very well the epidemic curves, over their entire range, for both types of second waves described above. Furthermore, our model has the advantage of being able to provide an estimation for the time of occurrence and intensity of the second wave, as discussed below.Although a visual inspection of an epidemic curve can easily reveal when a second wave of infection is likely to be present, estimating more precisely when such resurgence actually begins is not an obvious task. As we have argued in Sec. 3.3, the time t 0 − 2/ρ provides an upper bound for the onset of the second wave. This estimate can be further improved by noticing that the width of the transition region between the first and second waves if of the order of 4/ρ, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Thus, we shall take the time t Figs. 3-5 by a black dot on the respective cumulative curve, where one sees that this parameter does indeed correspond to a good separating point between the first and second waves. Next, we now turn our attention to discussing possible measures for the intensity of the second wave.We recall that the parameter K 1 represents an estimate of the total number of deaths if only the first wave had been present. Similarly, the parameter K 2 is the model prediction for the total number of deaths at the end of the second wave of infections, assuming that a third wave does not occur. Thus, the difference ∆K = K 2 − K 1 can be used to estimate the 'excess of deaths' attributed to the second wave of infections.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.An alternate (and possibly more accurate) measure of the intensity of the second wave, relative to the first wave, can be obtained by considering the corresponding peaks in the daily curve. To this end, we introduce the following measure:where M 1 and M 2 are the maximum values (peaks) of the theoretical daily curves for the first and second waves, respectively. More precisely, we definewhere t i is the location of the peaks, i.e.,C(t i ) = 0 and ... C(ti) < 0, with dots denoting time derivative. The values of γ for the selected countries are also shown in Table 1 . Among the countries that have experienced a standard second wave (Australia, Austria, Italy, Germany, Morocco, and Serbia), only Italy has a second wave of approximately the same severity as the first wave, as measured by the ratio γ; while for all the others the second wave was considerably more intense. This observation, i.e., that in a standard second-wave scenario the second peak of infections tend to be stronger than the first one, can perhaps be explained as follows: once the first wave was nearly controlled, the enforced or voluntary or control measures might have been relaxed (or not adhered by the population with the same zeal), leading to a stronger peak in the second wave. In contradistinction, for countries where the second waves happened in an anomalous way, in the sense explained above, the majority of them (Brazil, Japan, and US) had a relatively less severe second wave, with only Iran showing a more intense second wave. Since by the time of the upsurge of an anomalous second wave, the first wave has not been significantly diminished, it is reasonable to expect that in such cases many of the control measures were likely to be still in place or had only been moderately relaxed, which may explain the lower peak of the second wave. In other words, as health officials and the population in general were still facing a relatively high rate of infections owing to the first wave, it could have been easier in this case to avoid a stronger follow-up wave. As we mentioned in Sec. 3.4, for some of the selected countries (e.g., Iran, Japan, Morocco, Serbia, US) a third regime of strong re-acceleration has occurred subsequently to the maximum time considered in this study. An example, for illustrative purposes only, is shown in Fig. 6 for Serbia, where one clear sees three distinct waves of infections of increasing intensity. In the present analysis we have not included mortality data that may be attributed to third-wave effects, as mentioned above. Notwithstanding, it should be noted that our model could in principle be extended to include such multiple waves by considering time-dependent parameters of the following form:where N indicates the number of infection waves. As the total number of parameters grows linearly with N, the numerical task of fitting a N-wave model to a given empirical curve becomes quite challenging, specially considering that the total number of points in an empirical epidemic curve is relatively small (typically of the order of a few hundreds). Nonetheless, this interesting prospect deserves further investigation and is topic of ongoing research.In this paper, we have studied the dynamics of the second waves the infections by the novel coronavirus.To this end, we have introduced a generalised logistic model with time-dependent parameters to analyse the COVID-19 fatality curves of several countries from six continents. Not only the theoretical curves are in excellent agreement with the empirical data for all cases considered, but they also allow us to infer predictions about the location and severity of the secondary waves. For instance, we have verified that the intensity of a standard second wave (i.e., one that follows after the first wave has nearly subsided) tends, in its majority, to be considerably stronger that the first wave, as measured by ratio between the respective peaks in the daily number of deaths. Contrarily, in the majority of countries that experienced an anomalous second wave (i.e., where the resurgence of infections takes places while the first wave was still developing), the peak of the second wave was less intense than that of the first wave.We have argued that the behaviour described above might be due to the possible relaxation of control measures by government and health officials or lack of adherence to them by the respective populations. In other words, a sort of ""prevention paradox"" might be at play here, whereby early success in controlling the first wave of COVID-19 might lead to a false impression that ""the worst was behind,"" thus stimulating a relaxation of voluntary or enforced measures beyond what would be desirable. By the same token, in countries where a recrudescence of infections happened when the daily rates of deaths were still relatively high, so that more stringent control measures were possibly still in place, such an anomalous second wave would tend to be less severe. Of course, the severity of the secondary waves of infections is not only determined by their time of occurrence, as the dynamics of an epidemic at any stage depends considerably on the specific responses adopted by the affected populations. Furthermore, we have analysed only ten representative countries, as our main objective here was to introduce and validate our second-wave model. Nevertheless, we expect that the trends identified here should hold in general.The results reported in the present paper are relevant both from a mathematical viewpoint, in that they show that additional care is needed when modelling multiple-wave epidemics, and from a practical perspective, for they may help policymakers and health authorities in devising strategies to battle the disease during all of its waves. Here we have restricted our analysis to second-wave effects, but our model can in principle be extended to include multiple waves. This interesting possibility is currently under investigation.",Brazil,first author,2021-02-03,02
10de116da65455776cda4299a8bf092d40cc0fdd,Associations between movement behaviors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, has affected millions of inhabitants in the world in many different ways (1) . The Latin American region has had devastating consequences in terms of mortality and the spread of the disease in 2020, being one of the most affected areas in the world during the first wave. Chile accumulated 13,944 deaths from March until October 27 th 2020, placing the country seventh in the world with 74.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants due to COVID-19 (2) . One of the most common measures to control the spread of the disease was the introduction of mobility restrictions (i.e., lockdown) and physical distancing in the population. Despite their relevance, these measures have affected a wide range of everyday life dimensions such as work, education, transport, recreation and household activities (1, 3) . A large proportion of adults faced financial struggles due to job losses or suspensions, while children and adolescents experienced changes in their education, have had limited their social interactions and less access to school-based social services beyond education, such as food and health care (3, 4). These multiple challenges have likely had a negative impact not only on people's physical health but also on their psychosocial well-being (5). Stress and social isolation are factors that affect mental and brain health (6), conditions that may be aggravated in families suffering health and economic hardships during the pandemic. Studies have shown increases in the rates of stress, depression and anxiety in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic (7-10). Children, particularly those under the age of five, are not exempt from consequences of the pandemic (11, 12). They are among the most vulnerable groups since they are more likely to rely on others (parental, family, peer or institutional support) to cope with these challenging circumstances (7, 13, 14) . In Spain and Italy, most parents (87.5%) reported emotional and behavioral changes in children, and three out of four parents reported feeling stressed (15) . During the initial stages of the pandemic in these countries, children experienced more struggles in concentrating (76.6%), and were more irritable (39.0%), restless or nervous (38.0%), manifesting symptoms of loneliness (31.1%) (15) . In China, children aged 3-6 were more likely to show clinginess and fear that family members may be sick due to COVID-19 compared with older children (16). Mental health symptoms usually appear in childhood and then continue into adolescence (17) (18) (19) . It may be expected to observe emotional and behavioral changes as a reaction of an adverse event like the pandemic, but these changes may also be affected by the caregivers' responses (20-23). Studies have shown that toddlers' and preschoolers' behavioral problems and hyperactivity were associated with their parents' mental health (24). A longitudinal study has also shown that ""proximal risks"" (most immediate in time or close in context to the child) such as family grief/illness events, harsh discipline, maternal emotional distress, overinvolved/protective parenting, have the most considerable effect on externalizing (behaviors) and internalizing (emotions) symptoms of mental health in preschoolers (20). These potential risk factors may be exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic as most families are suffering a contextual change that is transforming family dynamics. However, even 12 months after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is limited evidence about emotional responses in toddlers and preschoolers and how these are associated with their parents' feelings or behavioral responses, particularly in Latin America. Movement behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep) in children have suffered during the pandemic (25), with the potential of affecting diverse areas of health and development (26, 27) . Physical activity in preschoolers has been positively associated with quality of life related to psychosocial health (28) and with sociability (29). A longitudinal study has shown that exposure to prolonged screen time at 6 months of age was a predictor of emotional and behavioral problems at the age of 4 years (30). Similarly, another study showed that those who did not meet WHO Global screen time recommendations (i.e., more than 1hour of screen time per day) had more emotional problems (i.e., externalizing and internalizing) compared with preschoolers who met the recommendations (31). Shorter sleep duration has been associated with poorer emotional regulation (32). In general terms, evidence suggests that the more guidelines children met, the more benefits they may obtain (31, 33). Using a socioecological perspective, we 3 aimed to assess the associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen time and sleep), caregivers' stress, and sociodemographic factors with emotional and behavioral responses in toddlers and preschoolers using a socioecological perspective during early stages of the pandemic in Chile.An online survey for main caregivers of 1-to 5year-old children living in Chile was conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. The study was promoted online using social networks (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram), messaging apps and emails to educational institutions. The inclusion criteria were: 1) living in Chile, 2) being the main caregiver of a 1-to 5-year-old child, and 3) living with the child most of the time before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study presents the results derived from a second survey completed by caregivers who participated in a study which aimed to assess movement behavior changes during the pandemic. All participants gave their online informed consent to participate in the study. The study was approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee at Universidad de La Frontera, Chile (ORD.: 009-2020). The study started two weeks after the Chilean government enforced educational centers closures (March 16th, 2020) due to COVID-19 and finished on April 27 th , 2020 when educational centers were still closed at a national level. Data were collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) hosted at the Universidad de La Frontera (34).The emotional changes during early stages of the pandemic were measured with questions developed for the context in COVID-19 pandemic. The emotions included in the study were selected from those commonly reported in the literature and used in questionnaires such as the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (35) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (36). The main caregivers answered the following question for ten emotions or attitudes: ""During the last time in the context of the coronavirus pandemic (lockdown or isolation) the child has been/had more: affectionate/ restless/ aggressive/ irritable/ temper tantrums/ frustrated/ worried/ sad/ sensitive/ afraid?"". Each question had a Likert-type response options in a 5-point scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly agree), with an additional option for ""not applicable"". The questionnaires were piloted in a small sample of caregivers before its official launch to assess pertinence, readability and understanding of the items. The questions related to emotional changes had a good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.88). The questionnaire is included in the supplementary files.Caregivers were also asked to estimate total physical activity, screen time, sleep duration on a typical day before and during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep quality both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was asked using a scale from 1 to 7 in which a higher score indicated better quality. These questions were adapted from previously tested questions from the International Study of Movement Behaviors in the Early Years (SUNRISE study, www.sunrisestudy.com) to capture the the unique features of the pandemic (37, 38). The changes in these behaviors during early stages of the pandemic were calculated using a residualized change score approach to eliminate auto-correlated errors and regression towards the mean.(39, 40) Thus, first, each behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic was regressed on the behavior before the COVID-19. Then, the residualized change score (i.e., trend) for each behavior was estimated as each participant's standardized residual score. A positive residualized change score indicates an increase in the specific behavior from the time before COVID-19 and a negative score indicates a decrease. Mean (standard deviation, SD) and proportions were used to describe the participants' characteristics.Comparisons between participants' characteristics and outcomes by sex were performed using t-tests and chi-squared test. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. All models were mutually adjusted individual, caregivers, family, home and geographic characteristics describe above. All data were analyzed using Stata 15.1 (StataCorp LLC, USA). P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant (tested 2-sided).To our knowledge this is the first study in Latin America that has reported the impact of the pandemic on emotions and behaviors among toddlers and preschoolers. This study has shown that a large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several variables were consistently associated with emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers such as child's age, changes in movement behaviors in the child, caregivers' age, caregiver's irritability, and residential area. Some family and home characteristics such as family income and number of inhabitants per home were also associated with emotional changes but less consistently than the other factors. The presence of lockdown was inversely associated with children being more sad and afraid.Our study showed that during early stages of the pandemic child's and caregiver's characteristics were more consistently associated with emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers than family, home and geographic characteristics. As shown in other studies (28-32), physical activity, screen time and sleep duration and quality were associated with emotions in children, highlighting the importance of ensuring opportunities to maintain healthy movement behaviors. These results capture early stages of the pandemic, therefore, some of these associations may have changed as the mobility restriction measures to control the spread of the virus were maintained during the development of the year 2020. The rapid affectation of healthy movement behaviors and the stress associated with this context may have negative effects not only in the emotional but also cognitive development in children (42, 43) . In line with international recommendations (26, 44), these findings suggest that healthy movement behaviors should be a key component in actions designed for enhancing psychosocial health in early childhood and prevent other deleterious effects of the pandemic.Among the caregiver's characteristics, the study showed associations between caregiver's irritability, tiredness and difficulties to concentrate with changes in most child's emotions and behaviors. Similarly, during the pandemic, other studies have reported how parental distress has been associated with children's emotions and behaviors (45, 46). During the first months of the pandemic, our results show that changes in working conditions for the caregivers due to the pandemic were not associated with emotional responses in children, but this may have changed as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed. A number of family and home characteristics were associated with emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers, highlighting the importance of the emotional support or interaction that children receive from their caregivers. These findings reinforce the need for implementing supporting strategies for caregivers as most of them reported increases in emotional stress, and it is likely to be maintained or worsened (47). However, programs should be supportive not only at individual level but also through comprehensive approaches in which communities, employers and decisionmakers should understand and empathize with caregivers (mainly women in Chile). A model similar to that used in the ""Sistema Distrital del Cuidado"" (District system of care in English) in Bogotá (48), Colombia, that was not developed during COVID-19 pandemic, may be used as a starting point as it focused on providing opportunities for reducing the burden of care, particularly in women, while offering educational and health care activities, among others, for the users.We acknowledge that more factors may contribute to the emotional and behavioral changes during the pandemic. However, strategies to mitigate the negative socioemotional issues derived from the pandemic should include multilevel approaches for promoting more physical activity, less screen time and more and better sleep quality (25, 58). Policies must consider toddlers and preschoolers in their design and impact assessment due to a year in pandemic in the life of them is expected to have more considerable impact on their future development than in adults (43, 58, 59). More extensive efforts are required to manage the collateral effects of the pandemic on mental health as a recent report from WHO showed that a large proportion of member states have mental health and psychological support plans, but only about a fifth of them have secured additional funding for covering the activities (1).Our study has explored the emotional and behavioral changes in toddlers and preschoolers using a socioecological perspective, including the main caregiver's distress (most of them women). This is critical in a pandemic context in which supporting networks (educational community, childcare services, families, friends, etc.) are limited and caring responsibilities rely on fewer individuals. Although this was a cross-sectional study, under the circumstances of a natural experiment, we have provided evidence on a topic that is not frequently explored in the area of movement behaviors, which is mainly focused on physical health (60). However, there are limitations in our study. The cross-sectional design of the study limits causality. Also, the selfand proxy-reports used in this study may have been affected by different sources of bias such as recall or social desirability. Our study may have recruited caregivers who would have been more concerned regarding their family's health, including emotions and movement behaviors, affecting the composition of our sample. Although we used commonly used and freely available social networks to recruit participants throughout the entire country, the final sample was not entirely representative. The sample was more educated than that observed in the census for the same age group, but it was comparable in terms of dwelling type and living area (41). We recruited a large sample, but unfortunately for this section of this study only 55% completed the questionnaire, but the characteristics of the sample of the current study were not different from those who completed the section on movement behaviors (25). The lower participation can be explained as people may be more reluctant to provide personal information through online methods compared with face-to-face methodologies. We used the best possible option to measure the variables included in the study as strict health and ethical restrictions were mandated during the early stages of the pandemic (61), limiting, for example, the use of accelerometers or other instruments that may have required contact with volunteers. To overcome some of these limitations, ongoing studies should explore longitudinal associations between different exposure variables and mental health outcomes.The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

9202bcd794ad34e1536c38e6fe506ab4f28131d7,Spatial pattern of COVID-19 deaths and infections in small areas of Brazil,"The COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be a challenge that is capable of impacting public health in all countries of the world with outcomes hitherto unimaginable. However, for several reasons, including political and economic reasons, some countries, like Brazil, have faced additional difficulties in controlling the pandemic. Brazil has become the new epicenter of this disease [1] as a result of the actions of many local authorities who disregarded WHO recommendations and did not implement strong measures such as population isolation, mask wearing, testing and contact tracing [2] [3] [4] .Brazil is characterized by large regional and socioeconomic disparities and high levels of inequality in access to health services. Thus, one may expect these features to impact the country's number of infections and deaths from COVID-19 at different levels across regions of the country. Additionally, at the onset of the pandemic, there was a positive correlation between deaths and infections rates in a few cities in the southern part of the country [5] , but recently, the disease has also spread through less developed areas of the country [6] [7] [8] [9] . Besides health disparities, there are three components that need to be considered when studying the pattern of COVID-19 in Brazil. First, mortality rates are marked by a considerable age gradient, that is, the number of deaths is significantly higher among the elderly and, consequently, the population age structure is important for understanding the spread and the risk of mortality across areas [10] [11] [12] . Second, the number of deaths is significantly higher among males [13] . We hypothesized that since women give more attention to issues affecting their health, this could have a positive impact on mortality risk. In addition, women are the majority of informal workers, domestic workers and the unemployed [14] , that is, they are also more directly affected by the lockdown imposed in many parts of the country. Finally, as is the case elsewhere, pre-existing health problems or comorbidities seem to increase mortality risk in the population [12, 15] . Some studies have shown that mortality is significantly higher in population strata that present any history of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or obesity [12, 16, 17] . The combination of these three components-age structure, comorbidities and sex-may also play a role in the final number of deaths.In this paper, we used publicly available data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health to estimate infection and mortality rates from COVID-19 in small-areas, taking into consideration the population age structure and sex distribution, and the level of income inequality across regions. We accounted for the number of intensive care units (ICUs) and number of physicians available in each municipality in order to consider the possible relationship with cases and deaths from COVID-19. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model for the 558 micro-regions of Brazil, based on data available at the end of July. Estimates at the local level are very important to develop proper public health interventions and evaluate the impact of the pandemic. An important caveat is that we used information on cumulative infections and death counts on a specific date. We did not control for the period in which the pandemic started in each area of the country, but we used the most recent data available to investigate how the pandemic has spread across the country. In addition, in using the cumulative count of cases and deaths in municipalities that had counts, we assumed that other municipalities had zero counts as of the date the first cases were recorded. This explains why, in the case of mortality, we used a zero-inflated Poisson model, since no death was recorded in many of the municipalities as at the time of the study. Notwithstanding, we observed that areas where the pandemic spread later went on to report significant increases and are rapidly catching-up, in terms of cases and mortality, to the areas that began to experience the pandemic first.We use public available data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil, DATASUS, available at https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/casos-nacionais [18] . Since 2009, there has been a system of surveillance for Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that tracks influenza, SARS and other respiratory illnesses across the country. The system incorporates recent information on COVID-19 deaths and infections at the municipal level (defined as a single political boundary), the smallest geographical aggregation of the country. In addition, data on intensive care unit (ICUs) and number of physicians available in each municipality in 2019 were extracted from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), which is also publicly available (https://mapasinterativos.ibge.gov.br/covid/saude/). Noronha et al [19] show that the number of health care beds in Brazil is about half of what is observed in OECD countries. Moreover, the spatial distribution is very unequal across the country. According to their analysis, the regions with lowest supply are concentrated in Amazonas, Pará, Roraima, Minas Gerais and Ceará. The supply of ICUs is also very unequal across the country, with most of regions in the North and Northeast showing the lowest supply of tertiary care, which is highly concentrated in the state capitals.Due to instability in the numbers of cases and the size of the exposed population, we aggregated the municipality information into 558 microregions, as defined by the Brazilian National Statistical Office (IBGE). These geographical areas are aggregated according to regional and socioeconomic similarities, which provide a good benchmark to compare spatial distribution of COVID-19 disease across the country.We collected the information on July 20th, when Brazil had registered 77,226 deaths in this database and a total of 1,795,054 infections. There were 45,013 deaths of males and 32,213 of females-a male/female ratio of 1.39. For infections, there is a different picture, a male/female ratio of 0.89, with 846,744 and 948,310 infections for males and females, respectively.We used a Bayesian formulation of a spatial autoregressive model (SAM), suitable for smoothing and stabilizing spatial estimates, to study the spatial pattern of the infections and mortality [20] .The observed count of cases Y i in area i is modelled using a Poisson distribution with mean E i θ i , where E i is the expected count of cases and θ i is the relative risk in area i. The relative risk (θ i ) quantifies whether an area has a higher (θ i >1) or lower (θ i <1) risk than the average risk in the standard population. In the case of mortality, because of the large number of zeros recorded in most of the study areas, a zero-inflated Poisson model was considered appropriate. If Y i~P o (E i θ i ), i = 1,. . .n, then the relative risk (θ i ) can be modelled through a log link function such thatWhere α is the overall risk in the study areas, (u i +v i ) is an area random effect, such that u i models the spatial dependency between the relative risks and v i is an unstructured exchangeable component that models uncorrelated noise, such that v i � Nð0; s 2 v Þ, while γ i is a function assumed for the age categories. The functions f(icu) and f(phy) are smooth functions assumed to model the possible nonlinear effects of number of ICUs and number of physicians. The structured spatial component was considered through the conditional autoregressive (CAR) distribution, which smooths the risks of certain neighbourhood structures, considering two areas neighbours if they share a common boundary. The prior is specified as:represents the set of neighbours and n d i is the number of neighbours of area i. The unstructured component v i was considered as independent and identically distributed normal with zero mean and variance d 2 v . The functions γ i , f(icu), and f(phy) were modelled through a random walk of order 2 prior, and γ i was also considered as a linear effect and modelled together with the intercept using Gaussian priors with mean 0 and precision 0.001.The Bayesian inference was determined using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) [21] , as implemented in the R-INLA package [22] . For each of cases and mortality we considered four models for each gender by varying the forms and terms in model 1 and compared model performance through the deviance information criterion (DIC) and Watanabe information criterion (WAIC), where the model with the lowest value for each of the criterion is considered the best. Results reported are based on the best model.In addition to the spatial analysis, we performed a decomposition analysis to investigate the possible effects of population age structure on mortality and infections. Thus, we sought to analyze the contribution of this factor on possible regional differences in the risks of death and infection across the regions [23] .We decomposed each difference in mortality and infection risk between two regions based on Kitagawa's [24] formulation:Where, R 2 and R 1 are the overall risks of an outcome in populations 2 and 1, and i is the category of predictor variable, age. P 2i and P 1i are the proportion of population 2 and 1 in category i of the predictor, and R 2i and R 1i are the risks of the outcome in population 2 and 1 in category i of the predictor. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246808.g001 but increase steadily with age. Though, on average, the relative risks for all the microregions are below one unit across the age groups, the Fig 1 reveals that from the 40-44 age group on, there are several regions standing as outliers, where the risks are above one, and this is more pronounced for individuals aged 80 years and above. These patterns of risks are observed for males and females, but mortality risks for males are greater than for females across all ages. increase. This is because only few municipalities have large numbers of ICUs and physicians. As evident from the plots, the number of ICUs appears to have little or no effects on infection for both sexes, as the estimates are about zero. For number of physicians, the results show slight rise in infections as the number of physicians becomes greater than 3500, especially for males. In the case of mortality (Fig 3) , the posterior mean estimates are about zero for both variables, indicating minimal effects on mortality from COVID-19 in the municipalities of Brazil.Figs 4 and 5 show the spatial distribution of the posterior means for relative risks for mortality and infection from COVID-19, respectively. The findings from the spatial analysis are not reported in the conventional 5-year age groups, but are instead in three large age groups (0-39, 40-59, and >60 years). We adopt these age ranges because our estimates show that the likelihood of death is quite small for individuals under 40 years of age, but increases slowly up to age 60 and then rises exponentially. Additionally, the age pattern of the relative risks of infection follows a structure different from those of mortality, peaking between the ages of 20-54 years old, a result similar to the findings of another study [13] (data not shown). To use the same scale of comparison for deaths and infections, we opted to present all spatial analyses using these age groups. In general, the results show that the relative risks for mortality (Fig 4) by microregion and sex are remarkably higher for older adults. Similar spatial patterns are observed for males and females. There are few distinctions in the geographical distribution of the risks of deaths between males and females across the age groups. From children to young adults, the relative risks almost do not surpass the value of 0.20 across the microregions. Between the ages of 40 and 59, there were isolated spots of high mortality risk, but in few places around the North Amazon Metropolitan area (Manaus) and in the Northeast coast microregion of Fortaleza (Ceará). These two areas were heavily affected in terms of cases and deaths in the first months of the pandemic [7, 25] .Additionally, in the Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo microregions, located in the Southeast of Brazil, there are spatial clusters of high mortality risks among this age group. This could be expected because, being business and touristic areas, these two locations were the first to report cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the country [7, 25] . Once more, it is important that we take into consideration the time that the pandemic hit a certain location, which may affect its relative risks in comparison with other locations. However, this fact does not entirely compromise our estimates because we also see many other areas in the country that registered much later cases of COVID-19 and they are showing relative mortality risks similar to those of the microregions that present more consolidated data.For the population above 60 years of age, the results indicate additional spatial clusters. There exists a cluster of higher mortality risks that extends from the Southeast part of the country and connects to the Center-West of the country. In addition, North Amazon and the coast of the Northeast regions present a high risk of mortality for the elderly due to COVID-19. One interesting fact is that the highest mortality risks are basically located in Northern and Northeastern coast areas of Brazil, despite the South and Southeast microregions presenting older population age structures [26] , and one would expect that in these last regions overall mortality due to COVID-19 might be higher, but this is not the case, especially in the aged South region of the country. We may speculate that socioeconomic disparities and limited access to health facilities in Northern parts of Brazil play a role in increasing mortality risks among elderly groups in these areas.Using PNS data from 2013, Borges and Crespo [27] show that age is the principal risk factor for comorbidities associated with COVID-19 in Brazil, but sociodemographic variables also have important impacts, generally indicating higher risk for persons in more vulnerable categories, such as those with less schooling and the black and brown population. Their study also shows the prevalence of certain diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure across different age groups and other SES categories.A second important finding is that the spatial pattern of infection risks is also highly concentrated in the North and Northeast of Brazil (Fig 5) . Here, we see a significant contribution of the young adult population to increasing the infection risk in these areas, while in other parts of the country the risk of COVID-19 infection is much lower. In addition to the socioeconomic dimension, the high infection risk in young adult population could explain the higher risk of mortality in these areas as well.We now turn our analysis to the decomposition effects. Fig 6 shows the decomposition of the effects of mortality and infection risks in terms of differences in age compositions and other effects, captured by differences in risks. To facilitate the analyses, we grouped the microregions according to macroregions and selected the region with the highest proportion in the oldest age group (the South), as a benchmark of comparison with the others. This way, we were able to analyze how the age structure affects COVID-19 mortality and infections across the country.Population age structure across regions in Brazil is very different. The population is younger in the North and Northeast and older in the South and Southeast. In 2018, about 10% of the Brazilian population was over 65 years of age, but the variation between Federation Units can range from 13% in Rio Grande do Sul to 7% in Mato Grosso. We cannot directly compare mortality levels from one state and another because it can show the impact of both mortality levels and age structure.The decomposition exercise did not show major differences among females and males, so we describe the findings for both sexes together. In terms of mortality risks, with the exception of the Center-West, the South region has a lower risk of mortality than the other regions. Age composition tends to reduce these differences, especially relative to the younger populations in the Northern and Northeastern regions, but other elements are responsible for increasing the differences in mortality risk between the South and other parts of Brazil.When we looked at infection risks, age composition played a small role in the differences between macroregions. All areas presented a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the South, and many unobserved factors are responsible for these regional differences in the number of cases. This last finding does not exclude the fact that age structure also played an important role in the spatial pattern of infection, as we saw in the previous estimates disaggregated by microregions.The population is younger in many microregions of the North and Northeast, but in these regions, the highest overall mortality rates are presented, when we control for population age structure. We also found that these areas, even before the pandemic, presented greater risks of general mortality and did not have good health infrastructure [9, 28] .In most countries, we do not have only one COVID-19 outbreak going on. There are several differences across regions in the rhythm and stage of the outbreaks [29] . Thus, it is very relevant to investigate the patterns in infections and mortality across different regions of a socioeconomically diverse country like Brazil [30, 31] . One important issue is the limitation regarding COVID-19 data in the country due to the lack of adequate testing and reporting. In this study, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate rates of infection and mortality from COVID-19 based on the microregions of Brazil, taking into account the population age structure and sex distribution, and controlling for the number of ICUs and physicians available to the municipalities as well as the levels of socioeconomic inequality commonly expressed in regional diversity. Overall, our results suggest a different spatial pattern between the risks of death and the relative risks of infection for both sexes. While the relative mortality risks by microregion and sex are remarkably higher for older adults, particularly for men, the relative risks for infections are concentrated among young adults, being proportionally higher among women. However, mortality risks are much greater for males than females.The number of ICUs and physicians appear to have only minimal impact on infection and death from COVID-19 in the municipalities of Brazil. A possible explanation for these unexpected findings could be that, in most cases, the number of these facilities is proportional to the population of the municipalities, such that crowded municipalities would have a higher number of ICUs and physicians. Noronha et al. [19] discuss the distance from each city to a main health care hub and show that regions in the North and Northeast have the longest distance to a city with an adequate offer of ICU beds. Also, Pereira et al. [32] show that there is a large variation in access to health care in Brazil. The access to ICUs varies across cities and regions and is much lower in poorer areas.We find that almost all the regions in the North and a good number of the microregions in the Northeast coast appear to be at a disadvantage in terms of the overall risk of mortality, when compared to the Southeast and South regions of the country. These are important points to be considered when coping with COVID-19, a disease that is more severe in older populations. Even with a younger demographic, many locations in the North and Northeast have higher overall mortality rate, which could be due to worse health conditions overall. In addition, these areas also present a great number of infections. In spite of the protective factor of a more youthful population, the microregions of the North and Northeast of the country have higher mortality rates due to age for certain causes of death that can accentuate the risks of complications from COVID-19 [33, 34] .For instance, Baptista and Queiroz [35] observed a rapid increase in mortality from cardiovascular diseases between 2001 and 2015 in the Northern and Northeast parts of the country, whereas in the South and Southeast they found a steady decline. Overall, they also show that in approximately 75% of Brazilian microregions, men have higher mortality rates than women. The North and Northeast regions are the least developed socioeconomically regions of the country and have mortality rates higher than the others. Previous studies show that less developed areas have seen the fastest rate of increase in mortality from cardiovascular diseases in recent years. Finally, diabetes mellitus affects mainly women. In approximately 78% of Brazilian micro-regions, mortality rates are higher for women than men. However, the spatial distribution suggests that, for males, this cause is more heterogeneous when analyzing the country as a whole. Spatial analysis also shows that, for both men and women, there is a concentration of high rates of mortality from diabetes in regions of the North and Northeast of the country.The Northern and Northeastern regions are the least socioeconomically developed regions of the country and have higher mortality rates than the others. França et al. [34] also show that mortality rates and prevalence of diabetes are concentrated in this region of the country [26, 36] . The population is younger in many microregions of the North and Northeast, but that is where the highest overall mortality rates are presented when we control for population age structure. We also found that these areas, even before the pandemic, presented greater risks of general mortality and did not have good health infrastructure [9, 28] .This scenario, combined with the weakening of measures to deal with the pandemic, such as the measures indicated by the WHO, are elements that need to be considered in mitigating possible future short-and medium-term regional impacts of this pandemic. There are certain areas that, even before the pandemic, already presented greater risks of general mortality, due to lack of good healthcare infrastructure, a large share of the population that needs emergency assistance from the government, and elderly people with comorbidities who are not practicing social isolation, even at the moment of the greatest spread of the pandemic. Populations in these areas are exposed to greater risks of collapse in the healthcare system and can give rise to a considerable increase in the number of deaths from COVID-19 [9] .Conceptualization: Everton Emanuel Campos de Lima, Ezra Gayawan, Emerson Augusto Baptista, Bernardo Lanza Queiroz.

26a99652bbc59ce639d8e9f80c8d1b3389df5e44,,"This work aims to confirm previous forecasts reported on May, 2020 [1] for the expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic in S. Paulo, the most populated Brazilian city with its 12.2 million inhabitants. It confirms all forecasts previously reported for the evolution of infected people and fatalities associated to this epidemic outbreak in town. The city of S. Paulo was selected once the first patient in Brazil was tested positive there. Since then, by January 12, 2021, were officially confirmed in Brazil 8.2 million cases with 205 thousand deaths, and in S. Paulo city 424,252 cases, and 16,208 deaths. Before the beginning of vaccination, the worldwide response to the pandemic has been the introduction of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) as mitigation policies. Regarding predictions, epidemiological models are commonly stochastic, diffusive-spatial, network based, with heterogeneous sub-populations (metapopulation approaches) [2, 3, 4] . However, the parameters of compartmental models are more directly related to and interpretable as physical processes [5, 6] . On the other hand, deterministic models impose restrictive analysis, once the dynamics of the host population and the virus are not deterministic. The population has free will, and the virus undergoes ""random"" mutations [7, 8] .The primarily intent of this work was to build a simple epidemiological tool to predict and confirm the main results for the basic dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemic breakout in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil.The compartmental SEIR model ( Fig. 1) represents one of the most adopted mathematical models to characterize an epidemic dynamics, and to predict possible contagion scenarios. The SEIR model can be useful to assess the effectiveness of various measures, such as social distancing, lock-down, mask wearing, closing public areas, among others. The model is based on a series of dynamic ordinary differential equations that consider the amount of the population subject to contagion, the trend over time of individuals who get exposed, recover after infection, and the individuals who unfortunately die. The coefficients of the equations represent the ratios of variation over time of different compartments, i.e., susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and dead. These coefficients have often been considered as constants. However, as constants they cannot take into account external influences, such as the NPIs, as social distancing, mask wearing, lockdowns, closed public places, or the possible change in health conditions of infected individuals due to pharmacological development. In this approach, a timedependent model parameter is introduced. It was assumed the infection rate time-dependent, considering that the number of contacts between people, during NPIs, changes proportionally to their overall mobility.Enforced NPIs in the city of S. Paulo reduced the growth of infected after the third week (March 22, 2020). Additionally, the fatality rate  was set constant, which is an oversimplification not supported by data. The compartmental model and methodology used in this work was presented with additional details in a previously publication [1] . A first series of available published data from March 1st to May 31 st , 2020 was initially considered to estimate the epidemiological parameters that govern the selected perpetuity.A key parameter in deterministic transmission models is the basic reproductive number R o , which is quantified by both, the pathogen and the particular population in which it circulates. Thus, a single pathogen, like the SARS-CoV-2, will have different R o values depending on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of the population experiencing the outbreak. Accordingly, R(t)=ψ(t).R o becomes dependent on the NPI policy ψ(t). The effectiveness of those NPIs may be quantified by a social distancing factor defined as SD = 1 -ψ(t), as previously reported [1] . The analysis of a time-varying reproductive number R(t) is applied to forecast the consequences of releasing the NPIs over specific periods of time. Adding to model a time-varying fatality rate (t) by data fitting to the first 90 days after March 1st, 2020 Regarding data on daily new cases and fatalities, due to a large data scattering, a smoothing data formula using a Gaussian Kernel Method -Equations (1) and (2) This basic assumption leads to an overestimation of the first estimated peak of confirmed cases and fatalities. The presence of a second wave becomes evident by the data and model predictions presented by Fig. 5a and 5b . Surprisingly or not, the previous publication reported on the presence of a second peak months after the first one. As mentioned before, the predicted number of infected individuals within the second peak was estimated to be lower compared to the first one.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-10,02
e80c50809b527d4d517bfd37ae5ee4e478da18cf,Journal Pre-proof The COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to weaken environmental protection in Brazil The COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to weaken environmental protection in Brazil,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts on the environment. An unexpected consequence of the pandemic, however, is the weakening of environmental regulation and enforcement (but see Corlett et al. 2020) . Across the tropics, deforestation increased between 63% and 136% during the COVID-19 outbreak, as compared to the same period in 2019, probably through relaxed legal enforcement during the outbreak (Brancalion et al. 2020) . The weakening of environmental enforcement is most likely due to the difficulties imposed by COVID-19, but the pandemic can also word as an excuse for ill-intentioned governments. In Brazil, a number of controversial actions by the Ministry of the Environment have occurred since the outbreak started in March 2020.While the weakening of environmental protection in Brazil has been going on since the onset of the current administration (Ferrante and Fearnside 2019; 2020a) , it seems to have intensified during the COVID-19 outbreak.The causal link between the pandemic and the dismantling of environmental protection in Brazil was confirmed by the release, by the Brazilian Supreme Court, of footage of a ministerial meeting that took place in April 2020, as part of an inquiry at the request of the Attorney General's Office on another matter (Spring 2020) . In the meeting, Brazilian actions included weakening environmental legislation and institutions, which legalized deforestation in key ecosystems, reduced environmental standards and law enforcement, and enfeebled Protected Areas' management. The likely consequences of those actions to biodiversity and environmentalconservation are yet to be estimated. Brazil holds a substantial part of the world's biodiversity and tropical forests, playing an important role in regional and global climate stability and, therefore, the consequences of a weakening of its environmental protection are likely to cross the country's boundaries (Fernandes et al., 2017) . The dismantling of environmental protection in Brazil during the pandemic has the potential to intensify ongoing loss of biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and the likelihood of other zoonotic disease outbreaks, and inflict substantial harm to traditional and indigenous peoples (Andreazzi et al., 2020; The Lancet, 2020; Ferrante and Fearnside, 2020a; Gonçalves et al. 2020 ). Here we review the major actions by the Brazilian federal government to weaken environmental protection during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as trends in deforestation and environmental fine during that period.We gathered information: i) on environmental deregulation and easing through a systematic search of all legislative acts published in the Brazilian Official Gazette, the official federal vehicle where all decrees and changes in legislation are published daily (https://www.in.gov.br/web/guest/inicio); ii) on monthly deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon from the Brazil's National deregulating or easing the current environmental legislation. One of the most significant deregulating acts was an order from the Minister of the Environment to reduce protection and provide amnesty for deforestation in the Atlantic Forest (Watanabe, 2020; Brasil, 2020a) , the ecosystem with the lowest original forest cover remaining in Brazil (Souza Jr. et al., 2020) .While the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law (Law No. 12.651/2012) establishes parameters to protect native vegetation in the country, the protection of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest is regulated by a specific and more restrictive law (Law No. 11.428/2006) , which prevails over the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law. The current government questioned this understanding, with a more flexible and weaker interpretation that would have dire consequences to the Atlantic Forest (Brasil, 2020a) . It would result in the amnesty of up to 20,000 km 2 of illegally deforested land, the removal of protection of 110,000 km 2 of currently protected vegetation within islands and mangroves, and inaction on 3,297 km 2 of vegetation in 'permanent preservation areas' that should had been restored (Rosa and Azevedo, 2020) . COVID-19 is also harmful for these areas that need restoration, as one of its more lasting impacts will be economic, restricting the availability of funds, particularly for active restoration that requires tree planting (Zahawi et al. 2020) . The synergism between the changes in the Atlantic Forest Law and the economic cutbacks caused by the COVID-19, therefore, could be disastrous for this already threatened ecosystem. After a campaign by the environmental movement and a lawsuit by the Public Prosecution Service, the order was canceled, but the Brazilian President No. 6446, http://portal.stf.jus.br/processos/detalhe.asp?incidente=5929755).Regarding legislative easing, several acts have postponed deadlines for both the public and the government to abide by different environmental regulations, including: a one-year extension of logging contracts (Brasil, 2020b) , the reduction of Brazil's annual emission targets until the end of 2021 (Brasil, 2020c) , and a two-year extension for fishing boats to adhere to a satellite-monitoring program (Brasil, 2020d) .The National EnvironmentCouncil (Conama) Another way to weakening Ibama and ICMBio is to cut budgets and reduce the infrastructure available for law enforcement operations, especially those against deforestation in the Amazon, which require aircraft support and complex logistics (Brant and Machado, 2020) . The direct consequence is a reduction in the number of fines applied for environmental infractions (Fig. 2) . Usually, there is an increase in the number of fines with an increase in the number of environmental infractions, as seen for Amazon deforestation in 2019 (Fig. 2) . However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite high deforestation rates, the number of fines was reduced by 72%in with no reference to the PLANAVEG or its commission and no indication of any civil societal participation (Brasil, 2020e) .The Brazilian media, scientific community, and civil society, as well as illustrated by the many references to newspaper articles cited here. Since the start of the pandemic, the Brazilian scientific associations have also produced a myriad of repudiation letters, in addition to many publications in important scientific journals calling attention to the issue (e.g. Andreazzi et al., 2020; de Oliveira et al, 2020; Gonçalves et al., 2020; Ferrante et al., 2020b; Sills, 2020; The Lancet, 2020) . Our study is the first to quantify the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the weakening of environmental protection in Brazil.During the COVID-19 pandemic, pressure at the international arena for better environmental performance in Brazil has also been key. In May 2020, the Brazilian photojournalist Sebastião Salgado organized a petition with more than 300,000 signatures, including those of international artists, celebrities, scientists, and intellectuals, calling attention to the possibility of a ""genocide"" of indigenous peoples in the Amazon (Phillips, 2020). PopeFrancis also expressed concern over the consequences of weak environmental protection and a COVID-19 outbreak among indigenous peoples in the Amazon (Blears, 2020) . Amazonian deforestation is not halted, given that European multinational J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f companies were increasingly unable to meet their environmental targets when trading with Brazil (Frost, 2020) .In turn, public pressure has helped to revert a number of acts aimed at weakening environmental protection in Brazil, both before and after the start of the pandemic (e.g. Brasil, 2019b; Brasil, 2020f) . The accumulation of evidence showing that the Ministry of the Environment is committed to weakening environmental protection in Brazil prompted the Public Prosecution Service to request for the dismissal of the Ministry of the Environmental during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in July 2020 (Brasil, 2020g) . On change.org there were nine online petitions asking for his resignation and the hashtag #forasalles (#resignSalles) had 23.7k likes on Instagram by September 2020.The current Federal administration in Brazil took office in January Provides temporary fishing authorization for all fishermen that claim to practice industrial fishing. The authorization comes without any screening or evaluation of the fishermen and their practices.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-05,02
1b415a4626ad7b250598e517876ea417e51b66d7,"A multipurpose machine learning approach to predict COVID-19 negative prognosis in São Paulo, Brazil","Algorithms performance. We analyzed the predictive performance of the algorithms for three negative prognostic outcomes: ICU admission (n = 263, 25.5%), mechanical ventilation (MV) intubation (n = 106, 10.2%) and death (n = 92, 9.4% ).First, we tested the predictive performance of the machine learning algorithms for a specific individual outcome (e.g. death) to get a baseline for comparison. Then, we used observations from patients who had the other two outcomes (in this specific example, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission) to train an aggregated model. In the aggregated model, we tested the performance when predicting the severe outcome not included in training (e.g. death). Finally, we compared the performance of the two strategies (e.g. individual against aggregated models) using the 95% confidence interval of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Table 2 shows the results of the models trained with the aggregated outcomes and the models with a single outcome. Every model, even the ones trained with different outcomes, presented high predictive performance, always with an AUROC over 0.91 in the test set. The individual models presented better AUC compared to the aggregated models when predicting ICU, MV or death with AUROC over 0.959, 0.945 and 0.972 respectively.Despite the individual models being overall better, the difference between the aggregated and individual models were all within the 95% confidence intervals. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the AUROC for each model. The sensitivity and specificity of the machine learning algorithms were also very high, in most cases over 0.8, with an average sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.82.The positive predictive values (PPV) for the aggregated models were higher than the individual models when predicting mechanical ventilation and ICU, reaching 0.398 and 0.729 respectively, while for death there was a decrease to 0.290. This means that two out of three of the aggregated models had higher PPV when predicting which patients would develop severe illness and require hospital resources than the individual models. In Supplementary Table 2 we present the final hyperparameters for each model. Figure 1 presents the prediction density for each individual outcome according to the different training strategies. The results point to a low overlap between negative and positive cases, indicating a good discriminative ability of the algorithms irrespective of the training strategy. Figure 2 presents the top five variables that most contributed to predict a severe outcome in the aggregated models, according to the Shapley values. The variables are ranked according to the contribution for each specific algorithm. The Braden score played an important role in the aggregated outcome algorithms, ranking as the most important predictor in two of the three models. Also, the C-reactive protein and ratio of lymphocytes per C-reactive protein were found to be good predictors, appearing in the top five in all three models. Urea, age, creatinine, and arterial lactate were important for only one of the aggregated models. Previous studies have used machine learning to develop early COVID-19 prognostic models for a specific severe outcome with overall good performance 21,23 , frequently reaching over 0.90 AUROC 26 . We used a different approach, by combining severe outcomes to train algorithms to predict another outcome, in order to test its potential for predicting multiple untrained outcomes. We found that machine learning algorithms were able to predict negative prognostic outcomes with high overall performance for COVID-19, even when the specific outcome was not included in the training of the algorithms. All models presented an AUROC higher than 0.91 (average of 0.92) in the test set, with high sensitivity www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and specificity (average of 0.92 and 0.82, respectively). The results highlight the possibility that high-performance machine learning algorithms are able to predict unspecific negative COVID-19 outcomes using routinely-collected data. The development of multipurpose prognostic algorithms, i.e. algorithms that identify nonspecific outcomes and overall future clinical deterioration, can be used in a large number of situations, especially in the case of complex and unknown diseases that lead to the development of several different negative outcomes. Instead of having to develop a different algorithm for each of the specific outcomes, multipurpose models can provide more comprehensive and clinically relevant information about the risks of future health problems of patients. The algorithms can be embedded in an app for smartphones or in electronic medical records to be used with routinely-collected data to perform simple predictions for each incoming patient, thus supporting screening procedures and decision-making. In the case of developing countries, while the issue of current availability of electronic medical records in poorer areas is still a challenge, in Brazil there have been promising recent advances regarding the use of electronic medical records 27 .Brazil is currently the third country in the world in total number of cases and second in deaths from COVID-19 28 . There is a growing demand in Brazil, and in many other developing countries, for decision support in the allocation of scarce hospital resources, especially in relation to the availability of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators 29, 30 . From a clinical standard, knowledge about immediate risks of negative prognosis can also contribute to the early start of preventive measures and new interventions, and thereby increase patient survival 5, 6 .For every outcome, variable importance analysis identified that age, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, urea and the Braden Scale were usually among the most important. While the age of the patient is widely found to be an important predictor for most negative health outcomes, CRP has been increasingly included among the main inflammatory biomarkers for the prognosis of cardiovascular 31 and respiratory diseases 32 . High levels of CRP have been also previously associated with individual severity of SARS-CoV-2 33, 34 . Interestingly, previous studies have also identified that chronic kidney disease is associated with developing severe conditions in COVID-19 patients [35] [36] [37] , where it has been observed that patients with higher levels of creatinine and urea are more at risk 38 . The Braden Scale is often used as a predictor for pressure ulcers, a common clinical classification scale for predicting pneumonia 39 during clinical reception, and in this study, it was an important predictor for negative prognosis in COVID-19 patients. The scale has a score between 1 (worst score) and 4 (best score) where the factors included are sensory perception, skin moisture, activity, mobility, nutritional status and friction 40 . The percentage of lymphocytes in the blood has been described as a strong predictor of prognosis for the severity of the new coronavirus. A randomized study by Tan et al. 41 suggested that, in most confirmed cases, the percentage of lymphocytes was reduced to 5% in 2 weeks after the onset of COVID-19, in line with other studies findings 42 .The study has a few limitations that need to be mentioned. First, some of the outcomes overlap, which may have helped the performance of the aggregated models, even though in the majority of cases the outcomes were independent. In the case of ICU admission, 55% of the patients did not die or used MV, while in the case of MV and death, 63% and 70% of their respective aggregated model was trained on other outcomes. Ideally, the outcomes would never overlap, but this is clinically unfeasible given the interlaced nature of negative prognostic outcomes. Another limitation is that we analyzed data from an urban COVID-19 hotspot in Brazil, in a period where clinical protocols for the disease were still being established, so this could affect the incidence of prognostic outcomes and may not directly generalize to other periods.In conclusion, we found that machine learning algorithms can predict severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients with high performance, including previously unobserved outcomes, using only routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data. The use of multipurpose algorithms for the prediction of overall negative prognosis is a promising new area that can support doctors with clinical and administrative decisions, especially regarding priorities for hospital admission and monitoring. 43 . Individual patient data was collected from electronic medical records. We included as predictors only variables collected in early hospital admission, i.e. within 24 h before and 24 h after the RT-PCR exam. From a total of 82 routinely-collected variables from the hospital, 57 variables were selected for the development of the predictive models, after removing variables with 90% or higher missing values, highly-correlated variables (above 0.9) and identifying variables such as patient number and hospital identification variables. The flowchart for feature selection is described in Supplementary Fig. 2 and the complete variable list, including demographic data, laboratory tests and vital signs is described in Supplementary Table 1. Figure 3 illustrates the overall process.Five of the most popular machine learning models for structured data (artificial neural networks 44 , extra trees 45 , random forests 46 , catboost 47 , and extreme gradient boosting 48 ) were trained with 70% of the data, and tested in the other 30%, simulating new unknown data. All the results reported in this study are from the test set. K-fold cross-validation with 10 folds was used to adjust the hyperparameters with Bayesian optimization (HyperOpt). Due to the unbalanced nature of the outcomes, random undersampling was performed in the training set, by randomly selecting examples from the majority class for exclusion. This technique was implemented using the RandomUnderSampler imbalanced-learn class 49 .Variables with more than two categories were represented by a set of dummy variables, with one variable for each category. Continuous variables were standardized using the z-score. Variables with a correlation greater than 0.90 (mean arterial pressure, total bilirubin, and creatine kinase) were discarded, and missing values were imputed by the median. To assess the performance of the models, measures such as accuracy, sensitivity (also known as recall), specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) (also known as precision), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score were analyzed. The value of the AUROC was used to select the best model. To understand the individual contribution of each variable to the predictive models, we calculated their respective Shapley values. All the analyzes were performed using the Python programming language with the scikit-learn library.The data comes from electronic medical records from BP-A Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo Hospital in Brazil and it is not publicly available as it contains sensitive information of patients.All the code written to process and analyze the data can be made available upon request to the corresponding author.Received: 19 August 2020; Accepted: 14 January 2021 The algorithm was trained and tested using a combination of two outcomes. The same algorithm was then used to predict the remaining outcome.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-08,02
f320725c0d91893f34d11d3a4be14ef439d1a42d,Liver injury predicts overall mortality in severe COVID-19: a prospective multicenter study in Brazil,"Globally, more than 25 million people have been infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . The clinical presentation of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might range from mild symptoms to critical illness requiring respiratory support including invasive mechanical ventilation [2] . Elevation of aminotransferases has been observed in 14-53% patients with COVID-19 [3] . However, the clinical relevance of liver tests abnormalities has been controversial [4, 5] . Although most studies have showed that liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases of COVID-19 cases [6] , its relationship with mortality has not been clearly demonstrated [7, 8] . In addition, the prognostic value of aminotransferases in predicting severe clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain [9] . Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of aminotransferases levels at hospital admission to predict all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.This prospective multicenter study included patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 26 tertiary hospitals from Brazil between March 10th, 2020 and June 6th, 2020. Adult patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that underwent invasive mechanical ventilation at any point of the hospitalization and had aminotransferases tests available on the first day of hospitalization were included. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs. We excluded patients with conditions that led to an increase in aminotransferases unrelated to liver injury, such as rhabdomyolysis, and those without measurement of aminotransferase levels in the first 24 h of hospitalization. Patients on spontaneous breathing or low flow oxygen therapy at admission were classified as mild presentation and those requiring significant respiratory support at admission (high flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation) as severe presentation of COVID-19.Demographic, clinical, and biological data were collected by trained investigators using the standardized form International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium/World Health Organization Clinical Characterization Protocol (ISARIC/WHO CCP) [10] . Data were entered in electronic case-report forms at Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap, https ://proje ctred cap. org/). Clinical records included comorbidities, disease symptoms, duration of symptoms and vital signs at hospital admission. Laboratory tests were performed at hospital admission and included red and white blood-cells count, platelets count, glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin and INR levels, sodium, potassium and C-reactive protein (CRP). Significant aminotransferases elevation at hospital admission was defined as ALT and/or AST levels higher or equal than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The course of transaminases during hospitalization was assessed. Presence of pulmonary disease was defined as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma; and heart disease as congestive cardiac failure or coronary arterial disease. All patients included in the study progressed to invasive mechanical ventilation at any point of the hospitalization and they were prospectively followed until hospital discharge or in-hospital death.Continuous variables were reported as median (interquartile range, IQR) and/or discrete variables were reported as absolute (n) and relative frequency (%). Comparisons between independent groups were assessed by Mann-Whitney and Chi-square test for quantitative and qualitative comparisons, respectively. The duration of COVID-19 was calculated from onset of symptoms to hospital admission. Additionally, duration of follow-up was calculated from the hospital admission to the date of discharge or death until June 30th, 2020. The clinical and laboratory characteristics at the first day of hospitalization (hospital admission) were considered for baseline. The primary outcome analyzed was the in-hospital all-cause mortality. The mortality rates (deaths per 1000 person-years) were reported. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and the log-rank test was calculated. We used the time to event Cox proportional model adjusted for age and sex to check the hazard-ratio (HR) risk of in-hospital all-cause mortality related to elevated ALT and/or AST levels at hospital admission. A sensitivity analysis stratified by severity of COVID-19 at admission was performed according to the need of respiratory support. The analysis was performed using STATA package, version 15, 2017 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Significance level was determined when p ≤ 0.05 assuming two-tailed tests.During the recruitment period, 936 patients hospitalized with symptoms of COVID-19 were eligible. A total of 126 with negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in naso or oropharyngeal swabs and 26 with missing COVID-19 test were excluded. From 788 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, a total of 382 patients were excluded, mostly due to missing ALT or AST levels at hospital admission. Therefore, 406 patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in this study (Fig. 1) . The median age was 56 years (IQR, 45-65) and 57% were male; 68% had hypertension and 29% had type-2 diabetes. Additionally, the prevalence of pulmonary disease and malignant neoplasm was 7% and 3%, respectively. The top leader symptoms were cough (74%), fever (73%) and difficulty breathing (58%) and the median duration symptoms was 7 days (IQR, 5-10) before admission. Demographic and clinical characteristics at hospital admission are described in Table ] had at least a second ALT and AST measure during follow-up, respectively. The maximal aminotransferases levels were measured from the second to the fifth day of hospitalization in 51% (n = 173 for ALT and n = 170 for AST); from the sixth to the tenth day in 29% (n = 97 for ALT and n = 94 for AST) and after the tenth day of hospitalization in 20% of cases (n = 68 for both). During the follow up, 7% (n = 25) of patients had ALT levels ≥ 5 × ULN. Patients on spontaneous breathing or low flow oxygen therapy at admission were classified as mild admission presentation and those requiring significant respiratory support at admission [high flow oxygen therapy (n = 21), noninvasive ventilation (n = 40) or invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 88)] as severe admission presentation of COVID-19. Pulmonary disease was defined as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma; heart disease was defined as congestive cardiac failure or coronary arterial disease. Missing data (n): pulmonary disease (18), type 2 diabetes (17), malignant disease (19) , fever (14) , cough (12) , sore throat (28), nasal congestion (25), shortness of breath (5), digestive symptoms (24), body temperature (44), pulse (8), respiratory rate (36), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (9), SpO2 (14), hemoglobin (12) , white blood cells (12) , lymphocytes (27), platelet count (13) (Fig. 4 ).The current study highlighted that elevated aminotransferases levels at admission predicted in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with severe COVID- 19 have implications for optimizing management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 since measurement of ALT and AST levels could be useful simple parameters to identify patients at high risk of mortality.Several studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause acute liver injury in mild and critically ill patients with COVID-19 [11] [12] [13] [14] . In general, patients with COVID-19 have mild aminotransferases elevation (1-2 × ULN), although more severe liver injury (2-5 × or > 5 × ULN) might be observed in few patients, especially in those with more severe disease [15] . The prevalence of significant elevated aminotransferases (≥ 2 × ULN) at hospital admission reported in the present study was similar to those previously described [16, 17] .Despite the pathways for liver injury in COVID-19 remains unclear, this might be explained by direct viral infection, high expression of liver angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, muscular injury, presence of steatosis, microthrombosis, and the use of hepatotoxic drugs [18] . Elevation of aminotransferases, especially at hospital admission, seems to be the liver expression of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, patients with elevated ALT and/or AST levels have a significantly higher proportion of signs of COVID-19 severity at baseline (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ). Overall, our findings reinforced the relationship between elevated aminotransferases and severity of COVID-19 from previous studies that evaluated severe and non-severe hospitalized patients [2, 6, 12, 14, 16] . However, few studies have described the correlation between liver injury and mortality, especially in low-to-middle income countries. A recent longitudinal large sample study described the dynamic patterns of aminotransferases levels during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 and reported the relationship between peak values of liver enzymes and mortality adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities [12] . Similarly, Hundt et al. identified an association between mortality and peak AST but not ALT levels [15] . However, these authors did not observe any association between admission aminotransferases and mortality.A low incidence of severe flare of aminotransferases (≥ 5 × ULN) during follow-up was observed in our sample. The peak of ALT or AST levels were not associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with maximal aminotransferases measurement after the fifth day of hospitalization and in those who progressed from aminotransferases levels < 2 × ULN to ≥ 2 × ULN during hospitalization (Supplementary Table 2 ). However, the low sample size and relatively small number of outcomes in those sub-analysis limited the interpretation of these findings. Similarly, Zhou et al. described higher proportion of deaths in patients with abnormal ALT levels at hospital admission compared to those with ALT < 40 UI/L [48% vs 24%; p = 0.002]. This study included 191 hospitalized patients, mostly with severe/critical COVID-19, very similar to our group. However, this was a retrospective study and the authors did not perform a time-dependent analysis [19] .Blood sample parameters, such as CRP, d-dimer, interleukin-6 and procalcitonin levels or lymphocyte count have been used to predict severe outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [15, 16] . However, these tests are costly and might not be available in limited-resource settings. Our study confirmed that simple and worldwide available parameters, such as aminotransferases, could be useful to predict all-cause mortality in severe patients with COVID-19, especially in low-to-middle income countries.We acknowledge that elevation of aminotransferases did not predict in-hospital all-cause mortality in the sub-group of patients with mild respiratory presentation at admission. This finding might be explained by the delay between measurement of aminotransferases at admission and necessity of significant respiratory support during hospitalization in this sub-sample of patients. In the present study, all patients progressed to invasive mechanical ventilation during the hospitalization. However, we only evaluated the prognostic value of aminotransferases levels at hospital admission (day 1) to predict all-cause mortality. Thus, the prognostic value of aminotransferases levels measured closer to progression to significant respiratory support in this sub-sample of mild admission presentation cannot be ruled out.In our study, higher INR levels at admission correlated significantly with increased risk of overall death during hospitalization, as already reported in the literature [20, 21] , but this finding was evaluated in a smaller number of patients and may be influenced by coagulation disorders, so common in patients with COVID-19.The main limitations of the study remain the lack of prior history of chronic liver disease or use of hepatotoxic medications and the relatively high number of patients excluded due to missing aminotransferases levels at hospital admission. Viral hepatitis serologies, history of alcohol intake or co-medications use prior to hospital admission were not available. However, the prevalence rates of chronic hepatitis B and C are low in Brazil [22, 23] and only four patients (1%) included in the present study reported any liver disease at admission. In addition, we considered aminotransferases levels collected at the first day of hospitalization to minimize the impact of long term COVID-19 or any hepatic drug induced toxicity during hospital stay. Another limitation is the absence of body mass index (BMI) information mainly due to poor clinical condition of most patients at admission [304 patients (75%) were admitted on intensive care unit and 29% of them (n = 88) were under mechanical ventilation] leading it difficult for measuring weight and height. To minimize the influence of muscle injury, another cause of aminotransferases elevation, and to avoid misclassification of liver injury in these patients, we excluded persons with rhabdomyolysis (n = 2).The main strengths of the present study rely on the longitudinal study design and the relatively high sample size recruited in multi-tertiary centers in Brazil. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that confirmed the relationship between abnormal liver tests and severe outcomes in Latin America, the current epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic.In conclusion, elevated aminotransferases levels at hospital admission could predict in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19, especially in those with severe disease at hospital admission. The use of these simple and worldwide available parameters can help identify patients with severe COVID-19 at high risk of worse prognosis during hospitalization. The measurement of aminotransferases levels at hospital admission should be integrated into the care of patients with COVID-19.The online version contains supplementary material available at https ://doi.org/10.1007/s1207 2-021-10141 -6.Author contributions FMP: analysis and interpretation of data; drafting and critical revision of the manuscript.

92a27e7c6eae456f27b0c3c84ee15e2dd163c37c,Influence of sex on disease severity in children with COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Latin America,"More than a year after the description of the first cases of COVID-19 in China, several aspects of this pandemic are still unclear. Among these, there is the different clinical impact of COVID-19 in women and men. Early data from China showed that men were more frequently infected by COVID-19 than women, and men with underlying diseases (diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease) developed severe condition with an increased mortality rate (1). Similar findings were reported from Italy and, subsequently, confirmed almost in all countries.Several hypothesis have been postulated to support these differences, although definite conclusions have not reached yet. Disparities in in sex-specific disease outcomes may be due to sex-specific steroids and activity of X-linked genes which modulate the innate and adaptive immune response to virus infection and influence the immune response (2). The sex-related pre-existing comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, can play a role, since they were associated with severe outcomes and are more frequent in men (3). Also, hormonal and genetic factors can affect ACE2 expression, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 (4-6), microRNAs expressions and transcription (7), and Vitamin D3 activity (8).However, if such a differences between sexes is present in the pediatric population has never been analyzed yet. Major pediatric papers mainly focused age as a risk factors of disease severity but, to our knowledge, no sub-analyses assessing sex have been described (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Since sex-hormones or specific habits (alcohol, type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease) are less pronounced in the pediatric population, in particular in infants and young children, such an analyses can provide indirect evidence of influence of hormones on COVID-19. Therefore, we performed this study aiming to understand if sex influenced disease severity and outcomes in a large cohort of latin-american children with COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C).This study is part of an ongoing independent project assessing COVID-19 and MIS-C in Latin American children, already presented elsewhere (12) and with a previous published paper describing an initial group of 409 children with confirmed COVID- 19 (14) . For the current study, we performed a sub-analyses of a previously used dataset (15) aiming to assess the influence of sex on disease severity. The remaining variables are those previously described and included age, gender, symptoms, imaging, underlying medical conditions, need for hospital and NICU/PICU admission, respiratory and cardiovascular support, other viral co-infections, drugs used to treat COVID-19, development of MIS-C and type of organ involvement, and outcome.SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive PCR test on nasopharyngeal swab.MIS-C was defined according to the CDC criteria: An individual aged <21 years (we only included if younger than 18 years) presenting with i) fever, ii)laboratory evidence of inflammation, and iii) evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization, with multisystem (>2) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic or neurological); and iiii) no alternative plausible diagnoses; and iiiii) positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test; or exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.The study was reviewed and approved by the CoviD in sOuth aMerIcaN children-study GrOup Summary statistics were presented as counts and percentages. The association between female sex and COVID-19 clinical outcomes was preliminarily evaluated with crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Confounding adjustment was performed using a propensity score approach based on inverse-probability weighting. More specifically, we considered the following covariates potentially related with the outcomes and unbalanced across males and females: age, pre-existing medical conditions, immunosuppressants at the time of diagnosis, primary or secondary immunodeficiency, chemotherapy over the last 6 months, pyrexia (≥38.0/≥100.4 °C/°F), days between symptom onset and diagnosis, administration of systemic corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, lower respiratory tract infection, and MIS-C diagnosis.Clustered standard errors were used to account for the multicenter design of the study. All data were analyzed using the Stata 15 software (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15.College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). The significance level was set at 5% and all tests were 2sided.The characteristics of the 990 patients included in the study, overall and by sex, are summarized in Table 1 . Among the 484 females, 39 (8.1%) had chest X-ray abnormalities, 124 (25.6%) were admitted to the hospital, 20 (4.1%) were admitted to ICUs, 49 (10.1%) received respiratory support, and 2 (0.4%) died. 24 (5%) were diagnosed with MIS-C. Among 506 males, 53 (10.5%) had chest X-ray abnormalities, 179 (35.4%) were admitted to the hospital, 27 (5.3%) were admitted to ICUs, 69 (13.6%) received respiratory support, and 6 (1.2%) died. 45 (8.9%) were diagnosed with MIS-C.Results of crude and adjusted analysis showing the association between sex and clinical outcomes are shown in Table 2 . Following adjustment obtained with a weighting approach based on propensity scores, the only significant outcome was access to the hospital: girls were admitted less frequently than boys (OR = 0.82, P <0.001).In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of sex on disease severity in a large cohort of Latin American children with COVID-19 and MIS-C. We found that a higher percentage of male children developed MIS-C (8.9% vs 5% in females) and died (1.2% and 0.4% in females), although on multivariate adjusted analyses the only statistically significant difference was found in need of hospitalization, with females less frequently admitted compared with boys (25.6% vs 35.4%).Taken all together, these preliminary data highlight that females can experience a milder disease compared with boys, as suggested in adults. In other reports (6), the females were more affected by hyposmia or anosmia and gustatory dysfunction compared with males; unfortunately, we did not assess this parameters in this study. In our cohort, children had no comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity or type-2 diabetes, therefore this behavioral factors, traditionally more frequent in males, should have not contributed in the described differences. Also, considering that sex hormones may have less impact in children, therefore different microRNAs expressions due to sex-hormones should not be involved as well.An explanation in of disparity in sex-specific disease outcomes can be found in the activity of Xlinked genes, as previously suggested (6), which modulate the innate and adaptive immune response to virus infection and influence the immune response. Also, the male predominance in the COVID-19 pandemic could partially be explained by sex-specific expressions of TMPRSS2 (6).The activity and expression of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), can also explain some differences. Age-related differences have been already reported in a review (16). Also, hormonal and genetic factors could lead to ACE2 over-expression in female sex. Gagliardi et al (6) reported that infection with SARS-CoV induces ACE2 down-regulation through binding of the viral Spike protein to ACE2, thus reducing ACE2 expression in the lung and igniting acute respiratory failure (17) .Vitamin D has also received attention in the immune pathogenesis of COVID-19 (17) and Pagano et al hypothesiezed that the synergy between Vitamin D3 and estrogen could affect the sex differences in the outcome of patients with COVID-19 (18, 19) . However, no rigorous data are yet available on this issues and, in our series, Vitamin D levels have not been reported.Sex may play an important, major role in severity and length of persisting symptoms after the first diagnosis of acute COVID-19. In adults, long covid has been described and it seems more frequent in women (20) (21) . In children, international experts highlighted the possibility of this disease in childhood as well and recent report seemed to confirm that long covid may affect children as well (22, 23) . Considering the autoimmunity has been suggested as a potential pathogenic trigger and the higher frequency of autoimmune disorders in children, the role of sex in long covid, including children, is a priority research topic for the following months.Our study has limitation to address. First, it was not initially developed to specifically address how sex could influence disease severity, therefore the variables included as well the study power was not tailored to this topic. Also, blood tests, hormones and Vitamin D were not tested and therefore not analyzed. Last, there is no a control group of adult patients from the same area to compare sex differences in different age groups. However, this study is the first one specifically assessing the role of sex in children with COVID-19 and MIS-C.In conclusion, we found that a slightly more severe course of COVID-19 and MIS-C in boys compared with women in our cohort of Latin American children. This data are preliminary and need further independent studies to better assess the role of sex. In light of the growing evidence of long covid in children, it is important to begin including sex as an important potential variable of severity or symptoms persistence in children with COVID-19.",Argentina,first author,2021-02-09,02
4925ae67d8ab78bc5c9def2812b56363f5ed74ce,Relative humidity predicts day-to-day variations in COVID-19 cases in the city of Buenos Aires,"Increasing evidence points to aerosols as a main mode of transmission of COVID-19, mostly occurring in indoor environments 1, 2 . Factors such as temperature and humidity can influence the transmission of respiratory viruses, as suggested by studies in laboratory-controlled conditions 3, 4 . The stability of influenza and other viruses in suspended aerosols, mimicking airborne transmission conditions, increases with low temperature and humidity 5, 6 . The exchange of water and heat with the environment also affects the physics of the droplets, determining their fate through deposition or dispersion 7, 8 . In addition, low levels of humidity also affect the immune response of the host, as demonstrated in laboratory animals 9 . Experiments of airborne transmission between animals confirm the overall facilitatory role played by low humidity in this complex chain of events 10 . Since the start of the pandemic, several studies have assessed the relationship between the number of daily COVID-19 cases and meteorological conditions in different regions of the world [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Indoor air conditions are not generally monitored, but widely available outdoor meteorology can be used as a proxy of indoor conditions, albeit mediated by levels of heating and ventilation 3 . Variables such as humidity, temperature, solar radiation, precipitation or wind speed have been found to co-vary with positive cases. These studies have typically taken two approaches. The first is to compare the spread of the disease across geographical regions. In this kind of study, variability in meteorological conditions is attained by including enough spatially distant locations, but differences other than meteorological (e.g., mitigation policies) between locations are a confounding factor. The second approach is to correlate the rising phase (or bursts) of the outbreak on a single location with a number of meteorological variables that might have modulated it. The challenge in this kind of study relates to the fact that many meteorological variables have marked yearly variations, and correlations with an abrupt increase in the number of COVID-19 cases might be spurious, simply reflecting two parallel but independent trends. In addition, the dynamic of local mitigation policies and the response of the population represent confounding elements for this approach. Due to these shortcomings, the question of whether or not meteorology can influence COVID-19 spread is still open, with sensible arguments on both sides 17, 18 .Here we present a long-term study of the influence of meteorological variables on the spread of COVID-19 in the city of Buenos Aires (CBA), Argentina. CBA has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons, and is a useful case study for several reasons. First, over 5% of its 2.9 million inhabitants have suffered from COVID-19 in 2020, as All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Meteorological data corresponding to the station located at the domestic airport (AEP; World Meteorological Organization station number 87582) from January to November, 2020 was obtained from public databases provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, US) 20 and OGIMET (www.ogimet.com). We included as meteorological variables for our study the surface daily mean values of relative humidity (RH), temperature (T), wind speed (WS), pressure (P), precipitation (PP) and sky cover (SC), as well as the surface daily minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) values of hourly temperature. Data on COVID-19 cases (SARS-CoV2 positive PCR tests) in CBA for the same period were obtained from the daily reports by Health Ministry of Argentina, compiled and curated by Sistemas Mapache (github.com/SistemasMapache/Covid19ar Data). Data on the date in which symptoms began, available for only 60% of positive cases, were obtained from the Health Ministry of Argentina open data webpage (datos.salud.gob.ar/dataset). All data were processed through custom scripts written in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Pre-processing In order to study the mid-range dynamics of variability of new COVID-19 positive cases in CBA, avoiding the slow (wave of the pandemic) and fast (day-of-week effects) modulations, we defined the weekly difference of any given variable X(t) as the value taken by this variable on day t minus its value 7 days before:Equation (1) was applied to daily COVID-19 positive cases to obtain DCovid(t) and to its meteorological counterparts (e.g. DRH(t) for relative humidity). To study the relationship between variables we used linear models and the Pearson correlation coefficient, including a potential lag between the day of the meteorological observation and that of the COVID-19 positive case report. Significance for a linear relationship against the null hypothesis of no contribution of a variable was obtained as a p-value through a t-test using the MATLAB function fitlim(). The optimal lag for a given variable was defined as the lag that maximized the significance and the absolute value of its correlation with DCovid(t).Note that the D transformation introduced in Equation 1, while convenient for a number of reasons, has a small disadvantage.Since a given value of RH(t) impacts on both DRH(t) and DRH(t+7), a strong correlation at a given lag is typically mirrored by moderately strong correlations of opposite signs at lags 7 days earlier or later. To avoid any ambiguity, in all cases the optimal lag was determined by the global maximum of significance, regardless of other local maxima. Furthermore, while the D transformation is central to our results, an independent analysis that did not use it (see section 'eventtriggered averages' below), was applied to the same data to confirm the typical size of optimal lags. Optimization of the multivariate linear model Full 10-fold cross-validation of all possible combinations of the 8 meteorological variables (all linear models with a number of variables ranging from 0 to 8) was implemented. For each combination of variables, the data was divided into 10 random subgroups of equal size. Each subgroup was once set aside and used as a test set for the linear model trained with the remaining 9 groups. The one-standard-error criterion was used to choose the best model, defined as the one with fewest variables that had a test sum of squared residuals not higher than the lowest one plus one standard error 21 . All linear combinations of variables were tested, including up to first order interactions, for two variations of the data: a) each variable with its own optimal lag and b) all variables using the optimal lag for DRH.To corroborate the results we repeated the analyses using the MATLAB lasso() function, which implements the choice of the optimal model by penalizing the sum of the absolute value of linear coefficients under the one-standard-error criterion 21 . Event-triggered averages To study the evolution of meteorological variables relative to peaks of DCovid(t) or the evolution of COVID-19 positive cases relative to extreme events of RH, the relevant events were identified, temporal windows of regular size defined around them, and variables averaged by overlapping these temporal windows. The 7-day average of COVID-19 positive cases was used to understand the evolution of cases relative to extreme RH events along these short temporal windows. This evolution was computed as a percentage relative to the value on the day of the event by normalizing the 7-day average for each window by its value on that day.The curve of daily new COVID-19 cases in CBA exhibits a rich dynamic with different scales of temporal evolution ( Figure  1A ). As in many such datasets, fast and slow dynamics are observed. The slow dynamic reflects waves of spread of the pandemic, which in the particular case of CBA took during 2020 the form of a single, slowly modulated wave starting in May and reaching its peak in August. Day-of-week fluctuations (especially weekend vs. weekday differences) drive the fast dynamic, reflecting a multiplicity of factors that presumably range from the number of potentially dangerous social encounters to variations in testing and bureaucratic processing of the data. In addition, a third, intermediate dynamic range is apparent in this dataset, represented by fluctuations with an irregular periodicity in the range of 2-4 weeks. In the present work, we characterized these mid-range fluctuations following the hypothesis that they are at least in part rooted on meteorological conditions. To do so, we applied Equation 1 to all variables. Compared to other methods for filtering out day-of-week fluctuations, such as the 7-day average, this procedure has the advantage of allowing for instantaneous day-to-day fluctuations, without smoothing the variables along the temporal dimension.We first studied the Pearson correlation between DCovid(t) and its meteorological counterparts ( Figure 1B ). Since meteorology is not expected to affect the outcome of positive COVID-19 cases reported on the same day, but rather those reported some days later, lags ranging from 0 to 20 days were included in the analysis. We found that DRH, DT and DTmin had a significant correlation (p < 0.01) with DCovid with an optimal lag of 9 days. The same happened for DTmax with a lag of 1 day, for DWS with a lag of 14 days and for DP with a lag of 15 days. As discussed in the Methods section, some variables exhibited a 7-day periodicity in the p-value curve, a direct consequence of Equation 1, but only the global minimum was considered to determine the optimal lag. Other variables did not exhibit a significant correlation with DCovid(t) regardless of the lag. Of all variables, DRH(t -9days) exhibited the most extreme correlation with DCovid(t) (Pearson correlation: -0.47; t(218): -7.9; p: 2 x 10 -13 ). The evolution of DCovid(t) and negative DRH(t -9 days) was strikingly similar ( Figure 1C) , especially so when considering the numerous confounders expected to mediate a relationship between meteorology and the reporting of COVID-19 positive cases (individual variability in symptomatic response, test processing time or indoor vs. outdoor RH relationship to cite only a few).To understand the relative importance of DRH compared to the other potential predictors, we applied two cross-validation methods (full 10-fold cross-validation and Lasso) to identify the linear combination of 8 meteorological variables (including individualized lags and first order interactions) that best modelled DCovid(t). Both methods led to an identical conclusion, pointing toas the best linear model of DCovid(t), where bX stands for the linear coefficient for variable X.",Argentina,first author,2021-02-01,02

Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, located at 2,630 m above sea level, has an area of 1,623 km 2 and a population of 7,200,000 inhabitants.As of November 1, 2020, Colombia has recorded 1,073,123 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 31,312 COVID-19 deaths, with a CFR (deaths/cases × 100) of 2.9%. The municipalities located below 1,000 m altitude have recorded 442,795 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 16,691 COVID-19 deaths, with a CFR of 3.8%, whereas municipalities located from 1,000 to 3,259 m have recorded 632,410 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 14,621 COVID-19 deaths, with a CFR of 2.3%. Data from < 1,000 m altitude and from ³ 1,000 to 3,259 m were assessed by the Spearman correlation, Pearson correlation, and Poisson regression analysis. Data from Poisson regression analysis were presented as adjusted R 2 with its P-value and included the β coefficient and its P-value.The results after Spearman's analysis showed a significant negative correlation between both SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths and altitude < 1,000 m (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was seen for altitudes between 1,000 and 3,259 m (P > 0.05). The CFR decreased as the altitude of residence increased for both groups (< 1,000 m and ³ 1,000 m) (P < 0.05) ( Table 1) .According to the Pearson correlation, the only significant difference was observed for SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths at altitudes < 1,000 m. However, the slope was close to zero, and biological significance is likely negligible (Figures 1A-F).Poisson regression was performed with only altitude in the model, only population density in a second model, and including altitude and population density in a third model. With only altitude in the model, a positive association was observed between infections and deaths in both altitude groups (P < 0.05). However, the CFR showed a negative association with altitude only in the group living at between 1,000 and 3,259 m (P < 0.05).When only population density was incorporated in the model, more confirmed infections and deaths occurred as population density increased in both altitudinal groups (P < 0.05). The CFR decreased as population density increased in both altitudinal groups (P < 0.05).In the third model, altitude and the population density were associated with dependent variables (infections, deaths, and CFR) for each altitudinal group. Positive associations were observed between infections and deaths in both altitudinal groups (P < 0.05), and for β coefficients for density (P < 0.05) and altitude (P < 0.05) variables. Case fatality rate had a negative association with density (P < 0.05) in both groups; however, no significant association was observed between increasing altitude and CFR in both altitudinal groups (P > 0.05).In conclusion, data from Colombia show that there is no altitude gradient that is protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 mortality.

The monthly percent positivity ranged between 2.84% to 11.10% with an average 6.1% viral positive rate. WeFrom July to October 2020, a total of 385 individuals between 2 months and 22 years old participated, and 38 individuals were found to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . After adjustment for test accuracy, the estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the Washington Metropolitan area was found to be 9.46 (95% CI 6.68-13.00) cases per 100 children at risk.The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the pediatric population estimated in our analysis of 9.46% was higher than previous studies that included immunocompromised participants or healthy children. 5, 6 Furthermore, there was no difference in the odds of being seropositive between chronic illness groups, which is particularly notable since immunocompromised children accounted for a large portion of our sample. Given our approach, which included both healthy and individuals with chronic illnesses, and accounted for test accuracy, we believe our estimate is a close approximation of seroprevalence for the diverse pediatric population in our region.Although we report a higher seroprevalence than other studies, our observed 9.46% seroprevalence rate remains well below the levels at which herd immunity has been estimated to occur 11 , however, per CDC's reports, there is an increased seropositivity rate trend for most of the US states 12 . Future studies should focus on longitudinal seropositivity assessments among children to determine the impact of continued infections in the community, vaccine implementation, and returning to school and extracurricular programs for much needed social, emotional and behavioral development.

8bf119f1d68caeb60916e911bfb0a1f3a9fcb97b,Essential title page information Title Fatal VAP-related pulmonary aspergillosis by Aspergillus niger in a positive COVID-19 patient Author names and affiliations,"IPA, caused by the Aspergillus genus, is known as a common complication in patients with severe respiratory syndromes and is also related to high mortality rates [1, 2] . There are many predisposing factors to the development of IPA, basically recognized in prolonged treatment with corticosteroids and lung epithelial damage [1] . Several cases of IPA have been documented as super-infections in patients with severe respiratory illness such as influenza and MERS-CoV [1, 3] . Starting in December 2019 many severe respiratory syndrome cases caused by Coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV-2) have been diagnosed. The clinical impact of this infection defines a highly dysregulated immune response and diffuse lung damage, which lead to the early onset of secondary infections [2, 3] . Here we describe a case of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by Aspergillus niger in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fIn October 2020, a 73-year-old man was admitted to the accident and emergency department of the University Hospital of Catania, Sicily, Italy, reporting fever, cough and diarrhea. Vital signs were recorded as the following: blood pressure of 160/87 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 40 beats per minute and SPo2 of 78%. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates ( Figure 1 ) and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected and tested positive for COVID-19 using molecular testing. The patient was moved to the ICU with the diagnosis of Coronavirus-19 pneumonia. Clinical history was updated to include a previous diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension.Corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone (12 mg/day) and C-PAP ventilation were immediately required. In the following days, laboratory tests showed significant increases of white blood cells (up to 30210/mm3) and lactate (up to 864 U/L), and low albumin (down to 2.27 g/dL). There was also a high increase of C-reactive protein up to 101.87 mg/L. On day 4, seric levels of the GM (Platelia Aspergillus; Biorad) and 1,3-β-D-glucan (Fungitell;Associates of Cape Cod Inc., Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA) were prescribed because of the patient's risk factors, which tested negative. On day 10 ventilator support with oro-tracheal intubation was implemented, due to a rapid decline of the patient's consciousness and respiratory quality. Because of a fever episode, antibiotic treatment with meropenem (3g/day) was started and a peripheral blood sample was taken for a microbiological culture, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f which tested negative. On the same day some surveillance exams were performed: cultures from rectal, nasal and pharyngeal swabs reported a normal microbiota, while a culture from a urinary sample revealed 100000 ufc/ml of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because of this positive result the urinary catheter was removed and a therapeutic lavage with antibiotics was carried out, with complete resolution. On day 16 a new chest X-ray was performed that showed a pulmonary worsening (Figure 2 ). [4] . Some literature reports evaluated the effectiveness of isavuconazole against the Aspergillus genus and the reliability of the MIC strip method for its susceptibility test [5, 6] . According to these reports, the susceptibility test for isavuconazole was performed using the MIC strip method and showed a MIC value of 2 mg/L. The patient was put on voriconazole 800 mg/day. On day 19, the patient died in the ICU of heart failure, while he was still on ventilator support.According to recent literature data (June 2020), about 38 cases of COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis are known [1, 2] . Percentages are probably underestimated owing to a diagnostic delay or to the lack of clinical recognition [1] . Most COVID-related pulmonary aspergillosis cases are, in fact, belatedly diagnosed, often in post-mortem time. In our case, because of the patient's critical issues, it was not possible to collect samples from the lower respiratory tract regularly. This inconvenience had a negative impact on the possibility to define a fungal colonization by Aspergillus and on the timeliness of a correct diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. These delays, together with patient's risk factors represented by extensive lung damage and prolonged treatment with corticosteroids [3] , involved a rapid worsening of the respiratory condition. The patient also reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes, which is related to structural modifications of blood vessels and predisposes to fungal angioinvasion. To clarify the eventuality of a previous chronic Aspergillus colonization, a detection of Aspergillus-specific antibodies by agar gel immunodiffusion was performed on serum. The negative result leads us to the assumption that the patient, most likely, was infected in a hospital setting during intubation. According to recent data Aspergillus sp. are recognized as a potential cause of VAP in immunocompetent hosts [7, 8] .Unfortunately, fungi are often not included among the possible causes of VAP in non-immunocompromised patients with other risk factors and therefore Aspergillus shows its angioinvasive properties for a long period before the real diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis [8] . Assuming that the infection of our patient was a VAP-related pulmonary aspergillosis, a frequent check of seric and colonization parameters would have allowed a prompter diagnosis: in the six days between oro-tracheal intubation and diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis, we do not have regular reporting of a mycological surveillance for this patient. This omission led to a dangerous consequence: Aspergillus had sufficient time to proliferate and to angioinvade the patient's respiratory tract, therefore the diagnosis and the administration of voriconazole were not enough, also considering the critical status of the pulmonary epithelium. Notwithstanding his critical clinical condition, the patient contrasted the progression of the infection for a brief time, both because of the absence of a marked neutropenia, which is often a predisposing condition to pulmonary aspergillosis and because of the involvement of Aspergillus niger, whose virulent nature is widely confirmed but it is lower when compared to other Aspergillus species. In fact, although Aspergillus niger is able to produce a severe pulmonary disease it is rarely reported as a cause of invasive aspergillosis, while it is often described as the etiological agent of otomycosis and cutaneous J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infections [9] . Moreover, in a study that investigated the presence of triazole-resistant Aspergillus isolates in agricultural areas in Southern Italy, the presence of other Aspergillus species was reported. These species, although less pathogenic than A. fumigatus, are very frequently isolated in Sicily and can represent a potential cause of invasive disease in patients at risk [10] . Despite the definition of fungal etiology and the rapid administration of voriconazole, the patient died because of the severe impairment of his respiratory condition.Consequently, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis should be investigated as a possible complication in cases of severe respiratory syndromes, even in immunocompetent hosts [11, 12] . A rapid diagnosis can lead to the development of an accurate therapeutic plan and ",Argentina,abstract,2021-02-18,02
485b7cf01273be6cdac34bb16cf67c947589b0e3,Experience of clinical screening for COVID- 19 among patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgeries: an alternative proposal,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most critical global event that has occurred in recent times, affecting almost 20 million people and causing more than 700,000 deaths across five continents at the time of writing [1] . Healthcare systems have had to adapt inpatient and surgical services to meet the guidelines for providing care during the pandemic. As in other countries, the healthcare system in Colombia has had to redirect resources to increase the intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and the numbers of ventilators and health care personnel. The risk of contracting COVID-19, both for patients and healthcare personnel, has led to the cancellation of nonessential surgical procedures [2] . A study conducted in May 2020 by the COVID- 19 Collaborative suggested that, globally, the specialty that would be forced to cancel the most procedures during the pandemic would be orthopedics. Colombia is one of the top five countries with the most postponed surgeries [3] , leading to millions of dollars in losses in the healthcare sector, an increase in patient complications, a deterioration in patient quality of life, and an increase in their absence from work [2, 4] .Few studies have been conducted that provide evidence supporting either the postponement or performance of elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [4] [5] [6] [7] .Our preoperative protocol for the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 includes preoperative isolation and a survey collecting information about the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the patient's epidemiological contact history. Preoperative serological or molecular testing is not performed [8] . The decision not to perform testing was made with consideration of the degree of uncertainty that exists regarding the pandemic, the controlled environment in the operating rooms, and the documented limitations of the currently available diagnostic tests [9] . In Colombia, which is a country with limited resources, it was considered important to continue to perform elective low-and medium-complexity orthopedic surgeries.With regard to the epidemiological context at the time the study was conducted (April 2020), Colombia was in the early mitigation phase, with an estimated 10% of the cases due to community transmission [10] . At the time, the prevalence of COVID-19 in Colombia was low, with fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 population, although strict lockdown measures were already being implemented throughout the country [10, 11] . By April 30, 6507 cases and 293 deaths had been reported, and Bogotá was the epicenter of the pandemic [12] .The objective of this study was to describe the results of the presurgical clinical protocol that was established in April 2020 in two institutions in Bogotá, Colombia, to allow the performance of elective low-and mediumcomplexity orthopedic surgeries during the mitigation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic; postoperative symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and mortality were analyzed.The present study was a multicenter, observational, descriptive, retrospective study of a cohort of patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery in a high-complexity university clinic and an affiliated medium-complexity ambulatory elective surgery center (Clínica Universitaria Colombia and Centro Médico Puente Aranda) in the Keralty group, in Bogotá, Colombia, between April 1 and 30, 2020. Clínica Universitaria Colombia is a general reference center where COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients are treated and undergo operations. Puente Aranda ambulatory surgery center is a COVID-19 free institution.All patients who were admitted for elective surgery were screened with a presurgical clinical protocol immediately prior to the procedure that included a complete physical examination, a survey of COVID-19-associated symptoms (fever, dyspnea, cough, muscle pain, dysgeusia, dysosmia, or diarrhea), and an assessment of any epidemiological history of contact with individuals with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. The patients who were scheduled to undergo operations had been put into mandatory quarantine on March 20, 2020, which was when the city of Bogotá implemented a strict confinement policy [8, 13] . If any positive findings were identified when following this protocol, the procedure was cancelled, and the patient was referred to the emergency department for appropriate management. No patient was tested (antibodies or RT-PCR) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 as part of our clinical protocol due to the limited availability of these tests in the country at the time of this study [8, 13] .Patients were not followed for more than 2 weeks after the surgery because the aim of the study was to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in this population in the perioperative period after the implementation of the presurgical clinical protocol. Based on the natural history of the disease and considering the maximum incubation period (14 days) [14] , the development of signs and symptoms after this period would imply that the patient had contracted the disease after the operation. This study was not intended to investigate the rates of postoperative complications other than the development of COVID-19 during follow-up.The included patients were those over 18 years of age who were candidates for elective orthopedic surgery in the two institutions mentioned above between April 1 and 30, 2020. Patients who were hospitalized at the time of surgery and those who had any positive indications of having COVID-19 during the presurgical screening were excluded (see Fig. 1 )The primary outcome was the incidence of confirmed or suspected COVID-19, which was described as a discrete variable. Other important variables were the type of surgery and the medically necessary time sensitive (MeNTs) scale score, which were defined as nominal and continuous categorical variables, respectively [7] .The following data were extracted: the demographic characteristics of the patients (age, sex, comorbidities, body mass index [BMI]), the presence of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in the 2 weeks following surgery, whether molecular or serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed in the postsurgical period, the type of surgery performed, the anatomical location of the surgery, and the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) class. The MeNTs scale [7] score was calculated retrospectively for each patient. Patient data were collected from patient records and during routine postdischarge calls made by Keralty staff; the questions asked during the calls were modified due to the pandemic and asked about signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the patient's epidemiological history of contact with individuals with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. Patients were also asked whether any diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 had been performed in the 14-day postoperative period and the results. In addition, patients who had undergone RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 were identified through the medical insurance (Sanitas) database.A descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. Continuous variables were analyzed with central tendency and dispersion measures based on the normality of their distributions. Kurtosis and skewness values were used to evaluate the distribution of the data, and a normal distribution was indicated by values of 0 and 3, respectively. The normality of the distribution of the data was corroborated with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Since some variables were normally distributed and others were not, means and standard deviations are presented, and medians and interquartile ranges are reported for each continuous variable. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. The mean MeNTs scale score and the standard deviation were calculated for each group of surgeries. Data analysis was performed using the SPSS (IBM-International Business Machine Corporation) version 25 statistical program.In total, 179 adult patients who underwent elective orthopedic surgery at Clínica Universitaria Colombia (21%) and Puente Aranda Ambulatory Surgery Center (79%) during April 2020 were included in the study. The mean age was 47 years, with a standard deviation of 14.83 and a range from 18 to 81 years; a majority of the patients were female (61.5%) (see Table 1 ).With regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients, 60% were overweight, with a median BMI of 26 kg/m 2 (Swilk = 0.2), 19.5% had high blood pressure, and 16% had a history of smoking. In addition, 9% had hypothyroidism, 6% were diabetic, 4% had lung disease, 1.7% had coronary heart disease, 1.7% had collagen disease, and 1.7% had a history of cancer.In the postoperative period, four patients were suspected of having COVID-19 because they developed at least two symptoms associated with the disease; the incidence of suspected cases of COVID-19 was 2.3%.Two (1.1%) of these four patients consulted an emergency department where RT-PCR tests were performed, which were negative for SARS-CoV-2. No patients died or were hospitalized for symptoms associated with COVID-19.Of the procedures performed, 86 (48%) were knee surgeries, 42 (23.5%) were hand surgeries, 34 (19%) were shoulder surgeries, and 17 (9.5%) were foot and ankle surgeries (see Table 2 ). No patients underwent hip or spine surgeries. The institutions did not allow hip and spine surgeries to be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic because they involve longer operation durations and are associated with higher risks of bleeding, morbidity, and ICU admission in the postoperative period.The mean score for all patients on the MeNTs scale was 44.6 (SD ± 4.6) points. Only one patient surpassed the established safety limit of 55 points, scoring 59 points. The results stratified by anatomical location and procedure are shown in Table 2 . Concerning the type of anesthesia, 70 patients (40%) underwent general anesthesia, and the remaining patients received spinal anesthesia, blockades, or mixed anesthesia. With regard to the ASA class, 73 (40.8%) patients were classified as ASA I, 101 patients (56.4%) were classified as ASA II, and five patients (2.8%) were classified as ASA III; no patients were classified as ASA IV or V. Some details of 15 patients who underwent knee arthroplasties, which are considered theoretically complex knee surgeries, should be noted. These patients had an average age of 68.9 (SD, 3.6) years with a range between 56 and 79 years, and an average BMI of 27.4 kg/m 2 (SD ± 3.6). In this subgroup of patients, the distribution of ASA classes was as follow: I (20%), II (67%), and III (13%). The mean MeNTs score was 49.6 (SD 1.45).The present study reports the experience of performing elective orthopedic surgeries, both essential and nonessential, of low and medium complexity after implementing a presurgical protocol that involved isolation and an epidemiological survey but not serological or molecular testing in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.The results obtained were satisfactory in that none of the patients developed serious symptoms, needed to be hospitalized, or died. This study showed that when laboratory tests are unavailable for various reasons, a clinical protocol can be an alternative means of screening patients before performing elective surgeries of low and medium complexity.This study gave similar results to another study conducted by Ruggieri et al. in which they performed extensive swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and found only 2 positive cases out of the more than 200 orthopedic surgical procedures performed [15] . Initial studies in China showed poor results in patients who underwent surgery during the incubation period of the disease, with a mortality rate of 21%. On the other hand, a more recent study conducted in Spain about gastrointestinal surgery showed, in its elective surgery arm, only one patient developed COVID-19 out of the 97 patients who underwent operations; this patient recovered successfully. These findings were in accord with our results [4] , although gastrointestinal surgery patients could be at a higher risk than orthopedic patients for COVID-19, and that study was conducted during the peak of the pandemic in Spain.A paper by Gruskay et al. [16] suggested the need for widespread diagnostic testing of all patients admitted for essential surgery due to the high frequency of asymptomatic cases; however, that study did not perform laboratory testing for patients undergoing outpatient surgery. Another study carried out in Italy, in an orthopedic reference center, suggested little compromise in terms of quality and efficiency of medical care to these patients using a protocol similar to the one implemented in this study, with the difference of laboratory testing and computed chest tomography being used [17] .The patients included in this study were retrospectively evaluated with the MeNTs scale. This scale was calculated for each patient based on the pathology, the corresponding procedure, and clinical characteristics, yielding an mean score of 44.7 (SD 4.6) points, which was reasonable with regard to the safety cutoff value of 55 points suggested by the authors of another study [7] . The findings of our study suggest the importance of the use of this scale during the COVID-19 pandemic and support its effectiveness in the field of orthopedic surgery.The present study was conducted during the early stages of the pandemic in Colombia; however, given the complex dynamics of epidemics, it is likely that similar circumstances will be observed again over the course of the pandemic [18] . Based on the fact that the pandemic is occurring in waves and the possibility of it spreading to new geographic regions as well as the potential for future pandemics, it is important to consider effective protocols.The main justification for continuing to perform elective orthopedic surgeries is that although they are classified as elective surgeries, they are actually medically necessary surgeries that allow patients to have a better quality of life, decrease or eliminate pain and disabilities, and reduce societal costs by reducing absences from work [7, 19] . The increased cost imposed on the health system by the increase in complications associated with the delay in the surgical management of pathologies is also a reason to continue performing these procedures. Another important reason for continuing elective orthopedic surgeries is that the unclear duration of the pandemic, coupled with the absence of a vaccine and effective treatment, makes the indefinite postponement of surgeries untenable.Yet another key reason to continue with elective surgery is resident education, studies suggest that while most challenges to resident's education brought on by the pandemic can be overcome, there are certain elements of the intra-operative experience that are irreplaceable [20] .Among the limitations of this study is that it only provides insight into the early stage of the pandemic. Furthermore, the protocol had limited ability to detect asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and those in the incubation period. Another limitation is the fact that no PCR testing was performed to confirm the performance of the protocol. The results suggest that it was safe to perform elective orthopedic surgeries of low and medium complexity in the early stages of the pandemic, but because of the nature of this study, these results cannot be generalized to other populations. The findings also suggest the effectiveness of the presurgical protocol with regard to preventing patients with clinical suspected cases of COVID-19 from undergoing surgical procedures, which could increase the risk of postsurgical complications [21] .Future studies in later stages of the pandemic and involving other levels of surgical complexity are needed to more accurately establish the safety of elective orthopedic procedures.The present study described our experience performing low-and medium-complexity elective orthopedic surgeries in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The selection of patients through a clinical protocol that included a physical examination, a survey collecting information about symptoms and the patient's epidemiological history of contact with people with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, and presurgical isolation but did not include serological or molecular testing, yielded good results with regard to the safety of performing elective surgery in this group of patients during the pandemic.

9b27bbe1f6cb9bc5f9ea521302aecfa83cc93562,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical Household crowding hampers mitigating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"Sustained transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Brazil started in large urban centers such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro; however, serological surveys that have been described and analyzed by Hallal et al. showed an early profound impact on cases and mortality rates in the North and Northeast regions 1 . Hallal et al. found heterogeneous prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies across cities, including in the north of Brazil along the Amazon river, with 11 municipalities having antibody prevalence estimates greater than 2% 1 . The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) estimated by Souza et al. was 2.6 [95% credible interval: 2.0-4.5] in the state of Amazonas 2 . Candido et al. evaluated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the country and found a reproduction number (R) of >3 in the early days of the pandemic in major centers before the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) 3 . These numbers indicated a high transmission intensity in the absence of actions for mitigation 3, 4 , which later varied substantially owing to the states' and cities' interventions. However, the effects of other factors, such as household crowding, i.e. when the number of residents is usually large for a given physical space 5 , on these marked differences in the transmission intensity across the country require further investigation. Household crowding is an important factor to consider given the living conditions in Brazil. In particular, it is necessary to analyze whether such factors hamper attempts to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission.The household crowding hypothesis was analyzed using the number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in municipalities of Brazil and Brazilian census data on population and housing conditions. Census data (2010), which are maintained by the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), provided the population sizes of cities and number of households using the following categories: 1 resident per room; 1-2 residents per room; 2-3 residents per room; and > 3 residents per room. For each municipality, the proportion of households with > 3 residents per room that is used as a bedroom was the index utilized to classify Brazilian municipalities by levels of household crowding.The distribution of the proportion of households with ≥ 3 residents per room that is used as a bedroom provided the thresholds for municipality classifications into low, average, and high crowding levels. The proportion of households with ≥ 3 residents per room from the census data revealed a lognormal distribution, with a mean of 3.35%. Household crowding was classified into the following levels: low (<2.17% [difference between the mean proportion and half the standard deviation]), high (>5.18% [sum of the mean proportion and half the standard deviation]), and average (>2.17% and <5.18%). Therefore, 28.60% (1,583) of the municipalities were classified as low, 31.60% (1,749) as high, and 39.70% (2,200) as average.The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the municipalities of Brazil was calculated as the ratio between the number of confirmed cases up to June 10, 2020 per municipality 6 and city population (IBGE). The mean value of the cumulative incidence in the given period was 88 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Figure 1 shows that municipalities with a high index of household crowding had higher incidence estimates, whereas those with low and average indices had very similar distributions of cumulative incidence estimates. A linear regression analysis that used the incidence estimate as the outcome and household crowding index (low, average, high) as the explanatory variable revealed that the group with a high index of household crowding was associated with a significantly higher COVID-19 incidence (an excess of 461 persons per 100,000; 95% confidence interval (CI): 371-558 cases per 100,000; p-value<0.001) than the group with a low index of household crowding. Most highindex municipalities with confirmed cases were in the northern region (150 cities) and northeast region (198 cities), followed by regions in the Southeast (53 cities), Center-West (6 cities), and South (6 cities). In addition, a Poisson regression analysis that used the cumulative number of confirmed cases as the outcome, proportion of households with ≥ 3 residents per room as the explanatory variable (log-transformed), and city population as the offset (log-transformed) revealed a significantly increasing effect of household crowding on COVID-19 incidence (factor: 0.824, 95% CI: 0.819-0.831).These findings showed how household crowding may adversely affect the incidence of COVID-19. In the early weeks of the epidemic in Brazil, only NPIs were available to reduce virus transmission; however, household crowding likely hampered the effectiveness of such measures. The role of household crowding, an important topic listed by the World Health Organization Housing and Health Guidelines, has been previously recognized in the transmission of infectious diseases 5, 7 . However, the effectiveness of mitigating actions varies across cities and states. Consequently, the impact on mitigating transmission (""flattening the curve"") also differed across the country; the implementation of interventions could have been limited in a few cities, including in those cities with high household crowding. Moreover, the distribution of household crowding in Brazil might have changed since the most recent census in Brazil in 2010. However, a substantial part of the category of cities with high household crowding may still be significantly above the mean proportion of crowding. Analysis of antibody prevalence by Hallal et al. in surveys conducted 3 weeks apart indicated higher antibody prevalence estimates in households having > 6 persons.In summary, many factors play essential roles in increasing the transmission intensities of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, including in Brazil. Hallal et al. found considerable variability in two early serological surveys, pointing to various heterogenous outcomes according to ethnicity, income levels, and household size. Therefore, there are potential factors that may be considered as confounding variables and warrant further research, namely sociodemographic structures in municipalities, as well as local adherence to mitigation strategies. Grassly et al. found a significant reduction in reproduction numbers after molecular testing for screening and contact tracing was used; this potentially might have reduced transmission in crowded households 8 . Furthermore, modeling studies have assessed the impact of high transmission within households as the secondary attack rate 9, 10 . The findings in this study demonstrated that household crowding may be a potential factor that could hamper transmission mitigation measures by evaluating the link between cumulative COVID-19 incidence and an indicator of household crowding. Therefore, this factor may be essential to consider while defining surveillance strategies such as contact tracing.Daniel Antunes Maciel Villela is a Research Fellow from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico.

b87cbcca6205b610fb54322f2ba9eaafb427cc46,Modelling the impact of contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic Running title: Contact tracing of symptomatic individuals,"The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was reported on 26 February 2020 in the State of São Paulo, the most populous Brazilian state with 44,639,899 inhabitants (1) .Genome sequencing coupled with phylogenetic analyses corroborate multiple importations of the virus from Italy followed by local spread (2). As of 30 October 2020, 1,113,788 cases and 39,255 deaths were reported in Brazil (3), the largest numbers in Latin America (4) .Isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment are important non-pharmaceutical public health interventions to control the explosive growth of COVID-19 (5) . Liberal testing, followed by contact tracing and isolation of all test positive persons have direct and clear benefits (6) .The World Health Organization recommends a combination of rapid diagnosis, immediate isolation of cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts (6) . In a previous paper, we analyzed the impact and costs of test-tracequarantine strategies (7) . Here we set out to model the effects of a contact tracing strategy of symptomatic individuals to control the COVID-19 spread regardless of the use of diagnostic testing. This may be an alternative strategy for places with limited availability of diagnostic tests.The model is based on a modified version of the SEIR model (7, 8) A schematic representation of the model is shown in Figure 1 .The incidence of infection is given by:The total number of reported cases is obtained by multiplying the number of infected individuals by a notification ratioThe total number of COVID-19-related deaths is given by:Finally, the total number of isolated individuals is given by:The parameter values used are shown in Table 1 .Model projections for future dates were obtained by keeping fixed the fitted values of the parameters from the last date observed in the data. Assuming that a fraction of the isolated contacts may be susceptible or recovered, we define a selection efficacy as the proportion of isolated contacts who are infected (asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals).We calculated the efficacy of the CT strategy subtracting from 1 the result of the division of the cumulative number of cases by the number of cases in the baseline scenario in which CT is not performed.A sensitivity analysis was performed using a Monte Carlo method to sample parameter values and a PRCC (Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient) estimation to measure the strength of association between an input parameter and an output variable after the linear effects on the output variable of the remaining inputs are discounted (9, 10) . Parameter values were sampled using a Monte Carlo sampling method assuming a uniform distribution for each parameter. The following input parameters were Table 2 . The cumulative number of cases after 60 days was used as the output variable.We fitted the model parameters simultaneously to the data of cumulative number of reported cases, deaths and the number of ICU patients (Figure 2 ) for the state of São Paulo until July 18, 2020. To estimate a 95% probability interval (shaded area in Figure   2 ), we assumed a normal distribution for the contact rate with a standard deviation of 1.0%.The cumulative number of cases and deaths over time for different numbers (1000, 3000 or 5000) of symptomatic individuals isolated per day and their contacts (5 or 10 contacts per symptomatic individuals) are shown in Figures 3 and 4 , respectively.We modelled the impact of a strategy based on contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. This strategy has lower costs when compared to a test-trace-and-quarantine strategy (7) . It may be a potential alternative strategy when the number of diagnostic tests available is not sufficient for a massive testing strategy.In the sensitivity analysis, we observed that the reduction in the number of cumulative cases was more sensitive to the number of symptomatic individuals isolated, the selection efficacy, and the number of contacts, in decreasing order of the PRCC. The increase in the number of isolated symptomatic individuals and their contacts poses logistical challenges and associated costs. These costs, however, are likely to be lower than the costs of a test, trace and quarantine strategy (7).",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-08,02
1548fb8f1250ab47f7ebeadfb7c5eed7e1db9818,COVID-19 pandemic: Solid waste and environmental impacts in Brazil,"• COVID-19 pandemic has hampered advances in sustainable development in Brazil. • Some locations have suspended recycling programs to safeguard public health. • Electric power enough to supply 152,475 households over a month could have been saved. • Potable water enough to supply 40,010 people over a month could have been saved. • The equivalent of US$ 781,000 has been disposed in landfills.a b s t r a c t a r t i c l e i n f oWorldwide public health and economy have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with deaths and increased economic vulnerability especially in middle-income countries (Chakraborty and Maity, 2020; UN, 2020 Science of the Total Environment j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / s c i t o t e n v America the new epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic (Feuer, 2020; WHO, 2020) , as Brazil has become one of the most affected countries, being currently the second leading country in number of cases with 1,759,103 confirmed cases as of July 09, 2020 (Worldometers, 2020) , albeit social isolation measures have been implemented in the Federal District on March 11, 2020, in São Paulo state and in Rio de Janeiro state on March 16, 2020 and March 17, 2020, respectively. Besides the alarming socioeconomic impacts, indirect environmental impacts caused by social isolation have been described in several studies, reporting positive impacts such as cleaner beaches and environment noise reduction (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020) , immediate improvements in air quality (Bao and Zhang, 2020; Collivignarelli et al., 2020; Nakada and Urban, 2020) , and in surface water quality (Braga et al., 2020; Yunus et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, negative impacts related to increased solid waste generation and reduced recycling programs may produce medium-or long-term effects and thus constitute a reason for concern (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). Kampf et al. (2020) have reviewed the persistence of coronaviruses on different surfaces and have reported viruses' survival on metal for 5 days, on plastic for up to 5 days, on paper for 4 to 5 days, on glass for 4 days, and on aluminum for up to 8 h. Furthermore, one recent investigation on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on several surfaces has reported viable SARS-CoV-2 virus on plastic for up to 72 h, on stainless steel for up to 48 h, and on cardboard for up to 24 h (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Considering that plastic plus paper/cardboard represent 64.6% of recycling materials in recycling programs in Brazil, and because the majority of recycling centers in Brazil are based on manual waste sorting (Fidelis et al., 2020) , COVID-19 infection risk for workers in recycling centers is high. Therefore, the Brazilian Association for Environmental and Sanitary Engineering has recommended the suspension of recycling programs in Brazil (ABES, 2020a).The aim of this study was to assess environmental impacts caused by shifts on solid waste production and management due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In this study, we have analyzed data from the Federal District, and all 26 state capital cities of Brazil plus 03 non-capital cities with more than 1 million people, totalizing 30 cities, which were selected based on the following criteria: i) state capital cities may represent the features of each state, considering social, environmental and economic diversity among Brazilian states; ii) data availability; and iii) solid waste production associated with large cities with high urbanization rates. So far, a total of 636,778 COVID-19 confirmed cases have been reported for the 30 analyzed cities, being the number of cases for each city as for July 09, 2020 presented in Table S1 .For the assessment of the impacts on solid waste management system in Brazil, we have analyzed official time-series data (SNIS, 2019a), and the latest published data about solid waste management in Brazil (Brazil, 2019), made available by the National System for Sanitation Information. Estimates of sale prices for recyclable materials were obtained from the Business Association for Recycling (CEMPRE, 2020) . Resources saved by recycling were calculated according to Eq. (1), adapted from Calderoni (2003) , being resources data presented in Table S2 . Environmental and economic impacts caused by the suspension of recycling programs were calculated using Eq. (1), considering 30 days of suspension only in cities where recycling programs were actually suspended.where:Resources X : Amount of resources of type X from recycling programs X: Sale price; or volume in landfill; or saved: electric power/potable water/trees/oil/ore/sand Rec. Mat. n : Daily amount of solid waste of type n: 1: Plastic; 2: Paper; 3: Metal; 4: Glass α i X : Transformation coefficient of amount of solid waste of type n to amount of resources of type X The numbers of daily disposable facemasks potentially used in cities under study were estimated using Eq. (2) (Nzediegwu and Chang, 2020) . Different levels of solid waste collection and recycling programs are observable on data referring to solid waste management in each analyzed city (Table 1) . Recycling programs are not available in three (10%) of the studied cities, albeit one of these cities (Macapá-AP) has reported recyclable collection, probably by informal workers. Effectively recovered materials represent only 1%, pointing out: i) low levels of recycling programs in the studied cities; and ii) high rates of disposal of recyclable materials following collection due to decreased quality for recycling or low commercial price. Another important aspect is the recyclable collection system, which varies between door-to-door collection and voluntary deposit in containers for recyclables (Campos, 2014; Ibáñez-Forésa et al., 2018) .The Brazilian Association for Environmental and Sanitary Engineering has reported decreases in solid waste production, as follows: 16% in Rio de Janeiro-RJ, 12% in Brasília-DF and Porto Alegre-RS, and 10% in Fortaleza-CE and Manaus-AM during the first week of April 2020, and 22%achieving 50% in central and thus commercial areaduring 30 days of partial lockdown in Belo Horizonte (ABES, 2020b). In the city of Campinas-SP solid waste production has decreased 15% during the first month of partial lockdown, albeit the recycling program has been suspended and the recyclable materials incorporated into the domiciliary solid waste collection (G1, 2020).A recent study has foreseen an increase in solid waste production due to social isolation (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020), which has not happened in Brazil. Because in Brazil up to 200 L-solid waste produced daily by commercial and service sectors are collected as domiciliary waste (Brazil, 2010) , the reduction of commercial activities may explain the decrease in solid waste production.Being Brazil a middle-income country, the purpose of recycling is mainly income generation, besides resource recovery (Conke, 2018) . The Brazilian legislation regarding solid waste (Brazil, 2010) encourages the integration of informal workers into the formal recycling sector, being the organization as a cooperative an important means to reduce socio-economic fragilities (Fidelis et al., 2020; Ibáñez-Forésa et al., 2018) . Considering the continental size of the country with its cultural and economic diversity, solid waste management also varies from similar to low-income countries to similar to high-income countries (Cetrulo et al., 2018) . Informal workers such as waste pickers, itinerant traders, and middlemen constitute one important characteristic of recycling programs in Brazil (Conke, 2018) , and even formal workers conduct manual waste sorting in recycling centers. Therefore, the Brazilian recycling system is highly vulnerable to the effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, considering both environmental and economic impacts of the suspension of recycling programs in Brazilian cities due to the COVID-19 pandemic ( Table 2) .As a measure to avoid SARS-COV-2 transmission in recycling centers, 14 out of 30 cities have suspended recycling programs. In São Paulo, the largest city in Latin America, recycling program has not been suspended; nevertheless, only automated segregation is still working (São Paulo, 2020b). As a consequence of the suspension of recycling programs, considerable amounts of natural resources have not been saved over a month, such as 24,076 MWh of electric poweramount enough to supply 152,475 households over a month, considering an average consumption of 157.9 kWh/household•month (Brazil, 2018) , and 185,929 m 3 of potable wateramount enough to supply 40,010 people over a month, considering each person uses 154.9 L/day (SNIS, 2019b). Furthermore, total sale price for recyclable materials during the suspension of recycling programs reaches more than 781 thousand dollars, being these materials disposed in landfills demanding an extra volume of 19,000 m 3reducing landfill lifespan, and hence causing a double loss: economic and environmental.An important income loss has been reported because of the suspension of recycling programs using manual waste sorting in recycling centers, albeit this measure was intended to safeguard public health, and therefore some city governmentsfor example, Belém-PA and São Paulo-SPhave approved emergency financial support for recyclingrelated workers (MPF, 2020; Jovem Pan, 2020) . Because there is a high rate of turnover in recycling centers (Fidelis et al., 2020) , at least 6581 formal workers have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis (Table S4) . In locations where recycling programs have not been suspended, sales for recycling materials have also been compromised because some sectorssuch as recycling facilities and also middlemenof the complex solid waste management system are not fully working (Conke, 2018; Peduzi, 2020) .The latest data on medical waste in Brazil has shown installed treatment capacity for 479,653 t/year, and an annual production of 252,948 t, being 63.8% of this amount properly treated (ABRELPE, 2020).Based on the evidence that medical waste production has increased up to 6 fold in Wuhan, China due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Calma, 2020) , a recent study has foreseen an increment in medical waste production (Saadat et al., 2020) . Assuming a 2 fold increase in medical waste in Brazil, the current treatment capacity would be exceeded. Moreover, although Brazil is one of the developing countries with most studies on its medical waste (Ansari et al., 2019) , improper management of medical waste in small medical units is still a reason for concern (Moreira and Günther, 2013) .The COVID-19 pandemic has become more critical in Brazil in middle April 2020, and non-official preliminary data report an increment in medical waste production in May 2020 (Azevedo et al., 2020) . By contrast, estimates on medical waste production in Brazil in the first week of April 2020 point out a 17% decrease in collected and treated waste (ABETRE, ABLP, ABRELPE and SELUR/SELURB, 2020), possibly because of the suspension of non-emergency medical and odontological appointments from late March 2020 on, and also improperly disposal among domiciliary waste (Azevedo et al., 2020) . Furthermore, increasing use of personal protective equipment such as facemasks and gloves (Calma, 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020) , both in hospitals and in general, also increases the chances for inappropriate disposal leading to environmental- (Saadat et al., 2020) and public health- (Nzediegwu and Chang, 2020) risks associated with potentially infective material.Recently, a few studies have depicted improper disposal of facemasks in distinct parts of the world, such as Soko Islands, Nigeria, Portugal, and Canada (Kalina and Tilley, 2020; Fadare and Okoffo, 2020; Prata et al., 2020) . During the social isolation period in Brazil, the press has reported inappropriate disposal of facemask in several cities analyzed in this study such as Campinas-SP, Campo Grande-MS, Goiânia-GO, João Pessoa-PB, Palmas-TO, São Luís-MA and São Gonçalo-RJ. Using the criteria described by Nzediegwu and Chang (2020) , an estimate show that more than 85 million facemasks may be daily disposed (Fig. 1) . Considering the high demand of disposable facemasks and in order to control improper disposal, the Ministry of Health of Brazil (MS, 2020) and the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA, 2020) have recommended the use of disposable masks only by health personnel, and the use of homemade reusable fabric facemask by population in general, according to the World Health Organization recommendations. One recent study has assessed the effectivity of cotton facemask as an alternative to disposable facemasks and has concluded that daily use of washable cotton facemask by healthy people in community is a suitable measure (Ho et al., 2020) .São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil, producing the highest amount of solid waste in the country, being data regarding solid waste collection monitored by an information system maintained and made available by the city government (São Paulo, 2020a).Time-series data on solid waste production from January to April over the last 11 years (Fig. 2 ) reveal some impacts on solid waste production caused by social isolation measures in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. As a result of environmental education campaigns as well as inspection of irregular waste disposal by the city government (São Paulo, 2020a), before the COVID-19 pandemic the following situations have been observed: i) variations in domiciliary solid waste collection, with a stable trend; ii) increasing recyclable collection; iii) increasing voluntary deposit in containers for recyclables; and iv) decreasing amount of solid waste on streets. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent partial lockdown, the following situations have been observed: i) the lowest (276,684 t) domiciliary solid waste collection over 11 years; ii) increased recyclable collection; iii) decreased voluntary deposit in containers for recyclables; and iv)) the lowest (3887 t) amount of solid waste on streets over 11 years.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several impacts on the solid waste management system in Brazil, considering socioeconomic and environmental effects, and hence has hampered advances in sustainable development. The suspension of recycling programs over a month has Recycling-related workers have experienced economic issues, albeit the government has approved emergency financial support. Given behavior shifts in the post-pandemic period, the solid waste management system may demand adjustments seeking to: i) increase both recycling capacity and environmental education, considering the increment in the use of disposable utensils and also packages from food delivery and online shopping; ii) encourage training of waste pickers for adoption of safe methods for recyclable sorting; and iii) monitor both the production and the installed capacity for medical waste treatment, in order to assess an eventual need for system expansion.CRediT authorship contribution statement Rodrigo Custodio Urban: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing -original draft, Writing -review & editing.

64aad39a79eb41376ac4ab0ed4cf95e225b9b8b3,"Plasmodium falciparum outbreak in native communities of Condorcanqui, Amazonas, Perú","In the Americas, the population at risk of malaria is 138 million, with 753,700 confirmed cases and 338 deaths in 2018 [1] . The greatest number of cases is reported in the Amazon basin, and Peru represents 6% of the total cases in the Americas [1] . Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 244,723 malaria cases were notified in 22 regions of Peru. Most of these cases were reported in Loreto (95.6%), Amazonas (1.8%), Junín (1.0%), and San Martín (0.7%) [2] . Approximately, 95% of the cases in Amazonas are found in the Río Santiago District (Condorcanqui Province), an area where native communities live on the banks of the Santiago River, with no electricity, drinking water, or road access, having the rivers as the primary means of transportation [3] . Last year, Amazonas reported a 2.5-fold increase, with an unusual circulation of Plasmodium falciparum, representing a risk for severe malaria and mortality. It is worth noting that since 2015 only four P. falciparum imported cases were reported. In 2018, 705 malaria cases were reported and this number increased to 1843 in 2019, including 807 new P. falciparum cases (Fig. 1 ) [4] . Factors such as poor living conditions, movement of people, poor treatment compliance, climate change, the circulation of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes plus a more articulate malaria surveillance in this area could be responsible for these numbers. Moreover, people with malaria infections may remain asymptomatic for a long period of time, acting as carriers and/or reservoirs and therefore contributing to malaria transmission [5, 6] . In this context, early diagnosis and prompt treatment represent the main actions for malaria control and elimination.Here, an epidemiological study was performed in eight sanitary districts of Rio Santiago, Condorcanqui, including follow-up of all positive cases until completion of treatment, and analysis of risk factors from positive malaria cases. Knowledge obtained from this report is useful to determine effective malaria control strategies and interrupt P. falciparum settlement in Amazonas.The Regional Directorate of Health-Amazonas (DIR-ESA-Amazonas) in collaboration with the Condorcanqui Health Network performed malaria active case detection (ACD) activities, in the Rio Santiago District, Condorcanqui Province, Amazonas Region of Peru, in response to the P. falciparum outbreak reported in 2019. The Institute of Tropical Diseases (IET) of the Universidad Nacional Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza (UNTRM) collaborated with these institutions during ACDIII activities between January 31st and February 10th of 2020 and the data collected was analysed in this manuscript. Activities were performed at the community centres and a door-todoor strategy was adopted for those families who did not attend the open call. This study was performed as part of the surveillance activities approved by the DIRESA-Amazonas and the National Ministry of Health.Informed consent was obtained from ""Apus"" (chiefs of the communities) as well as from all individual participants included in the study. For underage children, informed consent of parents or legal guardian was obtained.Condorcanqui Province is located in the northern jungle of the Amazonas Region of Peru (Fig. 2) , and it is part of the Marañon Basin. This province is bordered by the Republic of Ecuador to the North; by Loreto to the East, by Utcubamba and Bongara provinces to the South, and by Cajamarca to the West. Condorcanqui is divided in three districts: Nieva, El Cenepa, and Rio Santiago, and it has an extension of 17,892 km 2 [3] , with an estimated population of 42,470 [7] .The rugged relief of this region has an extensive fluvial network constituted by the Marañon River and its tributaries Cenepa, Nieva, and Santiago, in addition to a large number of streams of different flows and sizes. Condorcanqui has a humid tropic climate with temperatures that can reach 35 °C, annual average rainfall around 4800 mm, and relative humidity above 90%. The rainy season occurs between October to December, but it could last until May [3] .A total of 2718 individuals (representing the 47.4% of the total population) were screened for malaria infections in 21 native communities. These communities were grouped in eight ""sanitary districts"" (Cucuasa, Soledad, Ayambis, Nauta, Chapiza, Chosica, Yutupis, and Guayabal) according to their corresponding health post The increase in the number of malaria cases at different time points is associated with these events (Fig. 2) . The Rio Santiago District is divided into three major areas: Upper Santiago (Cucuasa, Soledad, Ayambis, Nauta, and Chapiza), Middle Santiago (Chosica), and Lower Santiago (Yutupis and Guayabal).Blood samples were collected from all participants by finger pricks for preparation of thick and thin blood smears. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were available only for people reporting symptoms. Microscopy results were given the next day and all positive individuals were treated according to the Peruvian Ministry of Health guidelines for malaria cases [8] .A registry of socio-demographic variables such as the name of the community, age, gender, and presence of symptoms was recorded for coded positive malaria cases with no personal identifiers. Data of previous malaria cases in Condorcanqui was obtained from the DIRESA-Amazonas database with no names or personal identifiers. Thick and thin blood smears were stained with Giemsa. The slides were examined under compound microscopes (Olympus) at 1000× magnification with oil to detect malaria parasites. Ring, trophozoite, or gametocyte stages were identified and assessed for parasite density using the semi-quantitative method according to the Peruvian Ministry of Health guidelines [8] . The microscopy team consisted of four field technicians, two with medium and two with high malaria expertise. The high expertise technicians confirmed the diagnosis. Additionally, all slides were independently read and confirmed at the Candungos or Galilea health centres. It is worth noting that 10% of malaria slides from all Peruvian national health centres undergo quality control at the National Institute of Health in Peru (INS) according to Ministerial Resolution N°. 461-2010/MINSA. SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f/P.f/P.v RDTs were available only for patients who presented symptoms. Fifteen percent of the positive samples (n = 35) were randomly collected in Whatman ™ Protein Saver cards 903 and confirmed by qPCR at IET for quality control according to a previously reported protocol [9] . PET-PCR assays were run with 5 μl of DNA template using QuantStudio 5 thermocycler (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). As previously established, a CT value of < 40 was considered positive; samples with CT values above 40 were considered to be negative.Positive Plasmodium vivax cases were treated with chloroquine and primaquine for 7 days and positive P. falciparum cases with mefloquine and artesunate for 3 days with additional primaquine (0.75 mg/kg) the last day of treatment. Mixed infections were treated with mefloquine, artesunate, and subsequently primaquine (0.5 mg/ kg/day) for 7 days. Children under 12 years of age were treated according to their weight [8] .Malaria cases were classified into six age groups defined as: children under 5 years old, children (5-11 years old), teenagers (12-17 years old), youngsters (18-29 years old), adults (30-59 years old) and seniors (over 60 years old). Type of infection was recorded according to the Plasmodium species observed by microscopy; mixed infections were reported if both P. vivax and P. falciparum were present. Parasitaemia was classified as ""low"" if less than 40 parasites were found in at least 100 fields and ""high"" if more than 40 parasites were found. Symptomatic individuals were defined as those who presented any of the following symptoms at the time of taking the blood sample: fever, headache, body pain, shivering, nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. Asymptomatic individuals were defined as persons with confirmed infection showing no symptoms of infection or disease.Prevalence of malaria positive cases with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each sanitary district and according to species. Omnibus test (Chi-square) was used to determine the association between location (sanitary districts) and presence of malaria [10] . Then, a generalized linear model with binomial distribution was used to evaluate specific associations. The outcome variables were measured on a binary scale, presence (Z = 1) or absence (Z = 0) of the infection, considering sanitary district as the predictor without intercept. To recognize specific differences between sanitary districts, 95% CI, and the probability of infection were calculated. The probability of infection was calculated from the estimated parameter with the exponential function. Fixed effects model odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% CI was used to analyse the magnitude of relative risk for an association between independent variables such as gender (female), age (all categories), type of infection (P. falciparum), and parasitaemia (low) with the dependent variables, symptomatology (asymptomatic), type of infection (P. falciparum) and parasitaemia (low).Additional bivariate cross-tabulations Pearson Chi-Square analysis with bilateral asymptotical significance (p-value of Chi-Square statistic) and Wald test from logistic regression were performed to examine these associations with 95% confidence. All the statistical analyses were based on Agresti, 2007 [10] , and were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics Subscription and Rstudio.A spatial analysis to detect clusters with high and low risk of malaria infection was conducted using the SaTScan software (version 9.6 64-bit). A Bernoulli model was applied to evaluate the spatial distribution in sanitary districts with positive malaria cases relative to the control group (negative cases). Clusters were detected with a maximum spatial cluster size of 50% of the population at risk [11] and a circular spatial window shape. SaTScan considers the null hypothesis that malaria infections are randomly distributed and compares the observed and expected number of infections inside and outside each circular window. The inference of isotonic clusters was based on a Standard Monte Carlo simulation with 9999 number of replications. SaTScan reports a p-value for all obtained clusters, as well as a relative risk which is the estimated risk within the cluster divided by the estimated risk outside the cluster. Significant low and high infection clusters (p < 0.05) were mapped using QGIS version 3.10.8 for total malaria cases and per type of infection (P. falciparum and P. vivax). To analyse the effect of the surveillance in these communities, heat maps of malaria incidence per 1000 habitants, considering only passive surveillance before and after ACD were also included.From 2015 to 2018, only four imported cases of P. falciparum were reported in Condorcanqui. The last case reported was a man visiting from the Shinguito community of Loreto (57 km away from Condorcanqui). Five months later, in January of 2019, the first two P. falciparum autochthonous cases were found in Soledad, a 3-year-old girl, and an 11-year-old boy. Then, sporadic cases were reported in the sanitary districts of Ayambis, Soledad, Chapiza, Nauta, Cucuasa, and Chosica. However, an unusual increase in the number of P. falciparum cases was notified after epidemiological week 25 of 2019 ( Fig. 3 , Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ) with clusters of cases in Chapiza, Chosica, and Nauta. After that, the cumulative cases (2019-2020) of P. falciparum increased up to 968 until epidemiological week 29 of 2020.A total of 220 malaria positive cases were found in the population screened by microscopy (n = 2718, 47.4%).The prevalence of malaria in this area was 8.1%, from which Chosica (13.2%) and Yutupis (13.4%) depicted the highest prevalence (Table 1) . In most districts, P. vivax was higher than P. falciparum; except in Ayambis (6.2%) and Soledad (5.2%) where P. falciparum infections were greater. The highest P. vivax prevalence was found in Yutupis (13.4%), followed by Chosica (12.1%), Chapiza (7.2%), and Nauta (6.8%). Also, 3.6% of the total malaria positive cases (eight individuals) were P. falciparum gametocytes carriers, and only one of them showed symptoms.From the 35 positive samples collected for qPCR confirmation, 10 were P. falciparum and 25 were P. vivax. These results have 100% agreement with the ones obtained by microscopy.SaTScan analysis detected a cluster of high malaria infection risk in the Middle part of Rio Santiago including Chapiza, Chosica, and Yutupis (Table 2, Fig. 4 ). Meanwhile, a high P. falciparum infection risk cluster was found in Soledad and Ayambis from Upper Santiago and a low relative risk cluster in Yutupis and Guayabal from Lower Santiago. Plasmodium vivax showed at least three clusters, a high-risk cluster corresponding to Chosica, From all positive cases, 76.4% were diagnosed with P. vivax, 20.9% with P. falciparum and 2.7% were mixed infections. In general, there were more positive females (58.2%) than males (41.8%) and according to the age distribution, the number of malaria cases was higher in children between 5 and 11 years old (30.5%) ( Table 3 ). In addition, 59.5% (n = 131) of infected people were asymptomatic, from which 16.8% (n = 37) were P. falciparum and 42.3% (n = 93) were P. vivax. Only one asymptomatic mixed infection was reported. However, it is worth noting that from all P. falciparum cases, 80.4% reported no symptoms compared to 55.4% of P. vivax cases.According to the Omnibus test, there was a significant association between sanitary districts and malaria infections (χ 2 = 2326.74, p < 0.001). The estimated parameter of the generalized linear model with binomial distribution indicated significant differences among all sanitary districts (p < 0.001) with a higher probability of infection in Ayambis, Nauta, Chapiza, Chosica, and Yutupis compared to Cucuasa and Guayabal (Table 4) .On the other hand, the analysis of risk factors showed significant associations between low parasitaemia and asymptomatic cases (OR = 3.71, 95% CI 1.97-6.98, p < 0.001) and between P. falciparum infections and asymptomatic cases (OR = 3.32 95% CI 1.51-7.30, p = 0.003). Furthermore, significant associations between adults and P. falciparum infections (OR = 4.10 95% CI 1.93-8.72, p < 0.001), and between low parasitaemia and P. falciparum infections (OR = 2.74 95% CI 1.41-5.35, p = 0.003) were also found ( Table 5) . These results agree with the Pearson chi-square analysis outcome (Additional file 2: Table S1 ).Malaria disease caused by P. vivax and P. falciparum represents a major public health problem in Peru. Most of the control efforts are focused in Loreto, where 95.6% of all cases are reported [2] . However, since 2018, Amazonas is the Peruvian region with the highest incidence of cases, affecting native communities, such as the ones living on the banks of the Santiago River. Thus, understanding the distribution and risk factors associated with malaria infections in native communities is important to strengthen the malaria control programmes with targeted activities. Condorcanqui province has shown increasing reported P. vivax cases during the past 2 years with the recent emergence of P. falciparum cases in 2019 [4] . In the epidemiological week 29 of 2018, only one P. falciparum imported case from Shinguito, Loreto, was reported. This community is 57 km apart from the community of Soledad in Condorcanqui, where the first two P. falciparum autochthonous cases were reported. These cases corresponded to symptomatic children that were taken to the health post; however, it is possible that infected adults did not report symptoms and remained unattended, contributing to the transmission of the According to previous data from ACD I and II, the highest prevalence of malaria was reported in Chosica (19.1%), followed by Nauta (12.4%) and Chapiza (10.2%) [4] . In this study (ACD III), Yutupis (13.4%) and Chosica (13.2%) reported the highest number of cases. Furthermore, a high-risk cluster for malaria transmission, included the sanitary districts of Chapiza, Chosica, and Yutupis, indicating that the cases were also spreading to other communities southern to Chosica (Fig. 4) . Additionally, P. falciparum and P. vivax presented different spatial distribution. The recent introduction of P. falciparum in Soledad can explain the presence of a highrisk cluster, while P. vivax is endemic in all Rio Santiago. Moreover, six mixed infections were reported, which represented a challenge for a correct diagnosis and treatment of patients. A previous study in riverine communities of Loreto determined that malaria prevalence and the microgeographical heterogeneity of P. vivax parasitaemia are linked to specific factors such as travel and occupation, which created a complex transmission dynamics in these communities [12] . These are important factors to consider when analysing trends in malaria prevalence along with environmental conditions that could facilitate the establishment of new mosquito breeding sites.In Condorcanqui, descriptive analysis of positive cases exhibited a higher number in females than in males and the number of cases in children (5-11 years old) was also higher than in other age groups. The lack of complete sociodemographic data of negative cases hinders further statistical analysis of infection risk. Although a door-todoor strategy was considered for individuals who did not attend the open call, some men were working in the field and some declined their participation in the study which might generated a bias towards women participants.Nevertheless, it has been reported that in malariaendemic zones, children and pregnant women are the groups at highest risk and the most affected due to poor socio-economic conditions and nutritional problems [12] , something that is also characteristic of these communities, given the high rates of anemia in the population. Anaemia in Peru is a long-standing problem, in 2018 the prevalence in children (6 months to 3 years old) was 43.5%, being even higher in the rural jungle (53.5%) [13] . Moreover, specific micronutrients play key roles in the function of the immune system and certain deficiencies could predispose to malaria infections [14, 15] . Hence, it is important to focus efforts on both risk groups for an efficient malaria control program.On the other hand, although P. vivax cases were predominant, most P. falciparum cases in Condorcanqui were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic malaria infections hamper disease control. Under normal circumstances, these patients do not seek treatment and they become parasite reservoirs contributing to the malaria cycle in the population [16] .Additionally, the evaluation of different risk factors showed significant associations between asymptomatic cases and low parasitaemia, these relative risks are in agreement with previous reports of endemic areas [17, 18] , suggesting that the population is acquiring immunity and there is a risk of falciparum malaria becoming endemic. Moreover, significant associations were also found between P. falciparum, asymptomatic cases, and adults (30-59 years old), consistent with previous studies [17, [19] [20] [21] . The higher relative risk of presenting P. falciparum infection in adults may be due to their activities, such as farming, hunting, or fishing, being in close contact with mosquito breeding sites, and more exposed to infections than other age groups. Low parasitaemia cases represent a challenge to the correct diagnosis and according to previous studies, there are significant numbers of submicroscopic asymptomatic cases only detectable by qPCR given that these subjects retained control over the parasitaemia [22] . It is worth noting that asymptomatic malaria cases reported in this study could be underestimated given that qPCR was not performed for all samples; however, quality control of the samples showed consistent results for both techniques. Also, an active report of gametocyte density is important considering that they are responsible for the continuity of malaria transmission [11] . Moreover, there is concern [16] . Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) could be considered a complementary tool for prompt malaria diagnosis [23] , especially in a field setting; however, it is important to consider that Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 deletions have been previously reported in Peru [24] and these could affect the efficiency of RDTs for P. falciparum detection. Thus, it is important to improve malaria diagnosis in native communities of Condorcanqui using complementary strategies, such as microscopy and RDTs or molecular biology techniques, for an effective malaria control [25] .Despite limited access to health services, completion of P. falciparum treatment in 3 days is achievable compared to P. vivax treatment, which requires supervision for 7 days [8] . Furthermore, P. vivax hypnozoites could be responsible for recurrences within 24 weeks [26] , which represents a problem for P. vivax control. Comparison of P. falciparum and P. vivax cases detected during passive surveillance before and after the four ACDs showed a significant decrease in P. falciparum prevalence, indicating a successful control of the outbreak; while P. vivax hotspots continued to be present (Additional file 3: Fig. S2 , Additional file 4: Fig. S3) .Although the number of malaria cases decreased after epidemiological week 20 of 2020, it has to be considered that the COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the health services and the report systems of other diseases. The first COVID-19 case was reported in Condorcanqui towards the epidemiological week 19 of 2020, and by week 23, cases spread to other sanitary districts, reporting over 500 cases. It is possible that malaria infections are currently underestimated and that the increase of COVID-19 cases hinders not only P. falciparum but also P. vivax control strategies. This represents a serious health problem given that malaria and COVID-19 could become syndemics (synergistic epidemics). Continue surveillance of malaria in endemic regions is important to prevent severe malaria and deaths as a result of a coinfection with SARS-CoV-2.This article represents the first study describing the epidemiology of malaria cases in native communities of Condorcanqui, Amazonas, the first reported P. falciparum outbreak, and the presence of asymptomatic cases. Results presented here are useful to understand malaria transmission in native communities and allow targeted activities for malaria surveillance and control in this area. In conclusion, it is important to improve diagnosis to detect as many asymptomatic and symptomatic cases as possible to promptly treat and prevent the spread of this disease to other communities of Amazonas, Peru. Moreover, the current malaria situation in Condorcanqui is worrying, since lack of follow-up can lead to the establishment of P. falciparum and syndemics with COVID-19.

a71fb80bb1daaf2dc6e3989eca4aa8e22c91db57,Use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials,"On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization's China Country Office was informed by local authorities of pneumonia deaths of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China [1] . After a few weeks, the causative agent was identified as a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease called COVID-19 [2, 3] . In less than 3 months, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic disease [4] .Increased mortality and the fast spread of the disease worldwide have made the scientific community engage in a global effort to find the best treatment for COVID-19. Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), drugs that belong to the quinolone family and are used to prevent and treat malaria, showed effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 in the first in vitro studies [5, 6] . Two initial small clinical trials reported a decrease in the viral load and better clinical recovery with high doses of HCQ use in patients with COVID-19 [7, 8] . Following these results, other observational studies have found unclear results on the beneficial use of HCQ/CQ in any disease phase.Recent randomized clinical trials have not shown better outcomes in patients treated with these drugs. There is much controversy about using this treatment worldwide, and some advocate that these drugs could be helpful at the beginning of the disease in the viral phase. Therefore, considering the contrast of conclusions, we decided to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of data involving the administration of CQ and HCQ in patients with COVID-19 and virological cure, clinical recovery, mortality, adverse effects, need for mechanical ventilation, and hospital discharge.This study is a systematic review of randomized clinical trials. We conducted a review of the databases: PubMed, Lilacs, and Cochrane Library. Studies published until 7 January 2021, were included. The following keywords were used as search terms: 'coronavirus', 'coronavirus disease', 'COVID-19ʹ, 'treatment', 'hydroxychloroquine', 'chloroquine', 'clinical trial'. The references for all selected articles were also retrieved and, due to the urgency of publications related to COVID-19, additional references were searched manually on the MedRxiv prepress server.Two independent authors screened this review. Disagreements were solved through discussion among all authors. Titles and abstracts of retrieved articles were revised to exclude irrelevant studies, followed by screening. Clinical trials were included when they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) COVID-19 patients using HCQ or CQ; (2) patients who did not use HCQ or CQ as a comparison group;(3) randomized controlled trial; (4) examination of the relationship between HCQ or CQ use and time to negative viral nucleic acid test, time to clinical recovery, mortality, adverse effects, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), hospital discharges, or kidney and thromboembolic complications. The study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Items guidelines for Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), and this study has not been registered.Data extraction was performed by two independent authors according to a data collection form. Possible conflicts were discussed with all authors. The information extracted includes authors, year of publication, study design, country of origin, population characteristics (age and sample size), type of treatment, disease severity, duration of follow-up, and measurement of effects for the researched outcomes. They should provide odds ratio (OR), ratio risk (RR), or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Inclusion was not restricted by study size.Two authors independently assessed the quality of the studies according to the Cochrane guidelines [9] . The following five domains were assessed: (1) bias arising from the randomization process; (2) bias due to deviations from the intended interventions; (3) bias due to missing outcome data; (4) bias in the measurement of the outcome; (5) bias in selection of the reported result. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third author.The primary analysis focused on the outcomes: (1) time for negative detection of the viral nucleic acid; (2) time for clinical recovery; (3) mortality of the treated group in comparison to the control group.The secondary analysis focused on the effect of treatment on the emergence of adverse effects, the use of MV, hospital discharge, renal and thromboembolic complications.We performed a stratified analysis by type of treatment: HCQ only, CQ, and HCQ with azithromycin. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed when necessary omitting each study to detect the influence on the estimate of the overall effect.Studies included in the meta-analysis reported RR, OR, or HR. For studies that did not report these measures of effects, the RR calculation was based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews [10] . For studies that reported OR, a corrected RR was computed as already described [11] . HR was considered comparable to RR.Pooled RR and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a fixed or random effects model according to the homogeneity of the studies. The Cochran's Q test and the I 2 statistic were used to evaluate the statistical significance and degree of heterogeneity between the studies, respectively. The result of p ≤ 0.05 for the Q test represents statistical significance, and the statistic I 2 ≥ 50% reveals substantial heterogeneity. Finally, the publication bias will be examined by the Egger test. All analyses were performed with Stata/ SE v.14.1 software (StataCorpLP, USA).The initial search identified one hundred and thirty studies. Of these, 49 were excluded because they were duplicated. Inconsistent trials, non-clinical trials, non-therapeutic, and non-randomized studies were excluded. Of the remaining studies, 12 met the inclusion criteria and were selected for qualitative analysis, and eleven studies were included for the meta-analysis ( Figure 1 ), totaling 7,629 patients. The investigated therapies found were as follows: HCQ in 10 studies, one study investigated HCQ only and HCQ plus azithromycin, and one study CQ therapy. One trial [12] investigated the effect of HCQ on individuals exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19. The basic characteristics of the studies are shown in Table 1 .The data were extracted and pooled from four studies. Three trials [13] [14] [15] studied HCQ only therapy versus usual care, and one trial [16] studied CQ therapy versus lopinavir/ritonavir combination. All trials used throat swab SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid at the beginning of the study to confirm COVID-19 and at the end to confirm the virological cure.Comparing the HCQ group with the control group, the results suggested no significant change in time for the virological cure (RR = 0.96, 95%CI 0.74-1.18). Combined with CQ study results, there was also no change in time for the negative RT-PCR (RR = 1.04, 95%CI 0.91-1.17, P > 0.05) ( Figure 2 ).The data were extracted from six studies that showed no decrease in time for clinical recovery in patients in the treated groups. Five trials [7, 14, 15, 17, 18] studied HCQ only therapy versus usual care, and one trial [16] studied CQ therapy versus lopinavir/ritonavir combination.Combining the six studies, there was also no decrease in the time for clinical recovery (RR = 1.03, 95%CI 0.92-1.13, P > 0.05) ( Figure 3 ).Cavalcanti et al. [19] studied treatments with HCQ only and HCQ plus azithromycin, while Abd-Elsalam et al. [17] , Horby et al. [20] , Lyngbakken et al. [21] , and Self et al. 2020 [18] studied the treatment with HCQ only. The risk estimate for HCQ only was not different from the control group (RR = 1.09, 95%CI 0.98-1.20, P > 0.05). When HCQ with azithromycin was included, the result was similar without statistically significant differences (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.-97-1.20, P > 0.05) (Figure 4) .The data were extracted from seven studies. Five trials (11, 17) studied HCQ only versus usual care, one trial [19] HCQ only versus usual care and HCQ plus azithromycin therapy versus usual care, and one trial [16] studied CQ therapy versus lopinavir/ ritonavir combination. In the first analysis, the treatment with HCQ showed an increased risk of adverse effects (RR = 1.50, 95%CI 1.18-1.81, P < 0.05) compared to the control group. The analysis of all therapies also showed a significant increase in any adverse effects (RR = 1.44, 95%CI 1.21-1.68, P < 0.05) ( Figure 5 ). The need to use MV was extracted from three trials [17, 19, 20] . Analysis of the HCQ only treatment showed no difference when compared to the control group (RR = 1.15, 95%CI 0.92-1.38, P > 0.05). Analysis including the HCQ plus azithromycin treatment also showed no difference with the control group (RR = 1.17, 95%CI 0.94-1.40, P > 0.05) ( Figure 6 ). Hospital discharge analysis was extracted from three trials. Two trials [18, 20] studied HCQ therapy versus usual care and one trial [16] CQ versus lopinavir/ritonavir combination. The analysis revealed that HCQ treatment did not favor the hospital discharge (RR = 0.97, 95%CI 0.74-1.20, P > 0.05). Combined analysis of HCQ and CQ showed no difference when compared to the control group, but with substantial heterogeneity (RR = 1.05, 95%CI 0.73-1.38, P > 0.05, I 2 = 54.6.1%) (Figure 7) .Renal and thromboembolic complications were described by Cavalcanti et al. [19] , but with no differences between the control group and treatment group.The heterogeneity of adverse effects analyses and clinical recovery was investigated by sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analyses showed that excluding one study at a time from the analysis did not change the findings ( Table 2) .For hospital discharges, the exclusion of Horby et al. [20] from the analysis changed the heterogeneity from substantial to moderate (I2 = 54.6% to 27.2%), yet did not alter the results.The results of the estimated bias coefficient were from −0.177 to 0.195, giving a P-value > 0.05 for all analyses. Therefore, the tests provide weak evidence for the presence of publication bias.Among the studies selected for the meta-analysis, four trials [18] [19] [20] [21] were considered as low risk of bias, five [7, [14] [15] [16] 22] as some concerns, and two [13, 17] as high risk of bias. Two trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and nine trials were randomized, open-label, controlled study. The quality assessments of the studies included in the meta-analysis are shown in Figure 8 .Despite all the controversy about HCQ and CQ use for COVID-19 treatment, this meta-analysis did not show any better outcomes in patients using HCQ or CQ when compared to the control group. The results showed no statistical significance in the treatment with HCQ or CQ in achieving virological cure and faster clinical recovery.Yao et al. [23] compared the in vitro effect of HCQ and CQ and showed that both have good antiviral activity, decreasing the replication of SARS-CoV-2. The conclusion of the study that HCQ is more potent in inhibiting viral replication led to prophylactic use. In contrast, Boulware et al. [12] show in their randomized, double-blind clinical trial that prophylactic use of HCQ after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 did not prevent patients' contamination.The literature shows previous in vitro studies with Zika viruses, which demonstrated the efficacy of the antibiotic's inhibitory viral replication effect. However, the drug has not been proven to be effective in humans [24, 25] . Likewise, another in vitro study addressing HCQ and azithromycin in the Ebola viral replication does not bring clear evidence of possible antiviral effect in vivo of the drugs, neither to the increase in the prevention or delay of time of death [26] . That previous evidence of in vitro antiviral effects made the rationale for justifying the use of those drugs as off-label therapy in the COVID-19 pandemic and was disseminated by social media in Brazil [27] .After in vitro studies demonstrated the efficacy of CQ and HCQ against SARS-COV-2, clinical studies were performed. Gautret et al. [8] pointed out a significant decrease in the viral load of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 after treatment with HCQ plus azithromycin compared to the control group. Chen et al. [7] reported a faster clinical recovery in patients with COVID-19 who used HCQ. However, both clinical trials have come under strong criticism. Chen et al. [7] did not disclose the results regarding the use of different doses of HCQ, as previously specified in the study protocol, while the nonrandomized clinical trial by Gautret et al. [8] was harshly questioned for the methodologies adopted and by the exclusion of six patients who had been treated with HCQ from the final results. In addition, Tang et al. [14] found no significant reduction in viral load and faster clinical recovery. This review shows no association between the use of HCQ only or HCQ plus azithromycin and the improved survival of COVID-19 patients. These findings corroborate the meta-analysis of observational studies by Fiolet et al. [28] . The author also reports no substantial evidence to support increased mortality associated with HCQ or HCQ plus azithromycin intake.Nevertheless, the use of these drugs in patients with COVID-19 deserves attention. Additional findings from this review show that the use of these drugs is associated with a 1.44-fold increased risk of adverse effects. The use of CQ and HCQ off-label is highly critical when addressing the adverse effects caused by these drugs. Among them, the most considered is the prolongation of the QTc interval, particularly in individuals with previous risk factors, in whom lethal ventricular arrhythmias are described, such as Torsades de Pointes [29] .Other effects have been described, such as psychosis, delirium, agitation, personality disorder, depression, and sleep disorders [30, 31] . As for the effects of cardiac conduction, other than those already mentioned, we must consider branch block and atrioventricular block [29] . CQ and HCQ uses, when associated with azithromycin, increase the risk of hepatotoxicity [32] , cardiotoxicity, and hypoglycemia [33] .Among the randomized clinical studies included in the meta-analysis, we observed a similarity between the reported adverse effects. Cavalcanti et al. [19] show that side effects were more evident in those patients who used HCQ + azithromycin, with 9 patients presenting complications due to adverse effects. Extending the QTc interval has been described in patients using HCQ and HCQ + azithromycin. Other conduction changes described were arrhythmias, bradycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia. Cavalcanti et al. [19] also highlighted the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism and acute kidney infection as potential complications. Vomiting, abdominal pain, changes in liver enzymes, nausea, diarrhea, skin rash, itching, coughing, and shortness of breath were other adverse effects also described [13, 16, 34] .Lastly, our results also suggest no association between the use of these drugs in patients with COVID-19 and the decreased need for MV and hospital discharges. Similarly, Geleris et al. [35] indicated that the risk of intubation or death was not significantly higher or lower among patients who received HCQ when compared with the control group. Furthermore, Magagnoli et al. [36] showed that the length of stay among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was not shortened by the administration of HCQ with or without azithromycin.This study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis using only randomized clinical trials of patients with COVID-19. This study informs physicians and patients regarding the efficiency of HCQ and CQ in treating COVID-19. Despite the few published clinical trials, the studies selected in this systematic review a total of 7,629 patients. Some limitations of our study were the small number of randomized trials on the use of CQ, different follow-up times between studies, studies performed without blinding, an analysis that mixed different treatments and doses and different treatments in the control group.These results suggest that the use of HCQ or CQ is not associated with decreased viral load, faster clinical recovery, improved survival, decreased need for mechanical ventilation, and decreased hospitalization time for patients with COVID-19. However, it suggests that the use of HCQ or CQ can be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects.",Brazil,first author,2021-02-11,02
bd87cb2189cc717851fbf28384e2f2c613f4fbab,Depressive symptoms among Peruvian adult residents amidst a National Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted health and well-being worldwide. Particular interest has been given to the detriments on mental health due to the disease spread, infection status, and policies to control the pandemic [1] . Although academic circles and mass media have highlighted the critical role of mental health [2] , empirical data is limited, and international guidelines are based mainly on expert recommendations [3] . National health bodies, especially those in high transmission settings, require timely data to plan and implement evidence-based policies to protect mental health during the present crisis.Severe SARS-Cov-2 infections could profoundly impact psychological well-being inducing mental conditions, including fatigue and delirium [4] . Recent evidence points out adverse neurological effects related to severe illness such as encephalopathies, inflammatory central nervous system syndromes, etc. [5] . Besides the direct biological effects of the infection on mental health, public policies, including social distancing and lockdowns, could also increase the burden of psychological reactions due to isolation, domestic violence, and the use of psychoactive substances [6, 7] . Mental health research needs to estimate the disease burden associated with the pandemic and quantify attendant mental health problems.The Americas have become the current epicenter of the pandemic [8] , mounting 31 million cases and 786, 808 deaths as of December 16th [9] Forecasts suggest a sharp increase during the third quarter of 2020, affecting countries like Brazil, Chile, and Peru [10] . Countries' responses to the pandemic in South America have included not only social distancing measures and testing but also mental health support interventions through hotlines, virtual screenings, and telemedicine [11] . Despite these laudable efforts, the effect of the pandemic and control policies on the public's mental health and mitigation of the further spread of COVID-19 is unknown, which challenges the elaboration of national plans and evaluation of these actions.Risk stratification is crucial to bring adequate and timely psychological support to specific populations. Early data revealed an increasing burden of psychosocial reactions in first respondents, such as emergency room (ER) and intensive care unit (ICU) health professionals [12] , findings common in other crises. Nonetheless, the general population has also shown increasing stress and different psychosocial reactions during lockdowns and highly transmission contexts. For instance, in China, youth showed high rates of anxiety and depression disorder [13] , while schoolaged children who remained at home exhibited depressive symptoms [14] .The current scenario demands innovative research methods such as mobile or web-based tools to collect critical information rapidly during the pandemic [15] . However, awareness has been raised around the challenges of using digital tools to collect data [16, 17] . These tools can facilitate the epidemiological response from symptom screening, contact tracing, and quarantine measures.This study aimed to identify and describe the distribution of depressive symptoms' using a web-based questionnaire in the Peruvian population during the national lockdown due to the pandemic. Moreover, we identified associated factors and their magnitude to compare them with regional and global estimates. We report major findings by key strata of geographical location, sex, age, and previous mental health diagnosis.We conducted a cross-sectional study using an opt-in online anonymous questionnaire distributed on social media by key partners: the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Pan American Health Organization Peru country office. Eligible participants were 18 years of age or older, of any nationality, living in Peru, and with access to an internet connection. Supplementary files 1 & 2 show the English and Original versions of the survey.In our final sample, we included all participants who consented to participate, provided sociodemographic variables such as sex, age, education, and geographical location, and completed at least 90% of the questionnaire. The 90% progress level corresponded to the survey's last question about the average monthly household income, already recorded as a categorical variable in a previous question. After completing the selection process, only one response was flagged as spam, and after careful consideration, was included in the final sample. The flowchart in Fig. 1 shows the selection of the analytical sample.The questionnaire was released on PAHO's and MoH's social media accounts, including Twitter and Facebook, on May 4th, almost 6 weeks after the start of the country lockdown. At the moment of the survey launch, Peru was facing the community transmission phase of the pandemic with up to 47,372 COVID-19 cases. Access to start the questionnaire was available for 7 days (May 4th to 11th), and participants had 7 days to complete it since the start date (up to May 18th). We used Qualtrics to design and collect the respondents' data, who needed to validate a captcha code to access the informed consent.The questionnaire included questions about demographic characteristics, mental health, COVID-19 infection, symptoms, and socioeconomic information. Mental health questions mostly referred to the past 2 weeks before completing the questionnaire. These questions included the previous diagnosis of a mental health problem, a sequential testing approach using the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, and the WHO-UNCHR Assessment Schedule of Serious Symptoms in Humanitarian Settings (WASSS) [18] .The PHQ-9 is a standardized screening tool that includes nine criteria for major depression. It has been validated in the Peruvian population [19, 20] and has been used in the national Demographic Health Survey (DHS) in Peru since 2014. Sequential testing, presenting participants, who scored at least 2 points in the PHQ-2, the other seven questions of the PHQ-9 has reported being pragmatic, preserving classification accuracy, and reducing response burden [21] [22] [23] . We used the Spanish version of both tools, PHQ-9 and WASSS, from the Peruvian DHS and the WHO official publication, respectively.At the end of the questionnaire, all respondents were shown information about available mental health hotlines and local community health centers.The primary outcome for this study was the prevalence of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 10 points, major depressive episode) [24] . Respondents that scored less than 2 points in the PHQ-2 were included and were assigned a value less than 10 points. Selected secondary outcomes were anhedonia (PHQ-9), suicidal ideation (PHQ-9), and impaired functioning (WASSS) reported using a Likert scale.We also explored the proportion of respondents who reported having a mental health symptom at least 7 days or more in the past 2 weeks, using items from the PHQ-9 and part A of WASSS by key strata. Supplementary file 3 shows the questions and outcomes in the PHQ-9 and WASSS.We selected four key strata to report the study outcomes: sex, age group, geographical location, and selfreported previous diagnosis of a mental health problem. The latter was a binary variable assessed by the question, ""Have you ever been diagnosed with any mental health problem?"". Geographical location was a categorical variable with four levels: Metropolitan Lima (Lima Province and Callao), Coastal (the coastline of Peru), Andean (the Andean mountainous region), and Amazonian (the Amazonia forest) regions, following the methodology from the Peruvian DHS.We included demographic and socioeconomic information as potential associated factors: education level, household size, employment status, household income, and marital status. Health characteristics were also included, such as the presence of any key comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and immune disease) and COVID-19 infection history (yes/no). We estimated individual weights using raking for all analytical sample observations based on key demographic variables: sex, age, education level, and location to emulate the Peruvian population distribution. Raking used marginal proportions for each variable from the latest Peruvian national census from 2017 [25] ; see Supplementary file 4 for details regarding raking values. All analyses presented in this study used raking weights to calculate proportions and regression estimates.We explored the distribution of PHQ-9 and WASSS items prevalence by geographical location, age group, sex, and prior mental health condition and tested for differences across them. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify associated factors for the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes by prior mental health condition status (yes, no, not responded). We used a series of sex-age adjusted generalized linear models to individually test the association of sociodemographic and health variables, using a Poisson distribution with robust standard errors for the primary outcome and multinomial logistic regressions for secondary outcomes.Sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings included using (1) subsets of data, including those who had 100 and 75% of survey completion, and (2) an alternative PHQ-9 cut-off point for depressive symptoms. Regarding the latter, recent evidence showed that the 10-point cut-off could overestimate the burden of moderate to severe depressive symptoms; we evaluated a recommendation of a threshold of ≥14 [26] .The eligible sample comprised data from 57,446 respondents who were predominantly young adults (72%), female (66%), living in the capital province (53%), and completed undergraduate degrees (47%). Marginal proportions for key sociodemographic variables corresponded to the values from the Peruvian Census 2017 after raking; see Supplementary file 4.Weighted results showed that one-quarter of the sample was unemployed, and a similar proportion reported receiving assistance from the Government during the lockdown. Nearly half of respondents had a monthly household income of less than 1860 PEN (547 USD), although 28% of the sample preferred not to respond. Differences across regions were more evident regarding education level and household income. Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of the participants by geographical location.Respondents with a previous mental health diagnosis were more prevalent in the Capital City (16%) and lowest in the Amazon (13%). These geographical patterns were similar for those who sought mental health care and had at least one contact with the mental health system within 2 weeks before the survey. Around half of those who sought help managed to contact the health system; however, differences persisted by region, detrimental to Amazon residents.We found that more than half of the sample (62%) scored at least 2 points on the PHQ-2, making them eligible to complete all PHQ-9 items. Both items of the PHQ-2, related to anhedonia and depressive mood, affected nearly 30% of the sample most of the time (≥7 days) during the past 14 days. These symptoms were much more frequent among female and young participants. Figure 2 shows the differences in each item and PHQ-9 score by key strata.The 6-item WASSS showed additional psychosocial and functioning symptoms. Disparities by sex, age group, region, and previous mental health diagnosis were consistent with those in the PHQ-9. The absolute sex gap was the widest for feeling angry and out of control as well as for feeling uninterested and did not want to do anything at all most of the time during the past 2 weeks. Impaired functioning affected a fifth of the youngest participants, while hopelessness reached up to 10% for those with a previous mental health diagnosis. Figure 3 shows the differences in each WASSS item by key strata.The PHQ-2 score was highest among those with a previous mental health diagnosis and those who preferred not to answer that question. Similar disparity trends were found for most of the PHQ-9 items. Nearly 35% of respondents had a PHQ-9 score of 10 or more, linked to major depressive episodes. This was slightly higher in the Andes, followed by Metropolitan Lima.The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 59% (95%CI 56.7, 61.4%) among participants who reported having a previous mental health diagnosis, which was similar compared to those who preferred not to respond to this question (60, 95%CI 54, 66.3%) and almost doubled the prevalence among those without a prior diagnosis (30, 95%CI 29.1, 30.9%). Table 2 shows the percentage and 95% confidence intervals of participants with a PHQ-9 score of 10 or more across covariate levels and by previous mental health diagnosis. Depressive symptoms trends by covariate level remained constant across these three groups, showing higher magnitudes in those with a prior diagnosis. There was a dose-response gradient observed by household income level, being higher in those with up to 930 PEN (274 USD) and the lowest with more than 4650 PEN (1368 USD), among those with or without a prior mental health diagnosis. Regression models that included only sex and age revealed that females and young adults show a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than their male or older counterparts. These results were consistent across mental health diagnosis strata. Sexand-age adjusted regression revealed other associated factors: education level, marital status, household income, and presence of at least one chronic comorbidity. Participants with an undergraduate degree or higher had a lower prevalence than those with incomplete high school or less (PR: 0.76, 95%CI 0.69, 0.83, and PR: 0.86, 95%CI 0.76, 0.98; in the group with and without prior mental health diagnosis respectively). Those reporting having a COVID-19 positive diagnosis did not score differently for depressive symptoms than non-cases among those with a previous mental health diagnosis. The dose-response relationship with income was observed despite the sex and age adjustment. The presence of any chronic disease comorbidity was associated with an increased risk for depressive symptoms reaching up to 43% more than in those without comorbidities. Risk and protective factors remain similar among those with and without prior mental health diagnosis, showing higher contrasts by region of residence.An exception was the COVID-19 diagnosis history, which increased the risk for depressive symptoms by around 43% (PR: 1.43, 95%CI 1.34,1.53) among those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Table 3 shows the prevalence ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals.Multivariate analysis for secondary outcomes revealed patterns similar to those depicted in the depressive symptoms results. A particular finding was the higher odds of outcomes in the Andes regions across mental health diagnosis strata. Lastly, those with higher household income showed consistently lower odds of impaired functioning than those at the minimum wage, exhibiting differences up to 50% lower odds than the poorest participants among those with a previous mental health diagnosis (OR: 0.50, 95%CI 0.43, 0.57).Results restricting those responses who completed the survey (n = 50,195) or including those with at least 75% of survey progress (n = 58,731) did not substantially change our main results. It is important to note that the latter group's additional responses did not have data for household income, increasing the portion of missingness for this variable from 0.34 to 2.52%.Sex-and-age adjusted regression estimates using the alternative cut-off point for depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 14) showed similar patterns for key associated factors, including education, employment, and household income. Table 4 shows the regression estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.We found a high mental health burden during the pandemic and lockdown in Peru. Three out of ten participants reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms in the prior 2 weeks. We found substantial disparities by key social variables favoring those with higher household income, education, and employment. Besides, we showed disparities of all psychosocial symptoms by sex, age group, and region. Stratified results by previous mental health diagnosis revealed a two-fold prevalence difference in depressive symptoms among those with a prior diagnosis compared to those never diagnosed. To our knowledge, this is the first study quantifying the mental health burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic with a considerable sample size in Latin America.Our findings reveal an overall prevalence of depressive symptoms five times higher than the one reported previously at a national level in 2018 (34.9% vs. 6.4%, respectively) [27] . Even if we limit our results to those without a prior diagnosed mental health condition, the magnitude of moderate to severe depressive symptoms is still nearly five times higher than the national prevalence. Risk factors such as being a woman, living in the Andes, and having comorbidities increased the probability of depressive symptoms.Contrary to previous evidence in Peru [27, 28] , we found that the younger population was more prone to having depressive symptoms. However, similar results have been found in large samples in the US [29] and the UK [30] during the pandemic, where young adults showed a higher prevalence of severe psychological distress compared to older groups [29] . Another possible explanation is that the pandemic and the measures implemented affect young people and adolescents differently due to their needs, socioeconomic condition, fear, and intolerance to uncertainty [31, 32] . Differences could also be attributed to young adults' higher participation in web surveys, in this particular case participation of those with a prior mental health problem or experiencing psychological distress. Population-based mental health evidence during the pandemic is limited. A recent study in China, which used a web-based survey and reached around 56,000 participants, found 28% of participants had depression, seven percentage points lower than our estimate [33] . There were no other comparable studies, especially in the Americas. Few studies with large sample sizes have been reported across the world. Results from Spain during the early stage of the pandemic [34] show that a third of Spaniards reported moderate to severe psychological impact, particularly women, the young, and the unemployed. Initial results from the COLLATE project suggest increased psychological distress among those with a mood disorder compared to those without reported mental disorders [35] . A social media-based survey in Taiwan [36] found that half of the participants and some 10% reported sleep disturbances and suicidal Values represent independent sex and age adjusted models for each covariate PR prevalence ratio, 95%CI 95% confidence intervals *p-value< 0.05, ** p-value < 0.01, *** p-value < 0.001 thoughts. Similar results were obtained in a small sample of Chinese [37] and Indian [38] adults, showing mild stress but high anxiety levels. Additional studies are being implemented to assess the impact of diverse physical distancing measures [39] .Our research provides a detailed characterization of mental health and psychological symptoms using a sample of around 60,000 respondents during the community transmission phase of the pandemic and lockdown in Peru. This massive participation was possible through a key partnership between PAHO and the Ministry of Health, in a time where the Peruvian Government was communicating COVID-19 information, interventions, plans, and restrictions in their official and social media accounts. Thus, the number of people visiting these sites was abundant, which was reflected in our online questionnaire's participation rates. Moreover, we describe associated factors among participants by a previous mental health condition, providing relevant information for mental health action plans in the COVID-19 pandemic context. For instance, this study's preliminary results were shared with the Ministry of Health in Peru to plan its mental health response [40] . The study has some limitations that are important to consider for the correct interpretations of our findings. First, we did not include other mental health issues such as psychological distress or anxiety in this study. Unlike depression, there were not previous studies on anxiety or distress at the national level to be used as a pre-COVID reference. We believe it is very likely that these problems are also present during this pandemic and lockdown; however, quantifying these problems was beyond the scope of our study.We used an opt-in online survey using social media as the distribution channel to collect information from respondents who had internet access and consented to participate. Internet connectivity in Peru has substantially increased in the past decade, representing 81 and 46.8% among 17-24 and 25+ years old citizens, respectively [41] . Urban areas and the Coastal region have more increased connectivity than their rural, Andean, or Amazonian counterparts. Thus, regional or national results represent those with access to internet connectivity, usually excluding the poorest and most vulnerable.Older adults are the smallest group of social media users; thus, we expected to find a low number of respondents of this age group. Besides adjusting for lower participation in the older population using raking, we encouraged all respondents who stated there is an older adult in the household to complete the survey for themselves. We did not have information about the rurality of the residence. Rural areas are more prevalent in the Andean and Amazonian regions; however, sex-age adjusted models did not found substantial differences by geographical region. We addressed these limitations using raking weights, which optimally balanced the data to known national marginal proportions of age, sex, education, and region of residence from the latest census official data in 2017.Lastly, due to the survey's opt-in nature, selection bias such as volunteer bias is possible. Participants who are experiencing psychological distress or have an existing mental health condition are more likely to participate and complete the questionnaire. We addressed this issue by providing stratified results by previous mental health conditions, which uncovered a depressive symptoms prevalence of 30%, a 5-fold increase with respect to national levels reported in 2019.An increased burden of depressive symptoms and psychosocial reactions emerged during the current pandemic and national lockdown in Peru. The mental health burden is disproportionately affecting participants with lower income and education as well as those unemployed. Peru has proven to be a dynamic country in terms of mental health reform and transitioning from a hospital-centered mental health model towards a community-based model whereby community networks are being established. As the Government is relaxing the social distancing measures and expanding its economic reactivation to phase four, with most businesses open with some restrictions, it is crucial to use local evidence to adjust public health policies and services in mental health to the renewed needs of the Peruvian people.",Peru,abstract,2021-02-18,02
7790a04ec2c82337aa9ba368afc944d7e0506f48,Updated SARS-CoV-2 Single Nucleotide Variants and Mortality Association,"Been transmitted over one year, COVID-19 has caused 100,584,555 cases and 2,167,313 deaths worldwide as of Jan 27, 2021 (1) . The global mortality rate of 2.15% greatly exceeded the estimated seasonal flu death rate in the USA, less than 0.1% according to the 2018-29 data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since its outbreak, diverse viral genomic mutations of SARS-CoV-2 have been observed (2, 3) , including insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (4, 5) , which led to viral protein structure changes that potentially affect the transmission and virulence of COVID- 19 . SNVs have been extensively detected by massive and daily updated whole-genome sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 SNVs presented clustering characteristics (4) in terms of concurrence (5) (6) (7) (8) that is likely to be linked to the complex mechanism of epistatic gene interactions in COVID-19 viral evolution. Therefore, timely updates of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, especially critical SARS-CoV-2 mutations that are associated with COVID-19 mortality rate, become a necessary and important step in the fight against COVID-19. However, such investigations remain scarce due to limited clinical information along with whole-genome sequences (9) (10) (11) .Following our previous report (5), we analyzed a total of 146,045 SARS-CoV-2 high-quality complete genomes downloaded from GISAID after June 1, 2020 (12) . The majority of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have evolved with a dominant SNV cluster represented by non-synonymous mutations A23403G (S: D614G) and C14408T (ORF1ab: P4715L), in addition to C241T at the upstream of ORF1ab and another synonymous mutation C3037T on ORF1ab. According to two-way clustering analysis on SNVs harbored by over 1% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, additional SNVs were uncovered with increasing occurrence ratios over recent months. Even though two dominant amino acid (AA) changes, ORF1ab: 4715L and S: 614G variants, were reported to be strongly correlated with mortality (9), their death rates have been relatively stable. Or at least they were not strongly correlated with occurrence ratios of these two mutations which were carried by over 99% of patients now. Therefore, we did a systematic analysis on geographical distributions of SNVs and their corresponding mortality rates. By performing enrichment analysis on 6,845 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with clinical information, we identified multiple SNVs that were significantly related to COVID-19-associated death. In the meantime, we did protein structure analysis on non-synonymous SNVs showed clashes caused upon mutations, in turn, might contribute to viral transmission and mortality. Some SNVs were also found with tendency of occurrence in intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs) of S and ORF1ab. Our findings can help to better understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 at the genetic level, possibly providing insights into therapeutic intervention and vaccine design in the future.SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing data and available clinical information were downloaded from GISAID from December 2019 to November 20 th 2020. 146,045 genomes with 1,748,802 SNVs along with 156,413 patient clinical information were collected for analysis. After filtering patients with the clinical status of ""unknown"" or ""cryptic"" for bias reduction, 6,845 genomes with clinical information were used for mortality analysis.Candidate SNVs related to mortality were first estimated based on their occurrence rates in the death and non-death group. Enrichment analysis was conducted for each SNV. Fold Change (FC) of one SNV was calculated as the ratio of the SNV occurrence rate within the death group to that within the non-death group, whereas the statistical significance (p-value) was evaluated based on the hypergeometric distribution model (13) .The elastic-net regularized logistic regression model (14) was employed to estimate the relationship between SNVs and mortality rate in individual countries. The elastic net method combines the penalties in Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and Ridge method, including the one with minimum mean cross-validated error as well as the other one resulting in the most regularized model. SNVs with |log2(FC)| > 1 and p-value < 0.05 based on the hypergeometric model were selected as features, while the clinical status (either death or non-death) of samples was set as the dependent variable for the regression model. To estimate the accuracy of the regression model, we took 5-fold crossvalidation by using cv.glmnet function from the glmnet package in R (15) with setting the ""family"" option to ""binomial"". The original samples were shuffled and randomly partitioned into 5 groups. We iteratively chose one group as the test data set for the model that was trained based on the rest 5 groups. The error of final model was generated based on the average of all 5 iterations. Considering the balance between accuracy and fewer number of SNVs, we finally chose the most regularized model given the value of λ that makes the cross-validated error within one standard error of the minimum (lambda.1se) (15) .QHD43416 for S, QHD43417 for ORF3a, QHI42199 for ORF10, and QHD43423 for N.Previously, we discovered four major SNV groups according to the analysis of SNVs in genomes collected before June 2020 (5). Here we analyzed 81,042 more SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from the GISAID database following the exclusion of low-coverage genomes. Same as our previous analysis (5), Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) was used as the reference genome to keep consistency. Approximately 5% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes were completely same with Wuhan-Hu1. In the remaining 95% genomes, a total of 20,477 nucleotide sites were identified to carry SNVs in at least one genome. The 52 SNVs occurring in greater than 3% of genomes were used for two-way clustering in the study.The clustering pattern of SNVs after June 2020 ( Figure 1A) were distinct from the one before June 2020 (5) . Before June 2020, four major basically independent SNV groups were linked to the majority of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. It is not surprised to see that group A of SNVs has prevailed since June 2020, represented by A23403G (S: D614G) and C14408T (OFR1ab: P4715L) (5). This SNV group occupied over 99% of genomes that harbored at least one of 52 SNVs, confirming continuity of variant D614G on S protein (25) (26) (27) (28) . The results also indicated that SARS-CoV-2 evolution has reached a level by almost fully replacing these 4 nucleotides on the original strain, Wuhan-Hu-1. Among the 266 genomes without SNV group A, 246 carried one of the signature SNVs in group C, G11083T (ORF1ab: L3606F) (5). This suggested that ORF1ab: L3606F was mutually exclusive with S: D614G in this population with 66.3% genomes from Singapore. However, the other 95% (n = 4,211) of genomes with G11083T were dominated by instead of independent of group A of SNVs. Another representative SNV (G26144T) previously reported in group C (5) almost disappeared, being detected in only 53 genomes after June 2020. Meanwhile, Group B (T28144C, n = 199) and Group D (G1440A/G2891A, n = 7) (5) nearly diminished in newly collected SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Interestingly, most SNVs in Figure 1A were first identified in SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected before June 2020 (black boxes in Figure 1B ), but their occurrence ratios gradually increased to higher levels (blue-filled boxes in Figure 1B ) after several months. This might suggest potential incubation periods of SNVs during SARS-CoV-2 evolution.In group A.E2, synonymous SNV C27944T (ORF8:H17H) was first found in China in January 2020 and the other one G204T located at upstream of ORF1ab) was identified in USA in March 2020. Although C27944T on ORF8 is a synonymous mutation, it falls in a stem-loop structure of ORF8 which may influence ORF8 translation (29, 30) . The A.E2 group had a very similar temporal pattern to that of A.E1, presenting high recent concurrence ratios ( Figures 1C and 1D ).Two more SNVs on S, C21614T and C24334T, were identified in group A.E3. C21614T caused AA change on S: L18F, which was found lurking in human since February 2020 in England. The origin of C24334T can be traced back to Japan in March 2020. Similar to A.E1 and A.E2 groups, the occurrence ratio of A.E3 rose quickly since August 2020 ( Figure 1C ). They were carried by about 48% of new SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected in November. Although over 98% of these SNVs were found in England, we also observed 0.6% in Denmark.In order to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 SNVs and the mortality rate, we analyzed a total of 6,845 genomes with clinical information downloaded from GISAID. Among them, 665 samples (9.7%) were defined as death group with keywords ""death""/""deceased""/""Hospitalized, deceased"" in the clinical information, while the non-death group contains the genomes with all the other patient status. The monthly mortality rate kept an increasing tendency from December 2019 to April 2020 with a peak death ratio of 18.5% and mainly decreased in the following months ( Figure 2A ). The mortality rates seemed independent of the total number of collected patient samples.In Brazil, the top three SNVs includes two non-synonymous mutations: G25088T (S: V1176F) and C12053T (nsp7: L71F), together with T25A at upstream of ORF1a and ORF1ab ( Figure 3A ). About 73.9% of death cases carried G25088T while only 13.7% of non-death cases harbored this mutation (odds ratio of 17.80) in Brazil. Similar to G25088T, C12053T and T25A showed notable enrichment in the death group with odds ratios of 6.95 and 5.74, respectively. In USA ( Figure 3B G204R). These three SNVs basically simultaneously occurred, covering 40.5% of genomes in the death group and 11.9% of non-death cases with odds ratio of 5.04. India is the country that has the secondlargest number of COVID-19 patient samples following Brazil in our study pool. However, the numbers of death group and the non-death group were very imbalanced (78 death cases and 725 non-death cases). 31 SNVs were identified to be significantly enriched in the death group ( Figure 3D ), although much fewer genomes carrying these SNVs. The top three SNVs, one non-synonymous mutation G16078A (nsp12: V880I) and two synonymous ones, G10396T on nsp5 and G21207T on nsp16, were detected in both the death and non-death group with an odds ratio of 3.66, 28.96, and 14.46, respectively. All other SNVs were observed only in very few numbers of the death genomes. The imbalance between death and nondeath sample sizes was observed in Italy as well (15 vs 458, Figure 3E ). But unlike India, 10 SNVs significantly enriched in the death group also presented much higher occurrence ratios in the group, although only 15 death-related genomes were collected in Italy. For example, the top two SNVs C7639T (nsp3: F1640F) and G20398A (nsp15: E260K) were identified in 40.0% and 20.0% of death cases compared to only 7.42% and 0.87% of non-death cases, respectively. Very few genomes harbored both SNVs simultaneously, suggesting the independence or mutual exclusion of SNVs C7639T and G20398A.Surprisingly, none of SNVs identified above was observed among any two of these five countries ( Figure   3F ).Intrinsic disordered region (IDR) in a protein represents an unfixed or disordered three-dimensional structure due to lack of sufficient hydrophobic AAs (31, 32) . The AA composition may influence the IDR conformational state, further resulting in variations of functional elements within IDRs and protein function alteration. IDRs determined from experiments cover 28.0% of S protein sequence, 27.6% of ORF3a protein sequence, and 3.8% of ORF1ab polyprotein respectively (31, 32) . Non-synonymous SNVs were found on approximately 62.3%, 65.7%, and 94.6% of S, ORF1ab and ORF3a, respectively ( Figure 4I ).Significantly higher SNV occurrence ratios were observed in IDRs of S (79.0%, p = 1.7×10 -15 ) andThe decreased hydrophobicity and increased mass upon mutation from S to N may affect the flexibility of this region and the binding of S protein to ACE2. Another mutation C21614T (S: L18F) in emerging group A.E3 SNV is located in N-linked glycan sites, which likely play a role in protein folding and immune evasion and may have implications in viral virulence and vaccine design (34) . Other mutations in IDRs of S, e.g., C21575T (L5F), G25049T (D1163Y), G25062T (G1167V), are located nearby N-linked glycan sites (11, 1, and 5 residues, respectively). They may have impacts on glycosylation which in turn play a role in protein folding and immune evasion.In this study, we monitored group structure changes of SARS-CoV-2 SNVs over time by comparing clustering results before and after June 2020. The representative SNVs in group A (5) had become dominant by covering over 99% of detected SARS-CoV-2 genomes since June 2020, while two other groups (B and D) were detected in less than 0.3% of the population. The occurrence ratio of group C SNVs also reduced compared to the previous result before June 2020 (5) . While the majority of groups A and C SNVs were observed as mutually exclusive with each other before June 2020, 95% of genomes harboring the representative SNV in the group C, G11083T (ORF1ab: L3606F), also carried group A SNVs after June 2020, confirming the ruling role of group A in current SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Several emerging SNVs, e.g., groups A.E1-E3, co-occurred with group A representative SNV, S: D614G, in United Kingdom and other Northern European countries ( Figures 1B-1C) . The occurrence ratios of these subgroup SNVs had increased quickly since August 2020. For example, group A.E1 SNVs, represented by C22227T (S: A222V), G29645T (ORF10:V30L), and C28932T (N: A220V), increased from 10% in August to 70% in November of all samples in the same month, while the occurrence ratios of group A.E2, C27944T and G204T, and group A.E3, C21614T (S: L18F) and C24334T, increased to about 60% and 50%, respectively, during the same time period The results indicate that these SNV groups might make virus more contiguous. Our systematic study revealed that apart from the A.E1-3, more SNV groups occurred more than 3% of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes with distinct temporal patterns, even though some of them did not clearly show increasing trend over time (Figure 1 ). Cautions should be taken to monitor these SNVs with collectively dynamic changes.In December 2020, a set of 23 changes or mutations (VUI-202012/01) were found to possibly drive infections in United Kingdom (35, 36) . The set of signature variants includes 8 changes from S protein: deletion 69-70, deletion 144-145, N501Y (A23063T), A570D (C23271A), D614G, P681H (C23604A), T716I (C23709T), S982A (T24506G), D1118H (G24914C). Virus with these mutations were reported to be up to 70% more transmissible than previous strains, although there was ""considerable uncertainty""With integration of the clinical information, 30 SNVs were identified as significantly over-represented in the group associated with COVID-19 related death. The enrichment analysis as well as logistic regression model uncovered several SNVs as mortality-correlated for individual countries. For instance, G25088Tand several other SNVs were observed significantly enriched in death cases in Brail. It can be adopted in a logistic regression model together with T25A, G29861T, and G29864A to predict the mortality status in Brazil. Regardless of potential biased sampling from limited genomes with clear clinical information, none of these mortality related SNVs were associated with any of two countries concomitantly. In other words, the SNVs related to mortality status were specific to the country, suggesting that it was not only SNVs themselves but also other unknown geographical features, e.g., potential environmental and human health factors, can contribute to COVID-19 lethality.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-01,02
c070c1bea6ba5e70f7cbaf333e60b00235132b35,Modelling the Impact of Delaying Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2 Assuming Unlimited Vaccines Supply,"As the world struggles to implement vaccination schemes against SARS-CoV-2, limited production of doses, imperfections in planning vaccine acquisition and difficulties in implementing distribution among the population, have hampered the control of the virus so far [1] . As of 18 February 2021, 188 million people have been vaccinated around the world, which represents less than 3% of the total. In Brazil, the total number of vaccinated people so far is, around 2.5% of the target population [2] . The world vaccination rate currently is less than 4 million doses per day, a very timid rate [3] .Soit is no surprise that vaccination by itself has had so far little effect on the number of cases and deaths that continues to soar in many countries. At the moment we have more than 109 million cases and 2.4 million deaths around the world [4] .Although previous pandemics have demonstrated that pharmaceutical interventions are less important than non-pharmaceutical intervention in controlling the infection, there is a growing body of evidences that this will not be the case with the vaccines against COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] [8] .Immediately after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China, many laboratories around the world started the development of more than 100 types of different vaccines, short-circuiting in less than one year the usual time frame of new vaccines development and testing, which normally would be around ten years, a remarkable tour of force [6] , [9] .There is a wide range of covid-19 vaccines being developed [ However, in order to have significant impact on the course of the pandemic, safe and effective vaccines have to emerge in less time that it would take the affected populations to reach natural herd immunity because to wait to have herd natural immunity would be disastrous. Therefore, an unprecedented time-schedule to roll out any effective vaccine is urgently needed. Nevertheless, in many countries the vaccination is limited to certain individual groups and the distribution of enough doses for these individuals is very slow. We have at the moment only 188 million doses applied in 64 countries around the world [11] .The model is an extension of the one presented in [15] and has the following variables: 1) Susceptible individuals, denoted S(t), which can either be vaccinated with rate ν, or acquire the infection with rate β. Susceptible are born with rate Λ and die by other causes with rate μ;2) Vaccinated individuals, denoted V(t), which are transferred from the susceptible state with the vaccination rate ν. The vaccine is assumed to have efficacy q and a fraction w of the susceptible complies with the vaccination policy. Vaccinated individuals die by other causes with rate μ;3) Failure to be immunized individuals, denoted FV(t). A fraction (1-q) of those vaccinated susceptible fail to be immunized, and can either acquire the infection with the same rate β as those non-vaccinated susceptible or die by other causes with rate μ; 4) Exposed individuals, denoted E(t), are those individuals who acquired the infection but are still in the stage that precedes either the overtly diseased patients or the asymptomatic individuals (see below). Exposed individuals can either progress to an asymptomatic stage with rate δ A , or to full-blown COVID-19 patients with rate δ I or die by other causes with rate μ. A fraction p E of those exposed are infective to susceptibles; 5) Asymptomatic (or pauci-symptomatic) individuals, denoted A(t), who progressed from the exposed and are, therefore, infected with SARS-CoV-2 but show no or very few symptoms.The total number of cases, Cases, is given by:The total number of deaths, Deaths due to COVID-19,is given by:The total number of vaccinated individuals, Vaccinated, is given by:In equation (6), T means time to reach herd immunity (HI). We simulated model (1) with the parameters as in Below we show the results of the numerical simulations of the model.and vaccine efficacy of 70%) was considered.In figure 6 we show the results of the same simulation as in Figure 5 with several vaccination scenarios, varying compliance, efficacy and data of the starting of the campaign.We fitted the model parameters simultaneously to the data of cumulative number of reported cases, deaths and the number of ICU patients (figure9) for the State of Sao Paulo until December 18, 2020.The fitting procedure is described in [16] , [17] .To estimate a 95% probability interval (shaded area in figure 9 ), we assumed a normal distribution for the contact rate with a standard deviation of 1.0%.The model has some important limitations worth mentioning, the most important is perhaps that it does not consider age-dependence in incidence of the infection and in the mortality rates. However, the model was intended to simulate a mass vaccination campaign that would include all age strata in a relatively short period of time. In addition, we considered only the original variant of the virus, which means that our results represent a lower bound in the number of cases and deaths due to vaccination delay. The current scenario of the pandemic, in which new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging in some countries [20] should be considered in the simulation of future vaccination models, but there is not enough empirical evidence of the impact of these new variants as related to the vaccine efficacy.In conclusion, our model shows that the current delay in the vaccination schedules, that is observed in many countries, has serious consequences in terms of mortality by the disease and should serve as an alert to health authorities to speed the process up such that the highest number of people to be immunized is reached in the shortest period of time.This work was partially supported by LIM01-HFMUSP, CNPq, FAPESP and Fundação Butantan.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-23,02
db649ac63c552f68b28bb729ff32ce1c5ff0146a,Clinical presentation and outcomes of the first patients with COVID-19 in Argentina: Results of 207079 cases from a national database,"a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS--CoV-2) was reported in the city of Wuhan, China [1] . Since then, coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly across different continents with a large number of people being infected in a short period of time, thereby challenging the healthcare system capacity and resources throughout the planet, such that on March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic [2] . Countries adopted different response strategies according to the speed of contagion and local characteristics of affected cases [3] . Intriguingly, significant differences have been reported in the demographics, clinical features, admission rates, need for intensive care admission, and overall outcomes among different countries and settings [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The arrival of the virus to Latin America posed a great challenge and became a focus of attention and concern for the WHO [9] . The first case of COVID-19 in Argentina was reported on March 3rd, 2020. A national lockdown was imposed on March 20th, 2020 with various levels of implementation across the country, and is still in effect at the time of submission. To contain the COVID-19 spread, the government implemented a national lockdown as of March 20th, 2020, with various levels of implementation across the country, and is still ongoing at the time of submission. On July 31st, 2020, the Ministry of Health released a report stating the reinforcement of the health system by increasing the number of ICU beds by 40%, including professionally trained staff and critical care support infrastructure. Twelve new modular hospitals were opened in the geographic areas where most COVID-19 cases seemed to be concentrated. On January 10 th in 2021, the Ministry of Health reports indicated a total of 1,714,409 confirmed cases, with 1,504,330 patients having recovered and 44,417 had died.Most of the available evidence on COVID-19 characteristics and clinical features has been based on studies of hospitalized patients, with only a few reports based on population wide datasets [10] [11] [12] [13] . Furthermore, there is only a paucity of studies reporting the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients in Latin America [11, [14] [15] [16] . The COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant challenge particularly in low to middle-income countries (LMIC) of the region, as interventions such as social distancing are challenging if not virtually impossible to implement in large overcrowded urban areas, and issues such as concurrent dengue outbreaks and limited testing capacity may further impede efforts to stop the spread [17] . Understanding features associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and adverse prognostic factors is therefore crucial to guide local health authorities in their quest to allocate their resources more efficiently and avoid over-stressing the already constrained healthcare system. The goal of the present exploratory study is to describe the clinical characteristics and severity of disease at the time of their initial evaluation of a large cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 over the initial 6 months since the first case was declared in Argentina, and to report on patient outcomes while assessing for potential underlying risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or with death.The COVID-19 database of the Integrated Argentine Health Information System (Sistema Integrado de Información Sanitaria Argentina (SIISA)) which includes all recorded cases in Argentina from March 3rd to October 2nd, 2020. SIISA uses a case report form based on the revised tool provide by the WHO for confirmed Novel Coronavirus COVID-19. In addition, the SIISA form includes information on contact history, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical diagnosis as defined by the attending physicians at the time of initial evaluation (clinical and radiological evidence of pneumonia, severe pneumonia and presence of respiratory failure) [18] . The case report form used herein is provided in the S1 Appendix. Data were collected at the initial site of care and regional healthcare authorities conducted follow up assessments via telephone calls.Only cases meeting a definition of suspected COVID-19 (as of April 16th, 2020 the current case definition includes two or more of the following symptoms: fever � 37.5˚C, cough, odynophagia, shortness of breath, anosmia or dysgeusia) were subjected to testing as per guidelines issued by the National Ministry of Health in Argentina. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as having a positive result through either sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis. The presence of comorbidities was evaluated by the attending physicians using no standardized definitions. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death.The study database was obtained and processed by the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases ""Dr. Emilio Coni"" which acted as data custodian. The study protocol was approved by the Independent Review Board of Hospital Zonal de Trelew, Chubut. According to National Law 25326. In the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic, written consent was waived for this type of epidemiological studies16, whereby data were anonymized to preserve confidentiality, analyzed and interpreted by the authors. All the authors reviewed the manuscript and checked for the accuracy and completeness of the data as well as for the adherence of the study to the protocol.Continuous variables were described as means and standard deviation (SD), medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Categorical variables were presented as absolute values and percentages. Continuous variables were compared using the independent group t tests (normal distribution). Categorical variables were compared by χ-square tests. The association between demographic characteristics, baseline symptoms, clinical diagnosis and comorbidities with adverse outcomes (admission to ICU or death) were evaluated using Odds Ratios (OR).Initially, an unadjusted (univariate) analysis was performed between variables and the statistical significance of the OR was evaluated using χ-square tests. Subsequently, associations were analyzed adjusting all the variables by binary logistic regression. Covariates significantly associated with increased risk in the univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 1 version 25.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States).During the study period, 2,078,326 subjects fulfilled the definition of a suspected case. Of these, 1,919,918 (92.4%) were tested by rt-PCR, and a positive result was recorded in 738,776 cases (i.e., positivity rate: 38.5%). Complete datasets were available for 207,079 COVID-19 cases (C1: 28.1%) (Fig 1) . When comparing the data from the total number of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, but with missing data in key variables (C2) with C1 cases, the latter were older (mean age: 42.9 vs. 38.6 years, p < 0.001), were less frequently male (50.0% vs. 51.3%, p < 0.001) and were more likely to be severe cases (hospital admission: 20.1% vs. 5.7%, p < 0.001, ICU admission: 2.7% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001, deaths: 5.3% vs. 1.8% p < 0.001) ( Table 1) .Baseline characteristics of C1 cases are presented in Table 2 . The vast majority of cases (84.2%) which tested positive (n = 174,300) lived in the city of Buenos Aires and in the province of Buenos Aires. The initial evaluation was performed in a public healthcare facility in 65.8% of the cases (n = 136,313). Infections were deemed attributable to community transmission in 103,059 (57.9%) and to close contacts in 51,573 (29.0%). A history of travel abroad was present in 0.37% (n = 653). Healthcare workers accounted for 10.6% of C1 cases (n = 18,809).The mean age of the cohort was 42.9±18.8 years, with 80.7% being younger than 60 years of age. The sample comprised 50.0% men and 50.0% women. At least one underlying disease was reported in 41.0% (n = 84,916). Hypertension was the most frequent coexisting disorder (19.2%), followed by diabetes (9.7%), asthma (6.1%) and obesity (5.2%). Current tobacco smoking was reported by 2.0%, and 2.6% were former smokers ( Table 2) .The most common symptoms were fever (58.5%), cough (58.0%), headache (45.4%), and sore throat (42.1%). General symptoms such as fatigue (32.9%) and myalgia (27.0%), were less common. Anosmia was reported in 25.7% and dysgeusia in 18.9%, and these symptoms were included in the definition of suspected cases as of June 8th, 2020. Gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 21% (diarrhea 9.9%, abdominal pain 4.5%, vomiting 3.9%, anorexia 2.7%). Neurological complaints including confusion (1.1%), irritability (1.1%), seizures (0.2%) and coma (0.2%) were rare ( Table 2 ).Median time elapsed between initial symptoms and database entry was 4.2 days (IQR: 2-5 days). Median time to ICU admission was 5.8 days (IQR: 1-8 days) and median time to death was 16 days (IQR: 7-21 days). Median time of days between ICU admission and death was 11.7 days (IQR: 4-16 days).Admission to ICU occurred in 2.7% of C1 cases (n = 5,652) while the total case fatality rate was 5.3% (n = 10,913). Those cases admitted to general wards and ICU were older (54.2±22.3 years and 63.6±17.4 years, respectively). Mean age of deceased patients was 72.0±14.4 years. Men were more likely to require ICU care (61.9% vs. 38.1%; p<0.05) and to die from COVID-19 (57.4 vs. 42.6%; p<0.05). No comorbidities were reported in 13.9% of cases admitted to ICU and in 9.5% of those who died. Only 3.5% of the whole sample had clinical or radiological characteristics consistent with pneumonia, while 3.6% presented respiratory failure, and only 1.6% appeared as severe pneumonia on admission. These figures increased to 22.0%, 28.6% and 17.5% respectively in ICUadmitted patients. The composite outcome (i.e., ICU admission or death) occurred in 17,995 cases (8.7%). In the univariate analysis, the mean age of patients with adverse clinical course evolution was 69.4±16.4 years vs. 41.1±17.5 years (p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with unfavorable clinical course presented more frequently with hypertension (52.1%), diabetes (26.8%), and obesity (12.2%) ( 30 ; p<0.05) and liver disease (adjOR: 2.14 95% CI: 1.65-2.61; p<0.05). In addition, asthma (adjOR: 0.86 95% CI: 0.67-0,95; p = 0.004) was also independently associated with adverse outcomes but interestingly suggestive of a protective effect, while neither current (adjOR: 1.08 95% CI: 0.96-1.23; p = 0.960) nor previous smoking (adjOR 1.00 95%CI: 0.92-1.09; p = 0.202) were associated with increased composite outcomes risk (Table 4 and Fig 2) .The results of this nationwide study among COVID-19 patients from Argentina show that although most of the cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in our database had a favorable outcome, the case fatality rate (CFR), was higher than reported in other studies. However, when we included both C1 and C2 cases, the CFR was similar to those reported in other settings [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Notwithstanding the fact that the majority of the C1 cases occurred in young subjects with no comorbidities, multivariate analysis identified a cluster of risk factors associated with adverse outcomes with many of these being similar to those reported elsewhere [4] . The most frequent symptoms in this large cohort were fever and cough, followed by headache and odynophagia, with anosmia and dysgeusia being less frequent, and predominantly occurring among milder cases (please note that these two symptoms were only included in the case definition several months later). Nevertheless, hospital admission was required in 20% of the cases, while ICU care was reported in a small percentage of patients, albeit accounting for approximately 50% of the mortality. Although only a minority of cases had a clinical or radiological diagnosis of pneumonia on admission, a diagnosis of severe pneumonia was associated with poorer prognosis. Patients admitted to ICU were older with a male predominance. Age, comorbidities, and several symptoms on initial evaluation-particularly coma, dyspnea and confusion-were also associated with ICU admission or death.Our results suggest that ICU admission rate was lower than the pooled 32% summarized in a meta-analysis of 50 studies [19] . However, the ICU mortality rate in this study was high (56.2%). ICU mortality in COVID-19 patients varies widely among the published case series, ranging from 16% to 78% [20] . The CFR of 5.3% reflects the inclusion of cases with complete data, which were also the most severe. A less stringent CFR estimate including all the cases (i.e., C1 and C2) would have resulted in a CFR of 2.7%. Reported CFRs varied from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy [21] . The CFR in this study may reflect a younger population with less burden of comorbidities, hospital admissions with a broader case definition, lower pressure on the healthcare systems as cases mostly concentrated in large metropolitan districts with more resilient healthcare systems and expanded hospital bed capacity, attenuated community transmission and improved adherence to lockdown measures during the period covered by this study. However, the ongoing propagation of the outbreak and the ensuing strain on healthcare may lead to radical changes in CFR, since more vulnerable healthcare systems in smaller towns and provinces with less resources may be more adversely impacted and more stressed [22] , similar to the observed trends in other countries in the region [23] .The burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel has been a matter of concern. The frequency of cases among such workers was 10.6%, higher than initially described for China, but lower than reported in the U.S., Spain and Brazil [24] [25] [26] [27] . The emerging occupational risk of contracting COVID-19 in this group is a strong concern for LMIC, considering the need for isolation of the affected personnel and their teammates, which will undoubtedly place an additional strain on the healthcare systems where human resources are already scarce [28] .The frequency of symptoms in our sample was comparable to other studies [29, 30] . Time from symptom onset to consultation was also similar to findings in the UK [6] . Twenty-one percent of the patients presented digestive symptoms upon admission, the most common being anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Frequency of these symptoms was higher in our series than the pooled prevalence of 15.0% presented in a systematic review of the literature [31] . Table 3 . Association between clinical features of cases and adverse outcome (Intensive care unit admission or death) (n = 207079, p values < 0.05 unless specified otherwise). Presence of tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, a clinical picture of pneumonia, or the presence of respiratory failure or severe pneumonia were indicative of poor prognosis. Similarly, neurological symptoms such as mental confusion, coma, and seizures were also associated with higher mortality. The presence of encephalopathy in COVID-19 has been attributed to tissue hypoxia, metabolic derangements with agitation and confusion, and these were reported in 5.1% of cases [32] . In this study the prevalence of confusion, coma and seizures was 1.5%. In our series, only 3.5% of cases had radiologic or clinical evidence of pneumonia on initial evaluation. While a majority of COVID-19 patients presented with mild illness and are not diagnosed with pneumonia, opacities in CT have been reported in up to 55.4% of non-critically ill patients [10, 33] . Previous case series have reported that computed tomography is more sensitive than chest X-ray for the detection of pulmonary involvement [34] . Initial chest X-ray may be normal in up to 63% of patients who may later develop clinical or radiological signs of pneumonia [35] . The low frequency of diagnosis of pneumonia may reflect a limited use of CT scans in the evaluation of mild cases in our clinical settings. However, the diagnosis of pneumonia on initial evaluation was associated with a poorer time course of the disease and was present in 22.0% of the patients admitted to ICU.An association between older age and adverse clinical outcomes has been uncovered very soon in the course of the pandemic, being reported already in the first published studies. In the present study, the risk associated with older age (particularly in those > 80 years) was prominently higher than previously published and needs to be compared with results from other LMIC [6, 12, 13] .We should also point out that even though most of COVID-19 cases reported no comorbidities, some patients with no risk factors required ICU admission or died. The factors associated with such unique susceptibility are unclear and may reflect genetic elements altering the immune response to the virus [36, 37] . Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and smoking were present in a lower proportion than findings from local population-based studies. The National Risk Factor Survey found a self-reported prevalence of hypertension of 34.7%, as well as 25.3% for obesity, 12.7% for diabetes and 22.5% for current smokers [38] . It is plausible that the exposed population during a period of national lockdown was composed mainly of those employed in essential activities, and this group would therefore be younger and suffer from less comorbidities than the general population. However, the possibility of underreporting of previous underlying conditions cannot be excluded with complete certainty.As previously described, patients with an unfavorable clinical evolution were more likely to have a history of immunosuppression, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac, asthma, hepatic or renal failure, neurological diseases, cancer and COPD [6] . After an adjusted analysis, the association with these risk factors remained significant in line with the findings of other studies [13, 39, 40] . Our findings suggest that comorbidities and age were independently associated with adverse outcomes, thereby corroborating other studies [11] . Asthma has been found to be prevalent among patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 but has not been consistently associated with a poorer prognosis [6, [40] [41] [42] . Our results are in line with these findings, albeit pointing to reduced risk for asthmatic patients, as heterogeneously reported for other countries of Latin America as well [43] . A history of smoking was not associated with the composite adverse outcome. Meta-analyses have found that current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications, disease progression and a higher mortality rate [44, 45] . Considering that the prevalence of smoking in our population is lower than reported by national surveys (22.5% in adults), smoking status may have been unreported in proportion of our sample yielding underestimates of its potential contribution.To our knowledge this is one of the first studies reporting the clinical presentation and outcomes of a nationwide sample of COVID-19 patients in South America. It includes a large number of patients with COVID-19 evaluated at admission and comprises a wide spectrum of severity of presentation, from those with minor symptoms to those requiring admission to the intensive care unit. It presents results from a nationwide population, of diverse social backgrounds, receiving their care in healthcare centers with different access to resources, both public and private, with caregivers with various levels of medical training, scattered throughout the country. It depicts a real-life picture of the clinical presentation and evolution of a disease which is still evolving and fraught with substantial uncertainties.Our study has some limitations that deserve mention. Information was obtained from the Official Registry System for the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. The counts for coronavirus disease deaths are based on mortality data provided by the 24 provinces in Argentina. This process can take several weeks for death records to be confirmed. Therefore, the data shown on this study may be incomplete, especially for the deaths that occurred in the more recent time periods.Data were collected using a standardized form, and we restricted analyses only to those cases with complete datasets, which represent only 28% of total positive cases. We cannot exclude the possibility that other cases may have not been registered since they may have avoided seeking medical attention. Such possibility could, if of significant magnitude, affect the overall frequency of complications or adverse outcomes related to infection with the virus. In addition, referral and clinical bias could also be a limitation for our study. Indeed, we had no access to hospital record data to include laboratory results or detailed clinical course. Data on symptoms and comorbidities can be incomplete due to the nature of a registry based on point-of-care case report forms. Furthermore, definitions of comorbidities and clinical diagnosis were not standardized. Given that the case definition used to decide whether to perform an rt-PCR test evolved, data on symptoms were subject to variability. Cases with atypical presentations, such as apyrexia or anosmia could have been missed in the initial stages of the pandemic since they were not considered in the case definitions. As previously mentioned, in the early stage of this registry a significant proportion of suspected COVID-19 cases were admitted to hospitals regardless of severity, consequently increasing the proportion of admitted cases. Associations obtained from our regression model should not be considered causal, as some degree of unmeasured confounding and reporting bias can be expected, particularly in the context of a cross-sectional design.We believe our findings can be generalized for Latin American countries. The predominant route of contagion in Argentina now is community acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, with IgG seroprevalence values of 53.4% having been reported in urban slum dwellers in the city of Buenos Aires [46] .Our findings should be useful for healthcare providers and healthcare authorities in LMIC and in countries of the Latin America region, as background information for estimates on the evolution of the pandemic. Severe cases can be identified based on the predictors we describe herein, and may help to prioritize attention, make site-of-care decisions, and allocate resources. Risk groups can be protected with tailored measures. ",Argentina,abstract,2021-02-11,02

9a3727d16bf936ffbfdff22ea5928ff528234ff3,"COVID-19, immunoprivilege and structural inequalities","to become common practice around the world (Hart 2020) . If implemented, it would disproportionately harm the global poor who will likely have limited access to the vaccine. As such, it appears we should take the possibility of future immunoprivilege seriously. I contend, however, that this perspective is flawed. On my view, immunoprivilege already exists, and represents a serious and immediate danger to marginalized groups. To investigate this claim further, I begin by reviewing in more detail the issues raised by immunity passports. Afterwards, I examine the ways in which immunoprivilege already operates within the US, and its impact on marginalized communities throughout the pandemic.Within the literature, there are two prominent objections against the use of immunity passports. First, the biomedical-epidemiological objection that, so far, studies have not proven that prior infection necessarily renders one immune against reinfection. For instance, in a study published in Nature Microbiology, researchers found that those who have tested positive for COVID-19 continued to produce antibodies for approximately six weeks to three months afterwards, depending on the severity of their case (Seow et al. 2020) . Meanwhile, other studies have found that, even in the absence of antibodies, certain white blood cells (B cells and T cells) may continue to offer COVID-19 immunity for some time after infection (Cox and Brokstad 2020) . Nevertheless, as Natalie Kofler and Françoise Baylis argue, unless this is confirmed, granting immunity passports presents a high-risk public health initiative (Kofler and Baylis 2020) . Moreover, even if scientists determine that reinfection is impossible, ""tens to hundreds of millions of serological tests would be needed for a national immunity certification programme"" (Kofler and Baylis 2020). Not only would that level of testing likely be unfeasible, but serological tests are not entirely reliable. The possibility of false positives and false negatives further complicates the manner. If too many people without antibodies are granted passports, it may lead to more outbreaks if they become infected. Meanwhile, if those with antibodies are denied passports, it may prevent them from accessing social and economic resources.The latter is intimately tied to the second objection regarding the social and political ramifications of immunity passports. In particular, some scholars, such as Insa Marie Schmidt, argue that these passports may exacerbate existing social inequalities by justifying and even enabling discrimination (Schmidt 2020) . It is a system that would benefit the ""immunoprivileged"" by potentially restricting accessibility to employment, housing, and even where one could shop for essential goods and services. In many ways, it would parallel discrimination against the ""unacclimated"" in the Deep South during the mid-1800s (Olivarius 2019) . During that period, rates of yellow fever were high, and thousands died from it. Those who survived were deemed ""acclimated"" and given preferential treatment for economic, political, and social opportunities. This system also served to justify further discrimination against immigrants and nonwhites. Indeed, it created a situation wherein marginalized groups would willingly expose themselves to the disease to try to become ""acclimated,"" regardless of whether they had access to healthcare (Olivarius 2019).Nevertheless, some scholars have advocated for their use. Rebecca Brown, Julian Savulescu, Bridget Williams, and Dominic Wilkinson argue that such passports may be useful for restoring a sense of normality to many individuals. For example, they would be able to move around more freely, not have to abide by all social distancing guidelines, and even return to work. This, in turn, would have several beneficial social effects, especially by alleviating the economic strain of the pandemic (Brown, Savulescu, Williams and Wilkinson 2020) . Similarly, Govind Persad and Ezekiel Emanuel argue that immunity passports may allow us to further protect vulnerable populations by providing safer care. For instance, they suggest that preferential hiring of immune individuals to work at nursing homes or hospitals could help reduce the spread of the virus, while also protecting those most at risk. On their view, preferential treatment for immune individuals does not ""violate equal treatment because the factors used to grant a license [or passport] are not discriminatory, like race or religion, but instead grounded in relevant evidence"" (Persad and Emanuel 2020) . Importantly, despite these endorsements, all of these scholars recognize the need for safeguards to prevent these passports from exacerbating existing inequalities.Such concern is crucial. It is already the case that millions of people within the US (and abroad) suffer the adverse effects of oppressive systems, such as racism, sexism, ableism, classism, homophobia, among many others. Moreover, the fact that many of these prejudices have been medicalized in the past demonstrates all too clearly the ability of scientific knowledge to be leveraged to justify discrimination. In light of that history, it is worth considering a more basic question: does immunoprivilege already exist within the US? I contend that it does -immunoprivilege is already present within the existing framework of structural inequalities. The present pandemic offers us many examples of this. Consider essential workers. With the implementation of shelter-in-place orders, many found themselves either working remotely from home, laid-off or unemployed. The exceptions were those working in essential services, or services deemed vital to the health and welfare of the country.By and large, essential services are provided by blue-collar labors, who are disproportionately women, low-income, undocumented and/or nonwhite (especially Black and Brown). For example, Hispanics constitute approximately fifty-three percent of agricultural workers; while Blacks compromise thirty percent of licensed and vocational nurses (Washington State Department of Health 2020). One in three jobs held by women are designated as essential services, with women of color being more likely to work an essential job than other demographic (Robertson and Gebeloff 2020) . These workers are far more likely to contract the virus, while being far less able to pay for unexpected medical care or even have the option to take a paid sick leave (Centers for Disease Control and Prevent 2020). Importantly, this is immunoprivilege. The privilege of those able to work from home, while others continue the vital work needed to keep the country going -a privilege largely enjoyed by White middle and upper-class men. It is the privilege of remaining gainfully employed while isolating oneself from risk of contagion and death. It is also a privilege borne from the long history of segregation and workplace discrimination that consistently relegated marginalized groups to the most hazardous jobs (Seabury, Terp and Boden 2017) .Even the ability to social distance is an immunoprivilege which marginalized groups less frequently enjoy. Most communities of color tend to be densely populated, making social distancing more difficult to practice. Tribal reservations homes and Alaska Native villages, in particular, tend to be more crowded than the rest of the nation (Rodriguez-Lonebear et al. 2020 ). High unemployment rates for Blacks and Hispanics during the pandemic may lead to greater risk of eviction and homelessness, which may in turn lead to more sharing of housing (Fox 2020) . Additionally, because of decades of supermarkets and hospitals not investing in low-income communities, people of color have disproportionately less access to groceries (especially healthy foods) and healthcare. This makes it more difficult, for example, to stock up on enough groceries to stay sheltered-in-place for extended periods. Moreover, because more trips are needed, it prolongs how long one must be outside, potentially exposing themselves (and those they live with) to infection. This is further exacerbated by the overreliance of racial minorities and the poor on public transportation (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). All of these factors create a situation wherein marginalized groups are more likely to contract COVID-19.Even the environmental conditions faced by people of color pose a serious threat to their health. Across the country, rates of pollutants and toxins are significantly higher in low-income and nonwhite communities (American Lung Association 2020). According to a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, in California alone, Blacks and Hispanics live in communities with approximately forty percent higher levels of pollution than their White counterparts. Low-income neighborhoods across the state have ten percent higher rates of pollutants than the state average; while pollutants in high-income neighborhoods are thirteen percent below the average (Union of Concerned Scientists 2019). Because of this, such communities tend to have higher rates of respiratory illness such as asthma and lung cancer (American Lung Association 2020). This, in turns, makes them far more susceptible to the harmful effects of COVID-19. The combination of these factors is no accident. They reflect the pernicious effects of longstanding environmental racism and class-based segregation that has conferred among some the immunoprivilege of health, while exposing others to disease and illness.To be clear, the benefits of immunoprivilege extend beyond the present pandemic. By and large members of marginalized groups are disproportionately more likely to suffer higher rates of chronic illnesses, higher mortality rates and have less access to healthcare (Haynes et al. 2020 ). As such, regardless of whether or not the US grants immunity passports, immunoprivilege is already present within the US. One's ability to live a long and healthy life is neither a guarantee nor are the chances equal across demographics. Immunoprivilege is simply another in a long list of unacknowledged rewards enjoyed by some at the expense of marginalized Others. COVID-19, far from instituting news forms of discrimination, allows us to see what is already the case -namely, that the health and wellbeing of nonwhite, poor and/or non-male bodies are expendable under the current system (Liz 2020) . Recognizing the reality of immunoprivilege is essential for addressing the disproportionate effects COVID-19 is having on marginalized communities across the country. Until we acknowledge the entire landscape of privileges and hardships maintained by the present system of structural inequalities, the dream of a more equitable and fair society will remain unattainable.",Chile,abstract,2021-02-10,02
58d0fb43fb564d2bb58300512690963d43970d1d,Vaccination efforts in Brazil: scenarios and perspectives under a mathematical modeling approach,"Starting between November and December of 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 , caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, pandemic claimed several lives worldwide. More than fourteen months later, many questions are still not answered, including its origin, routes of transmission, and effective treatment.After struggling for months to halt or diminish transmission solely through nonpharmacological measures such as quarantine, self-isolation, lockdown, mobility restriction on several spatial scales, a local and global immunization program through vaccination appears as a real possibility. Several vaccines have been approved for emergency use in several countries. They differ by technological and conceptual platforms, grouped based on the protective immune response they trigger [1] . The main platforms are RNA, DNA, Vector (non-replicating), Vector (replicating), Inactivated, Live-attenuated, Protein subunit, and Virus-like particle. Currently, there are about fifty official vaccine projects that reached human experimentation. Ten vaccine platforms are already in use, of which two of them are RNA, three are vector (non-replicating), four are inactivated, and one is subunit [2] .In Brazil, it was not different. On January 17, 2021, the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) approved the emergency use of the Coronavac vaccine developed by the Chinese biopharmaceutical company Sinovac and the ChadOx1 vaccine developed by Oxford University and the British laboratory AstraZeneca. Both of them performed phase 3 of their study in Brazil within a collaboration with two important Brazilian Institutions: Butantan and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) . The efficacy against symptoms presented by Coronavac and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, after two doses, was 50.38% and 70.42%, respectively [3, 4] . However, according to Anvisa, the data presented regarding efficacy had no statistical significance for severe cases, although some protection is expected.Brazil is known as one of the countries that produce and export vaccines to the rest of the world. The leading factories of Butantan and Manguinhos (Fiocruz) can produce from 1 to 3 million doses per day [5] . Moreover, the country counts with the National Immunization Program (PNI) through the Unified Health System (SUS). The PNI is responsible for successfully eradicating and controlling several endemic diseases in the country, increasing the average Brazilian life expectancy for almost half a century. The robust and complex infrastructure of SUS guarantees access to medicines, vaccines, and healthcare to the population. It provides high-cost medicines, expensive medical procedures, and vaccines to the entire population, including those with private health insurance and people in difficult-to-access areas, such as indigenous people and quilombolas 1 communities [6, 7] . This well-established unified system is an important tool against the COVID-19 epidemics and can easily vaccinate almost one million individuals per day as shown in other immunization campaigned [8] . However, the lack of vaccine production inputs makes the vaccination against COVID-19 in Brazil take slow steps towards community immunization.There is a worldly concern that the beginning of vaccination against COVID-19 may cause a decrease in the perception of the risk of infection [9] . The belief that immunization or recovering from a natural infection can promote full long-life protection is widely spread information among the population [10] . Besides, even after the strengthening of restrictions due to the explosive increase of cases and death toll after the holiday season, it is common to witness people-packed bars, streets, and even parties [11, 12] . More and more frequently, the news shows the lack of social distance between people, the absence of masks in public places, among other neglect of the population. Particularly in Brazil, the lack of a national plan to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants has been jeopardizing the recovery of the economy and enhancing the health system's fragility. Moreover, since the beginning of it, President Jair Bolsonaro has denied the importance of the epidemic, spreading fake news about the vaccine and encouraging the use of medications proven to be inefficient against COVID-19 [13, 14] .Brazil has started vaccination on priority groups, such as health professionals, older adults (80+), and indigenous people. But only about 2.7% of the Brazilian population has been achieved. Besides, Amazon state has been also prioritizing because of the emergence of new variants of the virus [15] . However, by the time vaccine is available for a broad population, acceptance and engagement are concerns. According to the Brazilian Immunization Society (SBIm) [16] , there are three main reasons for the population to refuse vaccination: confidence, complacency, and convenience. In this context, we aimed to investigate, using an agent-based model (ABM), the vaccination's impact under different scenarios of disease immunity, disease prevalence, individual behavior, and vaccination rate.An extension of a previous agent-based model is proposed to assess the impact of vaccination against COVID-19 in Brazil [9]. The population is divided into eight epidemiological classes given the history of the disease and a campaigned vaccination in course, which are: susceptible; vaccinated; exposed; asymptomatic (and infectious); pre-symptomatic (and infectious); symptomatic with either mild or severe/critical illness, recovered; and dead. The model considers several types of heterogeneity, such as the contact matrix among age classes, the disease incubation and recovery period, the daily contact number among individuals, the percentage of individuals that show disease symptoms, the predescendant of those slaves live. existing herd immunity of each age class, prevalence of comorbidities in each age group, among others.Every time-step, the number of daily contacts for each individual was sampled from a Poisson distribution based on their age group's average number of contacts per day (see Table A .3). With probability β, a susceptible individual is infected after contacting an infected individual. β is dependent on the status of the infected individual (asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, mild, or severe symptomatic). The incubation period was calculated from a Gamma distribution, based on an average estimate of 5.2 days. The time of incubation period in a pre-symptomatic stage is also calculated from a Gamma distribution. For symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, the infectious period was also sampled from the Gamma distribution, with a mean of 3.2 days and five days, respectively. Depending on the age, symptomatic individuals can develop mild or severe conditions (see Table 1 ). [28, 29] Length of ICU stay (days) Gamma(shape: 4.5, scale: 2.75) + 2 Derived from [28, 29] Mild symptomatic cases and severely ill cases isolate themselves within 24 hours once the symptoms started. We assumed (due to Brazil's lack of data) that the number of contacts is reduced to a maximum of three, until recovery, on self-isolation. A proportion of the severe cases were hospitalized in a period of 3 to 9 days from the commencement of the symptoms [30] , depending on their comorbidity status (see Table 1 ). The hospitalization period for ICU and ward was sampled from Gamma distribution, averaging 14.4 days and 12.4 days, respectively. Once hospitalized, the individual did not contribute to the spread of infection any longer. We assumed that long-life immunity is achieved after a successful recovery from an infection. The mortality probability is derived from [31] , per age group, and applied to severe cases (see Table A .4).We implemented the two-dose vaccination campaign already in the course in Brazil. The vaccines doses are distributed following the vaccination plan announced by the Health Minister of Brazil [32] and prioritizes the following groups (decreasing order): (i) healthcare workers and the age group 80+; (ii) individuals that are between 60 to 79 years old; (iii) comorbid individuals in the age group 18 to 59 years old; (iv) general population. We assumed that vaccination takes place until the total coverage reaches 40% of the population, which is enough to keep vaccinating during the whole simulated epidemic peak (that takes around 200 days).We used the effective reproduction number of 1.04, reported for the São Paulo State on January 10th [17] , to calibrate the model and find the transmission probability per contact between a pre-symptomatic individual and a susceptible individual. The transmission probability of asymptomatic, mild, and severe symptomatic cases was considered to be 26%, 44%, and 89% in the pre-symptomatic stage. The population's age distribution is based on the one reported in São Paulo State, encompassing ten age groups [33] . The contact distribution matrix is derived from Prem et al. [34] , dividing the population into five age groups (see Table A .3). Besides, the presence of comorbidities is stratified by age (see Table A .1) [35] .Vaccine efficacy against symptoms is 50.38% for CoronaVac (from Sinovac) and 70.42% for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (from Oxford-AstraZeneca) [3, 4] . For CoronaVac, due to the lack of information about the single-dose efficacy, we supposed that the first dose provides half of the second dose efficacy. Besides, we also supposed that, following vaccination, the first and second doses' efficacy is established after 14 and 7 days, respectively. For ChadOx1, the first dose efficacy is 64.1%, and each dose's protection is established after 21 and 14 days after the vaccination. Since there is no statistical significance of protection against severe symptoms during phase 3 of both vaccines, we simulated two scenarios of protection against severe symptoms: no protection (0%) and complete protection (100%). Any other result must lay between them.The initial condition is given by one individual, in the pre-symptomatic stage, arriving at a population. We suppose a preexisting immunity in the population of 10, 20, and 30% [36] . Regarding the age distribution of population immunity, this was sampled following the reported age distribution of São Paulo State cases [31] (see Appendix, Table A .2). After, we relaxed the initial condition to assume a high prevalence of the disease. In summary, the baseline scenario encompasses isolation of symptomatic individuals and a vaccination rate of 0.3% of the population per day; in the double vaccination rate, the rate is increased to 0.6% per day; and in the low-risk perception, the rate is kept at 0.3%, and vaccinated individuals do not isolate themselves when having mild symptoms. The results shown are an average of 1000 independent Monte-Carlo realizations. The model was implemented in Julia language and is available at https://github.com/thomasvilches/abm − brasil.Let us define the ""relative protection against infection"" as the fraction of the vaccine efficacy against disease symptoms that is also applied against disease transmission. It means that, for instance, for the CoronaVac, as vaccine efficacy against symptoms is 50.38%, the scenario with 100% of relative protection means that protection against disease transmission is 50.38%; if the relative protection against infection is 50%, then protection falls to 25.19% against disease transmission; and if it is 0%, then there is no protection against disease transmission. The efficacy against severe symptoms is either 0% (no protection) or 100% (total protection), which means that none of the vaccinated individuals develops severe symptoms.Firstly, we accessed the total number of infections, ward and ICU hospitalizations, and deaths resulting from each scenario of vaccine efficacy. Figures 1 and 2 display the results, supposing a previous herd immunity of 20% in the population. In the absence of a vaccine, it is generated almost 23,000 infections per 100,000 population. In a scenario of vaccination where vaccine provides the same level of protection against infection as against symptoms and complete protection against severe symptoms (scenario 100%-100% in Figures 1 and 2) , the number of infections decreases to 22,140 for CoronaVac and 19,320 for ChadOx1. Notice that when the protection against infection is zero, the number of infections overcomes the no vaccination scenario for both vaccines (scenarios 0%-0% and 0%-100% in Figures 1 and 2 ). This happens because asymptomatic individuals do not isolate themselves, and vaccination protects against disease symptoms.Still in the baseline scenario, the vaccine ChadOx1 can perform even better ( Figure  4 ), given its reported efficacy. In the worst efficacy assumption, in which the vaccine does not prevent against neither infections nor severe symptoms (scenario 0%-0% in Figure  4 ), the reductions in deaths, non-ICU hospitalizations and ICU admissions correspond to 34.98% (95% CI: 29.65% -40%), 27.31% (95% CI: 20.98% -33.75%) and 30.88% (95% CI: 25.15% -36.07%), respectively. When considering the best situation (scenario 100%-100% in Figure 4 ), ChadOx1 would prevent 56.98% (95% CI: 53.13% -60.41%) of deaths, 52.03% (95% CI: 48.24% -56.04%) of ICU admissions, and 47.59% (95% CI: 43.15% -51.57%) of non-ICU hospitalizations.Considering a double vaccination rate for the ChadOx1 vaccine, the results are even better. The worst scenario (scenario 0%-0% in Figure 4 ) the number of deaths is reduced by 46.8% (95% CI: 42.37% -50.81%), the non-ICU hospitalizations 39.59% (95% CI: 34.54% -44.47%), and ICU admissions 41.87% (95% CI: 37.05% -46.37%). In the best scenario (scenario 100%-100% in Figure 4 ), the reduction in the number of deaths exceeds 70%, whose value is 74.43% (95% CI: 72.1% -76.55%). The prevention regarding the non-ICU hospitalizations is 65.54% (95% CI: 62.85% -68.29%), while the prevention of ICU admissions is 68.57% (95% CI: 66.03% -70.97%).Nevertheless, when occurs a low-risk perception, the reduction values decrease. Considering the vaccine ChadOx1 in the best scenario (scenario 100%-100% in Figure 4 ), the reduction in the number of deaths, non-ICU hospitalizations, and ICU admissions decrease to 32.38% (95% CI: 26.72% -37.47%), 24.58% (95% CI: 18.23% -30.82%), and 27.95% (95% CI: 21.63% -33.77%), respectively. While for CoronaVac (scenario 100%-100% in Figure 3 ), we reached the values of 43.59% (95% CI: 37.89% 47.11%), 25.4% (95% CI: 19.18% -31.06%), and 28.35% (95% CI: 21.88% -34.19%). In general, the decrease in the reduction ranges between 2% -4%, revealing that if vaccinated people do not isolate themselves when mildly symptomatic, the vaccination result will be less efficient, which may correspond to thousands of lives. It shows the necessity of keeping other mitigation strategies while the process of vaccination occurs.Relative protection Regarding the CoronaVac, considering the best-case scenario (scenario 100%-100% in Figure 5 ), concerning the number of infections, it was possible to observe an increase in the average reduction in outcomes when the initial number of infected individuals moves from one to five, from 3.58% (95% CI: -4.39% -10.99%) to 6.96% (95% CI: 5.71% -8.12%), followed by a decrease for higher number of initial infections, from 6.96% (95% CI: 5.71% -8.12%) to 5.30% (95% CI: 5.23% -5.37%). In relation to non-ICU hospitalizations, the decrease in reduction was more drastic, going from 28 For the ChadOx1, increasing the initial prevalence of the disease, we obtain a significant decrease in the reduction of infections, non-ICU hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths. In the best-case scenario (scenario 100%-100% in Figure 6 ), the reduction in the number of infections has a slight increase when changing the initial prevalence from one to five individuals, from 15.92% (95% CI: 9.19% -22.55%) to 18.84% (95% CI: 17.66% -20.05%). For a initial prevalence of 45 infections, the reduction in infections jumps to 11.79% (95% CI: 11.71% -11.88%). The non-ICU hospitalization reduction decreases from 47.62% (95% CI: 43.47% -51.41%) to 30.68% (95% CI: 30.37% -31%), while the ICU admission reduction was 51.97% (95% CI: 47.73% -55.96%). The decline in the number of deaths is even more remarkable going from almost 60% (95% CI: 53.55% -60.45%), for one initial infection, to 44.15% (95% CI: 43.76% -44.54%), for 45 initial infections.Relative protection against infection − Severe−disease protection 100% − 0% 100% − 100% 50% − 0% 50% − 100% 0% − 0% 0% − 100% The impact of the vaccination campaign over disease control is not only related to the vaccine efficacy but also the velocity of vaccine production and distribution [38] . Competition about vaccine supplies is already in course, and low-and middle-income countries are more impacted by it. The baseline scenario was chosen to have a vaccination rate that corresponds to 0.3% of the population per day. Considering the Brazilian population, it would correspond to 640 thousand doses per day in the whole country. Moreover, we supposed vaccination campaign to be placed during the whole week, including weekends, which is already implemented in other countries, like the USA.Given the reported number of vaccinated people per day during other immunization programs in Brazil, such as against poliomyelitis (which vaccinated 80 million children in three months) [8] , it is fair to suppose that its production gives the limitation of vaccine distribution. In fact, the expected production rate of vaccines, when Butantan and Fiocruz reach their full capability, is around 1 to 3 million doses per day for each vaccine [5] . Therefore, our results are conservative in this aspect since it is also expected that Brazil can provide vaccine access to its neighborhoods countries in South America. The scenario with a double vaccination rate was able to decrease the disease outcomes highly. Even for CoronaVac, which has a lower reported efficacy compared to ChadOx1, in the situation that the vaccine does not prevents infections neither severe symptoms (scenario 0%-0% Figure 4 ), the reduction in ICU admissions and deaths was above 25%. This could take the health system off the borderline of collapsing. Today, most non-elective surgeries are canceled, prejudicing a lot of Brazilian patients that have their quality of life diminished by it. A fast vaccination would also stop the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, which is already on course in Brazil, England, and Africa. Once fewer people get infected, the lower is the mutation probability of the virus.When comparing the baseline scenario to the scenario in which the risk perception of vaccinated individuals is reduced (third column of Figures 3 and 4) , we can see that 2% to 4% of the vaccination efficiency is lost, which can correspond to thousand of lives when looking at the number of deaths per 100 thousand population. This shows the importance of keeping mitigations strategies and an information campaign taking place together with vaccination. According to the Brazilian Immunization Society (SBIm) [16] , the vaccination coverage by the PNI has steeply decreased since 2015, and in 2019 and 2020, none of the immunization programs has reached their goals. This is due to the lack of investments and good governance of the SUS services. As an example, the poor vaccination coverage has caused the once eradicated measles to reappear in Brazil. Another example is the vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV). Santos et al. [39] show that despite 96.6% of the studied population took the vaccine, 32.3% did not take the second dose, which is considered a high dropout rate.This study shows that the vaccines are keystones to preventing high attack rates and high tolls of hospitalizations and death, even when they provide limited protection 14 .This study presents the substantial gains of the vaccination program and its capacity for protecting vulnerable individuals. It is clear that once the public health actors apply adequate resources to ensure the proper mobility and action within the PNI framework, vaccination shall achieve the proposed goal of controlling outbreaks and lowering the disease burden. Fake news and behavioral change can diminish the vaccination rate and the population's adherence to immunization. Therefore, a national and unique informative campaign addressed to the population is urgent.in which the ρ symp is the death probability of a symptomatic case and θ is the probability that a symptomatic case is severe. We present the obtained results for CoronaVac and AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines for several scenarios: (I) baseline, doubling the vaccination rate, and decreasing the risk perception. Figures B.1 and B.2 show the results considering a pre-existing immunity of 10%, for CoronaVac and AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines, respectively. And Figures B.3 and B.4 , a pre-existing immunity of 30%.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-23,02
7d0b273c973f439611535318fcfa948e24ada309,Temporal and geographical variation of COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rate in,"Similarly, the variation in IHFR between regions or states could reflect a difference in the age pattern of hospitalized patients, age structure of the population, in addition to, or rather than a shortage of hospital resources.By the end of 2020, Brazil was the third country with the highest number of cases of COVID-19 in the world, and the second in number of deaths. The mandatory notification of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), which includes COVID-19, in a nationwide system in Brazil allows us to analyze the variation of IHFR for the entire country during the epidemic. The goal of this study is to assess the effects of time, inpatient age, and states on the IHFR in Brazil.Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of healthcare resources availability on the IHFR in different Brazilian states. Our hypotheses are that (1) IHFR increases with age and decreases over time (as management of severe cases improves and the knowledge is disseminated) but the intensity of this effect varies from state to state; and (2) the IHFR peak is greater in states with worse hospital resources, such as those with a lower number of ICU beds and physicians.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases are reported in Brazil in a nation-wide surveillance system, SIVEP-Gripe 9 . SARS/SARI is defined as a flu-like illness with any of the following symptoms: dyspnea (difficulty breathing), persistent chest pressure, O 2 saturation below 95% in ambient air, bluish color of the lips or face. All hospitalized deaths due to SARS/SARI, regardless of whether the patient was hospitalized or not, enter the SIVEP-GRIPE database.SIVEP-GRIPE was implemented during the A(H1N1) influenza pandemic in 2009, and since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, notification of all cases of SARS/SARI became compulsory. All cases reported in the SIVEP-GRIPE system are tested for etiologic agents and classified as ""confirmed SARS-CoV-2"", ""influenza"", ""cases due to any other etiologic agent"", or ""SARS of an unspecified origin"". For the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, each case notified in SIVEP-GRIPE is tested for SARS-CoV-2, and if confirmed, it is classified based on laboratory results (RT-PCR or serology) and/or clinical or radiological manifestations. These cases are reported on a standardized form, containing patient identification, clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data.We extracted data from SIVEP-GRIPE from March 01, 2020 until September 28, 2020 and included all COVID-19 hospitalized cases with a confirmed outcome, according to the above mentioned criteria until epidemiological week 35. We aggregated cases (n=345,281) by epidemiological week of symptom onset, age groups (classified as 0-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ years), state of residence, and outcome (death or discharge). We considered the beginning of the time series as the week in which each state accumulated at least 30 hospitalizations.To describe the variation in IHFR across epidemiological weeks, states, and age groups, we proposed four alternative generalized linear models (GLM) models:(1) temporal variation in IHFR is related to state characteristics and age pattern of inpatients, (2) temporal variation in IHFR is solely related to the age pattern of inpatients, (3) temporal variation in IHFR is solely related to state characteristics, and (4) temporal variation in IHFR is independent of state and age pattern of inpatients.With this modelling approach we thus posed competing statistical models for isolated effects of each variable, and their combined effects. We implemented the combination of variables (age group, state, and epidemiological week) as additive and interactive effects in GLM with IHFR as a binomial response variable (number of deaths out of total admissions each week). The time-evolving predictor (an integer value expressing the epidemiological week) was included in the models as a secondorder polynomial to allow for non-monotonic evolution of IHRF through time. We adopted an information-based model selection approach to simultaneously confront all linear models that translate each hypothesis outlined above.We selected the best model based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and models with Δ AIC < 2 were considered equally plausible.The analysis included only the 22 Brazilian states that reached more than 1,000 total hospitalizations as of September 28. All data analysis was performed in R 1 1 using stats and bblme 1 2 packages.All the analyses were done using R, and data and R scripts are available at https://github.io/covid19br/IHFR.In this study, we showed temporal trends in IHFR, which were markedly heterogeneous among Brazilian states during the study period. In addition, IHFR peaks along these trends were higher in states with fewer health care resources, especially those with less doctors and intensivists per 100,000 inhabitants, which were also the states in which a higher percentage of people relied on public health services (SUS) for medical assistance.The IHFR peaked during the weeks with the highest number of hospitalizations in most states, suggesting that hospital overwhelming is affecting COVID-19 inpatients mortality. This hypothesis was also raised by Ranzani², however. They didn't consider possible effects of the variation in the deaths by age group in the IHFR. Although data on hospital bed occupancy over time is unavailable for the Brazilian states, Andrade 17 reported that in several regions of Brazil hospitals were operating near full capacity during the most critical moments of the pandemic.The impact on the increase in-hospital mortality has been described in epidemic periods (influenza) and increased occupancy of ICU beds. 18, 19 . However, our results suggest that some states with higher rates of hospital resources were able to avoid the collapse of the system during increased demand for hospitalization. This effect could be observed especially in SP, BA, MG, and DF where the hospital lethality remained low and still decreased with higher rates and/or an increase in the number of hospitalizations.We acknowledge some limitations in our study. First, we use routinely collected secondary data on hospitalized cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome and deaths. While these data may carry some uncertainty, particularly in periods of high hospital demand and peak incidence, they are the best available official data and they are used to guide policy and decision making. Second, state analysis does not capture idiosyncrasies observed among the municipalities within the states, so even more variability is expected at the sub-state level. The testing capacity and quality of epidemiological surveillance are heterogeneous across states, with different levels of expertise for investigating and reporting cases. Lastly, our models do not include other socioeconomic factors that could affect the IHFR, such as variations in prevalence of comorbidities and nutrition status.",Brazil,abstract,2021-02-23,02
fd85f7c3eebe6f3bee9bee0225be259a6d271c46,CLINICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE CALL SCORE FOR THE PREDICTION OF ADMISSION TO ICU AND DEATH IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA IN A REFERENCE HOSPITAL IN PERU,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has generated a global health crisis that has placed international public health in great danger [1] . Worldwide, 44 358 000 confirmed cases are reported, of which approximately 1 174 624 people have died from the disease [2] . Peru is no stranger to this problem; currently, approximately 891,000 new cases have been estimated in the country, with a total of 34,197 deaths [2] . To date, the SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to spread, and newly infected people grow every day, despite the isolation and quarantine measures established worldwide.As the pandemic grows, we acknowledge that comorbidities such as obesity, arterial hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are risk factors and essential predictors for severity and death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [3, 4] . Based on those mentioned above and due to the need for a more practical, rapid, and valid approach, different clinical prediction rules have been developed. However, most are based on complex calculations with measurements of variables that we do not have in our country [5, 6] .The CALL SCORE was developed in China, a clinical tool based on four variables that facilitate patient decision-making with COVID-19 to achieve a practical and valid clinical prediction tool [3] . However, it is not validated for Latin American populations; its performance has only been evaluated in the Italian population with important results.It is crucial to evaluate its predictive impact and clinical performance in real clinical conditions on important outcomes such as mortality and ICU admission. Both, due to the lack of resources in our society and the need to improve our patients' management and make an adequate triage of those who require specialized treatment [3] .We conducted a retrospective analytical cross-sectional study based on the guidelines of the STROBE [7] statement. The study was registered in the PRISA database for observational studies of the National Health Institute of Peru, with the following registration code: EI00000001429 (https://prisa.ins.gob.pe/index.php/acerca-deprisa/busqueda-de-proyectos-de-investigacion-en-salud/1264-rendimiento-clinico-delcall-score-para-la-prediccion-de-ingreso-a-uci-y-muerte-en-pacientes-hospitalizadoscon-neumonia-por-covid-19-en-un-hospital-de-referencia-en-peru). The study was evaluated and approved by the Office of Support for Teaching and Research of the ""Dos de Mayo"" National Hospital with registration number 027660-2020.It was carried out in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia treated at the ""Dos de Mayo"" National Hospital between April to July 2020.Death was defined as the passing of the patient during his/her hospital stay. Admission to the ICU was defined as the patient's admission to the ICU while hospitalized in COVID-19 wards. The CALL SCORE was calculated with de data taken at the admission for each patient spanning a range of 4 to 13 points (comorbidity 1-4 points, age 1-3 points, lymphocytes 1-3 points, LDH 1-3 points). Additional variables such as sex, age, comorbidities, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and absolute lymphocytes were included to describe the patients' characteristics.The data were extracted from the medical records of the selected patients and recorded in a standardized instrument developed based on the study's objectives.We required a minimum of 51 patients (Power 80%, an estimated area under curve 0.76, and a distribution ratio of 4.6) 6. It was calculated on the page's web application:http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC/).The CALL SCORE classifies into three risk groups according to their probabilities of progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. Frequencies and percentages were presented for the qualitative and mean variables and standard deviation for the quantitative variables based on the normality tests (P>0.05).The area under the model curve and the operational characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) were calculated for the best cut-off point. 95% confidence intervals (IC-95%) were presented. The data were processed in the SPSS statistical software version 20.We found 120 patients who were admitted to hospitalization during the study period.Nevertheless, we included 51 patients to analyze.The most frequent gender was male (66.7%; n=34). The mean age was 55.6 ± 15 years.The most frequent comorbidity was obesity (23.5%; n = 12). The median for LDH and absolute lymphocytes was 360 mg/dL (range: 208-1054) and 1100 lymphocytes/mm 3 (range: 298-5671) respectively. The median Call Score was 6, with a range of 4 to 13.The CALL SCORE reported an area under the curve of 0.59 (IC-95%: 0.3 to 0.07), p=0.43 for predicting death (Figure 1) . Nonetheless, for a cut-off point of 5.5, a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 65% were obtained. For the prediction of ICU admission, the area under the curve was 0.67 (IC-95%: 0.3 to 0.07), p=0.43 ( Figure 2 ).The cut-off point of 5.5 presented a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 51%.Approximately 20% of COVID-19 patients are reported to develop severe respiratory illness, with an overall fatality rate of around 2.3%, and are secondary to COVID-19 complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. (ARDS), respiratory failure, liver injury, acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, septic shock, and even multiple organ failure [1] . In our study, 21.6% of patients were admitted to the ICU due to disease severity, and mortality was 15.7%. We did not evaluate the causes of admission to the ICU as it was not our study objective.Patients with underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, pre-existing respiratory infection, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) are more likely to succumb and experience progression to the more severe forms of COVID-19. They are also at higher risk of developing complications[10]. In a document carried out by the Unit of Evidence and Deliberation for Decision Making of the University of Antioquia, they found that for mortality, severe illness and admission to the ICU, age over 60 years, as well as cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk [4] .We found that the most frequent comorbidity was obesity, followed by Diabetes Mellitus 2 and arterial hypertension, respectively. When classified by risk groups according to the CALL SCORE, these comorbidities were more frequent in the intermediate and high groups. Association measures were not performed because it was not the objective of the study. However, the predominance of these diseases can be observed in patients with a higher risk of severe disease, consistent with the literature.We found that the higher the risk group for the severe disease was, the more frequent lymphopenia was. However, we did not see the same behavior with elevated LDH.The CALL SCORE's low performance or clinical validity does not allow adequate prediction of mortality and admission to the ICU in our population. Apparently, with scores of 6, screening could be carried out due to the high sensitivity extended to patients not necessarily hospitalized.We do not recommend using the CALL SCORE to predict mortality or admission to the ICU in Peruvian patients. It is probably useful as a screening test due to its high sensitivity in patients presenting to other services such as the emergency.The CALL SCORE presents a low clinical performance for predicting mortality and admission to the ICU in Peruvian patients. We do not recommend its use for the classification of patients requiring hospital management. The different clinical prediction rules used in our environment should be evaluated. The study should be replicated in other establishments and countries in South America.",Peru,abstract,2021-02-15,02
