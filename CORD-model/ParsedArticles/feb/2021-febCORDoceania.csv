However, a few numbers of pandemic and epidemic shook the financial system to its core. Black Death pandemic, surfaced in 1348, profoundly impacted the world economy by crashing at 29% in GDP while holding the history of maximum death rates. By 2002, an infectious respiratory disease (SARS) emerged, which influenced the decline of growth rate for over a year in most Asian countries, especially China, with its growth rate dropping down to 9.1%. Witnessing coronavirus pandemic, Novel Coronavirus depicts a revolutionary toll on the international economy and trade. As an attempt to curb COVID-19, governments have declared the closure of borders, businesses, and factories. However, by such a bold resolution, the massive global trade of goods and services is restricted which disrupts the economy. Considering the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2, WTO compares present financial crisis with the economic crash of 2009. World trade is predicted to suffer a dramatic decline from 13 to 32 percent, says WTO.Despite being geographically further from significant export markets, New Zealand stands 58th in the world for its export economy. Lacking certain goods, importing allows New Zealand to produce products locally by reducing its manufacturing costs. On the other hand, exporting boosts New Zealand's revenues and profits and, as a result, the national economy. Presently, international trade is contributing as much as 60% of New Zealand's total economic activity. Asian countries play a huge role in New Zealand's imports as 53% of the country's imports are purchased by countries in Asia. The largest import categories in New Zealand, including machinery (which includes computers) and vehicles, contribute two-thirds of the total product acquisition value.Regarding the export, New Zealand shipped goods of 18.9 billion dollars in the first six months of 2020. Mainly exporting food products (which includes dairy, meat, and fish), New Zealand's exports are accounted for 75% of its overall worldwide purchases. Countries such as India, New Zealand, China, the UK, and many more are on the verge of collapse due to the shutdown of international trade business. Regarding elevated unemployment and revenue, various countries have tools and mechanisms which can be used in response to minimize the loss [1] . The present study attempts to assess the impact of the corona pandemic on New Zealand trade by performing exploratory data analysis and applying ARIMA modeling.The rise of COVID-19 has impacted various aspects of the global economy, especially trading goods from one country to another. Several studies have shed light on the analysis of trade among numerous countries. While there has been much research on investigating the trade economy amid the coronavirus pandemic, few researchers have emphasized predicting trade economy.The relation between pandemic and economic crisis is well established; research by Arun and Ozili [2] concluded that an increase in the number of coronavirus-infected patients did not have a notable influence on the economy, and only the new policies established due to the spread of the virus rigorously changed the face of economic activities. However, the lack of a rich dataset and resemblance to a similar financial crisis makes the overall findings limited to defined criteria of observations. The authors of [3] analyzed the price data of stock markets and suggested the forecast of stock markets using the forecasting model, LBL-LSTM. On comparing the current economic downfall with the financial crisis during the SARS outbreak, the researchers established representations of the stock chart in both periods, along with prediction performance indicated using RMSE. The distinctness of this study is the active and adjustable model used to train and predict the data collected from Yahoo Finance Message Board.A study by McKibbin and Fernando depicts the resemblance between the global crisis, which took place in 2008-2009, and the current economic crisis [4] . The international trade collapse in 2008 surfaced due to demand-side shock, a sudden drop in the demand of goods or services, along with a supply-side shock from the finance sectors. Research shows it is dubious to expect the current trade to collapse as hard.Several empirical studies have focused on examining the adverse effect on trade volume amid the pandemic [5, 6] , while a systematic review by Farooqi offers forecasts for annual import/export flow in Pakistan using the ARIMA model [7] . While the researcher inspected the results on as many as ten tentative ARIMA models, he reflects on the limitation of the method being suitable for at least fifty observations. Similarly, authors of [8] compare different time-series models with ARIMA and conclude the trendy method, ARIMA, performs well for a real-world timeseries forecast and analysis.Nonetheless, there is a lack of robust research on the impact of COVID-19 on analyzing trade flow impact in New Zealand. This research paper intends to bridge this gap by providing a detailed exploratory analysis using ARIMA modeling to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the annual trade flow in New Zealand.In December, a month later, after the first outbreak of the coronavirus in China, WHO declared the virus to be a public health emergency [9] . Despite early signs of COVID-19 in China and other Asian countries, the first case of coronavirus surfaced in New Zealand three months later than in China [10] . Despite having zero coronavirus cases for a month, the New Zealand government allowed only New Zealand citizens to enter the country. The spread of coronavirus was declared a pandemic soon after the virus's uncontrollable expansion in more than 18 countries worldwide [11] . New Zealand imposed a complete shutdown by March with only one active case, when countries like China and England experienced a total number of 80,304 and 16,000 coronavirus-infected patients. New Zealand reported the first appearance of coronavirus in August, after 100 days of being corona-free. Meanwhile, Australia and England continued showing a downward trend in fatalities and confirmed cases concerning the SARS-CoV-2. Figure 1 displays the intensity of the coronavirus spread worldwide, including the maximum number of deaths and confirmed cases of the virus.The economy of New Zealand is considered trade-dependent, and as a result, one of the open market economies in the whole world. As mentioned by New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 70 to 95 percent of the country heavily relies on the export of the vital primary sectors (meat, dairy, seafood, wine, and forestry) [12] . Because of the low domestic market, the rise in export sales is essential as international trade is responsible for 6 out of every ten jobs in New Zealand [13] . Along with export, imported products such as cars and machinery equipment contribute to New Zealand's high GDP. When the goods had been exported earlier, they are imported to the same country which is called reimportation. It is noteworthy to discern that reimportation provides a negligible input to the country's trade sales. Figure 2 provides insight into the total earnings obtained from trade (export/ import/ reimport) from February to July 2020. China, one of the giant patrons of New Zealand concerning export and imports, issued a halt on trading business in 2019, which initiated a sparse reduction in sales. The majority of other countries witnessed the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 and implemented temporary closure to the international trades. It explains the sinking trade sales value in New Zealand after the spread of COVID-19 in various countries.By taking into account major transportation modes for exporting and importing, New Zealand's trade underwent a decline in sales. While the values showed growth in March 2020, the drop in sales in the following months cannot be ignored.New Zealand is responsible for the exportation of the highest values of goods to China. The sudden plunge of reduction in the exportation to China is noticeable in Fig. 3 , which is a repercussion of the initial lockdown implementation in China. Unlike in China, Australia did not implement immediate strict restrictions though imposed international travel and trading restrictions gradually. Imports in Australia, such as agricultural chemicals and ingredients, encountered a disruption and had to rely on the local suppliers to curb the damage [14] which explains the vague decrease in the value of exports to Australia. The American and Japanese governments placed no restrictions on international trading whatsoever, which distinctly justifies the raise of income from exports to Japan accompanied by the fragile extension in the value of goods exported to the USA, as shown in Fig. 3 . All the countries in East Asia, excluding China, play the second-highest role for the maximum value of goods exported from New Zealand. Most East Asian countries like Japan and North Korea did not place international trade ban restrictions, allowing New Zealand to continue export goods for a significantly higher rate. New Zealand underwent a considerably lesser downfall of the export value for the European Union, and in the case of the UK, New Zealand did not have a substantial consequence in the prices of the export goods.According to the World Bank, disruption to the agricultural inputs imposes a more prominent risk for food insecurity by jeopardizing next season's crop without necessary pieces of equipment such as fertilizers and seeds [15] . In such circumstances, people prioritize stocking adequate food to survive any incoming crisis. New Zealand noticed a majority of the people engaged in panic buying, despite the government's declaration of having a satisfactory amount of food stock. A visible effect of the COVID-19 restrictions can be recognized on the exports of essential commodities (food and forestry), as depicted in Fig. 4 . It is needless to say that exportation in fruit and dairy has shown intensification, among dairy being the most leading, followed by fruit and meat. In spite of the fact that the value of fruit export had been escalating since 2017, the exportation in fruit commodity experienced a sudden surge of increase from the year 2019 and rising forward over the year 2020. Considering the dairy export, at the end of 2016, the dramatic growth of price is visible; however, the prices shoot straight up with the increase in the spread of the COVID-19. While dairy and fruit export value rose significantly, the numbers for meat export remained steady despite the pandemic. It is also noteworthy to notice the downfall of seafood exports followed by 2019. Forestry, New Zealand's one of the influential exports, has shown a drastic sharp drop, sternly affecting the economy of New Zealand. The stats NZ spokesman Darren Allan has shared his viewpoints on the trade crisis by emphasizing to take cautionary decisions in the import and export of various commodities.ARIMA model excludes assuming financial model knowledge unlike other time-series models. It solely considers the forecasting based on the past values and errors considered [16] . One of the key benefits of using ARIMA is its better performance than most models for predicting comprehensive time-series data while being less susceptible to data fluctuations [17] . As compared to ARIMA, multivariate models cause a problem regarding the data timeliness resulting in forecast uncertainty. With time, several studies [18] have established ARIMA models' success in outperforming sophisticated models with regard to forecasting data. Figure 5 illustrates a general modeling and prediction strategy using the ARIMA model. The flowchart does not follow a succeeding pattern and includes iterative loops wherever required. The process starts with collecting the time-series data, followed by examining and processing the dataset to obtain a noteworthy analysis of the trade flow. The stationary or non-stationary state of the time-series data is tested in the third step of the process, where an iterative loop will direct the data to be transformed into stationary state of data. Once the stationary time-series data is achieved, the consequent and most critical step requires to identify the best fit line of the ARIMA model to estimate the correct results. After successfully completing the fourth step, the model is used to perform the prediction of the time-series data, which will allow further evaluation of the prediction results. The summary statistics for the trading imports, exports, and reimports of New Zealand are shown in Table 1 , For conducting the experimental analysis, firstly, the data have to be examined and analyzed, followed by testing the data to obtain its stationary state. Figure 6 illustrates the filtered export and import records obtained by normalizing significant features of the time-series data using Min-Max normalization. After performing normalization with Min-Max, the minimum and maximum value gets converted to 0 and 1, respectively.Before carrying forward with the model application, the state of data should be stationary. Stationary data resemble that its statistical properties remain steady over time, which makes it easier for the model to perform an errorless forecast. ADF test (augment Dickey-Fuller test) provides the null hypothesis of the given time-series data [19] . The AdFuller function is required to identify the need for difference; a method to transform non-stationary time series into stationary, where d = 0 relates to differencing, is unneeded. Figure 6 signifies the PACF plot representing the partial correlation coefficients among the time-series data and lags of itself with respect to the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). Considering the presence of unit root by the null hypothesis, the value of p should be less than 0.05, inferring the stationary state of the time-series data. The graph plot, given in Fig. 7 , yields the p degree value equal to 9 and the value of degree q equal to 1. It provides satisfactory conditions to apply the ARIMA model as shown in Fig. 8 allow to evaluate the import and export trade values predicted using the ARIMA model.This model is evaluated based on four vital metrics,MSE (mean square error) denotes the average of squared errorsUnlike MSE, mean absolute error (MAE) measures the square of the average distance between real and predicted data [20] Table 2 presents notable evaluation error metrics.After data normalization using Min-Max and dropping irrelevant features from the time-series data, import records undergo filtration as shown in Fig. 9 . It is significant to note the ADF function displays the data to be non-stationary considering the test statistics is larger than the critical values.It requires the process of differencing in order to decrease the value of and make the data stationary. After applying the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), the p and q values are equal to 1 denoting the null value of differencing. Once the model is built, its assessment is based on the value of metric errors.In order to fit the ARIMA model, the irrelevant features in the reimports data are dropped followed by normalization. Once again, the AdFuller function depicts a non-stationary state of the data. Therefore, the p and q values are transformed into 1 with differencing. ARIMA model is later applied to the features as shown in Fig. 10 .The research aims to evaluate the consequences of the trade economy in New Zealand caused by the coronavirus pandemic by using the ARIMA model. This research has provided the following accomplishments:After March, when most countries declared a complete shutdown of import and export, the trade value analysis for New Zealand starts descending. Considerable shortage of export values faced by New Zealand to countries such as Australia, China, East Asia, European Union, Japan, the UK, and the USA after the first few months of 2020 The sinking value of all commodities except food products, such as dairy, fruit, and meat, during the emergence of COVID-19 Performed data analysis, data normalization, and transformation to fit the ARIMA model Conducted error metric evaluation after implementing the ARIMA model to stationary time-series data Although the results are quite favorable for the given time-series data, the gap may have resulted from ARIMA's backwards-looking approach for predicting turning points. The results present a better comprehension of the trade impact on New Zealand concerning the coronavirus pandemic. The demand for essential goods in New Zealand is likely to elevate in the following months, while that for non-essential goods will continue to plummet. The policymakers could prioritize to keep the worldwide supply chains active by trading essential goods, such as food products and medical supplies. The restriction of export trade on fundamental goods puts the international trade market at risk and can accelerate panic buying, consequently increasing difficulties for trade-dependent countries like New Zealand. This paper has one prominent limitation of restricted analysis due to the confined dataset. A more extended dataset with a longer period may capture the economic consequences of financial management amid the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, this paper can be developed in the future by applying the ARIMA model to a noiseless variant of the trade data series. This could be done using advanced statistical techniques and decrease the random fluctuations of noise.",New Zealand,abstract,2021-02-17,02
c5246eb8232d3338c3b45c3c8ed8224ffdaea230,Using next generation matrices to estimate the proportion of cases that are not detected in an outbreak,"3 make accurate transmission predictions. Over time attempts have been made to account for under-reporting in models. Some models assume perfect reporting (15, 16) , however, this can lead to an underestimation of the infection rate (6) . Other methods assume a constant under-reporting rate (17) or use data augmentation techniques (6) . More recently, many models have switched to using death data, which was believed to be more reliable than case data, because it is more likely consistent over time and between countries (13) . This is especially important for methods which are robust to constant under-reporting.We propose using a quasi-Bayesian next generation matrix (NGM) approach in this paper to estimate the proportion of cases that are not detected in an outbreak. This method is not disease specific and is simple to implement from contact tracing and surveillance data. The calculation can also be repeated throughout the outbreak to provide time varying estimates.We present two applications of our method: the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New Zealand in 2020 and the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Guinea.NGMs are often used to calculate the basic reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections generated by a primary infection in a large fully susceptible population), ! , from a finite number of discrete categories that are based on epidemiologically relevant traits in the population, such as infected individuals at different stages of infection (e.g. exposed and infectious) or with different characteristics (e.g. age).For contact tracing to be fully effective, the parent (or primary) case needs to be diagnosed and, if positive, all their contacts placed under active surveillance. The parent case therefore needs to know and remember everyone they have been in close contact with whilst they have been infectious and for these contacts to be contacted. Despite a contact being recalled and reported, they may not be under active surveillance if they cannot be identified due to missing or incorrect contact details or evasion from contact tracers. We assume in our model that: i) cases that are not detected and those cases detected but not under active surveillance have the same effective reproduction number (R) and therefore on average, infect the same number of secondary cases; and ii) contacts under surveillance who become cases have a lower effective reproduction number (scaled by ) because they are rapidly isolated after the onset of symptoms. We define as the proportion of contacts recalled, as the proportion of contacts actively under surveillance, and as the proportion of cases detected or ""re-captured"" by community surveillanceWe identify 12 pathways through which individuals can become infected by three different types of cases ( Figure 1 ). These pathways are described as follows:1. A case that was detected (with probability ), who was infected by a case that was not detected and was therefore not under active surveillance.2. A case that was not detected (with probability 1-), who was infected by a case that was not detected and was therefore not under active surveillance.If "" = [ "" , "" , "" ] # is a vector of the number of each type of case for generation , the dynamics of the model is given by:where is our NGM that represent the potential transitions from one generation of cases to the nextFrom the eigenvalues of this NGM, we can calculate the proportion of each of the three types cases (ND, NAS and AS), see Supplementary Information (SI) A. In the limit as goes to infinity, an equilibrium is reach and the proportion of cases that are not detected, &' , can be calculated as:Cases are often recorded in line-lists during disease outbreaks, where dates of testing, symptom onset and hospitalization are recorded alongside information about the age and sex of the patient. When case lists are linked to contact lists, we can derive two ratios with which we parameterize our NGM. We define % as the ratio of cases who were contacts but not under surveillance versus the cases who were contacts and under surveillance and ( as the ratio of de novo cases (cases that were not known contacts) versus detected cases that were contacts and under surveillance.Following the pathways in Figure 1 , we expand % (the ratio of cases who were contacts but not under surveillance versus the cases who were contacts and under surveillance) as (4)We re-write this asWe also expand ( (the ratio of de novo cases versus detected cases that were contacts and under surveillance) as ?2) We assume % is equal to 0.5 (twice as many contacts under active surveillance than not under active surveillance or two thirds of contacts are under active surveillance) to illustrate the impact of a slightly better surveillance system. Since we know the total number of cases on the contact tracing list, 45, and assume % = 0.5, we estimate the number of contacts under active surveillance to be 30 (denominator of ( ). Therefore, ( is equal to 3.57.Therefore, we define our central estimate as the solution for the point in our viable parameter space ( , ) that is furthest from the boundary of our central region. We calculate this using the polylabelr R package (29) . Our credible intervals reflect the values between which 95% of our viable samples lie. All code necessary to implement the analysis is included open source in the ""MissingCases"" R package on GitHub (30) . Figure 3 , we find that the region of feasible parameter space for SARS-CoV-2 was only 2.4% of the total space, which suggests high certainty in our parameter estimates. It is also located in the top right corner of the parameter space, where both the proportion of cases detected in the community( ) andContact tracing is an important control mechanism for infectious disease outbreaks.However, its efficiency depends on detecting as many cases as possible. We show in this paper that NGMs can be easily used to estimate the proportion of cases that were not detected for two different disease outbreaks. Our method requires much less data (only 5 parameters) that other methods, such as capture re-capture (10), which is an alternative method suggested for estimating under-reporting and is highly data intensive. This means that it is feasible to repeat this analysis in near real time as the epidemic unfolds.We believe this method highlights important lessons for responding to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the unfortunate inevitability of future infectious disease outbreaks. By simply linking the case line-lists and contact tracing lists, we can use the very general method from our ""MissingCases"" package (30) to assess under-reporting throughout an epidemic. This would help outbreak responses, especially during the early and late phases, target resources and quantify how effect their surveillance systems were. In addition, these estimates can be used to improve the accuracy of other models, such as for the time varying reproduction number, which are key tools for the outbreak response themselves.isolation.

0999a96a1466a1818e8297f836a4fc3ce32aa015,Tilted Nonparametric Regression Function Estimation,"Let the regression model bewhere (Y 1 , X 1 ), (Y 2 , X 2 ), . . . , (Y n , X n ), are the data pairs, the design variable X ∼ f X , X and are independent, i 's are independent and identically distributed (iid) errors with zero mean E( ) = 0 and variance E( 2 ) = σ 2 . The regression function r and f X are unknown. In this paper, we will focus on a nonparametric approach to estimate r. The main subject of this study is a class of nonparametric estimators called linear smoother. Nadaraya-Watson estimator and local linear estimator are two prevailing members of this class of estimators. An estimatorȓ of r, is said to be 1 a linear smoother if it can be written in a form of linear function of weighted Y sample. Let the weight-vector be l(x) = (l 1 (x), ..., l n (x)) T .Then the linear smootherȓ can be written aswhere n i=1 l i (x) = 1, see Buja et al. [1] . Nadaraya-Watson estimator and local linear estimator can be written as a form of linear smoother with the following weight functions. The weight functions for Nadaraya-Watson smoother, see Nadaraya [2] , Watson [3] , are, i = 1, . . . , n. (1.3) For the standard local linear smoother the weight functions are defined as follows,, i = 1, . . . , n,where K is a kernel function. The kernel function depends on the bandwidth, or smoothing, parameter h and assigns weights to the observations according to the distance to the target point x, see McMurry and Politis, [4] . The small values of h cause the neighboring points of x to have the larger influence on the estimate leading to curvature changes in the estimated curve. The larger values of h imply that the distanced data points will have the same effect as the neighboring points on the local fit, resulting in a smoother estimate. Thus finding an optimal h is the essential task in the estimation procedure, see Wasserman [5] . One of the ways finding the optimal h is by minimising the leave-one-out cross validation score function, [5] . The leave-one-out cross validation score is defined bywhereȓ (−i) (X i ) is obtained from (1.2) by omitting the i th pair (X i , Y i ). In this work, we will present the tilted versions of linear smoother. A tilting technique applied to an empirical distribution, leads to replacing 1/n data weights from uniform distribution by p i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, from general multinomial distribution over data. Hall and Yao [6] studied asymptotic properties of the tilted regression estimator with autoregressive errors using generalized empirical likelihood method, which typically involves solving a non-linear and high dimensional optimization problem. Grenander [7] introduced a tilted method to impose restrictions on the density estimates. There are two approaches to estimating of the tilting parameters: Empirical likelihood and Distance Measure based approaches. The empirical likelihood-based method is a semi-parametric method which provides a convenience of adding a parametric model through estimating equations. Owen [8] proposed an empirical likelihood to be used as an alternative to the likelihood ratio tests, and derived its asymptotic distribution. Chen [9] , Zhang [10] , Schick et al. [11] , Müller et al. [12] further developed the empirical likelihood-based method for estimating the tilting parameters. Chen [9] applied the empirical likelihood method to estimate the tilting parameters p i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, under the constraints on the shape of distribution. In his kernel-based estimator, n −1 was replaced by the weights obtained from the empirical likelihood method. In [9] it was proved that the proposed estimator has a smaller variance than the conventional kernel estimators. Schick et al. [11] , also used the similar approach obtaining the consistent tilted estimator with higher efficiency than that of conventional estimators in the autoregression framework. In contrast in the Distance Measure approach, the tilted estimators are defined by minimizing distances, conditional to various types of constraints. Hall and Presnell [13] , Hall and Huang [14] , Carroll et al. [15] , Doosti and Hall [16] , Doosti et al. [17] used the setup-specific Distance Measure approaches for estimating the tilting parameters. Carroll [15] , proposed a new approach for density function estimation, and regression function estimation as well as hypothesis testing under shape constraints in the model with measurement errors. A tilting method used in [15] led to curve estimators under some constraints. Doosti and Hall [16] introduced a new higher order nonparametric density estimator, using tilting method, where they used L 2 -metric between the proposed estimator and a consistent 'Sinc' kernel based estimator. Doosti et al. [17] , have introduced a new way of choosing the bandwidth and estimating the tilted parameters based on the cross-validation function. In [17] , it was shown that the proposed density function estimator had improved efficiency and was more cost-effective than the conventional kernel-based estimators studied in this paper.In this work, we propose a new tilted version of a linear smoother which is obtained by minimising the distance to a comparator estimator. The comparator estimator is selected to be an infinite order flat-top kernel estimator. This class of estimators is characterized by a Fourier transform, which is flat near the origin and infinitely differentiable elsewhere, see [18] . We prove that the tilted estimators achieve a high level of accuracy, yet preserving the attractive properties of an infinite-order flat-top kernel estimator.The rest of this paper contains the additional four sections and Appendix. In the Section 2, we provide the notation, definitions and preliminary results. The Section 2 also includes the definition of an infinite-order estimator, as a comparator estimator. Section 3 contains the main results formulated in Theorems 1-3. We present a simulation study in the Section 4. The real data applications are provided in the Section 5. The proof of the main theorem is accommodated in the Appendix.Definition 2.1. A general infinite order flat-top kernel K is definedwhere λ(s) is the Fourier transform of kernel K, and c > 0 is a fixed constant.and g is not unique and it should be chosen to make λ(s), λ 2 (s), and sλ(s) integrable [4] .Letř be a linear smootherř =Xj −x h ) and K is an infinite order flat top kernel from (2.1), also see McMurry and Politis [4] . The trapezoidal kernelis an infinite order flat top kernel satisfying Definition 2.1 since the Fourier transform of K(x) isWe define tilted linear smoother as followŝwhere p i 's are tilting parameters, p i ≥ 0 and n i p i = 1. The bandwidth parameter h and the vector of tilting parameters p = (p 1 , · · · , p n ), are to be estimated. In Section 4, we evaluate the performance of tilted versions of Nadaraya-Watson (1.2) and standard local linear estimators (1.3) in finite samples.Letr n (.|θ) be the tilted linear smoother from (2.3) for the regression function r, where θ = (h, p) is a vector of unknown parameters. Furtherř from (2.2) will be used as a comparator estimator of r,ř can be any estimator with an optimal convergence rate [18] . We will estimate θ by minimising the L 2 − distance betweenr n (.|θ) andř preserving the convergence rate ofř, provided the following assumptions holdThere existsθ such thatr n (.|θ) andř possess the same convergence rates, i.e. r n (.where δ n ≥ 0 converges to 0 as n tends to ∞, e.g. δ n = n −c for some c ∈ (0, 1/2). A further discussion on the assumptions (a)-(b) can be found in Doosti and Hall, [16] . We defineθ as the solution to the optimisation problem aŝsubject to the constraints for the bandwidth parameter h > 0 and vector p introduced in Section 2.2.In Theorem 1, we show that the convergence rate ofr n (.|θ) andř is O p (δ n ).If the assumptions (a)-(b) hold then for anyθ which fulfills (3.1) we haveProof. Due to Assumption (a), there existsθ such thatin which the first equation is a result of the triangle inequality, and specifically from the fact thatsee assumption, part(a). Ifθ is as in assumption 1, part (2) thenTogether, results (3.2) and (3.3) imply Theorem 1.Theorem 1 implies that the convergence rate ofr n (.|θ) estimator coincides with that ofř with the bandwidth parameter h replaced by its 'plug-in' type estimate similar to that from [4] and [18] .The regression function r ∈ C, where C is a class of regression functions, ifsubject to existence ofθ. Theorem 2 states thatr n (.|θ) andř converge to r uniformly in C. Let X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n be iid random variables with probability density function (pdf) f (x) and g(x) be its kernel based density function estimatorSuppose that (c) -(d) hold for φ K and φ q , Fourier transforms for K and q = r · g, respectively,(e) For constants C 1 , ..., C 5 > 0, and j = 1, ..., k the derivatives q (2j) exist, |q (2j) (x)| ≤ C 1 and |q (2j) (x)| ≤ C 1 , and either(f) Under assumption (e)-(1), δ n → 0 as n → ∞, so that n 1/2 δ n → ∞ , and under assumption (e)-(2), n 1/2 log(n) −C2/4C5 δ n → ∞, where C 2 and C 5 are defined in (e)- (2) .Assumption (c)-(f) are reasonable and considered in tilted density function estimation in [16] . It is anticipated that r n (.|θ) − r = O p (δ n ), where δ n converges to 0 slower than n −1/2 as shown in Theorem 3. Next we formulate the assumption using the first term of the expression in the left hand side of (3.4) lim II. If the assumptions in (e) hold uniformly for q ∈ C and obtain (3.6) then (3.5) is valid.The proof of Theorem 3 is given in the Appendix.We present the results of simulation study of the performance of tilted estimators in various settings. Data were generated using exponential function and sin regression functions with normal and uniform design distributions. Four samples of sizes n = (60, 100, 200, 1000) were sampled from the population with regression errors which had standard deviations σ = (0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.5, 2). In the setting for each set of σ and n we generated 500 data sets. The Median Integrated Squared Error (MISE) was estimated using the Monte Carlo method. The leave-one-out cross validation score from (1.5) was employed to choose the optimal bandwidths for Nadaraya-Watson and local linear estimators, [5] . For an infinite order flat-top kernel estimator, bandwidth was selected using the rule of thumb introduced by McMurry and Politis [4] as part of 'iosmooth'. The bandwidth parameters for tilted estimators were estimated using our suggested procedure. The exponential regression function r 1 (x) = x + 4exp(−2x 2 )/ √ 2π. The design densities were taken to be uniform on [−2, 2] and N (0, 1). The Integrated Squared Error (ISE) was calculated over the interval [−2, 2]. The sin regression function r 2 (x) = sin(4πx) was paired with the uniform design density on [0, 1]. The ISE has been calculated over [0, 1] and [0.15, 0.85], the latter is chosen for addressing boundary effect.In Table 1 we provide the MISEs for the proposed estimators, the comparator estimator, and the conventional estimators. Data were generated using r 1 (x) regression function along with normal design density and normal distribution for the error term. It is evident that for moderate sample size (n=200) and a large sample size (n=1000) and for the medium standard deviation (0.5 and 0.7), the tilted estimators outperformed other estimators. Moreover, for larger sample size, as standard deviation of error terms increases, the MISE of tilted estimators decreases. In Table 2 , we provide the MISEs for simulated data using the exponential regression function r 1 (x) With the uniform design density and the random normal error term. For fixed sample size, as the standard deviation increases, the tilted estimators otperform others. Although, for large sample sizes, the conventional estimators tend to perform better than tilted estimators. For smaller sample sizes and the moderate standard deviation levels, the tilted N-W estimator remains superior to the conventional estimators at some extent. Table 3 presents the MISEs for the simulated data using sin function with uniform design density and normal random errors. For fixed sample size and moderate standard deviations 0.5 and 0.7, the tilted estimators perform better than conventional estimators. For sample size n=1000 with and increasing standard deviation, the tilted estimators demonstrate better performance over others. Table 3 : MISE for Infinite Order (IO) estimator with the trapezoidal kernel, Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator, standard local linear (LL) estimator, tilted NW estimator with 4 (NW p4) and 10 (NW p10) weighting nodes, tilted LL estimator with 4 (LL p4) and 10 (LL p10) weighting nodes, sin regression function, uniform design density, edges included. In each row the minimum MISE is highlighted in bold. For studying boundary effect the results provided in Table 3 and 4 were evaluated under the identical experimental specifications except the MISEs in Table 4 were evaluated over [0.15,0.85]. According to the results when the sample size and standard deviation increased, the tilted estimators demonstrated improved performance. Table 4 : MISE for Infinite Order (IO) estimator with the trapezoidal kernel, Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator, standard local linear (LL) estimator, tilted NW estimator with 4 (NW p4) and 10 (NW p10) weighting nodes, tilted LL estimator with 4 (LL p4) and 10 (LL p10) weighting nodes, sin regression function, uniform design density, edges excluded. In each row the minimum MISE is highlighted in bold. It is a known fact that the performance of Nadaraya-Watson estimator deteriorates near edges, [19] . This effect is often referred to as a boundary problem. The results presented in Table 3 and 4, illustrate that the for scenarios (n = 60, σ = 0.5), (n = 200, σ = 0.7) and (n = 1000, σ = {1, 1.5, 2}) the tilted Nadaraya-Watson estimator outperformed its classical counterpart. From the boxplots in Figure 1 it is evident that the tilted estimators have smaller median ISEs. The extreme values of the ISEs for the tilted estimators are smaller than these of the conventional estimators. Similarity between the ISE distributions and their spreads of the IO and tilted estimators can also be seen in Figure 1 . Figure 1 : Boxplots of Integrated Square Errors (ISE) for Infinite Order (IO) estimator with the trapezoidal kernel, Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator, standard local linear (LL) estimator, tilted NW estimator with 4 (NW p4) and 10 (NW p10) weighting nodes, tilted LL estimator with 4 (LL p4) and 10 (LL p10) weighting nodes, sin regression function, edges excluded, n = 1000 and σ = 0.7In this simulation study for carrying out the MISE analysis, we had 500 replications done using Monte Carlo method. For MISE evaluation at each combination of an estimator, a function, a standard deviation and for a fixed sample size we had to solve the optimization problem. For the numerical implementation, we used the parallel computing technique in R facilitated through 'snow', 'doparallel', and 'foreach' packages.In this section, we study the performance of tilted estimators in the real data environment.The tilted N-W estimator along with two other kernel-based estimators are being used for a curve fitting to the COVID-19 data. We shall apply the tilted N-W estimator approach to daily confirmed new cases and number of daily death for 12 countries including Iran, Australia, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Brazil, United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, South Africa and United States of America, from 23 February 2020 to 28 October 2020, downloaded from https://www.ecdc.europa.eu. The logarithmic transformation has been applied, and when the number of deaths or new confirmed cases were zero we altered these observations by a positive value eliminating the associated singularity issue. The optimal bandwidth for each Nadaraya-Watson estimator was found through minimization of relevant cross-validation function, [5] , at the same time we kept the bandwidth fixed for an infinite order flat-top kernel (IO) estimator which was found using Mcmurry and Politis' rule of thumb, [4] . Along with the tilted N-W estimator, we applied the NW, and IO estimators. The tilted NW estimator performed the best in terms of the Mean Square Errors (MSE). Table 5 and 6 provide the MSE for each estimator for the confirmed new cases and number of deaths. In terms of minimising the MSE, the tilted NW estimator ranked first, followed by IO and N-W estimators. Slightly, improved performance of the tilted NW estimator is attributed to the lower MSE components at the edges versus other kernel-based regression function estimators which are generally known for so-called ""edge effect"", [20] . Figures 2 and 3 shows curve fit to the daily confirmed cases and daily deaths respectively. The dose-response data refers to a study of phenylephrine effects on rat corpus cavernosum strips. This data first appeared in Boroumand et al. [21] where the dose-response curves to phenylephrine (0.1 µM to 300 µM ) were obtained by applying the robust four-parameter logistic (4PL) regression.Here we have used a tilted smoother approach to dose-response curve fitting. In terms of Mean Square Errors (MSEs) the tilted local linear estimators performed better than local linear, infinite order flat-top kernel estimators including the robust 4PL model. The fitted dose-response curves using the tilted local linear, local linear, infinite order flat-top kernel estimator, and 4PL model are plotted in Figure 4 . The corresponding MSEs are listed in the caption of Figure 4 . The original dose-response data contained the outliers and the standard 4PL model had a poor fit. Due to this we compared the performance of the tilted estimator with the robust 4PL model. The tilted local linear estimator outperformed the robust 4PL model in terms of MSE.In this section we provide proof of Theorem 3 for tilted Nadaraya-Watson estimator as a form of tilted linear smoother from (2.3). The result for tilted local linear smoother can be proved analogously.Proof. Let p i = 1 n π(X i ) where π ≥ 0 and is a smooth function, and g(x) = Eĝ(x). It can be shown that the left-hand side of (A.2) is converging to r(x)g(x). We havemultiplying both sides by e −itx and integrating over x, we deduceif kernel K holds the assumption (c) and q = r · g meet the assumption (d), thenwith π from (A.3), thenr n in unbiased. Next we show that π satisfies 0 < π(X) < 1.If the assumption (e) relaxed then there exist C 6 and h 0 ≥ 0, for all h, 0 ≤ h ≤ h 0 , π > 0 and sup π ≤ C 6 < ∞ then for unbiasedr n var{r n (x|h, p)}dx ≤ 1 We recall that (f) Under the assumption (e)-(1), δ n → 0 as n → ∞, so that n 1/2 δ n → ∞ , and under assumption (e)-(2), n 1/2 log(n) −C2/4C5 δ n → ∞, where C 2 and C 5 are defined in (e)- (2) .Then under the assumption (e)-(1) and (f), we have that n 1/2 δ n → ∞ thus n −1 = o(δ 2 n ). Consequently, there exists h(n) ↓ 0 as n → ∞ such that (nh) −1 = O(δ 2 n ), for some large n, h < h 0 since 0 ≤ h ≤ h 0 . Next, by replacing O(δ 2 n ) in the right-hand side of (A.5), we have a new form of (A.5) which is true for specific choice of π defined at (A.3), and consideringθ = (h, p) in the case of (2. For this version of p i = n −1 π(X i ), i p i = 1 does not satisfy. However, this issue can be fixed by normalisation similar to that done in the first paragraph of the proof. Property (A.6) implies part I of Theorem 3 and part II can be concluded under uniformity of (A.6) over C.Under assumption (e)- (2) and (A.4), |rg (2j) (x)/rf | ≤ C 1 (1 + |x|) C2 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, defining C 6 = max(|C 1 |, ..., |C k |), we have for 0 ≤ h ≤ 1so, if λ 1n → ∞ and λ C2 1n h 2 → 0, then sup |π(X) − 1| → 0 (A. 7) it means that whenever |X| ≤ λ 1n , 0 < π(X) < 1.In the first paragraph of the proof, we showed that π(X) ≥ 0. Then we found an upper bound for π(X) in (A.7) when X ∈ [−λ 1n , λ 1n ]. Now, we want to show that the probability of X being out of this interval is almost zero which means for all X, 0 < π(X) < 1.Assumption (e)-(2) implies thatUsing (f), n −1/2 (log n) C2/2C5 δ n → ∞, or equivalently, δ 2 n = λ 2n n −1 (log n) C2/2C5 → ∞, where λ 2n exists. We choose h so that (nh) −1 = O(δ 2 n ); or for simplicity, (nh −1 ) = δ 2 n , then h = ",Australia,first author,2021-02-04,02
20cc55d3449e29a03ea47ea5bd2be6eb40281fd9,Uncertainty-Aware Semi-supervised Method using Large Unlabelled and Limited Labeled COVID-19 Data,"Since the beginning of 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) has been spreading all over the globe as it is contagious in an unprecedented manner [1] . In severe cases, it may lead to multiple organ failure, acute respiratory distress, heart problems, secondary infections in a comparatively high fraction of patients, and thus may cause deaths [2, 3] . On January 30th, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO), announced the outbreak as a ""public health emergency of international concern"" (PHEIC). The epicentre of the outbreak was the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and on March 11 th , 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. Early detection and initiation of treatment in severe cases are vital to deal with the disease and thus mitigating mortality [4] .Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is generally utilized to confirm COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR were not recorded as robust enough for the treatment of the presumptive patients and early detection [5, 6] . A non-invasive imaging technique called computed tomography (CT) scans can play a crucial role in identifying some characteristic symptoms in the lung related to COVID-19 [7, 8] . A study using chest CT scans achieved 97% sensitivity (580/601 patients, 95% CI, 95-98%) for COVID-19 detection [6] . Hence, chest CT scans may be effectively utilized in diagnosis and early detection of the disease. Since COVID-19 causes pulmonary changes, chest CT scans may exhibit imaging features analogous to other types of pneumonia, leading to confusion during COVID-19 detection. Hence, despite the advantages of CT, it is challenging to discriminate COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia.Accessibility to huge datasets facilitates deep learning tools and applications to process large amount of unstructured information, allowing high level abstractions with enhanced generalisability and permitting key feature extractions [9] . In the domain of medical imaging, deep learning has shown outstanding performance in automatic feature extraction [10] [11] [12] . Due to the noteworthy performance that deep learning methods achieved especially in image processing tasks, it is remarkably useful as feature learners or automatic regressors in addition to classification tasks [9] . Deep learning is utilized to differentiate and detect viral and bacterial pneumonia in pediatric chest CT scans [13] . Different imaging features of chest CT can also be detected using deep learning [14, 15] . Chest CT scans of the positive COVID-19 patients have a discrete radiographic pattern: multifocal patchy consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and/or interstitial changes with a predominantly peripheral distribution [6, 7] . Chest CT scans with the help of deep learning methods have illustrated their efficacy in distinguishing COVID-19 from other types of viral pneumonia and thus becomes a useful diagnostic tool. This, in turn, leads to controlling and managing the pandemic situation [16] .Chest X-ray and CT scans have the potential to detect COVID-19 and isolate the patients in time. As most hospitals are equipped with X-ray, it is the first choice of the radiologists. However, chest X-ray images cannot distinguish soft tissues accurately [17] . Chest CT scan can be utilized as an alternative method. As the number of radiologists is scarce and also busy in pandemic situations, automatic detection of COVID-19 from chest images is highly desirable. Utilizing deep learning, Li et al. [18] designed a COVID-19 detection model called COVNet by extracting features from chest CT. Other non-pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) CT exams are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model. Their model could discriminate CAP from other lung diseases, accurately. Wang et al. [19] utilized the deep learning strategies to derive the graphical features from the CT images of COVID-19 patients. In these images, there are radiographical changes in the case of infected patients. Gozes et al. [20] proposed an automated approach using CT images for quantification, detection, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. They used robust 3D and 2D models based on deep learning concepts and integrated them with clinical perceptive. They utilized a multi-centre international dataset and generated a corona score using a 3D volume review from thoracic CT features. This score helped the system to compute the evolution of ailment over time.Several studies have applied new approaches to detect COVID-19 cases using machine learning and deep learning approaches. Hemdan et al. [21] devised a deep learning-based framework dubbed as COVIDX-Net to aid clinicians to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images. They partitioned the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Zhang et al. [22] presented an anomaly detection deep technique for reliable and efficient COVID-19 detection. Apostolopoulos et al. [23] analysed the X-ray images of normal incidents, confirmed COVID-19 cases, and common bacterial pneumonia for automated detection of COVID-19 patients. They applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning. Their model derived biomarkers related to the COVID-19 illness. Butt et al. [24] compared multiple CNN models and devised a deep learning model based on 3D and 2D networks to classify no-infection, influenza viral pneumonia, and COVID-19 samples. Their model successfully differentiated the non-coronavirus and coronavirus cases per thoracic CT records.Other approaches include Song et al. [25] who devised a CT diagnosis system based on deep learning technology and termed it as DeepPneumonia for the identification of COVID-19 patients. Main lesion features, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) which are the key in the diagnosis, are located by their model. Sethy et al. [26] proposed a deep learning technique based on X-ray radiographs analysis for detection of COVID-19 patients. They implemented support vector machine classifier using the deep features to discriminate COVID-19 X-ray images from others. Their technique could assist the radiologists in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.The test kits for COVID-19 are limited in hospitals owing to the exponential growth of the cases. Therefore, it is crucial to search for a fast alternative to detect such cases in order to confine the spread. Narin et al. [27] presented detection of COVID-19 patients based on Inception-ResNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 utilizing chest X-ray images. Confusion matrices and ROC analyses are performed with 5-fold cross-validation. Shi et al. [28] established a deep learning oriented CT and clinical features based prognosis model for assessing the severity of COVID-19 infection. They applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and developed the pneumonia severity index (PSI). Severe patients had higher PSI (p<0.001), percentage of infection (POICT), and mass of infection (MOICT) than non-severe ones. Their model proved its efficacy in the prediction of patients' severity.Pervasive demands have arisen to combat COVID-19 pandemic crisis by designing an automated and efficient diagnosis system. Maghdid et al. [29] presented an accurate deep learning tool with fast detection mechanism for COVID-19 cases. Various CT and X-ray images have been integrated to provide a comprehensive and publicly available dataset. The detection technique consists of transfer learning and deep learning. The network is trained using AlexNet and CNN models on the CT and Xrays dataset. The overview of published researches on COVID-19 detection is presented in Table 1 . Table 1 .

[29] CT and X-ray 170 X-ray images and 361 CT images Deep neural networks have great representation power but, their performance heavily relies on availability of labelled training data. In case the labelled data is limited, the deep networks won't be able to learn well. However, we can still train the deep networks well by exploiting unlabelled data. The justification behind our hypothesis is the success of transfer learning [40] . In a nutshell, in transfer learning a learner trained for a specific task is modified for another task which bears some similarity to . Although tasks and are not the same, the learner trained for can still benefit the similarity between and which accelerates the learning of . This is the motivation for our two-phase semisupervised approach. In the first phase, the discriminator is trained to detect valid CT scan images. In the second phase, using the gained expertise from the first phase, the trained discriminator can learn sick and healthy CT images faster. The learning boost is due to the fact that regardless of being COVID or healthy, each training/test image is a valid CT scan which the discriminator has mastered using unlabelled data.Considering the above argument, one may be tempted to use non-deep learners in an attempt to reduce the required amount of the training data. However, the major drawback of such learners is that they treat the input samples as vectors. To feed images to such non-deep learners, we are forced to reshape the images into vectors. The reshaping operation destroys the meaningful features that each pixel has to offer relative to its neighbouring pixels. Hence, the application of deep learning based models seems to be inevitable if the features present in image inputs are to be captured properly. Hence using semisupervised learning to train deep models with a mixture of unlabelled and limited labelled data is the best solution.The main contribution of our work is twofold. First, we collected a dataset of lung CT scan images useful for training/evaluation of COVID-19 detection methods. Second, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to propose the semi-supervised COVID-19 detection method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) [41] to detect this disease. The proposed method has been improved using Sobel edge detection. Despite being semi-supervised, our method is competitive to its supervised counterparts. This feature is beneficial when labelled data is hard to get. Although we have focused on COVID-19 detection, our method is not limited to any specific dataset. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides prerequisites, Section 3 describes our dataset, Section 4 elaborates the proposed method, Section 5 presents the experimental results and Section 6 concludes the paper.In this section, the required mathematical concept are briefly reviewed. First, GAN is reviewed since our method is based on it. The Gaussian Process is also reviewed since it is used during our experiments.Originally proposed by GoodFellow, GAN is a generative model with massive applications. Compared to its predecessors, GAN is capable of generating high-quality images which are vivid and sharp. Basically, GAN is made of two neural networks, namely Generator (G) and Discriminator (D). The job of the Generator is to produce high-quality images which are called fake samples. The Discriminator must distinguish between the real and fake samples. The two networks compete against each other in a minimax game. That is why we call them adversarial networks. The objective function based on which the two networks are trained is given as [41] :where ( ) is the real data (available dataset) distribution, ( ) is the Generator input noise distribution, D(x) is the Discriminator output, z is the (Gaussian) noise vector and G(z) is the Generator output. As can be seen, the Generator is trying to minimize the objective function in equation (1), while Discriminator is trying to maximize it. To this end, the following gradients are calculated:where and are the Discriminator and Generator parameters, respectively [41] . The gradients are computed over mini-batch of m samples.Gaussian Process (GP) is a non-parametric probabilistic model which can be used for regression or classification. GP can be considered as an infinite-dimensional Gaussian distribution which is defined on functions as follows [42] : Each ( ( ) ) is a random variable, ( ) is the mean function and ( , ) is the covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution [42] . The mean function is initialized to constant zero ( ( ) = 0). Each element of ( , ) is the output of a positive definite kernel function : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ which receives ( ) and ( ) as input. In this paper we use squared exponential kernel:where the kernel function hyper-parameters , , and are signal variance, noise variance, and length scale, respectively. The hyper-parameters are learned based on the available training data.In this paper, we focus on binary classification of healthy and sick people. Hence, in this section, classification using GP is briefly reviewed. Following the binary classification conventions, the two class labels are denoted as{−1, +1}. The basic idea behind binary classification using GP is as follows.A prior GP is placed over the latent function ( ). Output of GP is squashed through a logistic function (. ) to obtain prior ( ) ≜ ( = +1| ) = ( ( )). Here ( ) values are not observable and we are not interested in them either. We only care about input vector and desired class label . The sole purpose of ( ) is to make the model formulation more convenient.Assuming that the training inputs are aggregated as column vectors in matrix , and their corresponding labels are expressed as vector , the GP inference is carried out in two steps:1. For a test case * , the distribution of the latent variable ( * ) is computed as [42] :2. Now ( * | , , * ) is used to produce a probabilistic prediction as:̃ * ≜ ( * = +1| , , * ) = ∫ ( * ) ( * | , , * ) * .3 Dataset descriptionIn this study, 10000 lung CT scan images were captured at Omid Hospital in Tehran. The images have been collected from February 2020 to April 2020. The mean and standard deviation of the patients' age were 49.5±18.5 years old with 45% of the cases were male. Each image has been checked by three radiologists to determine whether the case is COVID-19 or not. Ethical approval to conduct use these data was obtained from the hospital. Typical normal and COVID-19 CT images used for this study is shown in Figure 1 . Despite the fact that the new coronavirus is spreading quickly worldwide, the amount of available labelled data for diagnosing the disease is limited. Also, due to the rapid growth of this virus, the ability to label data quickly is desirable. Therefore, this study takes a semi-supervised approach to train the deep neural network for diagnosing coronavirus with high accuracy where only 10% of the training dataset is labelled. The proposed method has two phases. They are explained clearly in the following sections.The objective of the first phase is to learn the underlying distribution of dataset samples achieved using unsupervised training [43] of GAN model using unlabelled data. The reason for using GAN is its ability to learn the training data distribution. Upon completion of the first phase, the GAN networks parameters are trained such that the generator is capable of producing high quality fake images and the discriminator is capable of distinguishing fake image from the real ones. This means that the discriminator has learned to identify the valid CT scan image. The output of the first phase is the trained parameters of discriminator which are used as a starting point for the second phase.The objective of the second phase is to fine tune the discriminator parameters such that it can classify CT scan images as COVID or healthy. To this end, the labelled data are used in supervised manner [44] to train the discriminator. It is worth noting that the generator is not needed in the second phase. The two phases of our method are depicted in Figure 2 . As can be seen, the discriminator output in the first phase is the probability of being real given the input image while the output in the second phase is probability of being COVID infected. Each sample is classified as COVID if p(COVID) > 0.5, otherwise it is classified as Healthy. The advantage of probabilistic output is that it can also be used as an uncertainty measure. The more the discriminator output is close to 0.5, the higher the uncertainty about the sample class (Health/COVID) is. Hence, looking at the discriminator output, the human expert gets an insight on how much the classifier output can be trusted. In case the classification has low confidence (p(COVID)~0.5), the human expert can ask for another human/classifier to confirm the class of the test images. The generator architecture [41] is shown in Figure 3 . The input to the generator is a (Gaussian) noise vector which is fed to multiple convolutional layers. These layers convert the noise vector to synthetic CT scan images. The discriminator architecture is depicted in Figure 4 . The input to discriminator is a two-dimensional image which could be a real sample or a fake one produced by the generator. During the forward pass of the discriminator, the input image is reduced to a scalar value which denotes the discriminator judgment about the received input sample. In the first phase, the ideal behaviour of the discriminator is to provide a higher probability of being real (p(real)) for real images and a lower probability for fake ones. Since the discriminator is competing against the generator (usually after the successful training), the probability provided by the discriminator is around 0.5 for both real and fake samples. This stems from the fact that the quality of the generator's fake samples is high enough to deceive the discriminator. The desired behaviour of the discriminator in the second phase is to distinguish between COVID and healthy images. Our dataset contains 10000 CT scan images which are divided into 80% training (8000 images) and 20% testing (2000 images). The test data are all labelled. Moreover, 10% (800 images) of the training data is labelled. For validation, 20% (160 images) of the labelled training data is used.To improve the performance, we pre-process the available data. The edge detection by Sobel operator is applied to the data to further improve the feature extraction in GAN.The main steps of our method are illustrated in Figure 5 . In the first step, the dataset is partitioned to training, testing, and validation as explained in section 4.4. In step two, 10% of the training samples and entire testing samples are labelled, manually. Before any pre-processing, in the third step, the Sobel technique is used to detect the edges of the images. Labelled and unlabelled data are pre-processed in step four. Initial pre-processing includes resizing of images to 100*100 and normalizing them. The normalization maps the intensity of all image pixels to interval [0, 1]. The fifth step involves the creation of GAN generator and discriminator networks' structures that are presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4 , respectively. The unsupervised training of sixth step is exactly the same as standard training procedure of GAN. The generator is trained such that it deceives the discriminator with high-quality fake images. The discriminator is trained in an unsupervised way by using the unlabelled data to distinguish between real and fake images. In the seventh step, the discriminator (with parameters initialized in step 6) is trained in a supervised manner to gain the ability to classify input images as healthy or COVID patients. To this end, the discriminator last layer activation provides the probability of each image of being COVID. In this step, the labelled data comes into play. Although the number of labelled data is small, the discriminator is able to distinguish COVID and healthy samples since its parameters have already been initialized to sensible values in the previous step. Finally, the trained discriminator is used to classify the test data in step eight. The proposed method has been implemented in Python using Keras library, which runs on top of TensorFlow. The experiments have been run on a PC with GFORCE GTX 950 GPU and 16GB of RAM. Hyperparameters of the method are explained in Table 2 . In this section, the experimental results of GAN and SCLLD methods for detection of COVID-19 patients based on CT scan data are presented. For SCLLD method, we provided three loss plots at iterations 3500, 4000, and 4500 averaged on five number of runs with 95% confidence intervals. These plots are shown in parts a-c of Figures 6-8 . Part d of these figures show ROC plots for SCLLD method.Moreover, we have compared the methods based on criteria such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, recall, specificity, F1-score, and AUC. These criteria are computed according to the following equations [13] :Sensitivity or Recall = TP TP + FN ,The experimental results for SCLLD method are presented in section 5.1. We have also summarised the results in Table 3 .The results of experiments at iterations 3500, 4000, and 4500 of SCLLD method are presented in Figures 6-8 . The proposed method has two training phases: unsupervised and supervised. The loss plots in parts a and b of Figure 6 belong to the unsupervised training phase while the loss plot in part c is related to supervised training. Part d of the figure illustrates the ROC plot of trained SCLLD. The structure of plots in figures 7 and 8 are similar to the one explained in Figure 6 . The only difference is the iterations (4000 and 4500) at which the plots are presented. The motivation behind plotting the results at multiple points during training is the investigation to the increasing number of iterations. This investigation is important since at some point during the training, the performance of SCLLD may degrade. Therefore, it is common practice to diagnose the SCLLD performance and stop the training when the performance of the model does not improve any more.It can be noted that, parts a and b of Figures 6-8 reveal that using Sobel operator has accelerated the training pace. Therefore, the best performance is achieved at iteration 3500. Beyond that iteration, the model has started to degrade quickly, leading to considerable loss value at iteration 4500 (part b of figure 8 ).The ROC plots at different iterations of SCLLD method match the accuracy results reported in Table  3 . Considering that the best performance is achieved at iteration 3500, it makes sense that ROC plots at this iteration reach value of 1.0 faster compared to their counterparts at iterations 4000 and 4500. For SCLLD, the accuracy decreases at iteration 4000 but increases slightly at iteration 4500. That is why ROC at iteration 4500 increases faster as compared to ROC at iteration 4000. An example of the CT images, result of applying Soble filter on them and the final results of GRAD-CAM are shown in Figure  9 . Grad-CAM is a generalization of the Class Activation Mapping. It does not needs re-training and can be applied broadly to any CNN-based architectures [45] .Based on the existing literature, GAN is good at capturing the underlying distribution of the training dataset [42] . However, the limited number of available labelled data might hurt the classification performance. This is the motivation for our semi-supervised approach SCLLD. In this section, we evaluated the performance of our method for different number of labelled data. This experiment reveals how much our semi-supervised approach can tolerate limited labelled data. The results for increasing sample size of training labelled data (1% to 10%) are presented in Table 4 . It is clear that even in a semi-supervised setting, the amount of labelled data cannot be less than a certain threshold, otherwise the performance drops dramatically. This scenario is observed if the labelled data falls less than 3%. For labelled data size above 6%, the performance metrics are similar and the best results are achieved when 8% of the data are labelled. Theoretically, increasing the training data should lead to better performance. However, it is customary to train deep neural networks using mini-batch sizes smaller than the whole dataset. The benefit of mini-batch training is twofold [46] . First, smaller batch size reduces the memory demand for one step of training. Second, smaller batch size results in noisy gradients which has regularization effect preventing over-fitting. The noisy gradients lead to stochasticity during the learning process which is why the accuracy values in Table 4 do not necessarily increase with larger labelled data size. As can be seen in Table 4 , the total training time is not a function of labelled data size. This is due to the fact that regardless of being labelled or not, all samples are eventually used during the supervised or semi-supervised training. Hence, the total cost of training is determined by the total number of labelled/unlabelled samples. To highlight the role of using unlabelled data in our method, we have also trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on labelled data in a purely supervised manner. The structure of CNN is the same as our GAN discriminator. According to Figure 10 , it is possible to compare the loss of CNN and our proposed method during the train and validation phases. According to this figure, it is clear that although the loss function of our proposed method is worse than CNN during the training phase, it shows better performance during the validation phase.The accuracy on training data and validation data during the training of CNN is shown in Figure 11 . Looking at the accuracy plot, it is evident that the training has been stopped early by Keras library. The reason for early stopping is the fact that the CNN performance has started to degrade after iteration 11. a b The performance of the trained CNN on test data is presented in Table 5 . It is clear that CNN training has suffered from the lack of sufficient amount of labelled data. While CNN requires a huge amount of labelled training data in order to unleash its representation power; our method can enjoy unlabelled data to reach significantly better performance even if labelled data are limited. To gain a better understanding of our results, we have also compared our proposed method with a Gaussian process (GP) approach which is trained in supervised manner with our dataset. The advantage of GP is that it can represent any dataset. The drawback is its high computational complexity, which is of the order O(N 3 ) [47] for N training samples. Considering that the amount of labelled data in our dataset is small, GP is an ideal choice since (i) the computation overhead is limited as the amount of available labelled data is limited. (ii) GP provides an estimate of the uncertainty in portions of the sample space where it has not seen enough data so the user knows where the GP output can be trusted.As can be seen in Table 6 , despite its power, GP exhibited poor performance due to lack of sufficient labelled data. We can observe that even robust supervised methods cannot deal with limited labelled data. This clearly shows the importance of semi-supervised learning methods. The ROC diagram of GP experiment on our dataset is also presented in Figure 12 . To evaluate the generalization of our method, we have evaluated the performance of our model using the publicly available Kaggle dataset [13] . The dataset belongs to China National Centre for Bioinformation with 8535 positive and 9430 negative CT scan samples. It can be noted from the presented results in Table 7 that our method has shown reasonable performance. Hence, our method is not limited to a specific dataset. COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than 1 million deaths and is spreading faster than expected. Currently, early detection of virus is of the highest importance which is a challenging task. Moreover, the virus detection test is expensive and not robust. Hence, chest x-ray and CT scans may be the useful tool to detect COVID-19 at an early stage. In addition to these detection techniques, researchers are utilizing AI methods to accelerate the detection and treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. This is the motivation behind our proposed method based on DL using a semi-supervised method.Our objective is to classify healthy and COVID-19 infected patients accurately using chest CT scan images. We have used the GAN method to deal with limited labelled data. To this end, GAN discriminator network parameters are initialized using unlabelled data. Next, the network parameters are fine-tuned with small number of labelled data. The proposed approach is further improved by preprocessing the input images using Sobel edge detection. After the training, the GAN discriminator is used to classify the test data. Using the probabilistic discriminator output, our system provides the human experts with an uncertainty measure about its decision. The experimental results reveal the superiority of SCLLD method as compared to the GAN method alone (Table 3) .To evaluate our SCLLD against other supervised methods, we have compared SCLLD performance with our dataset and other methods using their datasets (Table 8) . Testing on different datasets is necessary since our dataset has limited labelled data which can hurt the performance of supervised methods. This comparison reveals that while supervised learners are crippled in the absence of enough labelled data, our method is capable of dealing with limited labelled data and learning from unlabelled ones reaching performance which is on par with supervised methods. This is clearly the advantage of our method, which is due to its semi-supervised nature.The drawback of our method is its computation overhead. In this work, we have used two training phases. In the first phase, standard GAN training is executed, which involves training of generator and discriminator together. The first source of overhead is generator training since when training is done, it is no longer needed. In the second phase of training, discriminator is trained using labelled data. Hence, the second source of overhead is training of discriminator twice (unsupervised and supervised). We may note that the final output of our method is the trained discriminator.In future work, we investigate the effect of training the generator using feature matching [48] . Moreover, it is interesting to explore the effect of using soft labels [48] during the unsupervised training phase of GAN. To this end, hard labels (zero and one) corresponding to fake and real samples are replaced with a random number between [0, 0.3] and [0.7, 1], respectively. Soft labels usually lead to stable training. ",Australia,first author,2021-02-12,02
f28a3eceddc1cf74f61e7ea53d4ecc95471515c4,"Dual targeting of toll-like receptor 4 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: a proposed approach to SARS-CoV-2 treatment ""","The occurrence of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has rapidly become a pandemic, resulting in devastating effects to the global economy and public health [1] , with over 70.4 million cumulative cases and 1.6 million deaths [2] . While the majority of infected patients remain asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms, the pathophysiological hallmarks of the severe form of COVID-19 is characterized not only by viral infection, but accompaniment of an exacerbated and dysfunctional inflammatory response, which has been correlated to systemic immunopathological consequences (i.e., cytokine storm), pulmonary and respiratory complications, multiorgan failures and mortality [1, 3, 4] . Despite current knowledge pertaining to the pivotal role that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has during SARS-CoV-2 infection, burgeoning evidence is emerging, reporting viral susceptibility in intra-and extrapulmonary immune and non-immune cells lacking or expressing low concentrations of ACE2 [5] [6] [7] . Furthermore, loss of ACE2 activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in augmented pulmonary injury and worsened outcomes in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities [7, 8] . Additionally, recent publications have revealed toll-like receptors (TLR), specifically TLR4, as major contributors to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and pathogenesis [1, 9] . The SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been shown to favor and directly bind to the extracellular domain of TLR4 [1] , which may result in the elicitation of the aggressive inflammatory response observed in patients with severe COVID-19. As the developments of vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments to target SARS-CoV-2 are underway, researchers and clinicians have been challenged to urgently create an acceptable therapy to control infection and improve patient outcomes [1, 10] . We propose that a multipronged pharmaceutical treatment targeting restoration of ACE2 activity and TLR4 inhibition may represent an appealing approach to combat SARS-CoV-2 virus.Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ACE2, a component of the renin-angiotensin system, has gained notoriety by being identified as a key receptor involved in SARS-CoV-2 S protein entry into host cells [11] [12] [13] . However, burgeoning evidence is emerging, reporting viral susceptibility in intra-and extrapulmonary immune and non-immune cells lacking or expressing low levels of ACE2 [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, the theory associating enhanced infection susceptibility, severe pathological outcomes and increased mortality rate in patients with cardiovascular disease comorbidities prescribed pharmaceuticals that indirectly increase ACE2 expression [14] [15] [16] was unfounded during a recent clinical trial [16] . The randomised 30-day clinical trial was conducted to determine if continuing ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (n = 325) versus suspending treatment (n = 334) placed COVID-19 patients previously diagnosed with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases at a greater risk to SARS-CoV-2 viral susceptibility and worsened patient prognosis [16] . Results from the trial determined that these therapies failed to enhance intracellular viral load and had no effect on the occurrence of severe COVID-19 outcomes or mortality rate [16] . Yet COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease have a five times higher mortality rate than those without [8] .A previous letter, authored by our team, outlined the potential use of diminazene aceturate (DIZE) (an ACE2 activator [17] ) as a treatment to restore ACE2 activity in COVID-19 patients [18] . Patients with severe COVID-19 experience organ dysfunction, which manifests as acute respiratory syndrome and acute cardiac, hepatic and renal injury [19] . Damage to multiple organ systems may be caused by loss of ACE2 function subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 binding [7, 8] . ACE2 downregulation has previously been associated with myocardial [20] and pulmonary disease [21] in humans. In murine models of influenza A, proper homeostatic functioning of circulating ACE2 has been shown to be protective against influenza A-induced acute lung injury [22] . Conversely, ACE2 deletion in mice has been associated with increased aggravation and severity during influenza A infection [22] . Therefore, we postulate that ACE2 may have an undetermined protective role during SARS-CoV-2, which is silenced/lost once SARS-CoV-2 enters and hijacks host cells. Thus, restoring ACE2 functions through administration of DIZE may promote cardiovascular and pulmonary protection against SARS-CoV-2 and may improve COVID-19 patients (with and without pre-existing comorbidities) outcomes.Our hypothesis of alternative receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection is supported by current literature demonstrating interactions between TLRs and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [1] . TLRs are integral to innate immunity, as they are sentinel pattern recognition receptors responsible for host surveillance by identifying foreignand self-molecular signatures [23, 24] . Ten functional TLRs have been reported in humans, which are abundantly expressed in immune and non-immune tissues, including cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic and nervous systems [25] . TLRs display specialty and specify by identifying unique pathogen-associated molecular patterns (highly conserved motifs displayed by pathogens) [23] and danger-associated molecular patterns (endogenous alarm signals released by stressed, damaged or dying host cells), independent of infection [24] . However, the end product of robust sterile inflammation, produced through the MyD88-dependent pathway (TLR1, 2, 4-10) [26] or the TRIF-dependent pathway (TLR3 and 4) [27] , is ubiquitous among TLRs independent of the origin of the activating ligand. Recent literature has identified TLR4 as a key mediator during SARS-CoV-2 infection, involved in both infectivity [1, 28] and induction of the vicious inflammatory response [29] reported in patients with severe symptoms. While TLR3 and 7 agonists have been proposed as potential therapeutic targets for prophylactic agents to prime antiviral innate immune system responses [30] [31] [32] , their ability to engage with SARS-CoV-2 S protein and to be used for pharmaceutical targets after infection has been established remains elusive. Therefore, due to the involvement of TLR4 during infectivity and establishment of infection, we postulate that its inhibition may provide a promising treatment to combat COVID-19.TLR4 is predominantly responsible for providing immunity against Gram-negative bacterial, through identification of lipopolysaccharides [33, 34] . However, association and subsequent activation of TLR4 by viral fusion proteins and glycoproteins, including viruses that target the pulmonary system [35, 36] , have been reported. An in silico study, investigating the TLR-binding efficacy to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, demonstrated direct engagement between TLR1, 4 and 6 and subunit 1 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein [1] . Of which, TLR4 was favored, displaying the highest binding efficacy value of -120.2 [1] . The results from this study have been supported by a preprint indicating direct binding between the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and TLR4 in human monocytes (THP-1 cell line) [28] . Therefore, TLR4 may represent an alternative pathway used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into cells, accounting for viral vulnerability reported in intra-and extrapulmonary immune and non-immune cells lacking or expressing low concentrations of ACE2 [5] [6] [7] .Uncontrolled TLR4-mediated inflammation has been suggested to contribute to immunopathological consequences in COVID-19 patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested from COVID-19 patients demonstrated increased expression of TLR4 and its corresponding downstream signaling molecules (CD14, MyD88, TRAF6, IRAK1, TIRAP, TICAM-1 and NF-kB) [29] . Additionally, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have increased levels of activating danger-associated molecular patterns of TLR4, including β-defensin-3 [37] , fibrinogen [38, 39] , HSP70 [40] , HMGB1 [41] , syndecan [42] , S100A8/9 [29, 41, 43] , and surfactant A and D [44] ), which may be responsible for inducing persistent and aggressive inflammation, resulting in cytokine storm and severe pulmonary dysfunction. This is supported by reports of patients with COVID-19 displaying increased levels of cytokines and chemokines releases after TLR4 activation (IL-1β, -2, -6, -8, -9, TNFα, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MIP-1α and MIP-1β [45, 46] ).Taken together, we postulate that inhibiting TLR4 using the novel antagonist resatorvid (TAK242) may improve patient outcomes by preventing systemic infection and dampening the inflammatory response. TAK242 is a potent and selective TLR4 antagonist, which displays anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory abilities [47] . It is believed that TAK242 is able to exert its potent anti-inflammatory abilities due to its low molecular weight, allowing for rapid distribution to sites of inflammation [48] . Our hypothesis is supported by results demonstrating the ability for TAK242 to potently inhibit release of IL-1β from human THP-1 cells after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.As there has yet to be significant advances in vaccine development against the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, there is great urgency to develop an effective pharmaceutical treatment to be administered to patients to improve outcomes. We propose that a dual-acting pharmaceutical treatment, which combines TLR4 inhibition and ACE2 activation, may represent a strategic therapeutic approach to dampen severe inflammation, restore ACE2 functionality, protect cardiac and pulmonary tissues and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the development of a universal vaccine remains underway, a combination therapy of DIZE (ACE2 activator) and TAK242 (TLR4 inhibitor) may be a promising therapy to be administered to patients, allowing for effective treatment of COVID-19 patients.

673a13e9f802b959ac4c8087873f1a4e9a138f17,Genomic mutations and changes in protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus),"Since the first genomes were collected in December 2019, there have been many findings on the mutations of SARS-CoV-2. For example, Phan 16 analysed 86 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 downloaded from the the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https ://www.gisai d.org/) and found 93 mutations over the entire viral genome sequences. Among them, there are three mutations occurring in the RBD region of the spike surface glycoprotein S, including N354D, D364Y and V367F, with the numbers showing amino acid (AA) positions in the protein. That study also reveals three deletions in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from Japan, USA and Australia. Two of these deletion mutations are in the ORF1ab polyprotein and one deletion occurs in the 3' end of the genome. Likewise, a study in 17 shows that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes may have undergone recurrent, independent mutations at 198 sites with 80% of these are of the nonsynonymous type. Alternatively, a SNP genotyping study in 18 discovered highly frequent mutations in the genes encoding the S protein, RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein. Those high-frequency SNP mutations are worth further investigations for vaccine development because they may be linked to the virus transmissibility and virulence. Tang et al. 19 investigated 103 genomes of COVID-19 patients and discover mutations in 149 sites of these genomes. The study also shows that the spike gene S consistently has larger dS values (synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) than other genes. In addition, two major lineages of the virus, denoted as L and S, have been specified based on two tightly linked SNPs. The L lineage is found more prevalent than the S lineage among the examined sequences.Korber et al. 20 tracked the mutations of spike protein S of SARS-CoV-2 because it plays an important role in mediating infection of targeted cells and is the focus of vaccine and antibody therapy development efforts 21 . They detected 14 mutations in the spike protein that are growing, especially the mutation D614G that rapidly becomes the dominant form when spread to a new geographical region. Likewise, Hashimi 22 analysed the mutation frequency in the spike protein S of 796 SARS-CoV-2 genomes downloaded from the GISAID and GenBank databases. The study found 64 mutations occurring in the S protein sequences obtained from multiple countries. It suggests that the virus is spreading in two forms, the D614 form (residue D at position 614 in the S protein) takes 68.5% while the G614 form takes 31.5% proportion of the examined isolates. Koyama et al. 23 on the other hand found several variants of SARS-CoV-2 that may cause drifts and escape from immune recognition by using the prediction results of B-cell and T-cell epitopes in 24 . Typically, the mutation D614G occurring in the spike www.nature.com/scientificreports/ protein is found prevalent in the European population. This mutation may have caused antigenic drift, resulting in vaccine mismatches that lead to a high mortality rate of this population. A recent situation report 25 by Nextstrain 26 on genomic epidemiology of novel coronavirus using 5193 publicly shared COVID-19 genomes shows that SARS-CoV-2 on average accumulates changes at a rate of 24 substitutions per year. This is approximately equivalent to 1 mutation per 1000 bases in a year. This evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 is typical for a coronavirus, and it is smaller than that of influenza (average 2 mutations per 1000 bases per year) and HIV (average 4 mutations per 1000 bases per year). Shen et al. 12 conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples obtained from 8 patients with COVID-19 and found no evidence for the transmission of intrahost variants as well as a high evolution rate of the virus with the number of intrahost variants ranged from 0 to 51 around a median number of 4. Pachetti et al. 27 examined 220 genomic sequences of COVID-19 patients from the GISAID database and discovered 8 novel recurrent mutations at nucleotide locations 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations at locations 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 are mostly found in Europe while those at locations 17746, 17857 and 18060 occur in sequences obtained from patients in North America. Likewise, a study in 28 on 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences discovered 116 mutations. Among them, the mutations at position C8782T in the ORF1ab gene, T28144C in the ORF8 gene and C29095T in the N gene are common.SARS-CoV-2 mutation detection. We use 6324 sequence records downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database on 2020-06-17. The latest collection date for the samples from which the sequences were derived was on 2020-06-05. The data, which were collected in 45 countries, include both nucleotide sequences and protein translations of coding genes. A proportion of the 6324 records have sequences of only few proteins, i.e. these records do not annotate all 11 proteins (ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10, S, E, M and N). The number of available sequences is thus different from one protein to another (see column ""Available"" in Table 1 ). Genome sequences that do not specify country or AA sequences that contain letter ""X"" representing an unknown AA are excluded in our calculations. We use the genome obtained from the isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, accession number NC_045512 as the reference genome. For the mutation detection purpose, we apply a dynamic programming algorithm to protein AA sequences to get global pairwise alignments between a reference sequence and a query sequence. Specifically, we use the Python Bio.pairwise2.align.globalms function (https ://biopy thon. org/docs/dev/api/Bio.pairw ise2.html) where a match is given 2 points, a mismatch is deducted 0.5 points, 2 points are deducted when opening a gap, and 1 point is deducted when extending it. Gaps are then inserted into nucleotide sequences corresponding to the resulted protein sequence alignments. Using the resulted pairwise alignments, we are able to compare query sequences and the reference sequences at each position and identify locations of insertion, deletion, synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations.Secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction. Virus protein structure plays a key role in its functions and a change in structure shape may affect its functions, virulence, infectivity and transmissibility, possibly resulting in non-functional proteins. Protein secondary structure is defined by hydrogen bonding patterns, which make an intermediate form before the protein folds into a three-dimensional shape composing its tertiary structure. Eight types of protein secondary structure defined by the Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure (DSSP) include 3 10 helix (G), α helix (H), π helix (I), hydrogen bonded turn (T), extended strand in parallel and/or anti-parallel β-sheet conformation (E), residue in isolated β-bridge (B), bend (S) and coil (C). The DSSP tool assigns every residue to one of the eight possible states. In a reduced form, these 8 conformational states can be diminished to 3 states: H = {H, G, I}, E = {E, B} and C = {S, T, C} 29 . The protein secondary structure represents interactions between neighboring or near-by AAs as its functional three-dimensional shape is created through the polypeptide folding. We thus determine a change in protein secondary structure if any change happens in the structures of the mutated AA and its 10 neighboring AAs compared to those of the reference Table 1 . Summary of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on each protein and secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility changes. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ sequence. In detail, we consider 5 AAs ahead and 5 AAs behind the mutated AA. The same approach is applied when considering a change of the protein relative solvent accessibility. Solvent-exposed area represents the area of a biomolecule on a surface that is accessible to a solvent. Accordingly, a residue is considered as exposed if at least 25% of that residue must be exposed, denoted as the ""e"" state. Alternatively, the residue is determined as buried, i.e. the ""b"" state. There have been various protein secondary structure prediction programs in the literature and many of those were developed based on artificial intelligence models using protein AA sequences such as JPred4 30 , Spider2 31 , Porter 5 32 , RaptorX 33 , PSSpred 34 , YASSPP 35 and SSpro 14 . In this paper, we use the protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility prediction methods SSpro/ACCpro 5 14 within the SCRATCH-1D software suite (release 1.2, 2018) 15 . These predictors were built using the bidirectional recursive neural networks and a combination of the sequence similarity and sequence-based structural similarity to sequences in the Protein Data Bank 36 . Prediction results of 8-class structure (SSpro8 predictor) and 25%-threshold relative solvent accessibility (ACCpro predictor) are used for statistics on protein secondary structure and accessibility changes. We however also report in the spreadsheet supplemental information prediction results of 3-class structure (SSpro predictor) and relative solvent accessibility on 20 thresholds, ranging from 0 to 95% with a 5% step (the ACCpro20 predictor within the SCRATCH-1D software). Table 1 summarizes statistics of SARS-CoV-2 mutations so far. ""AA Length"" indicates the length of the protein AA sequence derived from the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. ""Available"" denotes the number of records among 6324 NCBI GenBank records that have the complete sequence of the corresponding protein. ""No mutation"" refers to the number of sequences that do not have any mutations compared to the reference sequence. ""No mutation rate"" is the ratio between ""No mutation"" and ""Available"". ""Delete"" means the number of deletion mutations occurring in the AA sequences of the protein. This number may be larger than the number of sequences having deletion mutations because an AA sequence may have more than one deletion. Likewise, ""Insert"", ""Nonsyn"" and ""Syn"" show the number of insertion, nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations occurring in the protein AA sequences. ""Nonsyn/Syn"" demonstrates a ratio between the number of nonsynonymous mutations versus the number of synonymous mutations. ""Structure change"" means the number of nonsynonymous mutations that have protein secondary structure change potential based on the SSpro8 predictor of the SCRATCH-1D software. Similarly, ""Accessibility change"" refers to the number of nonsynonymous mutations that have potential to change the protein relative solvent accessibility based on the ACCpro predictor of the SCRATCH-1D software. Insertion and deletion mutations alter protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility by default so that they are not included in the structure and solvent accessibility change statistics. Table 1 shows that the ORF3a and ORF8 proteins have the number of nonsynonymous mutations significantly larger than that of the synonymous mutations. In contrast, this ratio in proteins E, M, ORF7b and ORF10 are very small (less than 1). These proteins could be targeted for vaccine and drug development as they have less variations than other proteins. These findings are supported by results presented in Figs. 2, 3, 4 where we plot the number of insertion, deletion and nonsynonymous mutations against different locations in the proteins. A spike in these figures demonstrates a large number of insertion, deletion and nonsynonymous mutations. Regions between spikes are stable and can be useful for further research for vaccine and drug development. For example, in protein ORF1ab (Fig. 2 (Fig. 3) , entire regions before and after the spike at position 614 are almost unchanged. Figure 4 presents variations of multiple proteins. In addition to proteins E, M, ORF7b and ORF10, we find from Fig. 4 that proteins ORF6 and ORF7a are also relatively stable without a large number of variations at any particular locations. This is justified by data in the column ""No mutation rate"" in Table 1 , which shows the ratio between ""No mutation"" and ""Available"", i.e. the ratio between the number of sequences 99. This is because the size of these proteins is relatively small (see data in the column ""AA Length"" in Table 1 ). These proteins are considered as most stable when compared to other proteins, which have the ratios of less than 0.8. These results are consistent with the data shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4. Protein N has 1927 nonsynonymous mutations but 1678 of them are likely to make changes in protein secondary structure, making a ratio of 87.08%. This is considerably larger than those of protein S (4.42%), protein M (24.79%) and protein E (64.29%). The number of solvent accessibility changes of protein S is larger than its structure changes: 184 vs 164. This however is opposite in other structural proteins: E (7 vs 18), M (8 vs 30) and N (37 vs 1,678).Gene ORF1ab. The ORF1ab polyprotein has 7096 AAs. Among 6324 records deposited to the NCBI Gen-Bank database, only 3726 genomes have the complete coding sequence (CDS) of protein ORF1ab, with 1024 unique AA sequences. This is quite a large number compared to other proteins but understandable because ORF1ab is the longest protein of SARS-CoV-2 and thus has a large number of variations. Only 119 sequences have no mutation or synonymous mutations while the rest 3607 sequences have insertion, deletion or nonsyn- Table 2 . Figure 5 shows an alignment of sequences having a large number of deletions in the ORF1ab protein. Alternatively, 8330 nonsynonymous mutations are found, in which 1067 mutations are distinct. Table 3 Table 4 . Notably, the mutation Q57H occurs in 2795 sequences collected in many countries. This is an emerging and active mutation, which requires further investigation as the latest case of this mutation was on 2020-06-05, same as the latest collection date of the entire downloaded dataset. The mutation G251V occurring in 206 sequences is also a prevalent mutation in the ORF3a protein. Fig. 6 . The isolate MT547814 thus may have transmitted the virus to MT609561 but this implication needs to be corroborated by patients' travel history. There are 23 distinct nonsynonymous mutations and those occurring in 2 or more sequences are presented in Table 5 . Table 9 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 6 . Insertion and deletion mutations in protein ORF6. The GenBank accession numbers, collected dates and isolate names are presented on the left. One synonymous mutation D61K and two insertions − 62R and − 63T at the end of isolate USA/MA_MGH_00184/2020 (MT520188) is interesting while there is a high chance that HKG/VM20001061/2020 has spread to USA/VA-DCLS-0294/2020. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ USA: CA on 2020-03-27 and 2020-04-28, respectively) similarly have four deletions L141-, G142-, V143-and Y144-. The virus transmission may have happened between these two isolates but this needs further investigation. Alignment of these sequences is shown in Fig. 9 . The number of nonsynonymous mutations in gene S is 3711, with 240 distinct mutations. Mutations that occur in 10 or more cases are reported in Table 10 . The number of synonymous mutations is 670, making a in Thailand on 2020-01-04. It is however important to note that the first patient having the D614G mutation and his/her location may never be known because genome of that patient might not be sequenced and reported. Therefore, information reported here can support for further investigation.On the other hand, there are 37 A829T mutations that all occur in Thailand. The first case of this mutation was collected on 2020-01-23 and its latest case was on 2020-04-07. This may indicate that the first case had probably transmitted to other cases having the same mutation A829T in Thailand. Alternatively, mutations H146Y (24 cases), V483A (11 cases), E554D (14 cases), P681L (16 cases) and S939F (11 cases) all occur only in USA www.nature.com/scientificreports/ or mutation L8V (4 cases) occurs only in Hong Kong (refer to the spreadsheet data, which can be found in the Data Availability section). We identify the RBD region within the residue range Arg319-Phe541 of protein S based on a study in 38 . In the RBD region only, the number of nonsynonymous mutations is 53 and that of synonymous is 46, making a ratio of 1.15. This is much smaller than the ratio of 5.54 for the entire gene S, suggesting that the RBD region may have been optimized for binding to a receptor of a host cell. This is complemented by Fig. 9 showing all deletion mutations in gene S being outside the RBD region. Note that the difference of these ratios is partly due to the large number of D614G mutations (3089), which is outside the RBD region. Table 11 summarizes nonsynonymous mutations in the RBD region occurring in 2 or more sequences. Notable mutation in this region is V483A occurring in 11 isolates all collected in USA. The first and latest collected dates of these isolates were respectively 2020-03-05 and 2020-04-05, suggesting that the first isolate may have spread to others having the same mutation V483A. Likewise, the mutation G476S occurs in 6 isolates all collected in USA: WA from 2020-03-10 to 2020-03-25. Alternatively, the mutation Y453F occurs in 5 sequences all in Netherlands but the first collected date was on 2020-04-25 and the latest collected date was on 2020-04-29. These dates are too close, indicating that all the reported Y453F cases may have been infected from another case, whose genome had not been sequenced and reported to the NCBI GenBank. It is important to note that all the transmission implications need further investigation with more data from other aspects such as travel history, physical contacts and so on.In For the entire protein S, 134 nonsynonymous mutations (48 unique) have both structure and solvent accessibility change potentials. These mutations occurring in 2 or more sequences are reported in Table 12 . Mutation H146Y occurs in 24 cases and mutation P681L occurs in 16 cases, which are all collected in USA. The most common mutation D614G does not have the potential to change either protein secondary structure or relative solvent accessibility. Gene E. The envelope protein E has 75 AAs, found in 5852 GenBank records with 15 unique AA sequences.Among them, 5824 sequences have no mutation or only synonymous mutations while 28 sequences have nonsynonymous mutations. Gene E is thus relatively stable and could be targeted for vaccine and drug development. This is supported by the fact that no insertion or deletion mutations are found within gene E. There are 14 distinct nonsynonymous mutations in gene E and those occur in 2 or more sequences are presented in Table 13 .Five distinct nonsynonymous mutations in gene E have protein structure change potential: S68C, S68F, P71L, D72Y and L73F. Alternatively, 4 distinct mutations have potential to change relative solvent accessibility: L37H, L37R, D72Y and L73F. Therefore, D72Y and L73F are two mutations in gene E that have a potential to change both protein structure and solvent accessibility.Gene M. The M protein has 222 AAs and its complete CDS appears in 5677 GenBank records, with 37 unique AA sequences. There are 5557 sequences having no mutation or only synonymous mutations while other 120 sequences have nonsynonymous mutations. No insertion or deletion mutations are found in gene M. The number of distinct nonsynonymous mutations in gene M is 37, with those occurring in 5 or more sequences shown in Table 14 . Among these, 10 mutations are likely to make changes in protein secondary structure: C64F, A69S, A69V, V70F, N113B, R158L, V170I, D190N, D209Y and S214I. Alternatively, 6 mutations have the solvent accessibility change potential: N113B, P123L, P132S, H155Y, D190N and T208I. N113B and D190N are thus two mutations having potential to change both protein structure and solvent accessibility in gene M. Table 11 . Gene S-RBG region only-nonsynonymous mutations that occur in 2 or more sequences. Table 15 . Notable mutations Table 12 . Gene S-nonsynonymous mutations that have both structure and solvent accessibility change potentials occuring in 2 or more sequences. The ""Query Structure"" (and ""Query Accessibility"") shows the unique structure (and accessibility) changes based on on prediction results. Structure letter in parentheses is the predicted structure of the residue at the corresponding mutation position. Five letters before and after parentheses are structures of neighbouring residues. Likewise, letter ""b"" or ""e"" in parentheses shows the accessibility status of the residue at the mutation position. The proposed analysis approach has been able to detect all point mutations so far of SARS-CoV-2 and report them in a spreadsheet dataset, which can be found in the Data Availability section. The generated data can facilitate investigations about the virus in many perspectives. For example, using the mutations found, we can observe the possible virus transmissions between patients. This is showcased through Figs. 5, 6 and 8 where similar mutations are detected from different isolates. In Fig. 5 for instance, a group of isolates have similar deletion mutations at positions M85-, V86-or K141-, S142-, F143-in protein ORF1ab. Genome sequence of isolate USA-CA6/2020 collected in USA on 2020-01-27 is found to be the first having these consecutive mutations. There could be a connection between this isolate with other isolates obtained in USA, Greece and Australia. Information presented in Tables 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 is extracted from the generated mutation data. In these summary tables, ""First Date"" and ""First Country"" information is useful for identifying when and where the mutations were possibly originated while the ""Distribution"" information shows how such mutations have spread to different countries. The generated mutation data also allow us to observe the evolution of the virus. We can point out which mutations are still active or no longer active based on the ""Latest Date"" information presented in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 . For example, in gene S (Table 10) , the latest date of D614G was on 2020-06-05 (same as the latest collection date of the entire genome dataset used in this study), indicating that this mutation is still active. The latest date of P681L was on 2020-04-03, showing that this mutation may no longer occur. Mutations are still active mean they have evolutionarily adapted to varying environments while inactive mutations may have not. This kind of information is useful for further research on vaccine and drug development as ongoing changes of the viral proteins need to be focused and addressed rather than inactive mutations. Our analysis shows that the G form at location 614 in protein S becomes increasingly popular compared to the D form. Among 4434 sequences of the S protein, 3089 sequences have the mutation D614G, taking 69.67%. This number has considerably increased compared to 31.5% in the previous analysis in 22 on a dataset downloaded on 2020-03-22.Through the mutation analysis, we are able to detect regions of the viral genomes that are stable and can be targeted for vaccine and drug development, such as those coding for proteins E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. In addition, this study presents results obtained by the use of deep learning recurrent neural networks for protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility predictions. These results are useful for further research on SARS-CoV-2 protein structure changes. In particular, among 3089 D614G mutations, our prediction results show that none of these mutations is likely to make changes in the protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. This mutation has attracted much attention of researchers as it may affect the virulence and infectivity of the virus and our finding has contributed to understanding this mutation.Analysing the virus genome sequences and their proteins is crucial for understanding the virus and proposing appropriate approaches to respond to and control the pandemic. This paper has reported all point mutations of SARS-CoV-2 since the virus's first genomes were obtained in December 2019. A SARS-CoV-2 mutation spreadsheet dataset is built using a large number of genome sequences (6324) obtained across 45 countries. This dataset Table 15 . Gene N-nonsynonymous mutations occurring in 10 or more sequences. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ can enable scientists to monitor the evolution and spread of the virus although the use of these data needs to be corroborated with patients' clinical data and travel history for substantiated confirmations. We also predict the secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility of the virus proteins to evaluate whether the detected mutations have a potential to change the virus characteristics. The mutation D614G in protein S is unlikely to change either protein secondary structure or relative solvent accessibility based on the prediction results. These protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility change potentials are predicted results based on deep learning recurrent neural networks, which need to be experimentally verified. They however provide important insights about the virus and prompt further experimental biochemistry and molecular biology research into the genomic regions of these mutations. A future work focusing on impacts of the mutations on protein functions would be worth investigating. The function impacts can be determined via wet lab experiments or using low-cost computational tool such as PROVEAN 39 .The dataset generated and analysed during the current study is available in the bioRxiv repository, https ://www. biorx iv.org/conte nt/10.1101/2020.07.10.17176 9v2.suppl ement ary-mater ial.Received: 15 July 2020; Accepted: 25 January 2021",Australia,first author,2021-02-10,02
6fcb86f4de0668119f4283cffe971637c730cbec,"The effect of respiratory activity, ventilatory therapy and facemasks on total aerosol emissions","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and consequent coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity amongst patients, healthcare workers and the general population. 1, 2 Many international COVID-19 guidelines state that SARS-CoV-2 transmission is primarily through larger respiratory fluid 'droplets' (>5 µm diameter), while aerosols (<5 µm) are only a significant risk during 'aerosol generating procedures' (AGPs). 3, 4 Therefore, standard protection against COVID-19 is based on preventing droplet transmission, which includes surgical facemasks, whereas, fit-tested N95-rated respirators and enhanced environmental ventilation are recommended during AGPs. 3, 4 Aerosols are of concern as they can contain replication-competent virus, travel on airflows, better evade surgical masks and deposit on the alveolar epithelium, potentially increasing disease severity. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Concerningly, a higher prevalence of infection has been observed in healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients using droplet compared with aerosol measures. [10] [11] [12] The special status accorded to AGPs is based on weak epidemiological evidence from the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic where increased disease transmission occurred in healthcare workers exposed to patients requiring acute respiratory therapies. 13 Aerosols were not measured in these studies. 13 The respiratory therapies high flow nasal canula therapy (HFNO) and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are universally designated AGPs. 14 However, these therapies may supress aerosol emissions by altering pulmonary mechanics or filtering exhaled gases. 15 Earlier studies quantifying aerosols during therapies suggest both increased and decreased emissions. [16] [17] [18] A recent study and pre-publication suggest coughing may generate up to 3-10 times more aerosols than HFNO and NIPPV. 19, 20 However, the methods used in these studies may have underestimated total emissions and exposure risk. 19, 20 Misclassification of HFNO and NIPPV as AGPs may have two serious adverse consequences.We recruited healthy, non-smoking, healthcare workers, using a screening questionnaire and physiological measurements. The protocol was approved by the South Eastern Sydney Ethics Committee (ETH01467/2020) and written consent obtained.were stable (change <2 counts/second). Each sample required a one-minute prior purge, followed by one-minute of activity and sampling, and ended with a sustained purge.Exercise was an exception, where pedalling began one minute before sampling. The entire protocol lasted approximately four hours per subject. Six subjects performed the protocol in the order described and four in the reverse order.Ten subjects performed six respiratory activities with and without surgical facemasks and then repeated selected activities while receiving three respiratory therapies designated as AGPs detailed in the study design (Supplementary Table S1 ). The six respiratory activities were chosen because they represent common aerosol generating activities or were proxies for respiratory symptoms associated with acute infections, such as increased work of breathing and atelectasis. The combinations of activities and therapies were based on practical feasibility and clinical relevance. The activities were:• Quiet breathing through either the nose or mouth.• Talking; repeating the alphabet while talking loudly.• Shouting; repeating a short sentence as loud as could be sustained for this time.• Six forced expiratory volume (FEV) manoeuvres -a full inspiration, and then full exhalation to residual volume. Prompted at 7-8-second intervals, finishing at 45 seconds.• Six volitional coughs -moderate intensity, with timings as for FEVs.• Exercise with a pedal exerciser (PhysioRoom, Padiham, United Kingdom) set to midload (to achieve ~70% of maximal estimated heart rate).The six activities were repeated wearing a surgical mask with ties -(Med-Con, item 170515, Shepparton, Australia).The three respiratory therapies were as follows:Sample size was based on pilot data obtained during the protocol development and prior studies. 24 As particle counts were positively skewed and included some zero values, the counts were log transformed with a zero offset, as follows: log-count=log10 (count+0.3). To compare differences in particle counts between activities and respiratory therapies, a mixed effects linear regression model was used to take account of repeated measures across particle bin sizes and within participants (in Proc Mixed, SAS version 9.4). In all models the dependent variable was log-count. The main fixed effect was activity or therapy (or both).Subjects' perception of air passing backwards during certain activities, prompted an observational study of the behaviour of visible expired plumes using e-cigarette aerosols and a replica transparent cone and two subjects. An unexpected difference in aerosol emissions between NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D prompted a detailed comparison of ventilator performance in two subjects. Both experiments are detailed in the supplementary methods.When compared to quiet breathing, each of the respiratory activities was associated with a large increase in emissions ( Figure 2 , Table 1, Table S6 ). This increase ranged from 34.6-fold during talking up to 370.8-fold during six coughs (all p<0.001). The fold increases, also presented as average total number of particles per activity and as estimated total volumes (Table S6) .Abbreviations: HFNO, high flow nasal canula therapy with flow in L/min; NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (single and dual circuits, respectively) with inspiratory/expiratory airway pressures shown in cm H2O.The three respiratory therapies showed slight increases in total particle counts at higher flows and pressures (Table 1, Particle counts reduced when HFNO was used during respiratory activities, significantly during coughing, where emissions were halved (p=0.03). During exercise, the three respiratory therapies reduced particle counts by 30-60%, though only significantly during NIPPV-S (p=0.02) ( Table 1) .The overwhelming majority (>92%) of particles produced across all activities and procedures were respirable aerosols (≤5 µm) ( Table S6 ). The proportion of the total volume of particles that was aerosols, ranged between 5.9% and 34.9% for all respiratory activities alone, with coughing producing the greatest proportion, and between 7.1 and 22.4% during HFNO and NIPPV with quiet breathing.The intraclass correlation of subjects for all activities with and without devices was 0.065 and 0.068, respectively, indicating substantial variation between subjects in the total number of exhaled particles and the effect of activities and respiratory therapies. Although breathing was consistently a minor contributor to the total volume of particles, the ranking of other activities varied between subjects. The removal of the highest contributor had negligible effect on the relative magnitude of changes in particle emissions between activities and therapies ( Figure S2 , Table S8 ).This study is the first to explore (close to) complete exhaled respiratory emissions and the most detailed in comparing emissions (counts, size distributions and estimated volumes) across a broad range of respiratory activities with three non-invasive respiratory therapies.We demonstrate that the total emissions per minute during common respiratory activities are often one to two orders of magnitude greater than during HFNO and NIPPV which are currently classified as AGPs. Importantly, when these therapies were used during respiratory activities, emissions were reduced compared to the activities alone.Our data suggest the historic epidemiological association between the use of respiratory therapies and SARS-CoV-1 transmission should be reconsidered. The therapies were indicated for acute respiratory failure, and will have been associated with healthcare workers spending prolonged periods in close proximity to physiologically deteriorating patients with fast, deep breathing, cough and terminal airway closure. 13 Our data suggest these activities may have resulted in large numbers of physiologically generated aerosols.",Australia,first author,2021-02-09,02
8924a1f80144599cfbca8221d8051c86bd2d3ffb,,"On the 19th of January, 2020, the Chief Medical Officer of Australia issued a statement about a novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, internationally reported to the World Health Organisation [1] . At that stage, very little was known about its transmission, severity and risk factors. The first set of restrictions aiming to slow transmission of this virus were announced in Australia on the 15th of March [2] . These restrictions were rapidly tightened until there were variable state and territory lockdowns or public movement restrictions in place by the end of March. It is from this date that recommendations for triaging and changes in requirements for who could seek podiatry care commenced across the country (Fig. 1 ). Also at this date, there were 3966 cumulative cases and 16 deaths in Australia from complications relating to the virus, against a backdrop of 62,308 confirmed cases and 3390 deaths globally [3] .Since this time, much has been learned about SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. COVID-19 is an infectious pneumonia with classical viral symptoms such as fever, muscle soreness with fatigue, shortness of breath and cough [4] . Less common symptoms include altered taste and smell, and vascularrelated skin lesions [5] . SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through aerosolised droplets and is recognised as highly infectious [6] . There is variable mortality from the infection, but those who are immunocompromised or have a chronic disease are most susceptible to death, with mortality rates for older adults as high as 7.8% [7] .Although the Australian government established the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission to coordinate the national response to the pandemic, infection prevention and control responses varied in each state and territory, some of which resulted in lowering the spread of the virus in the community. This first wave of control early March involved recommendations to health workers to minimise face to face service delivery, increase social distancing requirements in their clinical settings, and increase the amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) worn with all patients [8] . However, there were a number of government recommendations and infection prevention and control breaches since March 2020, resulting in a second wave in Victoria and continued state of emergency [9] . One of the internationally strictest lockdowns and movement restrictions ensued in metropolitan Victoria in order to minimise transmission across the city and state. As of the beginning of October, Australia has seen 27,121 confirmed cases and 893 deaths, compared to a global cumulative case number of > 34.5 million, and over 1 million deaths [3] .In Australia, an estimated 60% of the podiatry profession are located in two states (Victoria and New South Wales) [10] which also had the greatest number of community SARS-CoV-2 transmissions to date [11] . Many international recommendations for podiatry triage and risk identification were made during the first three months of the pandemic, however none of these were contextualised to the Australian health system or private practice settings [12, 13] . Instead, government recommendations were made on the provision of essential podiatry services only. During this time also, research about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 primarily focused on epidemiology, aiming to understand the virus, develop vaccines, reduce transmission and decrease mortality. There has been little investigation of the impact of the pandemic on the allied health workforce, and what has been published has been primarily editorial in nature [14, 15] . Workforce research has particularly focused on roles traditionally considered ""frontline"" such as medical professionals, nurses and paramedics, with research focused on psychological impact and little on change in employment or service delivery [16] [17] [18] .Our primary aim of this study was to describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Australian podiatry settings. Our secondary aims included (i) describing the podiatry workforce decisions of closure and employment, (ii) identifying where podiatrists sought their information to make practice closure and environmental change decisions, and (iii) to synthesise podiatrists' clinical lived experience during the pandemic.This was a cross sectional study of Australian podiatrists using demographic data collected between 2017 and 2020. Each of the four data waves were open for approximately 6 months each year and pandemic-related question responses were added to the fourth wave and collected between 30th March and 31st August, 2020, at the height of Australian practice-based restrictions. Approval was given by the Human Research Ethics Committees of Monash University (19959). The CHERRIES (Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys) guided the reporting of collected data [19] .Australian podiatrists and podiatric surgeons were invited to participate in all four waves of the research project titled: Podiatrists in Australia: Investigating Graduate Employment (PAIGE). At the time of the fourth wave survey closure, there were an estimated 5429 podiatrists and 36 podiatric surgeons registered as practicing in Australia [10] . Participants were recruited each year through promotion of the survey at Australian conferences, social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram) and through targeted emails from peak bodies such as the Australian Podiatry Association and Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. Participants were also directly invited via email to complete each wave of the survey if they had completed a survey in a previous year. There were competition-based incentives through the recruitment processes, the most common being a $100 (AUD) voucher for up to 10 participants to be used from the Australian Podiatry Association for educational purposes. The winners were drawn in a way that survey responses could not be linked.The PAIGE study methodology and survey tools were based on the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) study [20] . The primary aim of the PAIGE study was to investigate intrinsic and extrinsic labour decisions. Questions were modelled on the MABEL study with similar wording for demographic data collection, in addition to measurement of constructs impacting on labour decisions such as job satisfaction (all waves), earnings (Wave 1), impact on family (Wave 1), workplace setting (all waves), mental health (Waves 2, 3 and 4) and attributes impacting on life-long learning (Wave 4). The fourth year of PAIGE data collection coincided with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Questions were added to include the impact of the pandemic on PPE and consumables, business decisions on closure and current working situation, information sources for making business decisions and the perceived helpfulness (4-point Likert scale with 0 -No help at all to 4 -Very helpful) of these sources, and a free text box inviting commentary on the impact of the pandemic on individual and practice circumstances. The full Wave 4 survey is provided as Supplementary File 1.Demographic variables extracted from any wave for this present survey included: Each wave of survey data were collected online via Qual-trics® software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA) [21] and subsequent waves linked through a self-generated code.Participants were asked to identify past responses which dictated question logic. If it was the participant's first time completing (in any year), they were asked questions relating to job satisfaction, location, training, and questions about their podiatry practice such as setting, hours of work, hours in spent face to face care. Where a podiatrist indicated they had previously participated, only demographics such as gender, year of both and year of graduation were shown in addition to new questions.Forced or requested responses were used to minimise missing data, but podiatrists could close and exit the survey at any time. Cookies were used to allow responses to be saved up to 4 hours within partial completion. Qualtrics® routinely collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses as part of the de-identified metadata in the survey response. IPs were only viewed and used as a last resort to match data where other linking variables were incomplete.Data were initially cleaned and responses removed if age or gender was unanswered or unable to be matched to previous waves. Partial responses were retained within pandemic response questions if at least one demographic wave question set, and at least one pandemic question was completed. Data were analysed in Stata 15 (Stata-Corp, College Station, TX, USA) [22] . Descriptive statistics were initially used to report on each variable of interest for the entire cohort where there were greater than 5 individual responses for that item. Less than 5 responses in any one demographic item were generally not reported due to the potential identifiable nature of the variable. Descriptive statistics were then grouped by states and territories due to the variable jurisdictional responses to SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and community transmission. The Australian Federal Government announced a number of financial support packages for individuals and businesses on the 30th of March, 2020. Survey questions relating to pandemic impact were collected from the same day, therefore no date stratification of responses was undertaken.Inductive thematic analysis of the single open text question was undertaken by hand. This method of analysis allowed for statements and comments to be individually considered and these statements used for theme generation [23] . Originally, the statements were grouped against concepts and then during concept review, meaningful themes were developed. There were a variety in the length of statements by participants. Even if the statement was one sentence, it was grouped where possible. This grouping took an iterative approach, whereby if a new concept or theme developed, earlier statements were recoded.The data were initially analysed by a single researcher (CW). To reduce individual bias, the themes and individual statements were independently reviewed by the second author (AC) and disagreements were resolved by discussion. Reflexivity was acknowledged as a concept that introduces personal bias into research [24] . Authors analysing qualitative data acknowledged their different individual experiences working within public and private podiatry settings during the pandemic, and how these different experiences may have influenced the analysis.There were 732 responses to the survey, with 465 (9% of 5465 registered practicing podiatrists and podiatric surgeons [10] ) responses containing data enabling descriptive analysis of workforce impact from SARS-CoV-2. The results from here on relate to the 465 podiatrists' responses. As podiatrists were able to exit the survey at any time; any partial pandemic related responses were retained and reported. Table 1 displays a breakdown of the 465 podiatrists' demographics, work setting and practice profile according to total responses, and responses from each state and territory. This is one of the first studies to explore the levels of podiatrists engaging with telehealth in general care, up to (n = 96) 25% of responding podiatrists reported utilising telehealth during this time.From these responses, 223 (49% of 453 responses) podiatrists reported no supply issues or having adequate supplies for the foreseeable future with PPE or consumables to support effective infection prevention and control ( Table 2) . During the data collection timeframe, up to 19% (85 of 453 responses) reported no or limited stock of some PPE components. Of these, the predominant lack of stock was masks, with some also describing lack of disposable gowns or wipes used for disinfecting surfaces.""Business as usual"" (n = 312, 67%) was the most frequent response to the various categories of business or employment conditions during the pandemic (Table 3) . Podiatrists also frequently responded to the category ""Business as usual, but with developed plans for cessation of service"", and these responses varied across the states. Western Australia had the highest jurisdiction response of those completing the survey (n = 6, 25%), however there were overall low responses from the 492 podiatrists within Western Australia [10] . Therefore, this response is unlikely to be truly representative of the total Western Australian podiatry profession. Participants from Victoria (n = 43, 19%) and Queensland (n = 12, 21%) reported having their hours reduced or ceased during this time with or without pay.Some participants described most frequently using the local state and territory Department of Health websites (n = 347, 75%), and the Australian Podiatry Association (n = 334, 72%) to make decisions about their health and Table 1 Demographics of participants presented with their mean (SD), frequency (%), median (IQR) and range business (Table 4 ). These sources were also rated as being the most helpful.Open ended responses to question: ""Any other comments on the impact of COVID-19 on your practice"".Participants provided rich responses to the openended question about the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on them and their practice. The overarching theme which resounded through their comments was that the pandemic was likened to a marathon and not a sprint. This analogy resulted in five superordinate themes were generated during the analysis. These were: (i) commitment to the end game and big picture, (ii) it's all in the plan, but not everything goes to plan, (iii) I need support from my team, but I am also the support crew for others, (iv) road blocks happen, and (v) nothing is easy, what's next?Theme 1: Commitment to the end game and big picture Participants described a commitment to public health messaging and having a role as public health advocates. These roles were described as personally positive, but had a negative impact on their practice. These challenges related from perceptions that the government and those making recommendations, not seeing the podiatry profession as important as other professions. It also challenged participants with how to safely provide services in their clinic or aged-care facilities. These comments were particularly focused around concern for the health and safety of people seeking podiatry service. This was highlight by the quote:""has reduced patient numbers / income but under the social contract I am in a privileged position to be an essential worker but with this privilege comes responsibility to do what is best for society in this time of crisis which means being more selective in who I see and why I see them"" (p60).Participants also described additional actions taken to support any employed staff, and people seeking care in their clinic during the various pandemic stages:""Have done up an A4 flyer on ""How to wear a mask"" as I spent a lot of time helping people understand Theme 2: It's all in the plan, but not everything goes to planParticipants described the challenge of setting themselves up with a plan, just like a marathon. They described preparation, educating themselves and then what happens when they hit a roadblock or required a detour to their plan. This planning theme with resultant actions was highlighted in a number of subthemes including (i) I have all the knowledge and skills to keep me and my patients safe, and (ii) I'm off on a detour, but have the skills to get back on path. While describing (i) I have all the knowledge and skills to keep me and my patient safe, participants described how prepared they felt in some areas as infection prevention and control. They highlighted the additional cleaning load in between people attending their clinic, and the challenge of wearing PPE for longer than usual:"" I am wearing full PPE gear when I conduct my treatments and am spreading out my appointments so I can do a thorough sanitisation"" (p373).Despite this being described as core business, participants also described the additional physical and mental health burdens of having to continually use information to guide decisions, wearing PPE and cleaning:""Physical work load has decreased with COVID-19 but arriving home totally exhausted"" (p372).""… staggered appointments, temperature and oxymeter checks, masks and gloves for reception, opening and closing door for patients, hand sanitiser, posters, following guidelines closely, reassuring patients"" (p96).Participants also described career impact resulting from workplace responses under the subordinate theme: (ii) I'm off on a detour, but have the skills to get back on path. Within this subtheme, there were alternate tasks performed by some participants as part of their employment. These included redeployment into contact tracing teams, COVID-19 testing, ordering PPE for their health service, and being on notice for redeployment into hospital teams without traditional podiatry roles, or utilising skills and knowledge in private practice to support patient care:""The infection control guidelines already in place prior to Covid have been entrenched in our clinical behaviour so as a Podiatrist, I feel we were able to adapt to the few extra duties like educating patients to hand sanitise prior to sitting and taking temperatures"" (p354).Theme 3: I need support from my team, but I am also the support crew for others Participants described the challenges and supportive roles their teams and other people played during this journey. Subthemes arose relating to rapidly evolving environmental challenges such as (i) information overload, and how this overload was managed, and a second subtheme relating to support teams and their concern for both the future health of people seeking care with (ii) will people still need me to support them as their health professional?Participants initially described banding together with colleagues and staff to navigate the rapidly evolving health landscape and recommendations. Reflections including positive communication, how things could have been done better, or when things did not go to plan:""We are having a daily zoom meeting with our CEO, board members and several hundred employees at a time, every day. We have been updated on a daily basis, and feel very comfortable with our current working arrangements to continue practising, would we consider an essential health service …"" (p13).""The not knowing what to do and how to plan ahead when things change every day. The rapidly changing work environment has been a big challenge and we have made it through and I feel most staff are happy now, but it has been VERY HARD!"" (p452).Participants also described their concern for the health and wellbeing people who regularly seek their support for foot health. These responses included increased cancellations, rescheduling of regular appointments and then subsequent complications developing or people being confused as to when they can seek podiatry care due to rapidly changing recommendations from authorities:""At initial shutdown business was affected with a decrease in clients wanting to attend. As time has gone on clients are wanting to continue their treatment"" (p41).""Patient dissatisfaction at new 6 week DHS [Department of Health Services] restrictions to work. Very stressful to determine urgency of a small portion of my patients. Some patients view their condition as urgent while I may disagree. This brings increased stress in already difficult times. I want to do right by my patients and duty of care and also adhere to DHS guidelines"" (p419).Similar to the marathon, the theme of roadblocks arising at different points in the journey also arose within participant responses. Participants described their experiences depending on their state and territory restrictions in relation to their timing of survey completion. Their responses were grouped into a number of roadblock subthemes including: (i) well, that was a speed bump, through to (ii) hitting the wall.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had vastly different impacts across Australia and this difference was highlighted, particularly in these two subthemes. Participants described some initial challenges during the pandemic relating to a short but dramatic business downturn which turned around with lower local community acquired infections. This experience was highlighted through economic challenges reported by both business owners and employee participants:""I remain busy, but have had an increase in DNA [did not attend] and last minute cancellations which has put strain on the cashflow. But not 30%, so am considering options to remain financially viable"" (p104).And:""Devastating. Haven't taken income since March to try to keep staff employed. Loans on hold, Job Keeper. Limited patients. OR [Operating Room] work very limited"" (p23).Other participants described (ii) hitting the wall, and not being sure how to move on from the challenge. This included accumulative impacts from recent bushfire disasters in large parts of Australia [25] . Participants who were also employers described the pressure to look after themselves, their families, their staff and their patients, and it having a negative impact on their own mental health. Location challenges and jurisdictional border restrictions also resulted in unexpectedly having to cease service delivery:""It was stressful at the peak and I had to close and take time out until mentally and physically equipped to provide optimum care"" (p16).""We have been affected by the NSW/Victorian border closure with some of my colleagues living outside the bubble and unable to attend work as usual"" (p86).Theme 5: Nothing is easy, what's next?Participants described seeing an end in sight, or feeling like they are on the other side of challenges. They described learning about practice behaviours and enhancements as they made plans to move forward. Some also described increase in business or additional opportunities as restrictions were locally eased, which made it easier to re-establish or continue with their practice. Others described using it as a way to increase selfmanagement strategies during telehealth:""As a subcontractor in a private clinic my patient load has decreased by approx 50%, however as a sole trader mobile podiatrist travelling to people's homes who may be self-isolating my business has increased by approx 20%"" (p150).""Conversion to telehealth where appropriate. I have found COVID-19 and restrictions has required patients to improve their self-management skills and take more ownership of their foot health"" (p166).There is very little known about the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on allied health care and private practice business decisions. This present study reports the first known data collected about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the podiatry profession. Other research has primarily focused on opportunities and challenges of hospital based service delivery [14] , and have provided recommendations for triage through variable staging of restrictions to delivery of health care in public or hospital settings [26] and reflections of the different public health restrictions and guidance for podiatry services primarily within the United Kingdom [27] .One important finding within this study was the variable disruption to service as a result of recommendations, and the resilience podiatrists demonstrated during this historical event. Despite the differing jurisdictional recommendations of service continuance, service delivery appeared minimally impacted. Participants often reported these impacts as a direct response to the business decisions at the time of answering the survey and that these varied with time. It was not pre-planned to stratify responses into months or according to government restricted service timeframes, however with larger responses, this may have been an approach to understand how government directives impacted triage decisions and workforce employment. Given there were between 10 and 14 weeks in Victoria where podiatrists were advised to provide limb saving podiatry services only [28] , it should be expected that responses reflected some loss of hours and work over that time, as many podiatrists in private practice may not commonly provide treatment to patients requiring that level of urgent care. Alternatively, podiatrists may have adapted their clinics to telehealth or alternative service provisions, or even decided based on their patient's foot health and well-being that they could justify their patients meeting the criteria set by the government during any restricted service timeframes.Due to the novel nature of this study, comparisons to other allied health professions are not possible. It is also unclear to what extent these findings could be generalised outside of the Australian healthcare context or for international podiatry practice. Australian primary care practice nurses reported experiencing greater loss of hours during the peaks of restricted practice, and similar to podiatrists, rarely experienced limited access to the required PPE in the workplace [16] . These important findings highlight exposure to vulnerability that many small businesses faced, where models of care are not fully reliant on billable government Medicare funds, or funding primarily accessed by medical practitioners. It also highlighted the success Australia had relating to access of PPE, with minimal impact of most PPE stocks, at least to the appropriate level within community based private practice settings. PPE stocks appears to be an ongoing challenge facing international colleagues, with recent reports of as high as 39.7% of health care workers reporting reuse or inadequate supply of appropriate PPE in the United Kingdom and United States [29] . We had limited numbers of podiatrists who responded working from public hospitals, and it is unknown how many provided care to COVID-19 positive patients, so we are unable to make any comparisons on the availability of the higher levels of PPE required in these settings. This is also one of the first studies to explore the use of telehealth for general conditions presenting to podiatry. Targeted telehealth service provision has been internationally recommended for wound care for podiatrists, particularly through the pandemic [12] , and has previously been trialled in Australia in rural and regional settings [30] . With limited knowledge about podiatrists' common caseloads of musculoskeletal, paediatric or general care, it is difficult to determine the suitability of telehealth for these services. However, it may be reasonable to assume that telehealth was limited for high risk services in the private sector, due to low/no cost provision of service in public podiatry clinics around Australia. It is also unknown how many public hospital and community podiatry clinics maintained face-to-face care for high risk services. It may be reasonably assumed that high risk face-to-face services were maintained in most hospitals around Australia. Other professions in variable health settings described a rapid shift to the use of telemedicine with unknown effectiveness relating to condition-specific outcomes [31, 32] . Through the timeline of directives (Fig. 1) , many of the major health insurance companies provided an item number for their customers to use to access telehealth by podiatrists in private settings, but there is limited knowledge of its uptake. Of note is that one of the largest health insurers removed this access after major restrictions were eased, citing low uptake by customers in accessing their podiatrist via telehealth [33] .A positive finding of this study was podiatrists reporting the use of reliable information sources such as jurisdictional governments and peak body information aiding business decision making. This may reflect the value placed on evidence informed sources by the responding podiatrists. Health professionals have been strongly urged to consider the spread of ""fake news"" throughout this time on social media and to take pro-active action against it [34] . While governments have a vested interest in the most accurate and detailed news being released, this places additional responsibility on peak bodies, such as the Australian Podiatry Association, to ensure accurate representation of these messages, due to frequency with which the professional seeks information from.The quantitative data provides a picture of limited impact on SARS-CoV-2 on the podiatry profession, however the qualitative statements of impact described by respondents described the mental health impacts and resilience podiatrists have shown through rapid change. The challenges of increased likelihood of exposure or infection, fluctuating service delivery decisions, schooling at home, financial or job loss and increased responsibility have all been areas identified as placing increased stress on health workers in the past 10 months [35] . Podiatrists described positivity and assuredness in their skill mix for use of PPE, together with their flexibility in triage or lateral shifts in service delivery outside of the general podiatry skill set. Others appeared to instinctively employ techniques to reduce the impact on their staff, such as debriefing, regular updates and meetings. However, many also discussed that this came at a personal toll, similar to that seen in other countries and health care settings [36] . Development or exacerbation of mental health conditions, burnout or even development of post-traumatic stress disorders are prevalent in health care workers post pandemic responses. These have been documented subsequent to pandemic responses by both frontline and non-frontline health care workers during outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), regardless of the closeness of patient interactions or exposure to confirmed cases [37, 38] . This should urge all podiatrists, regardless of which country worked in, to be proactive in identifying and seeking support if they have ongoing health or mental health concerns during and subsequent to this time.A number of research opportunities arise from these findings, but this research also has a number of limitations. Recent and setting-relevant workforce data is essential for health officials and government to make accurate recommendations and funding decisions. International workforce research groups could model similar survey design to understand internationally comparable data during the pandemic to understand and predict the impact of the pandemic on access to podiatrists to maintain foot health. Researchers should also consider collecting more detailed information on telehealth service provision (and for which health conditions, treatment modalities and their effectiveness), and more detailed information on case mix in each setting. While this data may be retrospective in nature, limiting burden to respond during a crisis, but provide valuable information in the future to aid and promote innovative service delivery. It is reasonable to consider the low survey response rate as being related to the challenging times when this survey was released. This means that while the data provides an accurate reflection of those who participated, it may not be reflective of the experiences of the entire podiatry profession. Lastly, there is little research on burnout, and mental health challenges in the podiatry profession, with only one study to date [39] . Future research should consider data collected prior to, and during this time for subsequent studies into the long-term impact of the pandemic on mental health in allied health.Podiatrists in Australia reported variable impact of the pandemic on their business decisions, limited impact on their PPE stores, and their valued sources of information. Podiatrists also described their ""marathon"" journey through the pandemic with quotes describing their challenges and highlights. Describing these experiences should provide key learnings for future workforce challenges, should further restrictions come into place. While the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still prevalent throughout the world, this study highlights the resilience of the profession and its adaptability during unprecedented times.",Australia,abstract,2021-02-03,02
6670613417b00176f51307541340530d6a6c9946,Distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 Effects of self-isolation and quarantine on loot box spending and excessive gaming-results of a natural experiment,"COVID-19 has prompted widespread non-pharmaceutical public health interventions including self-isolation and citywide lockdowns (Lewnard & Lo, 2020) . Although these measures have many advantages, including a substantial flattening of the disease curve, they may have unintended maladaptive consequences. For instance, self-isolation and quarantine has substantially reduced access to safe and legal social activities. Social support is an essential aspect of mental health, and social isolation can increase psychological distress (Teo, Choi & Valenstein, 2013) . Multiplayer video games offer one avenue for online social engagement. In fact, to encourage stay-at-home social activities, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recently partnered with 58 major video game companies to launch the #PlayApartTogether campaign, encouraging people to stay at home and play video games during the pandemic (Takahasi, 2020) ; despite having codified gaming disorder into their international classification of disease codes in 2018 (World Health Organization, 2018) .Scholarly debate persists about the potential for video games to foster maladaptive or excessive use (Aarseth et al., 2017; Van Rooij et al., 2018) . In particular, there is significant disagreement about whether excessive gaming produces, or is a coping mechanism for, psychopathological symptoms such as depression and anxiety (Van Rooij et al., 2018) . Irrespective of whether excessive gaming is a symptom or cause of psychopathology, there is clear theoretical rationale for examining the extent to which social isolation associated with pandemic control measures contributes to excessive gameplay. Moreover, people who are more concerned about being contaminated by the virus might also increase gameplay to cope with the anxiety or social isolation due to the pandemic. Here, we examined whether (a) socially isolated individuals exhibited higher rates of excessive gameplay than less isolated peers, and (b) whether contamination concerns (worry about, and avoidance behaviours of, disease and germs; Burns et al., 1996) were significantly associated with excessive gameplay.A distinct but related issue is that the inclusion of certain monetisation mechanics within video games might contribute to excessive gameplay or spending (on gamerelated purchases). Some video games contain randomised purchasable rewards (loot boxes) that some scholars have observed may psychologically approximate conventional gambling activities (Drummond & Sauer, 2018; Griffiths, 2018) . Some scholars have also observed that these mechanisms might meet the legal criteria in many jurisdictions, and could potentially be considered a form of bona fide gambling (Drummond et al., 2020a; McCaffrey, 2019) . This may explain why studies have repeatedly found a small significant association between problem gambling symptomology and spending 1 We intended to also assess the effect of being in citywide lockdowns, but the low number of participants reporting not being in lockdown (n = 69) rendered this analysis underpowered, likely invalidating the results. Interested readers can find these results in Supplemental Information. on loot boxes (Brooks & Clark, 2019; Drummond, Sauer & Hall, 2019; Drummond et al., 2020a; Drummond et al., 2020b; Li, Mills & Nower, 2019; Macey & Hamari, 2019; Zendle & Cairns, 2018; Zendle & Cairns, 2019; Zendle et al., 2020) , a result confirmed by metaanalysis (Garea et al., 2020) . The decrease in alternative social activities, and the increased need for online social activities may have the potential to exacerbate this relationship. Spending on loot boxes therefore appears to be more common among video game players with problem gambling symptoms (Garea et al., 2020) . The apparent increase in the number of people engaging with video games during the pandemic may result in increased exposure to, and hence opportunities for the purchasing of, loot boxes. This has prompted concerns about increased spending on loot boxes for certain user groups (Department for Digital, Cultural, Media & Sport, 2020; Harris, 2020) . One study suggests that reducing exposure to loot boxes by removing them from a game appears to reduce spending only among those with higher problem gambling symptoms (Zendle, 2019) . Thus it appears that problem gamblers who play games might be more likely to increase their spending on gambling-like features such as loot-boxes during the pandemic. This led us to predict that the social isolation of the pandemic might result in an increase in either overall spending on loot boxes, or, a specific increase in spending on loot boxes for problem gamblers. Thus, here we examined whether the established association between problem gambling symptomology was stronger for isolated gamers, compared to their non-isolated peers. As we thought that people who were more concerned about contamination would be more anxious and or more socially isolated during the pandemic than people who had lower contamination concern, we expected that people with higher contamination concern may have higher spending on loot boxes. Thus, we also examined whether contamination concerns were significantly associated with spending on loot boxes.In this pre-registered study (https://osf.io/f4cvj) we examined participants' excessive gaming scores, loot box spending, psychological distress, and whether they were selfisolating (limiting contact with others) or under quarantine (in mandatory self-isolation). We predicted that 1 : 1. Participants who report being in self-isolation or quarantine will have higher psychological distress (as measured by the K-10), higher spending on loot boxes, higher risky loot box use scores (as measured by the Risky Loot box Index; RLI), higher excessive gaming (as measured by the IGD scale), and higher contamination concern than participants not in self-isolation or quarantine. 2. There will be a significant positive correlation between contamination concern (as measured by the contamination subscale of the Revised Padua Inventory 10) and psychological distress as measured by the K-10. 3. There will be a significant positive correlation between contamination concern and spending on loot boxes, risky loot box use, and excessive gaming scores (as measured by the IGD scale). This effect will be stronger for participants currently in self-isolation or quarantine than for those not in self-isolation or quarantine.4. There will be a significant positive correlation between the amount of money participants report spending on purchasing loot boxes in the past month and their problem gambling symptoms as measured by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). 5. The relationship will be stronger for participants in self-isolation or quarantine than for those not in self-isolation or quarantine. 6. Participants who are categorized as problem gamblers by the PGSI will report spending more money in the past month on loot boxes than participants who are categorized as moderate-risk gamblers, who in turn will spend more on loot boxes than low-risk gamblers, who in turn will spend more on loot boxes than non-gamblers. 7. Being in self-isolation or quarantine will moderate the relationship between PGSI category and spending on loot boxes, such that problem gambler classification will show a larger difference in spending for participants currently in self-isolation or quarantine than participants not currently in self-isolation or quarantine. 8. There will be a significant positive correlation between the amount of money participants report spending on purchasing loot boxes in the past month and psychological distress as measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10).Using Prolific Academic, we employed a natural experimental design to compare those people who were isolated due to the pandemic to those people who had not been isolated by the pandemic. There was no theoretical reason to believe that the pandemic had selectively isolated gamers or problem gamblers at a higher rate than other people, so this created a natural-groups experiment to assess the effects of isolation due to the pandemic on the playing and spending habits of isolated (vs non-isolated) gamers. We therefore surveyed 1,200 participants from Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand and the US on their video game play and gambling. Excluding those who did not play video games (n = 54), and participants who failed attention checks (n = 2), our final sample was 1,144 participants (619 male, 499 female, 26 other). Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the sample by country.The majority of participants were from the US (n = 930), with 173 participants coming from Australia, and 41 coming from Aotearoa New Zealand. Age ranged from 19 to 80 years old (M = 31 .4 years, SD = 10.5 years). Participants gave informed consent to participate in the study by proceeding to the questionnaire after reading the information sheet which advised them to cease participation if they did not consent to participate in the study. Ethics approval was obtained for human data collection for this study from Massey University's Human Ethics Southern B Committee, Approval number SOB 19/11.Our study followed the same design as an earlier study protocol with the inclusion of some additional measures (Drummond et al., 2020b) . We employed a variety of standardised psychiatric measurement tools to assess participants' wellbeing, problem gambling symptomology, excessive gaming, risky loot box use and concern about contamination. These measures are detailed below.The Kessler (K-10) Psychological Distress Scale assessed psychological distress of participants (Slade, Grove & Burgess, 2011) and was employed as previously described in Drummond et al. (2020b) . The K-10 includes 10 items assessing how often (0, none of the time-5, all of the time) over the past 30 days participants experienced various non-specific aspects of psychological distress (e.g., ''During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel hopeless?'').Data on loot box spending was collected as previously described in Drummond et al. (2020b) . We asked participants to report approximately how much money (in their country's currency) they had spent on loot boxes in the past month. We converted all values into US dollars using the listed currency conversion rates of the day using Google's currency conversion. We converted all currencies into US dollars on April 21, 2020 using the following exchange rates: $USD = 0.63*AUD; $USD = 0.60*$NZD. In accordance with our pre-registration we excluded 9 participants (0.8% of total data) who spent more than 3.29 SDs (equivalent to a Z -score differing from the mean at p < .001; Tabachnick, Fidell & Ullman, 2007) greater than the mean ($6.08 USD, SD = $42.50 USD) as outliers from analyses of loot box spending. This resulted in the exclusion of any participant who spent more than $133.58 USD on loot boxes in the past month. Including these participants did not qualitatively alter the results.The Risky Loot Box Index (RLI), is a five item scale designed to examine risky engagement with loot box mechanics (Brooks & Clark, 2019) . This scale was employed in the same manner as described in Drummond et al. (2020b) . The scale asks participants to rate their agreement on a standard 7 point likert scale with items assessing their cognitions associated with opening loot boxes (e.g., ''Once I open a loot box, I often feel compelled to open another'').Data were collected as previously described in Drummond et al. (2020b) . We adapted the Internet Gaming Disorder Checklist to assess excessive gaming symptoms (Przybylski et al., 2017) . This checklist was based on the proposed diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). Participants indicate how true (1, not at all true-4, very true) statements were about how gaming had interfered with aspects of their lives (e.g., ''I have lost interest in other hobbies or entertainment in order to play games'') or emotions (e.g., ''I feel irritable, anxious or sad when I am unable to game'').We measured participants' contamination concern with the Revised Padua-Inventory 10 item contamination subscale (Burns et al., 1996) . The Padua-Inventory 10 is a psychiatric scale assessing obsessive compulsive symptomology. The contamination subscale assesses the degree of disturbance a range of common activities which might result in contamination causes participants (0, not at all -4, very much). Example items include ''I find it difficult to touch an object when I know it has been touched by strangers or by certain people'' and ''I feel my hands are dirty when I touch money.''Data on problem gambling symptoms was collected as previously described in Drummond et al. (2020b) . The Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) assessed Problem Gambling Symptoms. This scale asks participants to indicate how frequently (0, never-3, almost always) during the past 12 months, they experienced problems caused by their gambling behaviors (e.g., ''borrowed money or sold anything to get money to gamble''). The scale contains 9 items, with higher scores indicating greater symptoms of problem gambling. The PGSI has good validity in a non-clinical population (Holtgraves, 2009) . The scale can also be used to categorize participants into discrete groups of varying risk for gambling problems. In accordance with Currie, Hodgins & Casey (2013) revised criteria for the PGSI which display better concurrent validity to the original scoring criteria, participants who score 0 on the scale are considered non-problem gamblers; low-risk gamblers score 1-4 on the PGSI; moderate-risk gamblers = 5-7 on the PGSI and problem gamblers score 8 or higher on the PGSI. (Brooks & Clark, 2019) , and reported money spent on loot boxes in the past month. Participants reported contamination concern on the Revised Padua Inventory-10 (Burns et al., 1996) , and their isolation status: self-isolation (n = 250), quarantine (n = 197), or neither (n = 697). This created a natural-groups experiment to examine whether self-isolation or quarantine affected outcomes. We advertised our study on Prolific Academic as a study investigating video games and gambling. Data were collected between the 7th and the 9th of April 2020 (inclusive). At this time, Aotearoa New Zealand had been in stringent lock-downs (Level 4 under their COVID-19 Alert system) since the 25th of March 2020 (Ardern, 2020) . Australia and the US had not enacted a federal lockdown response (though individual States had enacted different lockdown restrictions; Morrison, 2020a; Schuchat, 2020) . For context, Australia implemented a national boarder closure (with exemptions for returning citizens, permanent residents, and immediate family members) on 20th March 2020 (Morrison, 2020b) , and non-US citizens travelling from China, Iran, The European Schengen Area, The United Kingdom and Ireland were banned from entering the US by Presidential Proclamations taking effect between 2nd February 2020 and 16th March 2020 (Liu, 2020; NAFSA, 2020) . We pre-registered comparisons between those who reported that they were self-isolating (eliminating contact with other people) or quarantined (under mandated self-isolation) and those who were not. We acknowledge that this grouping may overlook important differences in contexts between different forms of isolation (e.g., for participants anxiously awaiting test results), however two important points bear mentioning. First, the study was conducted early in the pandemic outbreaks in these countries, and terminology, especially among the general public, was relatively new, with exact restriction limitations still under development (Cameron, 2020) and some ambiguity in the Federal response in Australia and the US (Morrison, 2020a; Schuchat, 2020) . We expecteded this would add noise to participants' self-reported isolation status, resulting in our decision to group all isolated participants together. Second, the self-isolation questions allowed participants to report whether they were in self-isolation or quarantine to their best understanding of these terms. This may result in some measurement error in reporting. However, we expected that variations in the accessibility of participants' usual social activities would be the primary driver of increased digital media exposure. Thus, we believe our approach offers a valid way to investigate the effects of increased perceived isolation. A more fine-grained study investigating whether effects are similar across different kinds of isolation using objective measures of such isolation would no-doubt be worthwhile. Nonetheless, our results provide early evidence that participants' perceived isolation status was associated with changes in some gaming-gambling relationships.We also pre-registered comparisons between those who were under lockdown orders (specified to participants as ''including mandated social distancing, business closures, curfews, stay home orders or other movement restrictions'') in cities where movement and gathering restrictions were in place) and those who were not. However, very few participants were not in lockdown (n = 69, ∼6% of our total data). Thus, estimates for non-lockdown participants are underpowered and, therefore, unreliable. Rather than report these unreliable estimates in the manuscript, we have included the results for these pre-registered comparisons between participants in lockdown and participants not in lockdown in the online supplementary materials with appropriate caveats. At the time of data collection, Aoteroa New Zealand had implemented a Nationwide lockdown which had been in effect for approximately 14 days. Federal lockdown responses had not been introduced in Australia, or the US, creating divergent state-based responses (Morrison, 2020a; Schuchat, 2020) . We acknowledge that an examination of different stringencies of lockdown (e.g., Stage 2 versus Stage 4 lockdowns) would constitute a worthwhile follow-up study. Table 2 Associations between contamination concern and problematic gaming scales for all respondents (first column), participants not selfisolated or quarantined (second column), and self-isolated or quarantined (third column). Z -tests (column four) reported for the difference between not-isolated/quarantined vs self-isolated/quarantined. Correlations reported in Spearmans Rho.Not self-isolated or quarantined Participants played video games, on average, most days (M = 2.31, SD = 0.83). This was likely due to the fact that the study was advertised as a study on video game use and gambling, and therefore attracted participants who played video games. On average, participants reported spending $29.63 USD (SD = $56.27 USD; Range = $0 -$500 USD) on video games and $2.98 USD (SD = $11.48 USD; Range =$0 -$107.10 USD) on loot boxes in the previous month. Although these averages appear small, it is worth noting that this was due to a large number of participants not purchasing video games (n = 578) or loot boxes (n = 989) in the past month, together with the wide ranges for these variables. Contrary to predictions, psychological distress was actually higher among people not in self-isolation or quarantine (M = 24.88, SD = 8.65) than those in self-isolation or quarantine (M = 23.53, SD = 8.68), t (1,142) = 2.57, p = .010, d = 0.16, though this was a negligible difference (Ferguson, 2009; Sauer & Drummond, 2020) . We found no evidence that IGDC scores differed between participants in self-isolation/quarantine (M = 7.94, SD = 5.59) and participants not in self-isolation/quarantine (M = 8.28, SD = 5.55), t (1,142) = 0.97, p = .330, d = 0.16. We also found no evidence of differences in spending on loot boxes between participants in self-isolation/quarantine (M = $3.15 USD, SD = $11.38 USD) and those not (M = $2.86 USD, SD = $11.56 USD), t (1,133) = 0.42, p = .678, d = 0.02. There was no evidence of a difference in risky loot box use scores between participants who were isolating (M = 13.53, SD = 8.16) and those not (M = 13.52, SD = 8.00), t (1,142) = 0.02, p = .984, d = 0.01. Similarly, contamination concern scores were not statistically different between those in self-isolation/quarantine (M = 12.80, SD = 9.55) to those not (M = 13.77, SD = 9.72), t (1,142) = 1.66, p = .098, d = 0.10.Collapsed across isolation status, contamination concern was moderately associated with distress, r = .319, p < .001, and weakly associated with loot box spending, IGDC, and RLI (see Table 2 ). Though weak, relationships between contamination concern and IGDC and RLI both exceeded criteria for the smallest effects likely to bear clinical relevance (Ferguson, 2009) , suggesting contamination concern may be a clinically significant contributor to Figure 1 Association between Problem Gambling Symptomology (PGSI score) and Loot Box Spending in USD. Data are presented separately for gamers who were not self-isolated/quarantined (A) and who were self-isolated/quarantined (B). Each data point represents a single participant's responses. The trend lines indicate the positive correlations between spending on Loot Boxes and PGSI scores, with a stronger association for participants who were self-isolated or quarantined than those who were not.Full-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.10705/ fig-1 excessive engagement with both gaming and monetized in-game reward mechanisms. We compared correlation strengths using Fischer's Z -tests (Weaver & Wuensch, 2013) . Relationships were generally similar for people in self-isolation or quarantine though the association between RLI and contamination concern was significantly stronger for participants who were self-isolated or quarantined than those who were not (Table 2) . Problem gambling symptomology was associated with higher loot box spending, r s = .279, p < .001; with a stronger association for participants who were self-isolated or quarantined, r s = .366, p < .001, than those who were not, r s = .209, p < .001, Z = 2.825, p = .005. Figure 1 shows the association between loot box spending and PGSI scores, split by isolation status. When classified into risk groups, a 2-way ANOVA showed a main effect of problem gambler status, such that problem gamblers spent more than lower risk gamblers on loot boxes (Fig. 2) . However, there was no evidence that self-isolation or quarantine altered this relationship. Finally, loot box spending was weakly associated with psychological distress, r s = .103, p < .001.We investigated whether self-isolation or quarantine, or contamination concerns were associated with greater excessive gaming, loot box spending or psychological distress. Contrary to predictions, compared to those not self-isolated or quarantined, participants in self-isolation or quarantine showed negligiblly lower psychological distress, but no differences in loot box spending, loot box engagement, or excessive gaming. We found no evidence that self-isolation resulted in greater excessive gameplay or expenditure on loot boxes generally. It is unclear why lower psychological distress scores were observed for those in self-isolation or quarantine. Perhaps those in self-isolation or quarantine may perceive their health risks to be lower due to their isolation, and this offset any distress associated with isolation. Nonetheless, the effect size was negligible in magnitude, and unlikely to be of clinical importance (Ferguson, 2009) .However, higher contamination concern was associated with small-to-moderately higher excessive gaming and risky loot box engagement scores, and small increases in loot box spending. These effects were generally similar for participants who were self-isolating or in quarantine and those who were not, with the exception that the relationship between risky loot box use and contamination concern was stronger for people self-isolating or in quarantine than those not. People may be engaging with video games to manage their contamination concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, individuals may engage in a range of other activities (e.g., conventional gambling, online shopping, increased time streaming movies/ T.V. shows, etc.) as a means of managing contamination concern and social isolation due to the pandemic.The established relationship between problem gambling symptomology and loot box spending (Garea et al., 2020) was stronger for those in self-isolation or quarantine than those not, demonstrating closer agreement between problem gambling symptom scores and loot box spending. Indeed the relationship between problem gambling symptomology and loot box spending was moderate for isolated gamers compared to small for non-isolated gamers.However, when PGSI scores were used to categorise gamblers into discrete risk categories (e.g., low-risk, medium-risk, problem gamblers), average spending within categories was similar for self-isolated or quarantined participants and those not in isolation or quarantine. Since average spending did not increase for problem-gamblers in self-isolated or quarantined (vs. non self-isolated or non-quarantined), it appears that although the correlation between raw PGSI scores and loot box spending become more closely aligned for isolated gamers, how much they individually spend when devolved into risk categories does not substantially increase. Orford et al. (2007) suggest that gambling disorder is more appropriately viewed as a continuum rather than as discrete risk-groups, and the lack of differences between risk categories juxtaposed against a significant increase in the strength of the association between raw PGSI scores and spending may reflect a loss of variability in PGSI scores when this continuous measure is devolved into a categorical variable. Whether these effects persist when self-isolation and quarantine periods end is unknown. These increases may plausibly represent temporary coping mechanisms which will abate when the threat of COVID-19 ends. Alternatively, given the prolonged pandemic activity worldwide, they may persist as the acquisition of new gambling-like behaviours. Reexamination as the pandemic subsides may be required to determine whether any effects are temporary or long lasting. If there are prolonged mental health effects of the pandemic, then this may plausibly result in similar long-term changes in the ways people interact with video games.More generally, our results suggest that isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic may act as a moderator for other relationships in pathological gaming research, inflating the size of some previously observed relationships (Garea et al., 2020) . We therefore urge researchers to exercise caution in ensuring that the potential consequences of the pandemic and associated isolation are considered when interpreting the size of effects from data gathered during the pandemic in these areas of research. Further, we suggest that a moderating effect of COVID-19 may not be limited to these fields, and suggest that researchers in general carefully consider the potential impact of the pandemic on their data.One limitation of the present study is that it is unknown whether participants were responding to the Padua Contamination Concern index as a state or trait based measure. It is thus unclear whether the associations between the contamination concern scale, loot box purchasing, excessive gaming and risky loot box use measures imply that changes in concerns about contamination are causing changes in these outcomes, or if, more generally, people high in trait contamination concern tend to have higher scores on these measures. Our interpretation (and we admit that it is speculative) is that both may be true. Participants who are concerned about contamination may be particularly likely to engage in distracting behaviours (including spending behaviours) during a global pandemic. Future work should examine this possibility and its alternatives more deeply.This natural groups experiment examined eight hypotheses relating to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on excessive gaming, psychological distress, problem gambling and loot box spending. Our data suggest that contamination concern is associated with higher excessive gaming and risky loot box engagement, and to a lesser extent, loot box spending. Problem gambling symptomology is associated with greater loot box spending, and this effect is appreciably stronger among people who are currently self-isolating or in quarantine. Future work should examine whether the differences in the strength of the relationship between loot box spending and problem gambling symptomology for gamers who were isolated during the pandemic remains after the pandemic subsides.",New Zealand,first author,2021-02-03,02
3de3902c126b348253e01ae4a837a752f8151ab3,"Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination, and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission","Currently, there is uncertainty on how best to identify all cases once weekly cumulative incidence is very low and to detect and manage any reintroduction of community transmission on an ongoing and sustainable basis. The World Health Organization (WHO), although recommending surveillance of influenza-like illness and severe respiratory illness, identifies these areas as a knowledge gap in the monitoring of COVID-19 community transmission [2] . This lack of evidence hampers effective disease management and contributes to a reluctance to implement strong containment measures, due to fears that they would be required for extended periods [11, 12] . These fears can be addressed by a clear strategy for effectively identifying and managing early re-emergence of community transmission once controls are lifted through surveillance and management of cases and contacts, without the need for reinstitution of widespread containment measures.Exhaustive detection and elimination of community transmission chains, as recommended by WHO representatives [13] , is standard practice in management of high-risk pathogen outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease [7, 14] , and this practice provides useful guidance for the control of COVID-19 [1] . Although some factors make COVID-19 more difficult to control than Ebola virus disease (e.g. pre-symptomatic transmission, a higher proportion of asymptomatic disease, and shorter serial interval), it is likely more amenable to control than influenza due to the longer serial interval.This study evaluates surveillance options and proposes an efficient, feasible and scalable strategy that will:Exhaustively identify transmission chains; Provide strong evidence that community transmission has been eliminated; Identify and manage any reintroductions of disease when control measures are lifted; Address constraints such as limited testing capacity; and Identify broader response priorities that are critical to enhanced surveillance.A range of options are assessed, and efficient strategies recommended, with the structure and requirements for the system summarised. Given constraints on testing, we considered a range of testing requirements to allow the proposed strategy to be tailored to capacity and to consider the potential benefits of pooling [15] [16] [17] .We considered the following three candidate groups for surveillance:Group 1: Patients with pneumonia presenting to hospitals Group 2: Patients presenting with acute respiratory symptoms (fever and cough and/or other acute respiratory illness symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat) for testing in the community (e.g. at primary care or specific respiratory/COVID clinics and testing facilities) Group 3: Asymptomatic community members, including those who may be at higher risk of unprotected exposure (e.g. supermarket and delivery workers, transport workers [18] , essential service staff).Fever and cough was the syndromic case definition recommended by WHO early in the outbreak [2] , and although often reported in patients with COVID-19. It is clear that a substantial proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases do not report these symptoms [20] . We therefore also considered a broader syndromic surveillance case definition such as that utilised in Australia since April 2020, which included any acute respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny nose, cold symptoms or flu-like symptoms [21] .The following were estimated for the above three groups:The estimated number of cases in the community within the same transmission chain as the detected case, at the time the case is detected through the surveillance system. The sensitivity and efficiency of testing these groups for a range of testing capacities and varying weekly cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 respiratory symptoms in the population under surveillance. Efficiency was assessed by considering the number of tests required per case detected, and the number of cases missed, under different scenarios. The feasibility of surveillance and system requirements for increasing testing and follow-up.Gains from enhanced community surveillance were estimated for two scenarios:Default transmission scenario, with limited or no containment measures and an assumed reproductive number of 2.2 when cases occur [22] .Low transmission scenario, with some containment measures in place and therefore a reproductive number of 1.2 Estimated cases in the community were calculated using a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, assuming a 4-day incubation period before symptom onset, with transmission occurring during the final 2 days of this period. That is, a latent period of 2 days followed by 2 days of asymptomatic transmission in all infected individuals. We assumed three levels of severity: severe cases (20% of all cases) [23] who are hospitalised, asymptomatic cases (20% of all cases) [24] , and the remaining 60% of cases experiencing mild or moderate disease and not requiring hospitalisation. In sensitivity analyses, we considered proportions of asymptomatic infection of either 20 or 50% [25] . As hospital surveillance will reflect cases with severe disease, we assumed a 7-day delay from symptom onset until presentation at hospital in severe cases [26] , while a proportion of mild and moderate cases present for community testing 2 days after developing symptoms. We assume that cases are infectious for 4 days (including the 2 days of pre-symptomatic transmission described above) to replicate serial intervals of around 4-6 days [26] . Additional compartments in the model for individuals presenting to primary care and to hospital allowed us to identify the time until an event occurred, and the model was run until either the disease had died out or there had been a presentation at both primary care and the hospital. Repeated runs of the model allowed us to calculate averages over many stochastic simulations. Full model code is provided as a supplementary document (S1).Sensitivity and efficiency of testing strategies was evaluated using the following assumptions:Random sampling of presentations in each group. Weekly cumulative incidence of the syndromic surveillance case definition ranging from 2 to 6% of the population under surveillance: this range was chosen based on several data sources, namely, in the absence of control measures 3% (peak), 2% (winter) and 1% (outside winter) fever and cough weekly cumulative incidence in line with Australian syndromic surveillance data (FluTracking) [27] , and weekly acute respiratory symptoms (cold or flu-like symptoms as defined previously) incidence of 6% in winter (June) [28] . With social distancing measures, incidence of fever and cough has been shown to decrease by 40% [29] , a finding also seen in Australian data [30] .Testing rates of 30% [28] , 50% and 100% in all patients with symptoms.Weekly cumulative incidence of COVID-19 ranging between 0.01 and 0.5%, based on reporting levels across high-and low-transmission settings with high test coverage [31] .We also assessed overall test performance (negative and positive predictive values and false negative and false positive rates) under a range of weekly cumulative incidence values, sensitivity and specificity. Benefits of pooling of samples were considered by estimating the number of tests required at a given weekly cumulative incidence. We assessed pooling by comparing a scenario with high test sensitivity and no pooling, to a scenario of pooling under reduced test sensitivities.Under the default transmission scenario (reproductive number of 2.2), 20% asymptomatic disease and with 30% of all symptomatic cases presenting for testing, there are a median of 14 infected people in the community (8 already infectious) when a severe case with pneumonia is detected at the hospital compared to a median of 7 infected people in the community (4 already infectious) when there is a detection through community /primary care surveillance (Fig. 1 ). Under the low-transmission scenario (reproductive number of 1.2), there are a median of 4 infected people in the community when a severe case is detected at the hospital compared to a median of 3 infected people in the community when there is a detection is in the community. If 50% of cases are asymptomatic, there are 10 infected people to be traced under default transmission and 4 infected people under low transmission under primary care surveillance. If 50% of cases are asymptomatic and 50% of symptomatic cases present for testing, there are a median of 7 infected people in the community when there is a detection through primary care at high transmission, and a median of 3 infected people in the community at low transmission.Testing of those with respiratory symptoms in the community Table 1 assesses, for varied weekly cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the community, the estimated number of community cases missed by surveillance-related testing, given varied levels of non-COVID-19 acute respiratory symptoms in the community, and varied testing capacity/uptake. Given a 4% cumulative incidence of acute respiratory symptoms in the population, exhaustive testing of all symptomatic patients would be possible with 60,000 samples per million population per week (Table 1) given COVID-19 rates of up to 0.5%. Table 2 gives results for testing of 10,000 individuals, under a range of scenarios of varied prevalence of COVID-19 in those being tested and test sensitivity. If we assume a 4% weekly cumulative incidence of symptoms, then for a population of 1 million (i.e. 40,000 individuals with symptoms per week), this would mean multiplying the results in Table 2 by a factor of ((1million × 0.04)/10,000), i.e. by 4, to obtain the number of tests required per million population per week to test all those in the population who are symptomatic. If pooling were used and prevalence of COVID-19 in those symptomatic individuals who were then tested was between 0.05 and 3%, population testing could be achieved with 10,000-15,000 tests per million population by pooling in batches of 4 and with 3000-15,000 tests per million population by pooling of samples in batches of 16 ( Table  2 ). As Table 2 demonstrates, pooled testing is more efficient at detecting disease under all scenarios examined, including when pooling results in a drop in sensitivity to 70%, due to the larger number of individuals that can be tested. Pooling of 1/16 becomes less efficient than 1/4 pooling when prevalence in the tested population exceeds 1%.The above results are primarily influenced by the weekly cumulative incidence of non-COVID-19 acute respiratory illness symptoms when the weekly incidence of COVID-19 symptoms is less than 0.1%. Even at higher incidence of COVID-19, the overall conclusions remain the same (Tables 1 and 2 ). The main impact of varied community levels of COVID-19 is on absolute numbers of cases missed, and on efficiency gains through pooling of tests. However, when all symptomatic patients present and testing is exhaustive, the number of symptomatic COVID-19 community cases missed by screening remains at 0, whatever the COVID-19 incidence.Testing of asymptomatic groups with high-risk contacts Table 3 assesses the estimated the number of community cases of COVID-19 missed by asymptomatic screening, given varied testing and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) asymptomatic infection levels in the population being assessed. For all scenarios, the majority of cases are missed through random asymptomatic screening, whatever the incidence of COVID-19.Tables 2 and 4 present test performance for COVID-19 prevalence in the tested population of 0.05-3%, and a range of test characteristics (sensitivity 70-99.9%, specificity 70-99.9%). As Table 2 demonstrates, changes in sensitivity do not have a marked effect on false negatives at low prevalence. At a prevalence of disease of 0.05%, a sensitivity of 90% equates to 0.5 patients missed in screening per 10,000 compared with 0 missed when sensitivity is 99.9% (10% more cases are missed). At a prevalence of 1%, this translates to 11 patients missed in screening compared to 2 missed with a sensitivity of 99.9% (9% more patients are missed). However, as Table 2 also demonstrates, even with a higher false negative rate in a test or pooling strategy, such a test/strategy will be more effective if it allows a substantially greater proportion of the population to be tested. In situations of very limited availability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gold standard testing therefore, testing using a lower-performing but much more readily available testing intervention may be warranted.In regard to positive predictive value, Table 4 demonstrates that it is only with very high specificity (≥ 99.9%), and relatively high prevalence (≥ 1%) that most positive tests are true positives. In all other scenarios, most positives are false positives.(See figure on previous page.) Fig. 1 Cases of COVID-19 in the community at detection. Number of infected people in the community when one case is detected in primary care (left) or at hospital (right) for a a reproductive number of 1.2 and b a reproductive number of 2.2, assuming 30% of patients with symptoms present to primary care. For each scenario, the box shows the median, 25% and 75% of the distribution of number of cases, while the interval indicates the 10% and 90% limits For enhanced surveillance to lead to pandemic control, all confirmed cases must be investigated. As Fig. 2 infected by the case): optimal follow-up includes intensive case finding and quarantining of these contacts, with home monitoring (such as twice daily temperature checks, GPS monitoring of compliance) and PCR testing for active disease once the 14-day quarantine and follow-up period concludes to ensure they do not have asymptomatic disease. As above, 11 such contacts per case needing 14 days follow-up would be expected [32] . Indicators of success: monitoring and evaluation of surveillance system performance System coverage, uptake, and completenessThe key indicator of system sensitivity is the proportion of acute respiratory symptoms in the community tested for SARS-CoV-2. This is the primary indicator to be monitored on an ongoing basis, regardless of whether the response aims to supress transmission, achieve elimination, or maintain elimination. As our results indicate, feasible early detection and effective control is reliant on those with symptoms presenting for early testing in the community. The higher this proportion, the less disease there will be in the community at the point of detection, therefore we propose this indicator, with a target of 100% as the key indicator of a sensitive surveillance system with adequate coverage. Weekly population screening targets (i.e. estimates of the denominator for the above indicator) for all populations under surveillance should be based on Table 1 , with the denominator for the target percentage being the estimated levels of acute respiratory symptoms in the community under surveillance. Incidence of symptoms will vary; for example, they are likely increase as social distancing measures are lifted, especially if measures are relaxed during winter. Surveillance through voluntary reporting by community participants, or sentinel surveillance in health services [33] , is commonly used to track influenza levels; however, both these strategies are prone to a range of biases including selfselection of volunteers and differentials in health care access and uptake. Surveillance system performance should therefore be assessed and validated through regular, random, community-based surveys of acute respiratory symptom incidence. Such surveys can also monitor community understanding of testing criteria, attitudes towards uptake of testing and related behaviours, feasibility and burden, and support services for enabling testing, as well as other control measures such as quarantine, isolation, mask use and vaccination. The aim is for high levels of understanding, feasibility and support with manageable burden. Such surveys have been demonstrated as feasible on a weekly basis in, for example, an Australian state which has conducted a community-based, random, representative survey each week since April 2020 covering these factors [34] . This weekly survey of~400 participants provides data on the general population that is precise enough to make inferences around change each week, and inferences related to changes over 2-3 months for specific population subgroups of interest.The following indicators proposed are those that measure the absence of community transmission and/or risk factors for community transmission (i.e. undetected cases in the community, indicated by detected cases with an unknown source of transmission). This is based on the information presented in Fig. 2 , which illustrates COVID-19 transmission chains. All of the below indicators measure the absence of community transmission and/or risk factors for community transmission:The proportion of those with respiratory symptoms who present for testing on the day of symptom onset. The proportion of those with respiratory symptoms who isolate from time of symptom onset to receipt of a negative test result.Newly reported cases that are tested on the day of symptom onset (target = 100%). The proportion of newly detected cases that have been under quarantine from the time of the exposure event (target = 100%). The proportion of age-specific hospitalised new cases and/or deaths relative to new communityacquired cases in the respective age group (target = 0%) [35] . The proportion of cases with complete follow-up of contacts (target = 100%). The proportion of cases with unknown source of transmission (community transmission), with a target of 0%. The proportion of newly reported cases that are importations (i.e. acquired disease outside the surveillance area) and/or known contacts of confirmed cases (target = 100%). This is the mirror of the first indicator (i.e. if all detected cases are in contact of cases or imported cases in travellers, then cases with unknown transmission will be 0%).The number of upstream contacts per case should be at least twice the number of downstream contacts (Fig.  1) , and total number of contacts per case is expected to be > 35, unless there is a clear reason for low numbers of contacts. However, numbers of contacts per case can also be much higher [36] , as super-spreading events demonstrate. Expected numbers of contacts per case should be reviewed regularly based on population mobility and the characteristics of each case's social network, and contact case definitions updated regularily based on comprehensive testing data from contacts of identified cases, including in high-risk settings. Complete followup for upstream contacts should consist of PCR and serological testing (to identify past infection) at time of case detection, while complete follow-up for downstream contacts consists of documented quarantining for 14 days following the last contact with the case, and PCR testing at end of the quarantine period to exclude asymptomatic viral shedding.The indicator of successful elimination of community transmission, given the above system coverage, uptake and completeness indicators have all been met, is that the proportion of new cases that are classified as unknown source of infection (community transmission) is 0% over a 28-day period. This is the definition proposed by a range of experts in Australia and New Zealand, based on a period of 2 incubation periods free of disease following known community transmission, and has also been applied to decisions in Australia around the lifting of internal border controls [37] .This study shows that timely detection and management of community transmission of COVID-19 can be achieved with between 3000 and 15,000 tests per million population with pooling depending on the incidence of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19-related respiratory symptoms, and the capacity to trace, on average approximately 33-44 primary contacts per case of community transmission. Testing patients with acute respiratory symptoms is an efficient, effective and feasible strategy for the detection and elimination of transmission chains. The strategy we propose in this paper for COVID-19 surveillance, an earlier version of which was available in preprint form [38] , has been integral to Australia's pandemic response since April 2020 [39, 40] .The most important determinant of the effectiveness of the surveillance system proposed in this paper is uptake of testing in those with respiratory symptoms in the general community. Uptake depends on awareness of and availability and ease of access to testing, community perceptions related to the testing itself and the public health response measures linked to testing such as quarantine and isolation. Ensuring communities understand the need and value of presenting for testing and are supported to access it, is a fundamental requirement for successfully controlling and maintaining elimination of COVID- 19 . This has been demonstrated in countries that have high testing and contact tracing levels and so have been able to manage outbreaks occuring after the lifting of containment measures [41, 42] and in countries that have successfully controlled transmission through containment but have limited testing, which are seeing resurgence of community transmission [43] . This syndromic surveillance strategy provides a simple and clear message to the community: isolate and get tested if you have respiratory symptoms. Provision of paid sick leave supports compliance with testing and home isolation [1, 44] , while strategies for effective community engagement from other pandemics provide guidance to increase the acceptability of this approach [7, 14] . Implementing and evaluating interventions to strengthen community engagement and uptake of COVID-19 response measures, and scaling up those shown to improve participation in the surveillance system, is the most important strategy for achieving effective enhanced surveillance. Countries such as Australia have demonstrated high uptake of burdensome containment measures [4] , and of testing [45] . However, although testing rates are amongst the highest in the world, the majority of those with respiratory symptoms are still not being tested [46] . The most common reasons given for this was they do not think they have COVID-19 and that their symptoms were too mild to get tested. It is reasonable to expect that testing uptake could be further improved with a consistent and coordinated community engagement strategy.Promising strategies for further enhancing testing coverage include self-collection of samples [47] . Influenza studies have found that self-collection reduced sensitivity (87% sensitivity compared to clinician collected samples) [48] . As with pooling, self-collection may still result in greater detection, despite the reduction in sensitivity, if it increases the number of tests carried out. In both cases, messaging to the public must indicate the possibility of false negatives and that those with symptoms should isolate regardless of test results. Another promising strategy under review is testing of saliva samples, which will both allow self-collection and not require equipment such as swabs, another limit on testing capacity [49] .Surveillance through hospital presentations with pneumonia has low sensitivity, particularly as the reproductive number increases, and would be weaker still if measures to protect vulnerable groups [23] such as the elderly, immunocompromised or those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease [50, 51] are successful, thus reducing the proportion of cases with severe disease [23] . The gains from community testing compared with hospital surveillance increase as the reproductive number increases, meaning community-based surveillance strategies will increase in comparative effectiveness as restrictions on social movement and interaction are lifted. Random testing of sentinel asymptomatic groups is inefficient at most levels of likely prevalence. If asymptomatic testing were intended to detect cases, it would need to be repeated to constitute an effective surveillance system, entailing a high level of frequent, repeated and large-scale testing unlikely to be feasible on an ongoing basis in most settings [52] . Potential false negatives when testing asymptomatic people further decreases the value of this approach. An exception may be very clearly defined, small population subgroups where, once transmission in the general community has been controlled, the risk of reintroduction from higher prevalence settings and spread to the general community is high. An example of this is staff in COVID-19 quarantine facilities. Subsequent to the initial control of transmission, all major outbreaks in Australia requiring population-level restrictions on movement and social interaction have been seeded by breaches in quarantine facilities housing or transporting international travellers returning to Australia from higher prevalence countries [53] [54] [55] . In such settings, frequent testing of staff is feasible and has high value in terms of preventing reintroduction, even if yield per test is low.Where prevalence is low and there is limited testing capacity, pooling considerably increases coverage. Even with a decrease in sensitivity of pooled tests, the number of false negatives is small compared to the number that is untested. Pooling can also greatly reduce the need for testing reagents.Evidence suggests that sensitivity of viral PCR is high, at least 95%, although study findings are heterogeneous [56] . Table 2 demonstrates that reduced test sensitivity results in higher false negatives rates when prevalence is higher than 0.01%. Reduced test sensitivity impacts surveillance effectiveness similarly to reduced testing uptake, although the magnitude of effect is likely considerably less than that of reduced uptake (e.g. 70% of those with respiratory symptoms are not being tested currently in Australia) [28] . At low prevalence, small reductions in specificity considerably reduce the positive predictive value, and most positive tests are false positives. Although specificity is considered high (100%) for PCR tests, the impact of reduced specificity is an important consideration when assessing rapid diagnostic tests coming to market.Upstream contact tracing, including widespread testing of asymptomatic contacts of cases, is the main situation where testing of asymptomatic cases is warranted. Currently, some cases identified in Australia are classified as 'unknown' source of exposure [57] . As Fig. 2 demonstrates, this means that their source of exposure may have initiated multiple chains of transmission. Widespread testing of all contacts, upstream and downstream, including low-risk contacts around such cases, is the most effective strategy for filling these gaps in transmission mapping. Although investigation and quarantining of downstream contacts is part of most surveillance strategies, follow-up of upstream contacts is not uniformly undertaken, but is a feature of those settings implementing successful control [1, 42, 58, 59] . Investigation of contacts can be supported through training and integration of community volunteer networks into existing surveillance and contact tracing teams. Software may assist considerably in these efforts [19] and, linked to measures to increase uptake and adherence, is again an important part of follow-up in those settings with effective control [60] .With increased testing capacity, inclusion of symptoms emerging as useful predictors of early and/or mild disease (e.g. anosmia and loss of taste) [61] may increase the sensitivity of the system and allow earlier detection of transmission chains, especially once containment is lifted and the reproductive number increases accordingly. Screening of wastewater for evidence of community transmission is receiving increased attention [62] and could provide a useful addition to primary care screening systems. If sufficiently sensitive, it could also be used in ongoing monitoring of high-risk facilities such as hospitals and aged care facilities to identify early transmission. As it cannot identify infected individuals of chains of individuals, any wastewater testing must be linked to intensive human surveillance to effectively support control of COVID-19 community transmission.The determinant of the number of individuals requiring testing is the weekly cumulative incidence of respiratory symptoms in the general community. If COVID-19 has a seasonal pattern as with similar SARS-CoV viruses [63] , transmission during winter is likely to be amplified. Strong containment and surveillance aimed at elimination of COVID-19 before the peak of winter will optimise the value of this investment.We found that early identification, isolation and testing of symptomatic individuals linked to effective contact tracing of their social networks is critical, and this is supported by previous modelling of these factors [64] . However, although average contact numbers are useful when transmission is high, once low levels are reached, there can be great variation in contact patterns. Recent outbreaks in Australia have seen relatively few cases resulting in thousands of contacts needing to be managed [65] . Novel strategies such as pre-emptive quarantining of the contacts of contacts, as well as the emergence of more transmissible strains [66] , further emphasise the urgent need for empirical data to define operational requirements to implement these measures in practice.Our study only assesses surveillance and control measures for local transmission. A key contributor to transmission in Australia has been the management of Australia's borders, both air and sea. Hotel quarantining of new international arrivals began on March 28th 2020 [67] and, coupled with restrictions on movement and social interaction, contributed to a marked reduction in locally acquired disease. An enhanced surveillance system that has achieved elimination of detectable disease is designed to detect and manage early reintroductions or emergence, including travel-related disease. However, continuation of effective border controls between areas with ongoing community transmission and those without, once other social distancing and control measures are lifted, will reduce the pressure on the surveillance system to identify and manage imported disease. The other major challenge to the surveillance system will come from mass amplification events. Both during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and in past, significant outbreaks of other infectious diseases, such events centre around religious or burial activities [68] , other large gatherings where contact occurs [69] , specific settings where aerosol generating activities and close proximity are involved such as choirs and gyms, and around health facilities and other institutional settings [70] . Limiting the opportunities for transmission in such settings will be crucial to ensuring that single superspreading events that overwhelm contact tracing system do not occur.Given our findings, we recommend exhaustive testing of patients with respiratory symptoms in the community as the most efficient and feasible means of detecting community transmission of COVID-19 under conditions of both restricted and close to normal social interaction. Once community cases are identified, detailed and meticulous upstream and downstream contact tracing, linked to quarantining of all contacts, and both antigen and serological testing of upstream contacts who may be the source of infection, will support elimination of community transmission, and rapid control if and when reintroductions of disease occur. This strategy optimises the likelihood of remaining in the elimination phase while allowing for ongoing lifting of containment measures. Community engagement is critical for successful implementation of this strategy to ensure high levels of testing uptake and compliance with follow-up measures in identified cases and their contacts.The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s12916-021-01934-5.

a30eb687431257ce3617935159fd3c999789ca25,Increased SAR-CoV-2 shedding associated with reduced disease severity despite continually emerging genetic variants,"Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses: To identify likely seeding viruses for Missouri outbreaks, all 110,901 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes available on the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) consortium 18 (September 20, 2020) were downloaded. The 297 genetically closest sequences to Missouri samples were selected using an alignment-free complete composition vector algorithm [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE 25 , phylogenetic analyses using BEAST2 26,27 , positive selection analyses through PAML 28 , and sequence conservation visualization with SimPlot 29 (eMethods).Lineages were identified by PANGOLIN v2.0.8 (github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin). Unique Missouri sub-lineages were identified when they contained at least five samples with unpublished mutations, posterior probability >0.99, and sequence identity >99%.Statistical analyses: Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of viral load (Ct≤20, high; Ct>20, low) on hospitalization or length of hospital stay, controlling for demographics and comorbidities. The effect of viral load on length of hospitalization was tested with a Cox Proportional Hazards survival analysis accounting for censoring due to death. In all analyses, significance was defined at alpha=0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS Studio v3.8 (Cary, Indiana) Figure 1A) . Meanwhile, the weekly case fatality rate peaked at 12% in early May, then progressively decreased and remained below 0.02% through October.To study whether changes in viral shedding correlates with increased positivity rates, we analyzed the Characteristics of Study Population. We conducted chart reviews for 1,335 COVID-19 individuals from March-October 2020 ( Table 1 ). The largest age group was 18-29 years (n=562 of 1335, 42.13%).Molecular characterization identified mutations across multiple regions of the viral genome ( Figure 2B ).The previously reported S-D614G and nonstructural protein [NSP]12-P314L mutations appeared in most of the Missouri samples. Compared to their precursor viruses, the Missouri viruses had 126 new mutations (eTable 3). NSP3 contained the most mutations (28 of 126 distinct mutations), followed by S (13), Nucleocapsid (N) (11) , and NSP2 (11) . The most common mutations include NSP12-C22F (n=18), NSP4-M366I (18) , open reading frame [ORF]8-S47F (12), NSP12-A2V (11) , and N-V270L (10).Six unique mutations ( Figure 2B , eFigure 2) were detected in four sub-lineages that appear to have emerged and spread in the Southwestern region of the state. MO-B.1.1.a (n=11 sequences) had mutation NSP12-A2V; 10 of these viruses were from Springfield, Missouri collected between July 2-9; MO-B.1.1.b (n=18) contained NSP4-M366I and NSP12-C22F from patients living within 60 miles of Springfield between May 14-July 9, 2020; MO-B.1.c (n=6) with NSP3-N1178T and NSP3-A1179T includes six samples with all but one arising from Monett, an urban center in Southwestern Missouri (50 miles southwest from Springfield), between July 2-6, 2020; MO-B.1.2.d (n=6) with NSP15-P262L were from Springfield or Brighton, Missouri (20 miles north of Springfield) between July 5-7, 2020.Of the selected samples, we collected multiple samples at different time points for four patients and found one case of reinfection (eFigure 4). This patient was a female in her 20s with asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression, who reported chills, sore throat, dizziness, rhinorrhea, and fever during her initial positive COVID-19 test in March 2020. She was discharged and instructed to self-isolate. After two weeks, her symptoms had waned to encompass only cough and fatigue, and she was tested again due to her return-to-work requirements with another positive result.Interestingly, the two samples were from two distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages; the first sample belonged to properties. Eighteen isolates selected as representative sample strains from each viral load category and lineage were recovered from swab samples with Ct-values ranging from 9.09-37.76 (median=16.32) ( Figure 3A ). We determined growth kinetics for these isolates ( Figure 3B ) and observed a large diversity in viral growth patterns, especially during the initial 24 hours. Linear regression of viral proliferation (measured by Ct-values) at 24 hours showed that an increase of 1 cycle correlated with a decrease of 8.83 log10 (plaque forming units/mL) (Pearson correlation coefficient=-0.59, p=0.01) ( Figure 3C ).Taken together, the growth kinetics analyses revealed that strains with higher viral loads in clinical samples proliferated more efficiently than those with lower viral loads.The clinical findings and demographics from our study are reflective of national data, lending confidence towards the generalizability of our patient population 1 . Exceptions include the distribution of cases within the 18-29-year age category where we noted 50% higher proportional incidence than CDC data; correspondingly, our >50 age categories were slightly less than national data. This reflects the catchment area of our study which includes the University of Missouri with a high proportion of college-aged students. Additionally, our population had slightly lower Asian, higher Black or African American and White, and over 50% lower Hispanic or Latino individuals than national data, reflecting the overall racial and ethnic distribution in Missouri. We also found that other risk factors for hospitalization included older age, elevated BMI, and diabetes mellitus, consistent with published studies 40,41 .Recent studies show Nab titers to SARS-CoV-2 decline as early as 23 days following initial infection 53 .In this study, a young female patient was identified with two genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 strains within two weeks, indicating that re-infection can occur within a much shorter period than expected.There are several limitations to this study. Analyses with viral loads are limited by variability in nasopharyngeal swabbing techniques, which may cause inconsistencies in Ct-values, although the same sampling and processing protocol was used throughout this study. Additionally, during the initial phases of the pandemic, testing was generally limited to patients with more severe symptoms, potentially skewing viral load findings. Despite these limitations, we analyzed a large, representative sample, and adjusted for these confounders.In summary, multiple novel lineages were identified, and locally acquired mutations, present at both the urban and rural levels, remained predominant in the community. Although we were unable to find associations between specific variants and greater disease severity, Missouri COVID-positive individuals that presented with increased viral shedding had less severe disease by several measures. Continued monitoring of the impacts of these novel variants, particularly of those in the regions of vaccine targets, will be essential to the management of this pandemic.Genome data may be accessed using GenBank Accession Numbers: MW004168, MW521383-MW521516, MW525282.",Australia,abstract,2021-02-05,02

Of these, most (75%, n=99) stated they 106 were 'moderately' or 'extremely familiar' with guidelines and plans and that these were 107 'easy' or 'very easy' to adhere to (60.6%, n=80). Some participants (28.8%, n=67) did not 108 know if they existed , while others (14.6%, n=34) reported neither existed in their workplace.

The availability and access to PPE, as well as its adequate use, have been critical to 180 providing general practice services throughout the pandemic. Recent data suggest that the 181 largest proportion of physician deaths have been GPs (42%) and emergency physicians, 182 potentially due to the number of patients with COVID-19 seen by these specialties, as well as 183 limited PPE. 31 Using PPE appropriately is critical to preventing transmission of COVID-19 in 184 HCWs. 32 PPE shortages in general practice have been documented globally. 8, 33 Studies from 185 the UK found that 16.2% of GPs and 11% of emergency physicians had poor availability and 186 accessibility to PPE. 34, 35 The majority of our respondents expressed concerns about 187 contracting SARS-CoV-2 and not feeling confident in using PPE.

75c8c8fbafc7b510af9d8b343afb9c79f97f87ff,Artificial Intelligence Applications for COVID-19 in Intensive Care and Emergency Settings: A Systematic Review,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged healthcare systems and healthcare practitioners worldwide. Intensive care units (ICU) and emergency departments (ED) in badly afflicted areas have been overwhelmed by the surge in patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] . This exerts significant pressure on healthcare resources, necessitating novel diagnostics and care pathways to rationally deploy scarce emergency and intensive care healthcare resources. Current strategies and recommendations on clinical management and resource rationalisation draw on past pandemic experiences and expert recommendations [3] [4] [5] ; however, there has been growing interest in novel applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to assist in the COVID-19 response within these settings.AI is commonly defined as the use of computational methods to mimic human intelligence. Machine learning and deep learning are branches of AI which focus on automatic improvement of computer programmes through experience 6, 7 . Regression models, such as logistic, linear, or Cox regression, are simple forms of machine learning which already have longstanding use in medical research. More advanced machine learning, including random forest models, neural networks, or support vector machines, are also becoming more common in the medical literature, introducing more complex and diverse applications of AI. In intensive care and emergency settings, AI applications have assisted with automated patient monitoring [8] [9] [10] [11] , prognostication 12 , and optimisation of staffing allocations [13] [14] [15] [16] . Given the unprecedented volume of COVID-19 patients, recent reviews have also identified resource optimisation of ICU beds as a potentially significant application of AI 17, 18 .Earlier systematic reviews have identified significant issues in the quality and reporting of predictive models for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis 19 and AI applications for classifying COVID-19 medical images 20 . Shillian et al.'s 21 systematic review of machine learning studies in pre-COVID-19 ICUs reported similar issues, such as limited sample size and poor validation of predictions. However, no study has evaluated the scope and quality of all available AI applications in intensive care and emergency settings. This gap in knowledge precludes valuable improvements to the development and deployment of AI applications in these settings. We aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current evidence on AI applications for COVID-19 in intensive care and emergency settings, focussing on methods, reporting standards, and clinical utility. emergency settings. For brevity, the search strategy showing only the first three terms in each concept set is as follows: ((""Artificial intelligence"" OR ""Deep learning"" OR ""Machine learning"" OR …) AND (""COVID-19"" OR ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR …) AND (Emergency OR ""ED"" OR ""intensive care"" OR …)). The complete search strategy can be found in Additional file 2. We also screened the reference lists of included articles to identify additional relevant studies. We included articles that met the following criteria: (1) applied AI; (2) investigated COVID-19 operations of ICU, ED, or emergency medical services (EMS) or analysed data from COVID-19 patients in the ED or within a prehospital setting, COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation, or a composite including either of these outcomes), or the healthcare workers treating these patients, including ED or ICU physicians and nurses as well as paramedics; and (3) were original, peer-reviewed research articles. For this review, artificial intelligence only encompassed conventional machine learning algorithms such as random forest models, neural networks, or support vector machines. Multivariable logistic regression predictive models (including ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression) were excluded. No restrictions were placed on the language of articles.We conducted an initial search on 30 August 2020 and updated the search results on 1 October 2020. Articles were screened by title, abstract, and, if ambiguous, full text by two independent reviewers (MLC and NL). Subsequently, the two reviewers (MLC and NL) independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction form. Discrepancies in article selection and data extraction were resolved between reviewers through discussion.We extracted the following data for all included articles: country of study population, outcome predicted, sample size of the training and validation datasets, AI algorithms used, discrimination (e.g. C-index, accuracy) and calibration (e.g. calibration slope, Brier loss score) of models on the strictest form of validation, features included in the final model, and transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) study type 22 , if applicable.For studies including multivariate AI predictive models, we evaluated the risk of bias within the study methodology using prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) 23 . PROBAST is a structured tool comprising 20 signalling questions for assessing the risk of bias and applicability across the four domains of participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis. Applicability of included studies was not assessed as our study was not concerned with a specific application of AI predictive models. In lieu of specific reporting standards for AI studies at the time of study conception 24 , we assessed the reporting quality of multivariable predictive modelling studies using an adaptation of Wang et al.'s 25 modified TRIPOD statement 26 for AI models (Additional file 3). For all other studies, we summarised the study methodology, including data sources, application of AI, and validation methods, as well as the key findings of the study.In terms of country of study, Italy (n=3) and United States (n=3) were represented by more than one study, while Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Turkey, and the United Kingdom had one study each.According to the TRIPOD classification of predictive models, two studies were classified as Type 2b (validation using a non-random split of data by time and/or location), three studies as Type 2a (validation using a random split of data such as a train-test split), four studies as Type 1b (validation using re-sampling techniques such as bootstrapping or k-fold crossvalidation), and one study as Type 1a (no validation, only evaluation of apparent model performance on the same training dataset). One study that conducted development and validation using data from separate studies was considered Type 3. Table 2 presents the risk of bias assessment of AI predictive models according to PROBAST. All 11 predictive modelling studies had a high overall risk of bias. Two out of 11 studies had an unclear risk of bias within the participant domain. Unclear risk of bias in the participant domain was mainly due to ambiguous exclusion criteria that may lead to the study population not being representative of the intended target population 33,34 . All three studies at a high risk of bias in the predictor domain were prognostic. Two studies 32,33 used retrospective, multicentre data and were at risk of bias from varying methods of predictor assessment at different centres. The remaining study 31 obtained predictor data from the most recent assessments available, instead of assessing predictors at the intended time of use. Two studies did not report adequately on the assessment of computed tomography (CT) 36 or other features 34 , resulting in an unclear risk of bias.Two and four out of 11 studies were at high and unclear risk of bias within the outcome domain, respectively. In many prognostic studies 28, 29, 31, 34 , the criteria for ICU admission and blinding of outcome determination to predictor variables were often not reported, leading to an unclear risk of bias.Within the analysis domain, all eleven studies had insufficient outcome events per variable (EPV) (<20 EPV for model development studies and <100 for model validation studies) leading to a high risk of bias. Furthermore, no study reported on model calibration and only two studies 34, 35 appropriately handled and reported on missing data. Prognostic predictive models were particularly at risk of inadequately accounting for, or reporting on, censored patients who were still hospitalised without the outcome (e.g. ICU admission) at the end of the study period. Only one study appropriately accounted for censored data by combining deep learning techniques with traditional Cox regression 33 .Three studies investigated diagnostic AI predictive models; two studies developed models to predict the outcome of COVID-19 status at admission to the ED. Only one study was externally validated: Vasse et al. 37 developed a decision tree based on cellular population data using Random Forest for feature selection (accuracy=60.5%). Brinati et al.'s 35 Random Forest model (C-index=0.84, accuracy=82%) and Three-Way Random Forest model (accuracy=86%) achieved better performance but was validated using weaker k-fold crossvalidation. Both studies included leucocyte or a leucocyte sub-population count as a predictor in their final model.The third study 36 developed a decision tree for determining COVID-19 infection status in the ICU based on plasma inflammatory analyte features selected by a random forest classifier. On five-fold cross-validation, this classifier achieved an accuracy of 98%.Most studies on prognostic AI predictive models (9/10, 90%) predicted ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or a similar composite outcome of severe or critical illness. The artificial neural network trained by Abdulaal et al. 27 using data collected at ED admission (C-index=0.901) was the only prognostic AI model developed to predict inhospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.Apart from predictive modelling, Durhan et al. 38 and Mushtaq et al. 39 evaluated the prognostic utility of two separate deep learning-based software that determine the normal lung proportion and total lung involvement, respectively. Scores obtained from each software achieved a C-index of 0.944 and 0.77 for predicting ICU admission, respectively. While multivariate predictive models were not developed, both studies were subject to similar issues in development and reporting, including ambiguous criteria for ICU admission, inappropriate handling of missing data using complete-case analysis, and lack of reporting on treatments received by participants and on blinding of the outcome.Our study is the first systematic review of AI applications for COVID-19 in intensive care and emergency settings. Applications were largely limited to diagnostic and prognostic predictive modelling, with only one study investigating a separate application of simulating ICU bed occupancy for resource optimisation. Due to high risk of bias, inadequate validation, or poor adherence to reporting standards in all reviewed studies, we have found no AI application for COVID-19 ready for clinical deployment in intensive care or emergency settings.Several key areas for improvements in reporting were identified in our study, including treatments received by participants, blinding, and study size determination. In particular, no study reported on calibration, a crucial yet often unevaluated measure of model performance 52 . We recommend assessing calibration using the calibration hierarchy described by Van Calster et al. 53 instead of the commonly used Hosmer-Lemeshow test 54 . This avoids artificial stratification of patients into risk groups and other limitations associated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test 52 .Studies should also endeavour to validate their data using stricter validation techniques. Studies with smaller sample sizes should utilise re-sampling techniques, such as bootstrapping or k-fold cross-validation. Studies with larger sample sizes should use a nonrandom split of data (e.g. by location or time) or perform external validation on independent data, for example, from a different study 22, 23, 55 . Validation using the same data for model development is inappropriate as it only provides apparent model performance. Similarly, validation using a random split of data, such as a 'train-test' split, has lower power than resampling techniques 22, 56 and should be avoided.The above barriers to the validation and integration of AI in clinical settings may preclude significant contribution of AI to combatting the COVID-19 pandemic in intensive care units and emergency departments in the near future. However, improvements in the development, validation, and reporting of AI applications will be critical in advancing the applicability and acceptance of these systems in clinical settings in later phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and in future global health crises. Encouragingly, leading journals such as the Lancet family of journals have committed to enforcing AI-specific guidelines such as CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI for submissions with an AI intervention 61 . However, concerted effort is needed from the entire research community, including journals, editors, and authors, to normalise the use of these guidelines and checklists. Such changes will encourage improved development, reporting, and eventual clinical uptake of future AI applications.The results from our systematic review should be considered along with the following limitations. Firstly, our search excluded non-peer-reviewed articles which may neglect the most recent literature but ensures a baseline quality of included studies. Secondly, we may have missed some relevant articles despite using a comprehensive search strategy due to publication in journals not indexed in the searched databases and variations in terminology used to describe AI algorithms and intensive care and emergency settings. We may also have missed AI applications that were deployed without publication in scientific literature; in particular, given the intense media attention and the pressure to deploy solutions quickly, AI solutions developed by governments and industry are more likely to be published in mass media formats rather than scientific journals. Thirdly, assessment according to PROBAST and, to a lesser extent, TRIPOD reporting guidelines still rely on a degree of subjectivity, despite comprehensive explanations and elaborations. Hence, other reviewers may arrive at slightly differing results. Lastly, the unprecedented volume of research on COVID-19 has resulted in a rapidly evolving body of literature. Hence, our findings are merely descriptive of the current state of affairs, which may change with welcome improvements and additions to the medical literature.The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.NL conceived the study.

ab2b4d4366ffb30caab042adcce0bee645ffb57b,Mapping internet activity in Australian cities during COVID-19 lockdown: how occupational factors drive inequality,"gaging in written communication, and replacing face-to-face interactions with online streaming activity, work-related tasks are likely to result in measurable increases to home internet traffic.Population-level data on home internet usage may therefore provide a useful complement to the widely available mobility data typically used to monitor and model the real-time effects of COVID-19 [16, 17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . While mobility data can tell us who is staying home and where people are going when they leave the home, internet data provides critically important information on what is happening within households, particularly in relation to adapting their work arrangements to COVID-19 lockdown requirements.Here, we demonstrate how relationships between occupational factors and home internet traffic can provide unique insights into the disparities amplified by the pandemic and associated non-pharmaceutical intervention policies. Our results support the hypothesis that occupational factors link the ability to work from home with income security, and clearly show how this link produces strong positive correlations between income security and increases to home internet activity during COVID-19 restrictions. Our results in the Australian context may help explain the observations of other recent studies describing the connection between income, internet, and the ability to self-isolate during COVID-19 [17, 21] . Overall, the results we present contribute to the detailed picture that is currently forming of the impacts of COVID-19 on human behaviour, and will help policy makers to understand the balance between public health and social impact in making future decisions. Furthermore, results such as those presented in this work will contribute to the ability to produce precise, integrated models of epidemic dynamics connected to social and economic phenomena.We examine the relationships between income security, the ability to work from home, and changes to home internet use volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. We utilise a population-scale data set describing home internet use patterns aggregated on the scale of Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) released by nbn co ltd. (nbn TM ), a Government Business Enterprise providing national, wholesale broadband access in Australia. The SA2 regions are defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), and typically contain between our individual-level interpretation of observed population-scale trends.The data provided by nbn TM consist of upload and download volume (in bytes) by individual households over 30 minute intervals, spatially aggregated into SA2 regions. Different types of internet usage (such as streaming movies, videoconferencing and online gaming) are associated with different patterns of upload and download volume. The high time resolution and structure of the data allowed us to approximately differentiate between background activity, recreational activity, and work-related activity.To reveal spatial variations in residents' ability to adapt their working arrangements to home-based activities, we investigate the relationship between internet activity and the characteristics of local occupation distributions. We define several measures to translate local distributions of occupation types into meaningful quantifiers of two properties: a) income security, and b) the ability to work from home. We then assess the relationship between these quantifiers and putative work-related internet activity.We focus on the urban areas of Sydney and Melbourne during a pre-COVID period (which we use as a baseline), during the first pandemic wave (with Australia-wide transmission and restrictions), and during the second wave (with substantial transmission and restrictions in Melbourne only). We identify positive correlations between income security and changes to internet activity during COVID-19. These correlations are consistent with the assertion that higher income security is associated with more people working from home during lockdown.This assertion is further supported by individual-level data from the CARE survey. We observe that in Sydney this trend persists after the release of lockdown restrictions, indicating the possibility of a ""new normal"" of remote working conditions, particularly for occupations associated with higher income security. In Melbourne, we find that the role of children conducting their studies online disrupts these correlations due to an inverse relationship between income security and the proportion of families with children.Income security is distributed spatially according to distinct patterns, with high values in the central and northeast suburbs of both Sydney and Melbourne (Figure 1a and 1b) .The upper 50% income security quantile (Figure 1c ) favours managerial and office-based occupations, while the lower 50% quantile (Figure 1d ) contains more service staff and other socially-oriented occupations. The distributions of average income security among SA2s in Sydney and Melbourne (respectively) are provided in the Supporting Information Figure S4 , which demonstrates that the distributions in the two regions are not significantly different (two sample t-test, p = 0.552).To quantify changes to home internet use during COVID-19 restrictions, we aggregated internet activity data reported for the SA2 regions within Greater Sydney and Greater Melbourne. For the pre-COVID baseline, we chose the period spanning from October through November, 2019. Over this period, we averaged the per-user upload and download rates from the hours of 9am to 12pm in order to capture putative work-related activity (see Methods).During the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Australia, peaks in case incidence coincided with the implementation of the most restrictive policies, and were followed by increases in total internet use, which peaked approximately one to three weeks after implementation of the tightest level of restrictions ( Figure 3 ). The grey bands in Figure 3 show the periods over which nbn TM data was averaged in order to quantify changes to internet activity during first and second waves of COVID-19.We found that during restrictions associated with the first wave, areas with higher income security tended to exhibit larger absolute and relative changes to download volume ( Figure   4a , 4b, and 4c). Examination of absolute download volumes during the baseline and firstwave periods shows that increasing absolute and relative changes to download volume with income security corresponds to a shift from decreasing, to uncorrelated absolute download levels ( Figure 4a ). However, absolute upload volume shows the opposite trend ( Figure 4d ).after those policies have been formally relaxed.To complement our analysis of spatially-aggregated household-level associations between income security and the ability to work from home, we also analysed individual-level survey data collected by the COVID-19 Attitudes Resilience and Epidemiology (CARE) study. An online cross-sectional survey of 1006 residents of Victoria, Australia. While the CARE study did not collect data on income security per-se, it did record the annual income bracket reported by each respondent.By combining an analysis of occupational factors and distributions with large-scale, highresolution, real-time data on internet activity, we have broadly characterised the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on two major urban centres in Australia, demonstrating three main results:1. The occupations associated with greater income security are also associated with the ability to work from home.Increases were greatest in regions with high income security, suggesting that they may be caused by people who were able to adapt to working from home.3. During the second wave in Melbourne, lower-income regions also displayed increased internet usage, potentially driven by increased levels of home schooling.In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted occupational disparities in urban Australia. Historically, the spatial concentration of income insecurity has produced inequality in the risk that entire urban districts face during crisis situations, such as pandemics [33, 37] .All processed data necessary for reproducing the figures and results of this paper is available in the GitHub repository located here: https://github.com/cjzachreson/Internet_ Income_and_COVID19_in_Australia.

FMS provided CARE survey data and assisted in its interpretation. NG, MT, and RB conceived of and initialised the study.The income security index was constructed using data on employment security and income characteristics linked to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO). For income, we used Australian Bureau of Statistics average weekly earnings by occupation [38] . To calculate the employment security associated with an occupation, we used the most recent iteration (2018) of the nationally-representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. Occupation security status was developed as an individual categorical variable with two levels: 0-secure employment, 1-insecure employment. An individual was classified as 'secure' if they had a fixed-term or permanent job.nbn co ltd. (nbn TM ) is a Government Business Enterprise providing national, wholesale broadband access in Australia. nbn TM provided access to aggregated Australian internet usage volume data from household customers. The data were restricted to the total download and upload volume for 30min intervals, per SA2 region, and the corresponding number of active internet connections per time slot that generated these data. Only data generated by at least 50 domestic connections were included, to avoid privacy concerns and to reduce the impact of aberrant individual household behaviours in regions with insufficient service coverage.Outlier data points beyond three standard deviations from the corresponding time period mean were removed, to limit the impact of outlier usage data points, usually caused by network management or internal infrastructure configuration changes.We set the data collection interval of October 10th, 2019 until November 29th, 2019 as the baseline period, when life in Australia was not impacted by school holidays or major, longer public holidays, and preceding the major disturbance produced by the bushfire season of summer 2019-2020.The period representing behaviour during the 1st wave of restrictions was set to the interval of April 18th -April 24th, 2020, while the period representing the second wave of restrictions was set to the interval of August 8th -August 14th, 2020.The following upload and download volume characteristics per SA2 region were computed for these three periods (baseline and the two COVID-19 intervals): (1) an overall daytime average volume; (2) the daily average minimum volume relating to the minimum internet usage, between 4:30am and 5:30am; (3) the average volume generated during the daytime period (from school start until noon, 9:00am -12:00pm noon); and (4) the average daily maximum usage (8:30pm -10:00pm). See Figure 7 depicting the daily fluctuation of average internet use for the period of September 2019 -September 2020 in Australia, illustrating the relative changes in internet use in these periods.""second wave"" of the COVID-19 epidemic and the associated public health measures.We used a structured questionnaire addressing the following three domains: perceptions of risk and consequences of COVID-19 infection; measures taken by individuals to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 infection; and social and emotional impact.The questionnaire was administered online to members of the YouGov Australia panel of individuals who have agreed to take part in surveys of public opinion (over 120,000 Australian adults). Panellists, selected at random from the base sample, received an email inviting them to take part in a survey, which included a survey link. Once a panel member clicked on the link and logged in, they were directed to the survey most relevant to them available on the platform at the time, according to the sample definition and quotas based on census data. A plain language statement appeared on screen and respondents were required to electronically consent prior to the survey questions appearing. Proportional quota sampling was used to ensure that respondents were demographically representative of the Victorian adult population, with quotas based on age, gender, household income, location (state and metropolitan or regional) and whether a language other than English is spoken at home.The study was by approved by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (2056694).[1] International Labour Organisation (ILO).

c16fc926a94b95613392502d69cf5a33e2f90b54,"'It's not hands-on therapy, so it's very limited': Telehealth use and views among allied health clinicians during the coronavirus pandemic","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has placed an added level of complexity and concern for faceto-face health care. Given the health risks associated with the coronavirus, and government restrictions on health professionals providing face-to-face care in some regions, telehealth services have been rapidly adopted to maintain continuity of care, and to ensure access to treatment [1] [2] [3] .Telehealth involves remote patient-clinician interaction via synchronous (e.g. telephone or teleconference) or asynchronous means (e.g. wearable sensors) 4 . During the coronavirus pandemic, some health systems have responded by providing financial rebates for synchronous telehealth consultations. For example, in Australia, new public health (Medicare) and private insurance rebates were rapidly created in response to the pandemic 5 , contributing to a surge in telehealth services use by allied health clinicians and their patients.Evidence for the efficacy of telehealth continues to emerge 6, 7 . Telehealth delivery of guideline-based recommended care for musculoskeletal conditions (including persistent pain and osteoarthritis) demonstrates similar efficacy to face-to-face care 8 . Telehealth also offers advantages related to access to care for people in rural and remote areas, convenience by reducing travel burden (time and costs) for patients 3, 6, 9, 10 , and creating more flexible work arrangements for clinicians 3 . There are also challenges with telehealth, such as the perceived or real difficulty in developing an effective therapeutic alliance between the clinician and patient. Also, ability to appropriately diagnose or manage certain conditions 3, 4, 6, 11 . Patient perception and trust in receiving appropriate care via telehealth and access to required resources, such as appropriate Internet access and teleconference equipment create additional challenges 3, 6 . Given potential challenges and absence of established guidelines for telehealth assessment and diagnosis of musculoskeletal conditions, it is uncertain how allied health clinicians view, or are prepared to adopt, telehealth during or after the pandemic.This survey aimed of this survey was to investigate the use of, and views towards telehealth among allied health clinicians treating people with musculoskeletal conditions during the coronavirus pandemic. Understanding how allied health clinicians use telehealth services with musculoskeletal patients, and their attitudes towards telehealth may help to inform development of future guidelines and training.This study was a cross-sectional survey investigating the use and views towards telehealth among allied health clinicians treating people with musculoskeletal conditions during the coronavirus pandemic. Data collection occurred from April to June 2020. The Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) guided the reporting of this study. 12 Ethical approval was granted by University Human Research Ethics Committee (No. 24212). All participants provided informed online consent.The online survey was developed by members of the research team (PM, CB, MM, CW, TH), and informed by previous research related to potential barriers and enablers of telehealth adoption 4, 6, 11, 13 . The survey was constructed in using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Provo, Utah) and included 35 questions (see Supplementary file 1) appearing over 10 electronic pages. Questions covered participant characteristics including demographic factors (age, gender, country of residence), and clinician-related factors (profession, clinical experience, clinical setting, post-graduate training, impact of the pandemic on their clinical revenue, percentage of total caseload that included people with musculoskeletal conditions). Clinicians were also asked about telehealth use (percentage of telehealth caseload pre and post coronavirus pandemic onset), telehealth resources used, training in telehealth use, conditions seen using telehealth, and telehealth (as well as face-to-face) management practices (diagnosis, treatment, resources provided to patients). A series of questions were developed based on components of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) of behavior change.The TDF is a theoretical framework rather than a theory. It provides a theoretical lens through which to view the cognitive, affective, social and environmental influences on behaviour 14 Prior to launching, the survey was piloted by a convenience sample of five independent allied health clinicians and members of the research team. Changes were subsequently made to improve accuracy and clarity (i.e. phrasing of questions), functionality and data retrieval (i.e. forced response to all questions, appropriate use of multi-select options, and back button added) (See -Supplementary file 1).Allied health clinicians, defined as any non-medically trained health professionals that consult to people with musculoskeletal conditions, were invited to participate. There were no country limitations to participation. To capture clinicians that provided telehealth during the period of international coronavirus practice restrictions, the survey was live for recruitment between April 24 and June 5, 2020. The advertisement invited 'all allied health clinicians who have treated (one or more) people with a musculoskeletal complaint through telehealth during the coronavirus pandemic.A convenience sample of allied health clinicians treating people with musculoskeletal conditions were recruited through social media (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) accounts of the authors and their networks. Members of the Australian Physiotherapy and Podiatry Associations were also emailed an advertisement promoting study participation. All clinicians were incentivized by offering a free 1-hour recorded webinar providing evidence and practical information related to telehealth for musculoskeletal conditions.All survey data was exported from Qualtrics to SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) data analysis software. The completion rate (proportion who completed 80% of more of the survey) was reported. Descriptive data were reported for demographic and clinician-related factors. The frequency and proportion of clinicians who used telehealth pre and post coronavirus pandemic onset, and the telehealth resources, training, conditions treated, and management practices was reported descriptively. Attitudes towards telehealth were described by how clinicians were Applying the COM-B model allows for a simplified understanding of barriers to behaviour change, in order to inform future implementation interventions 18 . Over several meetings, the two researchers (JPC, CB) discussed and refined the codes and themes, and undertook a frequency count of the content to aid interpretation. A third researcher (PM) was subsequently involved to refine the themes. Differences in researcher perspective and reflexivity were discussed and if necessary, codes and themes were regrouped and recoded until reaching consensus.There were 1,185 allied health clinicians who commenced the survey, and 827 completed ≥80% of the questions and were included in analyses (completion rate = 827/1185 = 69%). There were 358 clinicians who completed less than 80% of the survey and most of this subset of respondents (84% [301/358]) consented but did not respond to any questions.Demographic information for the cohort is shown in Table 1 . Eighty-two percent (688/827) of clinicians were physiotherapists. Detailed demographic information of the cohort is provided in Table 1 .Seventy-one percent (587/827) of clinicians reported reduction in revenue since the coronavirus pandemic and 23% (190/827) reported the question was not applicable to their individual working circumstances (e.g. they worked in the public sector). Clinicians reported a mean (SD) revenue reduction of 62% (SD = 24.7%).Two-thirds of clinicians (66%, 547/827) reported not using telehealth at all prior to the pandemic.The median proportion of people seen via telehealth by clinicians increased from 0% pre (IQR 0 to 1) to 60% during the pandemic (IQR 10 to 100).All clinicians (100%, 827/827) used subjective questioning, most (86%, 713/838) assessed functional tests (e.g. range of motion, single leg squat task). Approximately half used patient self-delivered palpation (52%, 427/827) and patient self-delivered special tests (55%, 457/827) to assist with diagnosis. In free text responses, clinicians reported using multiple other diagnostic strategies, including: running and walking gait assessments, patient reported outcome measures, body charts, accessing diagnostic imaging reports or ordering pre appointment imaging, family member or carer assisted tests/palpation, observation (e.g. of swelling, alignment) and use of on-screen annotations (e.g. joint range measurement).Proportion of participants who reported using telehealth for selected conditions and services is shown in Figure 1 . Only 3% (23/838) of clinicians reported they would not consider treating any J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f musculoskeletal conditions or providing any services via telehealth. Clinicians also indicated they used telehealth to treat a variety of other non-musculoskeletal conditions (e.g. cancer rehabilitation, concussion, respiratory conditions, falls or balance concerns). Over two-thirds of clinicians cited receiving telehealth information during the pandemic from speaking with colleagues or websites, and more than half from their professional associations, or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f social media (Figure 3b ). Clinicians also reported accessing telehealth information via their telehealth providers (e.g. Cliniko, Physitrack), and podcasts.Attitudes towards telehealth Figure 4 shows results related to perceived role, confidence, capabilities, support, value, and training related to telehealth.Barriers and enablers to implementing and using telehealth are summarised in Table 2 Table. Challenges and enablers to telehealthOur data demonstrate an extraordinary shift toward telehealth, with median reported proportion of telehealth consultations per week increasing from 0% pre coronavirus to 62% during the pandemic.This shift reflects most clinicians (82%) agreeing that telehealth was part of their professional role, and most clinicians (76-83%) agreeing they were confident in diagnosing, assessing, and treating both acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions via telehealth. Reported telehealth care during the coronavirus pandemic was broadly similar to face-to-face care, focused on exercise, education and activity modification, but obviously without provision of hands on passive treatments.Despite high rates of adoption and reported confidence among clinicians, only 42% agreed that telehealth was as effective as face-to-face care, and just one in four agreed that patients valued telehealth to the same extent. This suggests that many clinicians adopted telehealth due to necessity, making it questionable whether they would persist with its use, once barriers to face-toface care were removed. Importantly, these perceptions among clinicians and patients about inferior J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f value of telehealth are contrary to emerging evidence evaluating efficacy in musculoskeletal pain conditions, including high patient satisfaction and equivalent clinical outcomes 8 .Qualitative themes helped to explain clinician perceptions about telehealth. Many focused on the lack of physical contact, perceiving this to hamper accurate and effective diagnosis and management. Consistent with this view, Cottrell and Russell (2020) 6 suggest telehealth offers good validity for observational assessments (e.g. pain, swelling, joint range, balance and gait) but not for assessments traditionally requiring skilled physical contact (e.g. some 'special' tests or neurodynamic assessments). Many clinicians also expressed the view that patients expect them to provide 'handson' care, which may be a barrier to sustained implementation of telehealth. However, the belief that telehealth was inferior to face-to-face care was not consistent across all clinicians. Some felt that telehealth facilitated acting as coaches enabling encouragement of self-management, rather than their traditional role as 'fixers', providing hands on care. This shift away from passive to more active care facilitated by telehealth is consistent with guideline recommendations for common musculoskeletal conditions including osteoarthritis and low back pain 19 , indicating telehealth could improve the value of care provided.Only 21% of clinicians agreed they had been trained to provide telehealth services to people with musculoskeletal conditions. This widespread perception of inadequate training was mirrored by many clinicians reporting in open-ended questions that they turned to peer support and mentoring (e.g. experienced clinician observation) to upskill. Addressing these apparent gaps in telehealth training requires consideration to increasing telehealth and digital health training opportunities for allied health clinicians and students 20 , including tailoring to varied allied health clinicians roles and work settings (e.g. private practice vs hospital) 20 . The urgency in addressing these training needs extends beyond the coronavirus public health emergency 1 . Improved telehealth access and delivery is needed to also address rapidly evolving health care models 21 , growing demand for digital health interventions 22 , and need to improve healthcare access for people in remotely located areas 6 . A focus on telehealth implementation strategies including training, detailed telehealth practice guidelines, and clear guidance to clinicians and patients on conditions that are amenable to telehealth is strongly encouraged.`Aligning with evidence of efficacy for telehealth 6 , most clinicians reported they would manage common musculoskeletal conditions via telehealth including low back pain, osteoarthritis and tendinopathy. More than half the of the clinicians also reported managing a range of other chronic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and acute injuries including muscle and joint strains/sprains, despite an absence of evidence of efficacy to support telehealth for these presentations. Qualitative analysis also indicated a perception that some clinicians felt particular conditions were not suitable for telehealth (e.g. complex acute conditions). Collectively, these findings highlight the need for continued research to develop and evaluate interventions for the broad range of musculoskeletal conditions managed by healthcare systems, in order to provide better guidance for clinical practice.Beyond any perceived inferior value of telehealth, several other barriers identified in qualitative analysis are worthy of mention. Physical opportunity related factors made up the bulk of barriers identified, including environmental (e.g. space, funding) and resource (e.g. internet, software) factors related to both clinicians and patients. This was consistent with only 58% of the cohort agreeing that they had adequate resources to implement telehealth. Similar environmental and resource-related barriers have been identified in the literature 6, 23 . Issues with communication and developing rapport with the patient were also identified as barriers to telehealth 24 . Although these barriers have been highlighted in the literature 6, 23 , our analysis provided novel insights into why clinicians may hold these beliefs. Specifically, physical contact was viewed by many respondents as an essential method for developing patient trust and rapport. Clinicians in our cohort also expressed concerns about the demands of telehealth for various reasons, including the requirement to troubleshoot technical issues, generate and send out patient resources, and the associated administration. Many of the barriers related to digital literacy, communication, and perceived demands (e.g. workflow) may be addressed with appropriate training and resources (e.g. telehealth toolkit). There is a clear opportunity for professional bodies to better support clinicians to implement telehealth with only 52% of respondents feeling they are currently adequately supported.Our findings provide unique insights into the perceptions of allied health clinicians related to telehealth during a time of crisis and swift telehealth uptake. There are several limitations that need to be mentioned. First, we caution against generalising beyond physiotherapists (82% of the cohort).Further, our cohort reflect the views of less experienced clinicians, and may not be generalised to all clinicians. Two thirds of respondents had not used telehealth at all prior to the coronavirus pandemic and we incentivised respondents with free telehealth education. It is possible that their views may change with continued telehealth experience, or education and training to use telehealth.Although this limits the generalisability, it is a key population to study because they are likely to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f experience the greatest difficulty in adopting telehealth. Second, given the online nature of the survey, we could not verify who completed the survey or whether the same people completed the survey more than once. The online nature of this survey also means that it was most likely already biased towards people who access information digitally and are comfortable with the digital environment. We may therefore have missed a population of less digitally enabled clinicians for whom there may be different barriers and attitudes. Third, although we used broad open questions to gather rich data on barriers and enablers to telehealth use, our survey design did not allow for indepth exploration that could be expected from an interview or focus group design.Allied health clinicians rapidly adopted telehealth during the coronavirus pandemic, treated a range of musculoskeletal conditions and view it as part of their clinical role. Yet, most felt they lacked adequate training to deliver telehealth services, and that telehealth was less effective than face-toface care and undervalued by patients. These barriers may limit continued telehealth use among allied health clinicians beyond the pandemic. Future research should consider strategies to address patient and clinician barriers to telehealth as well as improving the current evidence base. ",Australia,abstract,2021-02-05,02

No reuse allowed without permission.This study was approved by the ethical committee of Hasselt University [CME2020/025].Individual data-sources obtained additional ethics approval as required.Data from a core questionnaire regarding COVID-19, and relevant patient demographic and neurological information, were reported by treating clinicians, as described previously 10 . Data were entered in three fashions: 1) ""Direct entry to central platform""; 2) ""Patient-level data sharing via participating registries/cohorts"", where MS registries and cohorts are regularly invited to share and upload their COVID-19 core dataset into the central data platform; and 3) All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Data was entered for a given participant once, but information for that participant could be reentered and this then replacing the original record. This thus made for serial iterations of the analysis dataset, which were analysed over time as the dataset expanded, thus allowing for assessment of temporal consistency of observed associations. Previous iterations of the dataset have been presented 11 but this article describes only the present iteration of the dataset.The study sponsors had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation data, in the writing of the report, or the decision to submit for publication.COVID-19 status was defined as confirmed, based on a positive diagnostic test, or suspected, based on clinician judgement.Patient age at the time of reporting was categorised into four groups: 0-17, 18-49, 50-69, and ≥ 70 years; the 0-17 group was excluded (n=5). MS-phenotype was grouped into relapsingremitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (SPMS, PPMS). Disability was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 12 or Neurostatus 13 . Disability was dichotomised into 0-6.0 and >6.0. Comorbidities were queried, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic liver disease, kidney disease, other All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Associations with hospitalisation, ICU admission, ventilation, and death were assessed using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, random effects grouped by data source, as univariable and adjusted for age, sex, MS-phenotype, and disability. In addition, sensitivityanalyses were completed serially excluding each data-source to assess whether influential data sources underlay associations. Subgroup analyses were also undertaken where data on comorbidities, BMI, and smoking were available, allowing additional adjustment for these covariates. All analyses were complete-case.For DMTs, individual DMTs were first compared with dimethyl fumarate. Despite leading to lymphopenia in some patients, dimethyl fumarate has not been associated with increased risk of infection 14 , and its biological mechanism of action is unlikely to interfere with the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 15 , while being common in the sample. Next ocrelizumab and rituximab and the untreated were compared with pooled other DMTs.Finally, ocrelizumab and rituximab were evaluated vs natalizumab to assess ascertainment bias, since natalizumab-treated patients present for infusions every 28-42 days, compared to biannual infusions for anti-CD20 DMTs. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The cohort comprised 2,340 patients, of whom 657 (28.1%) had suspected COVID-19 and 1,683 (71.9%) had confirmed COVID-19. Among suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, which was the primary analysis dataset, 20.9% were hospitalised, 5.4% admitted to ICU, 4.1% required artificial ventilation, and 3.2% died. Proportions were slightly higher among confirmed COVID-19 cases (Table 1) .Data sources were located in: 1) Sweden (n=290); 2) Australia, Belgium, Brasil, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Turkey (n=97); 3) Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico (n=159); 4) Bulgaria (n=3); 5) Germany, Italy (n=45); 6) Denmark (n=56); 7) Brasil (n=96); 8) Australia, Bahamas, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Serbia, Spain, UK, USA (n=114); 9) Germany (n=41); 10) USA (n=1,161); 11) UK (n=131); 12) Spain (n=147). Sources-2 and 10 had higher proportions with confirmed COVID-19 and Sources-4 and 5 higher with non-suspected COVID-19. Among suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalisation was higher in Source-11 and lower in Sources-2, 4, 5, and 7; ICU admission was higher in Sources-3, 9, and 10, and lower in Sources-2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 12; ventilation was higher in Sources-3 and 8, and lower in Sources-2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11; death was higher in Source-11 and lower in Sources-2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Results were comparable on restriction to confirmed-only COVID-19 (data not shown).All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Demographic and clinical characteristics of hospitalisation and ICU admission ( Table 2 ) and requiring artificial ventilation and death (Table 3 ) among suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases were assessed. In multivariable models, female sex showed an inverse trend with risks of hospitalisation and death, while older age was positively associated with hospitalisation and death. Progressive MS-phenotype was associated with higher risk of hospitalisation.Higher EDSS was associated with higher risks of all outcomes. Among confirmed-only COVID-19, most of these associations persisted (Tables S2-S3 ).In the subset of data sources with data available, having comorbidities was associated with increased risk of death and obese BMI with increased risks of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and ventilation, while smoking was not associated with any outcomes.Compared to dimethyl fumarate, rituximab use was associated with greater risks of hospitalisation (aOR=2.43), ICU admission (aOR=3.93), and artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00, Table 4 ). Ocrelizumab showed similar trends for hospitalisation (aOR=1.56) and ICU All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Compared to all other DMTs (Table 4 ), those using rituximab had higher risks of hospitalisation (aOR=2.76), ICU admission (aOR=4.32), and artificial ventilation (aOR=6.15). Ocrelizumab showed similar trends for hospitalisation (aOR=1.75) and ICU admission (aOR=2.55) but not ventilation (aOR=1.60). Neither rituximab or ocrelizumab were associated with risk of death. Untreated patients had increased risks of hospitalisation (aOR=2.05), ventilation (aOR=2.07), and death (aOR=2.53). These results persisted among confirmed-only COVID-19 cases (Table S5) .Compared to natalizumab, rituximab was associated with higher risks of hospitalisation (aOR=2.88), ICU admission (aOR=3.23), and ventilation (aOR=5.52, Table 4 ). Ocrelizumab showed similar trends for hospitalisation (aOR=1.86), but did not reach significance for ICU admission and was not associated with ventilation. Neither rituximab or ocrelizumab was associated with increased risk of death. Results were similar among confirmed-only COVID-19 (Table S5) .To mitigate the impact of potential heterogeneity among the individual data sources influencing the results, particularly that for source C10 which comprised nearly half the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.sample, we utilised random-effects logistic regression. However, in addition, serial exclusion analyses were undertaken wherein analyses were run excluding each dataset in turn. These analyses showed no material differences in associations compared to the main analysis (data not shown).To assess whether the associations seen for ocrelizumab and rituximab with outcomes was genuinely a function of the DMTs, rather than the characteristics of patients commonly treated with these medications (older, progressive MS, higher disability), we undertook stratified analyses evaluating associations among persons aged>70 years vs ≤ 70, among RRMS vs progressive, and among EDSS≤6 vs EDSS>6. These analyses showed that associations were actually present in persons of younger age, of RRMS phenotype, and lower EDSS, indicating that the observed associations were a function of the DMT, not underlying risk profile (Tables S6-S8 ).In the largest sample of people with MS with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 to date, we demonstrated that the anti-CD20 DMTs rituximab, and to a lesser extent ocrelizumab, were associated with more severe COVID-19. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, pooled other DMTs, and natalizumab, anti-CD20 DMTs were associated with higher risks of hospitalisation and ICU admission, while only rituximab was associated with greater risk of requiring artificial ventilation for each analysis. Comparison to natalizumab is particularly important, suggesting that anti-CD20 associations do not reflect ascertainment bias.Regardless of comparator, rituximab consistently showed stronger associations with All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Anti-CD20 DMTs, which selectively deplete circulating B-lymphocytes, alemtuzumab and cladribine which act through broader immunosuppressive mechanisms, and fingolimod, which sequesters lymphocytes from circulation, are highly effective MS treatments, but can increase infection risk 1, 16 . This has raised concern during the COVID- 19 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Of interest are the differences in the magnitudes of associations seen for ocrelizumab and rituximab, since both bind the same CD20 epitope on the outer loop of the protein, albeit in slightly different fashions 17, 18 . In comparison to dimethyl fumarate, to pooled other DMTs, and to natalizumab, rituximab consistently showed stronger associations with outcomes than ocrelizumab. Importantly, in analyses stratifying associations of DMT exposure with COVID19 severity by age, MS-phenotype, and EDSS, there was no evidence that the anti-CD20 DMT associations merely reflects patients with underlying risk factors being disposed to use these treatments. The differences seen, both in magnitudes of associations with hospitalisation and ICU admission and the lack of association with ventilation, are puzzling. This weaker magnitude for ocrelizumab has been seen in prior iterations of the analysis but also in those prior iterations ocrelizumab was significantly associated with ventilation as well as hospitalisation and ICU admission, albeit of weaker magnitude 11 . That ocrelizumab was no longer associated in this iteration of the data may reflect changes in medical practice for COVID-19 treatment, including the introduction of more effective treatments that reduce the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.That anti-CD20 DMTs were not associated with death conflicts with the results seen for the other outcomes, as well as with the MuSC-19 study which found a positive trend between anti-CD20 DMTs and death. The issue may lie in ascertainment bias, with fewer of the older patients included in our sample: we had only 9.1% of confirmed COVID-19 cases over 60 years old, vs 17.7% in the MuSC-19 cohort 9 . The potential impacts of these DMTs on death due to COVID-19 should be further explored.In contrast to prior clinic-based studies, our cohort focused on a pre-defined limited set of demographic and clinical characteristics 10 . Thus, we could not assess other clinical features, particularly prior MS clinical course and DMT use, paraclinical information such as radiological burden of MS, or the nuanced details of COVID-19 onset and evolution. Another limitation of our data is that they likely comprise greater proportions of severe cases requiring medical attention. One particular element lacking in our data is treatment duration or duration All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Heterogeneity in the definitions of exposure and outcomes and in patient inclusion among the data-sources is a known problem in combining multiple data-sources. Related to this are the differences in protocols for hospital and ICU admission and initiation of artificial ventilation between hospitals. To ensure that our results were not being driven by single influential datasources, we undertook all analyses using random-effects logistic regression, as well as serialexclusion sensitivity analyses. These analyses showed that, while there was some variation in the magnitudes and significance of associations, trends tracked as seen for the whole cohort, indicating that the results were not driven by a specific data-source.Another issue lies in the anonymous nature of the data entry, such that patients may be entered more than once in different data-sources. We are unable to account for whether participants already participated or had their data entered in another study as there is no identifying information to assess this, nor any query of prior participation in the survey.Another issue is the comparator used for individual DMTs. We initially planned to compare to glatiramer acetate given its absence of impact on infection risk; however, infrequency of outcomes among these patients precluded its being the comparator. Interferon-beta and teriflunomide were potential comparators but their potential impacts on infection immune response argued against this. Dimethyl fumarate was identified as a suitable comparator, being common in the sample and was also that used for the MuSC-19 study 9 . The untreated All rights reserved.

Thus, we were obliged to use three-level categories of age and two-level EDSS, rather than more exact values of each. That said, these levels are generally aligned with the levels of each associated with increased COVID-19 severity.Another issue is the definition of outcome values. Where these values were missing, we have left them as such, rather than inferring for instance that patients who were not hospitalised were also not admitted to ICU or required artificial ventilation. This was a conservative allocation that increased the proportions missing for such parameters, rather than coding them to null values, but analyses coding such to null values made little impact on results (data not shown).In the largest population yet studied, we have shown that MS patients treated with anti-CD20 DMTs, rituximab and ocrelizumab, are at higher risk of more severe COVID-19 compared to those treated with dimethyl fumarate, to pooled other DMTs, and to natalizumab. This risk is additional to the risk associated with demographic and clinical characteristics. These results agree with smaller cohort studies and suggest that the risk-vs-benefit of continued or new exposure to CD20-depleting treatment strategies compared to other DMTs needs to be considered in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

0914cc7fe93d117e42ada8ce099e765852b66551,Adapting harm reduction services during COVID-19: lessons from the supervised injecting facilities in Australia,"Public health interventions in response to COVID-19, including border closures and physical distancing measures, have had profound implications for the ways in which people access health services [1] . Service providers have faced significant challenges to remain open during the pandemic, and many (e.g. general practitioners and mental health clinicians) have adapted by moving operations online [2] . This is not possible for many services where ongoing client facing operations are essential. This is particularly the case for supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) and drug consumption rooms (DCRs) more broadly.Supervised injecting facilities are designed to provide highly marginalised and stigmatised communities who consume drugs [3] with; (1) safer spaces to inject drugs; (2) immediate responses to overdose and other adverse drug reactions (where necessary); and (3) facilitated access to a range of other health and social services. In reality, SIFs provide much more than these services (e.g. responding to acute mental health issues, harm reduction advice and community engagement), highlighting their flexibility and responsiveness in meeting the often complex health and social needs of their clients [4] .There are two SIFs currently operating in Australia, the Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) in Sydney and the North Richmond Community Health Medically Supervised Injecting Room (MSIR) in Melbourne. Each service operates under specific legislation that allows exemption from criminal liability for both clients and staff, and with explicit support from state police. In New South Wales and Victoria, police are encouraged to exercise discretion not to charge people for simple drug possession if they are in the vicinity of, or travelling to and from, the service.The MSIC is located in Kings Cross in Sydney, an area that has historically had large street-based illicit drug markets in operation [3] . Staff working at the MSIC include a medical director, operations manager, nurse unit manager, mental health nurse coordinator, referral coordinator, health education officers, registered nurses and security staff. The MSIC has 16 injecting spaces available for client use. It is a stand-alone service with close links to many other health, social and harm reduction services. It is an injecting facility and as such, does not cater for other modes of drug administration.The MSIR is located in North Richmond in Melbourne, an area that has historically recorded high levels of public heroin use and related harms [5, 6] . Staff working at the MSIR include a medical director, operations manager, nurse team leader, registered nurses, harm reduction practitioners and security staff. The MSIR has 20 injecting spaces available. It is co-located with a community health centre with medical staff, dental staff, drug outreach workers and allied health workers. In addition, a consulting zone located within the injecting room building provides a range of on-site services provided by NRCH and partner organisations including BBV testing and treatment, opioid agonist treatment, basic oral health care (including with silver fluoride), housing and legal services, alcohol and drug treatments, mental health counselling). As an injecting facility the MSIR also only caters for this mode of drug administration.Since opening in 2001, the MSIC in Sydney has supported over 1.1 million injecting visits and responded to over 10,000 overdoses (personal communication, M Bartlett, 11 August 2020). According to the MSIR Review Panel's final report, in its first 18 months the Melbourne MSIR responded to 2657 overdoses [6] . These services are important not only in mitigating comorbidities associated with non-fatal overdose, and in reducing the number of injections that occur in public places, but also in averting fatal overdose, highlighted by the fact that neither facility has ever had a single fatality.People who inject drugs are likely to be impacted by COVID-19 in unique ways and for multiple reasons. First, the introduction of stay-at-home and isolation orders presents risks for people injecting alone, as the presence of others is often a protective factor for overdose [7] .Second, a large proportion of people who attend SIFs are either street based, homeless or in boarding houses [8] and may have no home in which to self-isolate, increasing their risk of contracting the virus. While state governments across the country have made provisions to temporarily accommodate these communities during the pandemic [9] , there may be increased risks in these contexts including overcrowding, difficulties maintaining physical distancing, and challenges with early detection and sufficient isolation of potential COVID-19 cases [10] .Third, many people who inject drugs have poor physical health and underlying respiratory conditions [11] , which may increase susceptibility to poorer outcomes if they contract COVID-19. Finally, any disruptions to the illicit drug market may have a range of consequences, including people potentially reducing their use and seeking drug treatment, but also people potentially moving to more dangerous substances (e.g. fentanyl or fentanyl analogues) or heavier and more frequent patterns of use [12] . Indeed, in the context of increasing numbers of overdose deaths attributed to fentanyl recorded in the region during the pandemic, fentanyl has been described in North America as the 'predictable outcome of opioid prohibition' [13] .The challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted many harm reduction and treatment services worldwide [1] . Several DCRs across Europe have been forced to close, particularly where distancing was not possible, while others adapted by providing outdoor services [14] . Many drop-in centres across Europe providing support for people who consume drugs have also been closed [14] . Harm reduction services have also closed or restricted intake in North America [13, 15, 16] , as have some Australian alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment services, creating further risks for people who inject drugs, and stress on local health services [17] .As at the time of writing, the two SIFs operating in Australia have remained open throughout the pandemic by adopting a range of adaptive practice changes. Lessons learnt in responding to the pandemic are likely to apply to a range of other client facing services including homelessness services, outreach needle and syringe programmes (NSP), and opioid agonist treatment (OAT) [1] . This paper documents the strategies implemented by the MSIC and MSIR in adapting to COVID-19 between March and December 2020. It does so in the context of the implementation of government restrictions in Australia nationally and in New South Wales and Victoria. It also discusses future challenges that may arise for clients of these services as the pandemic evolves.Government restrictions in Australia, February to December 2020 Figure 1 outlines some of the major Australian jurisdictional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic up to the date of writing (December 2020), documenting the dates of border closure and restrictions on gatherings and movement. Legislation governing these restrictions occurs at the jurisdictional and national level, and there is variation in how they are implemented. Victoria and New South Wales are the most populated jurisdictions in Australia [18] and account for the greatest number of COVID-19 cases during the pandemic so far [19] .Australian borders were closed to non-residents and non-citizens from 20 March. More restrictive lockdown measures were progressively introduced throughout March, culminating in enforceable stay-at-home directions for all Australians from 31 March (Stage 3 restrictions).The process of easing restrictions commenced on 1 May in New South Wales [20] , and from 11 May in Victoria.On 9 July, Stage 3 restrictions were reintroduced for Victorian residents living in greater Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire, following several large clusters of COVID-19 cases occurring in the state. Stage 4 restrictions, including a night-time curfew (8 pm-5 am), were introduced in greater Melbourne on 3 August [21] . New South Wales also recorded several localised outbreaks in early July, and again in December, with stay at home restrictions reintroduced for parts of the greater Sydney area on 19 December (Fig. 1 ). Figure 2a , b shows the number of cases and seven day moving average reported in New South Wales and Victoria. New South Wales experienced a large spike in daily cases in late March (212 cases), while Victoria experienced a second and much larger spike (723 cases) in late July [19] . For the period 1 March to 31 December 2020, New South Wales had a cumulative total of 4,731 cases, equating to 58.2 cases per 100,000 population, and Victoria had a cumulative total of 20,358 cases equating to 306.1 cases per 100,000 population.The MSIC and MSIR implemented a range of strategies from as early as 16 March aimed at reducing the COVID risk to staff and clients (Table 1) , with many responses being escalated as necessary throughout this period.Procedures controlling entry to the services, including manning the front door and reducing the number of clients at one time in the registration area, were implemented across both services. Staff members/security staff at each service ensured clients were distancing appropriately, while they waited to access the service. The total number of injecting spaces was reduced (from 16 to 8 at the MSIC; from 20 to 13 at the MSIR), and clients were asked to limit the time they spent in the service. All client-facing staff at both services were required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) in clinical service areas (Table 1) .Clients at both services were screened for travel history, symptoms and temperature prior to entry. MSIC clients with symptoms were offered a face mask and referred for testing at the nearest facility. Those who met COVID-19 testing criteria were not permitted to access the service. Local AOD clinical services offered pop-up and outreach COVID testing. Testing procedures at the MSIR evolved in response to changing levels of community transmission. In the initial phases of the pandemic, clients were encouraged to undergo onsite COVID-19 testing. Clients who were symptomatic were not permitted entry to the service at this stage. In the context of increasing community transmission rates in Victoria, all MSIR clients who were symptomatic were required to undergo testing. During this time, expert advice from Infection Prevention and Control consultants was sought. Recommendations included the implementation of an enclosed alternative injecting and aftercare space for individual use for clients who met COVID-19 testing criteria. Deep cleaning procedures were implemented for this area after every occasion of use.Staff of both services were also screened for temperature and movements prior to commencing work in each service. Support for contact tracing in both services was critical to enable a prompt response in the event of a COVID-19 case being identified among staff or clients. This was facilitated through the online clinical databases at each service, with the clients' time in and out of each stage, and the number of the injecting space recorded electronically. MSIR also used closed circuit television (CCTV) monitoring, which is a standard feature at the service. Staff monitoring was facilitated through documentation of staff movements through each stage (Table 1) .Overdose response protocols were changed at both facilities including: (1) staff to wear full PPE when responding to overdose; (2) earlier administration of intramuscular naloxone; and (3) in oxygen flow where oxygen-assisted respiration was required, due to the aerosolization risks associated with both procedures.Facilitating access to temporary accommodation and OAT during the pandemic has been a substantial and important undertaking for both services. Provision of Overall-MSIC staff to remain 1.5 m distance from clients while they are using the service except in case of emergency. All client-facing staff to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) in clinical areas (as below). Hourly cleaning of clinical areas. Encouraging client time spent in the service to be less than one hour, unless they require monitoring due to decreased level of consciousness or post-overdoseOverall-MSIR staff to remain 1.5 m distance from clients while they are using the service except in case of emergency. All client-facing staff to wear PPE in clinical areas (as below). Hourly cleaning of clinical areas. Air conditioning settings changed and air purifiers with HEPA filters in all client areas. Implementation of a support role to guide clients through service and procedural changes. Encouraging clients to reduce time spent in the service and exit as soon as safe to do so All MSIC staff to wear full PPE-gown, face shield, N95 mask and gloves when responding to an overdose that may require bag valve mask (BVM) resuscitation. All MSIC staff responding to an overdose with oxygen only are required to wear N95 masks and protective eyewear-no gown or gloves are required for these responses All MSIR staff to wear full PPE (gown, full face shield, N95 mask and gloves) when responding to an overdose. Implementation of a scribe at MSIR to record observations and support staff with communication MSIC changed first response to overdose: ceased BVM resuscitation for clients who are apnoeic (not breathing) due to aerosolization risk.MSIR changed first response to overdose: oxygen flow limited to 6 l/min, use of non-rebreather masks if 6 l/min with a Hudson mask is not sufficient. No nebulising medication administered. Severe overdoses moved to (enclosed) medical monitoring room using evacuation slide sheet and crash mat for response, which may include ventilatory support Naloxone (800 mcg IMI) administered immediately for apnoeic clients, in place of BVM-repeat in 2 to 3 min as necessary Naloxone (1200 mcg IMI) administered immediately for apnoeic clients (800 mcg IMI if some breathing but less than 5 breaths per minute)Commence BVM only if client not responsive to naloxone Commence BVM in enclosed medical monitoring room using two-handed vice grip on the mask to reduce aerosolization risk Reduction in oxygen flow to 6 l/min when administering oxygen through Hudson mask, due to aerosolization risk. Staff encouraged to turn oxygen off before removing Hudson mask to reduce any slight risk of aerosolization Reduction in oxygen flow to 6 l/min using non-rebreather mask if requiredFacilitated access to COVID-19 swab testing COVID-19 swab testing onsite onsite OAT commenced at the MSIR in September 2019; however, clients were increasingly encouraged to commence treatment during the pandemic. MSIC also actively encouraged referrals to OAT. There has been increased uptake of OAT (particularly buprenorphine depot) during this time among MSIR and MSIC clients. The facilitation of access to short-term accommodation for clients dramatically increased across both services due to government initiatives implemented in Australia during the pandemic. Both services also increased the provision of take-home naloxone (THN) during this time.Several of these procedural changes are unique to the SIF environment. Airway management during overdose response undoubtedly increases the risks of COVID-19 transmission. The aerosolization risk of virus transmission is clearly greater during these responses, particularly where oxygen administration is required [22] . Also elevating risk is the inability of staff to physically distance while responding to overdose. An additional challenge for clinical staff was the scarcity of PPE in the early period of the outbreak, an issue that has also been reported internationally [23] . The fluid nature of information about COVID-19, and the often highly contested views in relation to transmission risks that have emerged throughout the pandemic [24] , has also presented challenges in implementing procedural change.Protocols evolved over time as community risk increased, evidence of risk exposures became available, and response strategies were trialled and assessed. For example, resuscitation protocols developed rapidly from requiring PPE for staff performing BVM resuscitation, to cessation of BVM altogether once the aerosolization risk of virus transmission was more clearly established. Requirements on the use of PPE continued to progress as understanding of the virus and transmission risks advanced, with differences between the MSIC and MSIRThe MSIC and MSIR differ in terms of service location, and overall service structure. The MSIR is a programme of North Richmond Community Health (NRCH), a community health provider. NRCH and partner organisations provide co-located health and social support services in addition to the supervised injecting facility. In contrast, MSIC is a standalone supervised injecting facility Tracking register implemented for staff onsite-record of risk exposure (e.g. responded to overdose) absences, COVID tests and results ""Stage Log"" for all MSIC staff, documenting time in and time out of each stage during working shift. Also in staff kitchen area where staff have breaks MSIC management team seating changed so that alternative teams placed in different 'air space' to reduce contact and transmission risk. Shift patterns of front-line staff unable to be altered due to smaller staff numbers MSIR staff movements recorded through the service to assist with contact tracing, if necessary. Activation of the COVIDsafe app on two service phones to facilitate contract tracing MSIR has onsite CCTV (since inception) (not available at MSIC) MSIR staff divided into teams to further reduce contact between staff and limit number of contacts in the event of a confirmed case. Shift patterns altered to reduce staff crossover MSIR recommissioned a consulting room in the Registration area as a 'single occupant/single use' alternative injecting and aftercare area for clients who meet COVID-19 testing criteria and who agree to an onsite test. This is an additional mechanism to support COVID-19 testing, self-isolation and isolation planning, and reduce risks of transmission due to nondisclosure/masking of COVID-19 symptomsAt least weekly briefings with clinical staff about implementation of and changes to procedures in relation to COVID-19 and transmission risks. Informal audits done on donning and doffing of PPE and reminders about mask hygiene. Weekly teleconferences between the MSIC and MSIR to discuss ongoing response and procedural changes. Specific COVID-19 pandemic training undertaken by MSIR staffEducational material about the virus, including local harm reduction messages, about the importance of hand hygiene, cough etiquette, physical distancing and testing placed throughout all service and office areas. Conversations with clients occurring daily as part of service provision. Ongoing monitoring of adherence to COVID-19 government directivesFacilitating access to temporary accommodation Facilitating access to short-term accommodation through co-located onsite housing officer. Facilitating access to telehealth, including drug treatment services, income support and legal services Promotion of referral options for OAT Providing onsite OAT (i.e. long-acting injectable buprenorphine), and as part of a COVID-19 outreach service for clients in short-term accommodation Mental health support provided by specialist onsite mental health clinicians Advocacy in relation to legal issues arising (e.g. policing of COVID-19 restrictions) through lockdown periods reflecting the substantive difference in levels of community transmission in each jurisdiction over time.Procedural changes often needed to be implemented quickly, with decisions being made daily (sometimes hourly), based on the best available health advice. Communicating these changes, along with information about the virus and reducing transmission risk, has been crucial, as many clients may not regularly engage with other health services.There were several challenges from a client perspective. Client feedback on procedural change, sought in the aftercare area, was incorporated as an important element of adaptation, reflecting one of the fundamental principles (client-centred) of drug treatment provision in Australia more broadly [25] .Firstly, reducing capacity in the registration area meant increased numbers of clients queuing outside. This increased client visibility, in turn increasing the potential for law enforcement intervention. Increased liaison between the SIFs and local police occurred during this time to facilitate greater understanding and ensure that clients could access the service without impediment.In an attempt to reduce unnecessary law enforcement engagement, and to adhere to public health guidelines, staff monitored the entrance to ensure clients were safely distancing.Second, reducing time spent in the aftercare area meant clients were missing opportunities for incidental social interaction. MSIC re-instituted their consumer advisory group (CAG) meetings at the CAG's request. This was to ensure some level of connectedness among clients, while also managing distancing requirements. Aftercare area restrictions also meant reduced opportunity for clientstaff interactions regarding referrals and physical and mental health assessments. Staff were encouraged to be particularly vigilant and proactive in determining client needs.The final challenge relates directly to virus transmission. As at the time of writing, there have been two confirmed COVID-19 cases among MSIR clients (none at MSIC and none among staff ). Provision of COVID-19 testing onsite allowed for rapid detection and response. All procedures (described in Table 1 ) implemented at the MSIR meant that neither case necessitated closure of the service nor quarantine for staff, given none were considered in close contact. Monitoring of client movement throughout the centre was pivotal in contact tracing and facilitating further testing among clients where necessary.Services continue to be monitored and procedures revised as government directives evolve. To the credit of both the MSIC and the MSIR staff, and their clients, these changes have been implemented while in a constant state of flux.This paper shows the adaptability of Australian SIFs in responding to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Both services implemented significant changes to operating procedures to minimise transmission risks for clients and staff, as well as ensure continued provision of a safer supervised injecting space. Changes were implemented immediately following the introduction of national government restrictions in March, and in the absence of clear guidance on what these restrictions meant for local harm reduction services.Such a proactive response was critical to continued service provision at both sites in a way that is consistent with government COVID-19 and public health guidelines. As with any health service, remaining open during this time poses potential risks of transmission for clients and staff. In the case of SIFs, the harm of the potential loss of life from injecting in unsafe/unsupervised environments and the loss of ancillary supports for people who inject drugs means ongoing service provision is important.Physical distancing measures are likely to continue to be required to mitigate the risks of virus transmission [1] . Changes to overdose management may also need to be incorporated into standard operating procedures for the foreseeable future.Important lessons have arisen from the experience of both services during this time. Firstly, one of the key features enabling the MSIC and MSIR to remain open during the pandemic, and to respond to risk appropriately, is that they operate within a clinical model. As such, they had access to the requisite medical supplies (e.g. PPE), albeit with some difficulty at times, enabling them to adjust protocols to continue operations, and to safely and effectively respond to overdose while minimising transmission risks.Arguably there are also limitations to operating within the clinical model, including the limited capacity to provide outreach support for clients who may have been further isolated during the pandemic. Both services worked closely with local outreach teams in an attempt to address this gap in service delivery, with outreach teams extending their services to cover a greater number of clients across a larger geographic area.Second, changes to service entry procedures and the use of PPE among staff appeared to create barriers between staff and clients, highlighting the importance of these relationships. Given the discrimination SIF clients often face in many health settings, it matters how clients are welcomed into these services, as well as the nature of staff-client interactions that occur while they are in the service.Third, the utility of onsite COVID-19 testing at the MSIR was highlighted, with temperature screening providing additional benefits for clients such as identifying untreated septicaemia. The MSIR is likely to continue with these measures beyond the duration of the pandemic.Finally, the reduction in capacity in the aftercare area of both services impacted clients negatively, through reduced social interaction. This has highlighted the role these services play, beyond safe spaces to inject, in providing important opportunities for social connectedness between clients.It has been a worrying time for many frontline AOD services in Australia as they navigate uncertain conditions with respect to the pandemic, and brace for potentially unprecedented demand for drug treatment [1] . This may well exacerbate the already existing unmet treatment demand [26] during a particularly challenging time for many Australians.The continued operation of the MSIC and MSIR during this time has been critical for people who inject drugs in Sydney and Melbourne, and the public health benefits for these groups profound. Preventing substantial loss of life and improving health and wellbeing among these groups has clearly been demonstrated by these services both in Australia and internationally [3, 6] . People who use drugs are often isolated (economically, socially and in their ability to access health services) under normal circumstances, and the pandemic has undoubtedly highlighted this isolation in many different ways.It remains to be seen what longer term impacts COVID-19 and the resulting restrictions will have on illicit drug markets internationally. Any significant changes will have implications for drug use and related harms among people who use drugs [27] . While there are early reports from European countries that some drug use (e.g. cocaine and MDMA use) is declining due to restrictions on the night time economy, there are reports from other countries of substitution of heroin with other substances (including buprenorphine and amphetamines), and increasing reports of amphetamine use in Northern European countries [28] . There are also reports of increased attempts to access OAT in parts of Europe [28] . Indicators in Australia suggest a decline in frequency of injecting among some consumers in the context of declining access to methamphetamine and heroin [29] , with other consumers reporting increases in alcohol and cannabis use [30] .Harm reduction services across North America have been greatly reduced, and some closed to minimise the risk of virus transmission [13, 15, 16] . In addition, opioid overdose deaths have steadily increased during the pandemic, particularly in Canada where they have reportedly increased by 40% after declining in the previous year [13] . Access to supervised consumption services in Canada has been greatly reduced due to restrictions, and often long wait times outside these services [16] . Without access to these services, the likelihood of people injecting alone increases, which in turn increases the risk of fatal overdose [13] . The impact of the pandemic on substance use patterns, onsite drug overdoses and the numbers of clients attending Australian SIFs will be the subject of future analyses.Some of the future challenges for drug using populations are likely to be broader than drug-related harms, and future work assessing these impacts, including the ways in which these populations were engaged (or not) throughout the pandemic, is required. Further economic hardship may be inevitable, particularly as Australia moves into a recession and the current level of economic support provided to these populations is reduced [31] . Likewise, the mental health impacts present a significant challenge, with access to mental health services difficult for these groups [32] .In addition, social interaction has been greatly reduced across the world for these client groups, with many dropin centres across Europe forced to close during the pandemic [14] . Supervised injecting facilities and DCRs worldwide play an important role in client advocacy, particularly in relation to access and equity. This role is likely to gain increasing importance as the longer term impacts of the pandemic emerge.The global COVID-19 pandemic has irrevocably altered the way we all live, and health services have been required to adapt to ever-changing government regulations. The MSIC and MSIR implemented substantial changes to the way they provide services including reducing numbers of clients within the service at any one time, adapting overdose protocols to ensure they could respond as safely as possible, and vastly increasing their capacity to facilitate access to temporary accommodation and OAT services. Both the MSIC and MSIR provide critical services for people who inject drugs and are important conduits to accessing other health and social services. Their continued operation during the pandemic has been essential. If anything is to be learnt from a global health emergency such as COVID-19, it is that we need to provide health care that is readily accessible and responsive to all community members, particularly the most vulnerable in our population.",Australia,abstract,2021-02-17,02
3a1abeae1086ad1fb179d81b4d11ce55b48f6000,Journal Pre-proof Assessing the potential of unmanned aerial vehicle spraying of aqueous ozone as an outdoor disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2,"Since declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020 as a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in >31 million infections and >1 million deaths with the daily number of infections and deaths still remaining very high (https://covid19.who.int). The rapid escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic has in many cases led to ad-hoc large-scale dispersion of chlorine or alcohol-based disinfectants across public areas ( Figure 1 ). Despite recommendations from the WHO that disinfection outdoors is not required (WHO 2020), widespread spraying of public areas has occurred in numerous locations eg China, Russia, India, Philippines and Iran (Nabi, Wang et al. 2020 , Service 2020 . Recent assessments indicate SARS-CoV-2 can remain active on surfaces for up to 28 days (Riddell, Goldie et al. 2020) . High touch areas of partially covered facilities such as sports stadiums and park/playground equipment have been an area of particular concern in many jurisdictions.Outdoor disinfection is largely unregulated and often sits between medical therapeutic regulation of indoor disinfection and agricultural chemical regulation for outdoor settings.The urgency with which outdoor disinfection is often applied frequently limits the possibility of even the most basic environmental and public health risk assessments being conducted.Any proposed widespread spraying of outdoor spaces must consider the potential for secondary adverse impacts alongside the efficacy of outdoor spraying (SanJuan-Reyes, Gómez-Oliván et al. 2021) . The direct exposure to spraying of chlorine as disinfectant during Ebola outbreaks in West Africa led to significant respiratory, skin and eye impacts on J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patients, residents and health workers (Mehtar, Bulabula et al. 2016) . Whilst there have been no quantitative studies to date on the secondary impacts of outdoor disinfection spraying in response to SARS-CoV-2, potential impacts on water quality of natural systems from increased use of chlorine based disinfectants have been highlighted (Chu, Fang et al. 2020 ).Anecdotal evidence from Chongqing, in southwest China suggests wildlife mortality occurred as a result of high intensity outdoor disinfectant application (Yingzi 2020) .Attention has also been recently drawn to the environmental risks of broad scale outdoor disinfection (Nabi, Wang et al. 2020) . Three principal groups of chemical disinfectants are typically used for virus inactivation; alcohol based (>70%), quaternary ammonium and oxidisers (chlorine, hydrogen peroxide or ozone) (Wigginton, Pecson et al. 2012 , Hora, Pati et al. 2020 . Despite safety and health concerns (Gorguner, Aslan et al. 2004 , Medina-Ramón, Zock et al. 2005 ) chlorine bleach at 1000-5000 mg/L continues to be the most commonly used disinfectant product due to its low cost, ease of use, deodorising and efficacy across a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including viruses (Kampf, Todt et al. 2020) . Oxidisers such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide in contrast, offer promise as a safer alternative. Environmental and public health risks are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f alleviated as these oxidisers rapidly convert to oxygen and water without leaving residual toxicity on disinfected surfaces.Ozone gas is routinely used as an effective disinfectant in the medical industry. In uncontrolled outdoor environments, the gaseous phase of ozone is neither practical nor safe due to potential for exposure of operators to harmful concentrations of ozone (>0.1 ppm).Ozone can be dissolved in water to form ozonated water, or 'aqueous ozone', which can deliver a liquid form of ozone to surfaces as a disinfectant. The aqueous form of ozone has been utilised as a disinfectant in wastewater treatment (Von Sonntag and Von Gunten 2012), food and livestock industries (Aslam, Alam et al. 2019) , and as a commercial disinfectant (Martinelli, Giovannangeli et al. 2017) . Studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of aqueous ozone as a hand sanitiser in hospital settings, with improved efficacy and lower secondary impacts (eg skin irritation) compared to traditional alcohol-based sanitisers (Breidablik, Lysebo et al. 2019) . Aqueous ozone can effectively inactivate virus through disrupting the proteins and lipids of the virus spikes (Tizaoui 2020) . However, the instability of aqueous forms of ozone (20-minute half-life) has limited the widespread uptake as a commercial disinfectant. Recent advancements in understanding aqueous ozone chemistry (Eriksson 2005) has led to commercially available ozone generators producing a stabilised form of aqueous ozone, increasing its stability to several hours.The widespread disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic has driven innovation in the utilisation of autonomy, robotics and artificial intelligence across a range of settings (Zeng, Chen et al. 2020) . Numerous jurisdictions globally have re-purposed agricultural spraying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support disinfection efforts in response to COVID-19.To date, this effort has largely been reactionary with little pre-planning, testing or assessment of efficacy. A range of disinfectant solutions (chlorine (1000-5000 ppm), alcohol, hydrogen peroxide) have been utilised alongside early trials of high intensity UV light for indoor J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f applications. However, the lack of systematic testing coupled with significant concerns around public and environmental safety of widespread chlorine bleach spraying, has limited the effectiveness and continuation of these UAV disinfection programs.Using conventional disinfection delivery systems in outdoor areas with complex structures is a major challenge due to health and safety risks to applicators, as well as the logistics of moving large volumes of liquid in confined areas. In addition, where rapid application of disinfectant is required (eg between sporting or entertainment events), this presents a challenge to current manual delivery systems. Furthermore, the scaling of adequate and rapid disinfectant coverage using existing manual delivery systems requires greatly increased person hours. The advent of aerial spraying using UAVs represents a feasible approach to overcome these challenges, as a single system is able to provide rapid coverage within complex outdoor structures.Here we present the first quantitative assessment of the potential of utilising unmanned aerial vehicles to disinfect complex outdoor environments, demonstrating the efficacy of the aqueous form of ozone to inactivate SARS-CoV2 and show its environmental safety in two experimental insect models.This study assessed three core areas; efficiency of spray coverage, environmental and operator safety, and efficacy in inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 using aqueous ozone.A critical component to ensure both effective and efficient UAV based spraying of disinfectant is to assess coverage and drift of spray under different flight conditions. Test strips of 6 m x 5 m 160 gsm geofabric (Grunt Non-Woven Geotextile Membrane, Preston, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Australia) were used to quantify both coverage and density of spray from the UAV (DJI Agras MG-1, Shenzhen, China). Two hundred mL of red food dye (Pillar Box Red Food Colour, Queen, Brisbane, Australia) was added to the 10 L spray tank of water and trials were conducted using flight speeds of 4.7 km/h and 5.8 km/h. Spray heights of 1, 1.7 and 2 m were tested as well as a combination of coarse or mist nozzles either mounted below the motors or on a rigid boom. Following each spray trial a high resolution aerial image was taken from 10 m elevation using a UAV (DJI Mavic 2 Pro, Shenzhen, China). These high resolution images with 3 mm pixel size were georectified (ArcGIS 10.5, ESRI) prior to further analysis.Linear Spectral Unmixing, a sub-pixel classification method was used to calculate the intensity of the spray. The process offers superior results where the feature size is relatively smaller than the pixel size and with limited spectral bands (Kamal and Phinn 2011) . As a result of spectral unmixing, fractional cover maps were generated and a rule-based feature extraction model was applied to identify the concentration of the red dye in each pixel. The fractional images provide endmember-based data with pixel values ranging between 0 -1.Pixels with complete coverage of red dye had high pixel value, whereas the areas with less or no spray will provide values close to zero. The areas were then divided into the four distinctive spread classes of high, moderate, low and no spread ( Figure 2 ).The stability of dissolved ozone in four solutions were assessed: Brisbane municipal tap water pH=7.4; Brisbane municipal tap water filtered through a cation exchange resin (Tersano SAO-24, referred here as Municipal-Tersano) pH=3.2; deionised water pH=7.1; and deionised water filtered through a cation exchange resin (Tersano SAO-24, referred here as Deionised-Tersano), pH=3.1. Five liters of each solution was ozonated for 10 min by recirculating through an industrial ozone generator (Grenof, Brisbane, Australia). The ozone J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f generator uses corona discharge to produce 5 g/h of ozone which is introduced into the water flow via a venturi injector nozzle. Dissolved ozone concentrations were monitored using a Cronos Ozosense Analyser (Process Instruments, Burnley, UK) every 10 min for the first 4 h and every 30 min for the following 4 h.Cell line and virus isolates: Vero E6, African green monkey kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37 ºC with 5% CO 2 . Two different isolates of SARS-CoV-2, QLD02(GISAID accession EPI_ISL_407896) and QLD935 (GISAID accession EPI_ISL_436097) were obtained from the Queensland Department of Health as passage 2 in Vero E6 cells and passaged once more in Vero E6 cells to generate virus stocks. The virus titres were then determined by immuno-plaque assay (iPA) as described below.Virucidal activity assay: viral isolates, each with an estimated 1-5x10 5 foci forming units (FFU)/mL, were prepared in 1.8% NaCl solution in deionised and filtered water (pH=6.0). Operator safety is a key consideration for any disinfection operation, therefore a field test was undertaken to examine atmospheric ozone levels during UAV spraying operations. The Australian occupational limit for atmospheric ozone over an 8 h period is 0.1 ppm and it is important to ensure pilots as well as support crew are not exposed to atmospheric ozone J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f levels above this limit during aerial spraying operations. An atmospheric ozone logger (Aeroqual Inc., Series 500 -Portable Ozone Monitor) was placed 20 cm above ground level directly in the spray zone to capture the likely maximum atmospheric ozone levels during spray operations. Spray tests using 1.5 mg/L aqueous ozone were undertaken on 20th May 2020 at a spray height 2 m above the ground with a spray duration of 2 min to maximise local atmospheric ozone levels. Ozone is highly unstable in the dissolved phase in water, which is dependent on pH, temperature and presence of metal ions and other impurities (Eriksson 2005) . We assessed Municipal water (dark blue, circle), deionised water (red, square), municipal water prefiltered through Tersano cation exchange resin (purple, circle), deionised water pre-filtered through Tersano cation exchange resin (green, triangle).The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 provides an ideal example to use aqueous ozone as a disinfectant. Two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV2; an early Australian isolate QLD02 sampled from a patient on 30/01/2020, and the more recent isolate QLD935 sampled from a patient on 25/03/2020 were tested here for inactivation by aqueous ozone. QLD935 isolate represents the currently dominating virus isolate with a characteristic D614G mutation in a Spike protein which potentially increases virus infectivity (Korber, Fischer et al. 2020) . Both viral isolates were efficiently inactivated by as little as 5 minutes incubation with 1.5 mg/L and 0.75 mg/L of aqueous ozone with more than 1.7 log 10 reduction ( Figure 4A ). Thirty minutes incubation produced similar results for these ozone concentrations with complete inactivation of both virus isolates ( Figure 4B ). In fact, no virus was detected at all in treatments with these ozone concentrations with the limit of detection being 2.9 log 10 FFU/ml (400 FFU/ml). Further reduction in ozone concentration to 0.375 mg/L decreased efficiency of inactivation (Figure 4) , however, we still observed inactivation of 91.5% (1.07 log 10 ) for QLD02 isolate 82% (0.74 log 10 ) for QLD935 virus isolate after 5 min incubation ( Figure 4A ), or 92% (1.09 log 10 ) for QLD02 virus isolate and 84.5% (0.81 log 10 ) of QLD935 virus isolate after 30 min incubation ( Figure 4B ). based on the mean log 10 reduction (L) was calculated using the formula: P= (1-10 -L ) x 100.The safety of UAV operators was assessed by comparing background ozone levels to insitu ozone sensors within spraying operation. Ambient ozone levels at the nearby (less than 7 km) Southport air quality monitoring station (https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/air-quality/) ranged between 0.002 to 0.04 ppm over the duration of the sampling month ( Figure 5A ). Local measurements from the spray area showed background levels to be 0.015 ppm immediately prior to testing ( Figure 5B ). The highest reading recorded during spraying of stabilised aqueous ozone was 0.026 ppm within the spray zone ( Figure 5B ). Monitoring of atmospheric ozone levels 5 m downwind from the spray zone showed concentrations similar to background levels of 0.015 ppm. Based on these initial findings, the atmospheric exposure to ozone during spraying is unlikely to be a health concern for operators as the observed levels all lay within the range for background ambient levels.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Environmental safety is an important consideration for disinfection operations. We evaluated the potential effect of aqueous ozone and other disinfectants on the survivorship of larvae of the worldwide crucifer crop pest, the diamondback moth, and adults of its parasitoid, D. semiclausum, which has been widely introduced for biological control of the pest (Furlong, Wright et al. 2013) . Parasitoids are typically far more sensitive to insecticides and other xenobiotic chemicals than their insect hosts (Devine and Furlong 2007, Kim, Lee et al. 2019 ) and as such their responses can serve as important bio-indicators of xenobiotic compounds in the environment (Furlong, Zu-Hua et al. 2004 ) Bleach and hydrogen peroxide significantly affected the survival of diamondback moth larvae ( Figure unintended consequences on the environment in some instances (Nabi, Wang et al. 2020) , and a placebo effect or ""disinfection theatre"" in others (Lowe 2020).As the pandemic transitions to local community transmission, developing effective yet safe disinfection protocols will be critical to enable large scale outdoor events to proceed safely.Examples from Italy have demonstrated that high density community events, such as sporting matches, can lead to rapid escalation of community transmission and are a critical gap in knowledge (Sassano, McKee et al. 2020) . The complexity and scale of surfaces in sporting stadiums and the short turn around between events limits the potential of targeted manual disinfection of high touch surfaces. Recent work demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 may remain active on surfaces for up to 28 days highlights the need to investigate new approaches for disinfection (Riddell, Goldie et al. 2020) . Aerial spraying of traditional disinfectants (eg chlorine bleach) introduces too many environmental and human health risks to make it a viable option in reducing COVID-19 transmission risk. The potential of ultraviolet (UV) radiation has recently been demonstrated as a cost-effective sterilizing method for SARS-CoV-2 (Bianco, Biasin et al. 2020) , however the integration of high energy UV systems on aerial platforms is less developed than spraying systems. Aqueous ozone may provide the ideal balance between efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety to be utilised at scale for disinfection control of large community gatherings. Recent studies showed effectiveness of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ozone spraying in the inactivation of aerosolized airborne viruses (Dubuis, Dumont-Leblond et al. 2020) indicating that in addition to intended inactivation of SARS-CoV-2-contaminated surfaces aqueous ozone spraying may also aid in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 potentially remaining in the air after large community gatherings such as sporting events.Although aqueous ozone has been utilised in limited health care settings, uptake across the cleaning and disinfection industry has been limited by a number of factors including stability of ozone in solution, presence of ozone-consuming compounds such as organic substances, and of by-products from ozone action on organic compounds (Khadre, Yousef et al. 2001 ). In our experiments, deionised and filtered water showed the best performance in providing extended ozone solubility and stability. The highest antiviral activity also required virus dilution in NaCl solution prepared in deionised and filtered water. Virus preparations in other solutions, such as complete cell culture media with or without foetal bovine serum were inactivated less efficiently (data not shown). Whether these factors could potentially reduce the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by aqueous ozone spraying in the settings of large community gatherings remains to be determined. Field trials of aqueous ozone spraying in large stadiums using model microbial organisms as the readout will provide highly valuable data to further assess the potential of aqueous ozone as an effective disinfectant.Background levels of exposure to high atmospheric ozone and particulate matter concentrations have been linked to increased transmission and severity of COVID-19 (Fattorini and Regoli 2020 , Zhu, Xie et al. 2020 , Bontempi 2020a , Bontempi 2020b . The low atmospheric concentrations of ozone released during outdoor spraying indicates these broader relationships between ozone pollution and transmission and severity of COVID-19 will not be influenced by disinfection spraying. Despite the human health risks associated with ozone exposure (Ito, Inoue et al. 2005 , Wang, Wild et al. 2020 , our field trials suggest aqueous ozone sprayed in outdoor settings maintains atmospheric concentrations below regulatory levels, thus ensuring operator safety.

966d4bfa80e2d8c50613558a099b0f940cddf331,Comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 Patients: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"now seven coronaviruses known to infect humans (3) (4) (5) . First identified in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has since spread rapidly around the globe with over 210 countries and territories reporting infections. The global new COVID-19 cases and deaths are soaring. Increasing numbers of cases and deaths are being reported weekly since early October 2020. The numbers peaked in the second week of November 2020 with almost 4 million new cases and 60,000 new deaths recorded. As of 13 December 2020, SARS-CoV-2 is known to have infected over 70.4 million individuals with more than 1.5 million associated deaths reported (6) . Fortunately, through a global effort, COVID-19 vaccines are now entering the market to slow the spread of COVID-19, with the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna both reporting greater than 94% efficacy in clinical trials (7) . The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for use in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom, and priority is being given to people over 80 years of age and health care workers (8) . On 18 December 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for Moderna's vaccine (7, 9, 10) . However, caution is still warranted, as it is still unknown whether these vaccines will provide long-term protection.There are multiple risk factors that are associated with COVID-19. For example, the male population has a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to females (11, 12) . Studies have shown that a higher incidence of severe and fatal COVID-19 is observed with increasing age (13) , and it is speculated that this phenomenon is partly attributed to preexisting comorbid conditions (14) . To date, there are several systematic reviews being published regarding the effect of comorbidities on prognosis of COVID-19 patients. However, much of the previous data analysis is limited by factors such as incomplete prevalence reporting due to the use of non-peer reviewed data and only using data from China (15, 16) . This limits the conclusions that can be drawn from these early studies, particularly given the global reach of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.As the pandemic has progressed, an increasing amount of clinical data has been made available from around the world. The aim of this study is to present an updated systematic review on the influence of comorbidities on the exacerbation of COVID-19.Here we analyze the most recent data available in the literature to gain better insights into the development of COVID-19 and severe forms of the disease resulting in death to aid the development of strategies to better manage SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.Study selection. A total of 4,266 articles were identified using the search strategy employed in MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases. A total number of 3,143 duplicates and irrelevant articles were removed, bringing the number of articles screened for title and abstract to 1,123. Subsequently, 778 articles were excluded after title and abstract screening, resulting in 345 studies which were subjected to fulltext screening. Fifty-three studies matched our predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies included a total number of 375,859 participants from 14 countries, namely, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Italy, Mexico, Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Uganda, United Kingdom, and United States (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).Among the selected articles, two articles specifically studied adult patients (17, 18) , while three articles focused on pediatric patients (19) (20) (21) . The remaining 49 articles did not impose any age limitations in their respective studies. However, despite SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients, these studies did not identify positive samples in patients with a mean age of ,18 years, which aligns with previous observations suggesting age plays a role in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection (13, 14, 22, 23) . The three most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension, obesity, and diabetes amounting to 80,093 (21.3%), 68,935 (18.3%), and 67,954 (18.1%) patients, respectively. The comorbidities were reported as defined, respectively, from extracted studies.Clinical outcomes reported in study participants included mortality, severe disease, hospitalization, length of hospitalization, the need for intubation, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In one study, the final clinical outcome of patients was not reported (24) .The majority of studies included in the analysis did not report the status of the comorbidities in patients. Two articles investigated the role of cancer in COVID-19 patients. One study included 12 participants of which 7 had received anticancer treatments a month prior to the study (25) , while in another Italian cohort, active cancer independently predicted mortality in COVID-19 patients (26) . Chronic kidney disease stage was reported in two studies (27, 28) , and later disease stages were not associated with a worse prognosis in study participants from Iran (27) , while the effect of higher chronic kidney disease states on prognosis was not evaluated in a Spanish study (28) . In a cohort of COVID-19 patients with chronic kidney and end-stage renal diseases, only the former was reported as an independent predictor of the requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) level care (29) .One study categorized obese participants into two groups, having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 40 kg/m 2 or BMI of $40 kg/m 2 . Having a BMI above 40 kg/m 2 and being younger than 50 years was independently associated with mortality (30) . A study by Docherty et al. (31) grouped diabetic patients into those with and without complications. However, the individual effect of each of the groups on patient outcome was not reported. None of the studies included in the analysis evaluated the role of antidiabetic therapy on SARS-CoV-2 outcome in patients.Mortality. Thirty studies reported mortality as a clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients (17, 18, (26) (27) (28) . Independent risk factors for mortality were reported in 22 studies, and these risk factors included hypertension, obesity, diabetes, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neurological disease, and cardiovascular disease (18, 26, 30-37, 40, 42-52) . Eight studies were selected for meta-analysis of cancer (36, 39) , chronic kidney diseases (26, 28, 39) , diabetes (26, 28, 32, 53) , hypertension (26, 32, 53) , and obesity (28, 37) as comorbidities. Meta-analysis results for comorbidities in which three or more studies were included in the analysis are shown in Fig. 1 and 2 . By virtue of having larger sample sizes, we believe meta-analysis results for diabetes and hypertension are more reliable.The overall natural logarithm of odds ratio (log.OR) of mortality in cancer patients was 0.49 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.01 to 0.97), which translates to an OR of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.00). The results indicate a significant 63% increased odds of COVID-19-related mortality in patients with cancer.The overall natural logarithm of hazard ratio (log.HR) of mortality in patients with FIG 1 Log hazards ratios of COVID-19-related mortality in patients with diabetes. Log.HR was calculated from four independent studies (Wu et al. [53] , Ciceri et al. [26] , Portoles et al. [28] , and Chachkhiani et al. [32] ). N is the study size, n is the number of participants with comorbidity, and Log.HR is the natural logarithm of hazard ratio. (Fig. 1) . The results indicate a significant 94% increased hazard of COVID-19-related mortality in patients with diabetes.The overall log.HR of mortality among patients with hypertension and nonhypertensive patients was log.HR 0.8 (95% CI, 0.40 to 1.10) (Fig. 2) , which translates to a HR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.50 to 2.90). The results imply that the hazard of COVID-19 mortality was increased 2.1 times in patients with hypertension, indicating a significant effect on mortality in COVID-19 patients.The overall log.HR of COVID-19 mortality among obese patients was 0.45 (95% CI, 20.03 to 0.94) which translates to an HR of 1.58 (95% CI, 0.96 to 2.57). The results indicate a nonsignificant 58% increased hazard of COVID-19 mortality in patients with obesity. Overall, there was low heterogeneity in all meta-analyses, which implied that performing a random-effects meta-analysis was unnecessary.Severe disease. Ten studies reported severe disease as an outcome in COVID-19 patients (19, (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) . The definition of severe disease, however, varied among studies. Independent predictors of severe infection were described in three studies, and these predictors included neurological disease, neoplastic disease, arterial hypertension (59), obesity (55) , and diabetes mellitus (57) . One study reporting severe disease as an outcome specifically targeted pediatric patients with a median age of 16 years and a total of 407 patients. Critical illness was linked with increasing age, longer duration of symptoms, and lower oxygen saturation on presentation. Twenty-four of the children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 19 of them required hospitalization. Of those 19 patients, 7 were critically ill, with 4 requiring intubations. Comorbidities were present in two out of the four intubated patients, and one of them died from a sudden cardiac arrest (19) .Severe outcome. A composite severe outcome in COVID-19 patients was reported in three studies (25, 63, 64) . Of the three studies, only cancer with an OR of 6.51 (95% CI, 1.72 to 24.64; P = 0.006) was reported as an independent risk factor for a severe outcome in a study with participants from China (25) . In a Spanish cohort of 456 SARS-CoV-2-positive rheumatic and nonrheumatic patients, connective tissue disorder with an OR of 1.64 (95% CI, 1.02 to 2.66; P = 0.042), obesity with an OR of 1.78 (95% CI, 1.13 to 2.81; P = 0.013), diabetes with an OR of 1.81 (95% CI, 1.11 to 2.95; P = 0.018), hypertension with an OR of 2.60 (95% CI, 1.72 to 3.94; P , 0.001), heart failure with an OR of FIG 2 Log hazards ratios of COVID-19-related mortality in patients with hypertension. Log.HR was calculated from three independent studies (Wu et al. [53] , Ciceri et al. [26] , and Chachkhiani et al. [32] ). N is the study size, n is the number of participants with comorbidity, and Log.HR is the natural logarithm of hazard ratio.3.49 (95% CI, 2.21 to 5.51; P , 0.001), and lung disease with an OR of 2.15 (95% CI, 1.34 to 3.45; P = 0.001) could be reported as risk factors for a severe outcome only in bivariate analysis.Hospitalization. Hospitalization as an outcome was reported in nine studies (21, 48, 51, (65) (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) . The criteria for hospitalization are expected to vary in different countries and studies. Factors independently predicting hospitalization were identified in five studies (48, 51, (66) (67) (68) , and commonly identified comorbidities included diabetes, chronic kidney diseases, obesity, smoking, and COPD. In a study by van Gerwen et al. (51) , diabetes was associated with an increased risk of mechanical ventilation with an OR of 1.35 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.69) in hospitalized patients, and an observational longitudinal study of COVID-19 patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases identified the presence of a systemic autoimmune condition (OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.30 to 9.67; P = 0.01) as a risk factor for hospitalization (66) . Although the immunosuppressant medication for autoimmune patients may predispose patients to severe disease, rheumatic patients enrolled in the study were mostly elderly and presented with comorbidities (66) . Despite a 14% prevalence of asthma in one study, the comorbidity was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with a relative risk of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.19; P = 0.71) (65). In a cohort of COVID-19 patients from metropolitan Detroit (MI, USA), severe obesity with an OR of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.6; P = 0.02) and chronic kidney disease with an OR of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.3; P = 0.006) were independently associated with intensive care stay in hospitalized patients (29) . Additionally, severe obesity with an OR of 3.2 (95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0; P , 0.001), chronic kidney disease with an OR of 2.4 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.2; P = 0.001), and cancer with an OR of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 5.0; P = 0.01) were independently associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (29) .In a cohort of COVID-19 patients with neurological complaints, altered mental status was identified as an independent predictor of prolonged hospital stay with an OR of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5; P = 0.01) and the requirement for intubation with an OR of 4.9 (95% CI, 2.6 to 9.4; P , 0.0001) (32) .The association between comorbidities and their role in the exacerbation of COVID-19 in patients leading to death is evaluated in this study, using published results from large cohort data from across the globe. Our study identified hypertension as the most common comorbidity in COVID-19 patients followed by obesity and diabetes. This partially resonates with earlier publications on the clinical characteristic and frequency of comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients where circulatory disease (including hypertension and coronary artery diseases) was reported to be the highest (71) (72) (73) . In the meta-analysis, we demonstrated that chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were associated with COVID-19 mortality. The latter two are among the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients and were associated with a higher risk of fatality and often coexist as multiple comorbidities along with obesity (51). In patients with chronic kidney disease, the risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients appears higher in cases with end-stage renal disease compared to chronic renal disease (50) . However, in one study, only chronic kidney disease was associated with the requirement of ICU level care in COVID-19 patients (29) . Recently, a study reported a staggering 49% of cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients (74) . COVID-19 is associated with increased clot strength, platelet fibrinogen contribution to clot strength, elevated D-dimer levels, and hyperfibrinogenemia (75) . Hence, the association of severe outcomes in patients with hypertension and diabetes may be partially explained by the increased incidence of thrombotic complications as it is already established that patients with hypertension and diabetes have elevated risk of thrombotic events (76, 77) .Further investigation to explain the higher prevalence of reported comorbidities in COVID-19 patients may focus on the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanism. Similarly to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor with a higher binding affinity compared to SARS-CoV-1 (78) . ACE2 receptor is commonly identified in the epithelial cells of the lungs, intestine, kidney, and blood vessel (79) . Diabetic patients are frequently prescribed with thiazolidinedione, a type of oral hypoglycemic used to lower blood glucose level. Thiazolidinedione is reported to increase the expression of ACE2 (80) . ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are also frequently used as a treatment strategy to treat diabetes and hypertension (81) . Consequently, increased expression of ACE2 may promote the internalization of SARS-CoV-2, which in turn may increase the chances of developing COVID-19 or a severe form of the disease. However, despite clear evidence that ACE2 is the main receptor for COVID-19 (82) , several studies have encouraged the continued use of ACE-I and ARB medications in patients with diabetes or circulatory diseases as use of these medications is not associated with severe COVID-19 and may even be beneficial in reducing disease severity in these patients (57, 60, 83, 84) .Chronic medical conditions, similar to infectious diseases, often present with inflammation and weakened innate immune responses in affected individuals. This may predispose those individuals to infections and disease complications (15) . The high prevalence of fatal cases among COVID-19 patients with hypertension and diabetes as comorbidity could be due to the induction of cytokine storm. Cytokine storms resulting in hyperinflammation are the hallmarks of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (85) . Besides participating in host defenses against infectious agents, inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of many chronic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (86) . Inflammation is therefore regarded as a link between pathogens and chronic disorders. Metabolic inflammation as a consequence of hypertension and diabetes is also known to compromise the immune system, thereby weakening the host's ability to fend off infections. Hypertension and diabetic patients are commonly reported to have weakened immunological function arising from reduced macrophage and lymphocyte activity which could predispose individuals to infections, especially those infections for which cell-mediated immunity constitute an important host defense (87) . Similarly, the use of immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer in patients also suffer from weakened immunological functions. This may explain the increased risk of hospitalization observed in these patients particularly in those that are critically ill (66, 88) . Thus, patients with an underlying comorbidity, particularly cancer, hypertension, and diabetes, face a higher risk of mortality as evidenced by our findings.Obesity was not identified as an independent predictor of mortality in our metaanalysis. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since only two studies were included in the analysis. Obesity is unanimously accepted to be a common morbidity among critically ill patients, including its association with increased mortality (89) (90) (91) (92) . Unlike diabetes and hypertension, obesity does not directly influence the expression of ACE2. Rather, obese patients have a larger amount of ACE2expressing adipose tissue in the body which indirectly results in an increased amount of ACE2-expressing cells (93) . Other factors put forward to explain COVID-19 severity in obese individuals include abnormal cytokine and complement production leading to the reduction in the activity processes that inhibits acute inflammation (94, 95) . Increased risk of blood clotting due to obesity has also been proposed to play a role (95, 96) . Prolonged viral shedding is also associated with obesity in SARS-CoV-2infected patients, which may also contribute to COVID-19 aggravation leading to mortality (97) . Moreover, managing obese patients requiring intensive care presents with practical difficulties (which affect prognosis) such as the need for bariatric beds, challenging intubations, weight limitations on imaging machines impacting imaging diagnosis and the fact that obese patients are more inclined to take prone positions promoting ventilatory dysfunction (98) .There are several limitations to our findings. Our search obtained non-English articles which were excluded. In addition, many studies failed to report bivariate analysis for the investigated comorbidities leading to only eight included studies in the meta-analysis. It should also be noted that patients with chronic kidney diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer are already at increased risk of mortality in the absence of COVID-19 (99) (100) (101) (102) . These limitations may contribute to the overestimation or underestimation of comorbidity and its role in the exacerbation of SARS-CoV-2 leading to fatal outcomes. We attempted to but may not have fully controlled for heterogeneity which may introduce bias into our findings, as patients included in our study are of various ages, ethnicities, and living conditions among other factors. Furthermore, some studies failed to report the type of intervention applied, such as the type of medication prescribed to affected patients, which could lead to a various number of reported casualties. In this study, data also suggested that several patients had more than one comorbidity but did not confirm whether the risk increased with the number of comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 is claiming more lives daily, and the number of cases is still increasing. From our data, patients with comorbidities should be given prompt care to avoid complications.Our study identifies hypertension to have the highest prevalence as a comorbidity in COVID-19 patients. Patients with chronic kidney diseases appear to face a higher risk of fatality while hypertension, diabetes, and cancer are found to significantly exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 in patients resulting in death. Evidence presented in this study will help to determine high-risk COVID-19 patients so that appropriate measures can be taken to mitigate the number of fatalities in the COVID-19 pandemic. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used in this review (103) . This study aims to report the influence of comorbidities and its role in exacerbation of COVID-19 leading to fatality in infected patients.Ethical approval. Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee (HSREC) (ethics number UFS-HSD2020/1150/2807/-0001) at the University of the Free State.Search strategy. The MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published from 1 December 2019 to 15 September 2020. The search strategy employed was as follows: (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) AND (underlying or comorbid* or comorbid*) AND (prognos* or outcome*). The search was restricted to include only articles printed in English.Study selection. Study selection was conducted by authors, W.H.N. and T.T. independently. Identified articles were pooled together, and duplicates and irrelevant articles were removed (Fig. 3) . The titles and abstracts of the studies were then screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria below.Inclusion criteria 1. Only studies reporting comorbidities and patient's outcome were included. 2. Only peer-reviewed journals were included. Exclusion criteria 1. Literature and/or systematic reviews, letters, comments, case reports, and family-based studies were excluded.2. Articles not reporting SARS-CoV-2 infections were excluded. 3. Studies not reporting the nature of comorbidity, hospital names, or regions from which study participants were drawn and the period for which the study was conducted were excluded.Data extraction. A data extraction form was developed in MS-Excel, and data were extracted independently by T.T. The data extracted was subjected to screening by W.H.N. and unanimity was reached on disputes after discussion. A third author was not involved, as there were no major disputes in study selection. Data extracted in this study, when available, included the title, published year, number of participants, country, patient's age and gender, identified comorbidities, and the percentage of infected patients, type of intervention, study type, and patient outcome. In cases of studies with overlapping participants, the study with the longest sampling period was selected.Statistical analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted using pooled studies which reported bivariate analysis. The study aims to identify the association of comorbidity and its exacerbation of the outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients resulting in death. Therefore, univariate analysis is not applicable, as it does not deal with the association. The models used for multivariate analysis, on the other hand, vary greatly in terms of the parameters used to justify its inclusion. Statistical analysis was performed using R, version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to account for between-and within-study differences across studies in the meta-analysis. For each random-effects meta-analysis, relative weight, based on the within-and between-study variances was applied. Heterogeneity was assessed based on two approaches, a scale with cutoffs at 25%, 50%, and 75% for low, intermediate, and high inconsistency, respectively, among the study findings, and level of statistical significance, where P , 0.05 shows that the true effects vary (104) . A nonsignificant P value for heterogeneity implies weakness in the effect sizes but could also be related to the sample sizes across the studies analyzed. Results from the meta-analysis were summarized into either natural logarithm of odds ratio (log.OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) or natural logarithm of hazard ratio (log.HR) and 95% CI depending on the outcome considered.Supplemental material is available online only.

64f28ac669a8ba1694a0728ec4b0011473bbf310,"Title Mental Health, Substance Use, and Suicidal Ideation Among Unpaid Caregivers in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Relationships to Age, Race/Ethnicity, Employment, and Caregiver Intensity Corresponding Author","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with mental health challenges related to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease and its mitigation. Early studies have documented elevated levels of adverse mental health symptoms in the United States 1,2 and around the globe 3,4 compared with previous years. Young adults and unpaid caregivers for adults (caregivers) are among highly affected populations.A pre-pandemic meta-analysis found that caregivers, who perform activities such as assisting others with activities of daily living and medical tasks, experienced higher levels of depression and perceived stress and lower levels of general well-being than non-caregivers. 5 Subsequent studies have characterized an association between subjective caregiver burden and depressive symptoms, 6 which in some cases limited provision of care. 7 During June 2020, caregivers reported significantly higher prevalence of adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms than non-caregivers, including symptoms of an anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, or COVID-19-related trauma-and stressor-related disorder (TSRD), having started or increased substance use to cope with the pandemic, and suicidal ideation. 1 A study of 1,459 paediatric and adult brain tumour patients and 530 caregivers in 33 countries found that caregivers were significantly more anxious than patients, and 42.8% of caregivers felt that their caregiver burden has significantly increased during the pandemic. 8 Caregivers represent a significant demographic in the United States. In 2020, the prepandemic estimated prevalence of caregivers was 19.2% of adults aged ≥ 18 years, or 47.9 million Americans. 9 This estimate represents an increase in caregivers of more than eight million 6 compared to 2015. 10 Some people may have taken up unplanned caregiving roles during the pandemic due to mobility restrictions related to community mitigation activities designed to reduce potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for older adults. Moreover, others who were providing care before the pandemic may have faced barriers and disruptions to their routines and livelihood. Both scenarios require caregivers to make sacrifices to care for others during a time when their own lives may have been disrupted.Addressing the needs of the disproportionately affected population of caregivers is critically important for the health and well-being of caregivers and the persons for whom they provide care. To effectively address these needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and afterwards, studies are needed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of caregivers, and to identify stressors that may be targets for support systems and prevention and intervention efforts. This study aims to estimate the prevalence and characteristics of US caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to evaluate factors associated with differences in mental and behavioural health symptoms.Ineligible respondents who did not meet inclusion criteria (e.g., age <18 years, not a US resident) or exceeded set quotas (i.e., maximum demographic characteristic quota already met) were not empanelled in the survey.The survey instruments included individual questions, validated questionnaires, and COVID-19-specific questionnaires used to assess respondent attitudes, behaviours, and beliefs related to COVID-19 and its mitigation, along with mental and behavioural health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.Demographic variables included gender, categorized age, combined race/ethnicity, disability status, marital status, household occupancy, 2019 household income, US Census region, urban/rural classification using self-reported ZIP codes, employment status, and, among employed respondents, self-identified essential worker status and weekly paid work hours.Questionnaire (PHQ-4), a clinically validated screening instrument. 11 Symptoms of COVID-19related trauma-and stressor-related disorder (COVID-19 TSRD) were assessed via the six-item Impact of Event Scale (IES-6) to screen for overlapping symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder (ASD), and adjustment disorders (ADs). 12 Respondents also reported whether they had started or increased substance use, (e.g., alcohol, drugs) to cope with stress or emotions related to COVID-19, or if they had seriously considered trying to kill themselves in the prior 30 days. See appendix (pp 1-2) for additional details.All surveys underwent Qualtrics, LLC standard data quality screening procedures, and a secondary cleaning conducted by the investigators; see appendix (p 2). Respondents who failed an attention or speed check, along with any responses that failed data quality screening procedures, were excluded from the analysis.Iterative proportional fitting and weight trimming (0.3≤weight≤3.0) were employed to improve the cross-sectional sample representativeness of the 2010 US population by age, gender, and combined race/ethnicity (appendix p 2). The statistical analyses were completed in four phases. The first phase included bivariate analyses and described demographic characteristics of caregivers and non-caregivers, as well as mental and behavioural health, overall and by demographic variables, among caregivers and non-caregivers. The second phase described mental and behavioural health symptoms among caregivers, overall and by both demographic variables and caregiving characteristics. For comparisons between (demographics, group prevalences of adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms) and among (prevalences of adverse mental or behavioural health symptoms by demographics) caregivers and noncaregivers, Rao-Scott adjusted Pearson chi-squared tests were used to test for differences in observed and expected frequencies among groups by characteristic with a Bonferroni adjustment and evaluated at a significance level of α = 0.05. The third phase included adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms among caregivers estimated using Poisson regressions with robust standard errors evaluated at a significance level of α = 0.05. Finally, in the fourth phase, non-parametric Spearman correlations were calculated between individual CII items and mental and behavioural health measures to assess the relative association of each item with adverse mental and behavioural health. All statistical analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.7.8; Python Software Foundation) and using R software (version 4.0.2; The R Foundation) with the R survey package (version 3.29).Of 9,896 eligible invited adults (Table 1) . There was not a significant difference in caregiver status by gender or 2019 household income, though compared to non-caregivers, caregivers were significantly more commonly of young age (e.g., 18-24 years=26.6% vs 8.0%, respectively, group p<0.0001) and either Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (Black=18.8% vs 9.7%; Hispanic=29.0% vs 11.6%, group p<0.0001). White respondents accounted for 44.5% of caregivers and 70.8% of non-caregivers.Caregivers also more commonly reported living with a disability than not (37.9% vs 17.0%, p<0.0001), and, among employed caregivers, essential than nonessential worker status (73.7% vs 47.8%, p<0.0001) ( Table 1) .Among caregivers, adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms were most prevalent among those aged 18-24 years (e.g., at least one symptom, vs those aged ≥ 65 years; 88.5% vs 18.8%, group p<0.0001), and were more prevalent among Black and Hispanic caregivers than White caregivers (80.2% and 89.4%, respectively, vs 53.4%, group p<0.0001) and among those with than those without disabilities (85.8% vs 59.8%, p<0.0001) ( Table 2 ). There were also differences by employment status, as caregivers who were employed (76.1%) or students (79.0%) had higher prevalences of adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms than those who were retired (29.9%) or unemployed (59.3%) (group p<0.0001). Among employed caregivers, adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms were more common among essential than nonessential workers (81.6% vs 60.6%, p<0.0001), and were most prevalent among those who worked >60 hours in the previous week and decreased with weekly work hours (e.g., vs those who worked ≤ 20 hours; 96.9% vs 59.3%, group p<0.0001). There were also differences by caregiving characteristics; 93.0% of 126 caregivers providing care to multiple types of relationships reported adverse mental or behavioural health symptoms, compared with 55.6% of 261 caregivers providing care for a parent or parent-in-law (group p<0.0001).Similarly, 89.0% of 370 who had been providing care for 4-6 months, compared with 44.7% of 199 caregivers who had been providing care for more than 12 months (group p<0.0001) ( Table   4 ). There were also difference by CII score; 91.1% of 335 caregivers with high CII scores reported at least one adverse mental or behavioural health symptom, compared with 20.7% of 31 caregivers with low CII scores (group p<0.0001).Both caregivers and non-caregivers who were young, Black, Hispanic, living with disabilities, essential workers, and working long hours had disproportionately high levels of adverse mental health, consistent with findings during the pandemic. [13] [14] [15] [16] However, caregivers more commonly identified as members of these at-risk populations than non-caregivers, with more than twothirds (928 [68.1%]) of caregivers aged below 45 years, more than half (756 [55.5%]) non-White, more than one-third living with disabilities (516 [37.9%]), and nearly three-quarters of caregivers employed as essential workers (751 of 1,018 [73.7%]), adding additional potential stressors to their caregiving responsibilities. Long work hours, which were also common among employed caregivers, are associated with increased odds of adverse health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and impaired sleep, 17 an effect that may be exacerbated by caregiving responsibilities outside of work. Committing long hours to paid work and unpaid care limits opportunities for core elements of health, including sleeping, exercising, eating, socializing, and medical care. Among caregivers, those who provide care for more hours and those who had been caregiving for fewer than 12 months had higher prevalences of adverse mental health symptoms, which may reflect stressors from being forced into a caregiving role, starting as a caregiver during the pandemic, or survival bias, whereby those who are still providing care after 12 months are more resilient to stressors associated with the role.The findings in this report reveal that unpaid caregiving for adults is common, has likely increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is represented broadly across demographics.",Australia,first author,2021-02-05,02
63df163a37acb27256a44c19078138c77c56654c,Estimating the Failure Risk of Hotel-based Quarantine for Preventing COVID-19 Outbreaks in Australia and New Zealand,"New Zealand and Australian states have successfully eliminated community transmission of the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, 1 albeit with occasional outbreaks from imported cases that have been quickly brought under control. These two countries have mostly used hotel-based quarantine for citizens returning to their countries during the pandemic period. This process is typically 14 days of quarantine combined with PCR testing and mask use in any areas involving shared space (eg, exercise areas).Converting hotels for quarantine purposes has the advantage of making use of a resource that would otherwise be underused during a pandemic, given declines in international tourism. However, the major disadvantage of hotel-based quarantine is that it is likely to be less effective than purpose-built quarantine facilities owing to shared spaces and lack of proper ventilation (as per WHO advice on air flow 2 ). Moreover, the consequences of leakage of the virus out of quarantine (eg, through facility workers) may be more severe given higher population density in urban settings where the hotels are based. Given these issues, we aimed to estimate the failure risk of hotel-based quarantine in New Zealand and Australia in terms of the spread of COVID-19 infection into the community.We searched official websites in both countries, and for the eight states and territories in Australia, to identify outbreaks and border control failures associated with hotel quarantine (searches conducted between 6 January and 12 February 2021). Where an outbreak source was uncertain (eg, the Auckland, New Zealand, August 2020 outbreak) we used the best available evidence to classify it as a hotel quarantine failure or not. We used two denominators: a) the estimated number of travelers who went through these facilities during the 2020 year up to 31 January 2021 ; and b) the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive people who went through these facilities in this same time period. The unit of analyses were New Zealand, the eight Australian states and territories, and both countries combined.For New Zealand, we used official data on both travelers going through the hotel quarantine system 3 along with official (Ministry of Health) data on SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, 4 although there are some discrepancies in the information about when regular testing began in Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) facilities. For Australia we used overseas arrival data, 5 health data, 6 and also considered the new caps on travelers for Australia in January 2021. 7The collated data for hotel quarantine failures is shown in Table 1 , with specific details of each event in the Appendix (Table A1 ). In Australia, seven failures were identified, one causing over 800 deaths and six out of the seven resulting in lockdowns. In New Zealand, there were nine failures, with one causing an outbreak with three deaths, and also a lockdown.Given our estimates of the number of travelers processed via hotel-based quarantine (Table  1) , the overall risks for both countries combined were one failure per 20,702 travelers, and one failure per 252 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in hotel-based quarantine. The combined data can also be interpreted as one outbreak leading to a lockdown response per 47,319 travelers; and approximately one death from COVID-19 per 412 travelers (using the 800 deaths estimate from Australia and the three deaths from New Zealand -although this figure is largely driven by the second wave in Victoria and is unlikely generalizable forward in time).At the country level, there were 15.5 failures per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases transiting quarantine in New Zealand (95%CI: 5.4 to 25.7), compared to 2.0 per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Australia (0.5 to 3.5) -a greater than seven-fold difference in risk. Given the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases since 1 December 2020 in quarantine has increased to 9.1 per 1000 in New Zealand and 16.3 per 1000 in Australia, this would equate to 1.8 and 0.7 expected failures per month in New Zealand and Australia, respectively -assuming past quarantine practices are constant into the future. Moreover, if new arrivals with SARS-CoV-2 have a variant that may be around 50% more infectious, that would become 2.8 and 1.0 respectively (assuming a linear increase in risk, which is likely an underestimate).This analysis identified 16 failures of hotel quarantine in Australia and New Zealand combined (up to 31 January 2021) . The significantly higher failure risk per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases transiting quarantine in New Zealand vs Australia could reflect a lower quality approach in the former and/or possibly better detection in New Zealand from greater use of border worker testing over a longer period. However, it must be noted that since 1 December 2020, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases among international arrivals is greater in Australia (16.3 per 1000) than in New Zealand (9.1 per 1000).These estimates are both subject to chance variations due to low numbers of failures, and as an estimate of all breaches of quarantine an underestimate. That is, there will probably have been instances of viral incursion out of quarantine that failed to spread substantially and be detected. Genomes of the first 649 viral isolates collected in New Zealand show that only 19% of introductions were estimated to infect more than one other person. 9 Therefore, counts of border failures are sensitive to how they are identified and defined. Indeed, with increased testing (eg, testing of people after leaving quarantine on day 16 as is now common in Australia), we may be detecting breaches that previously went undetected.Looking forward, the failure risks per month in New Zealand and Australia are likely to increase, given that the proportion of travelers returning to these countries who are infected is increasing due to global intensification of the pandemic and the increasing infectivity of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. 10 Indeed, in February 2021 there have been two clearly documented cases of spread within quarantine hotels in Melbourne, highlighting the increased risk and evolving situation with more highly infectious variants arriving from overseas. Offsetting this trend will be measures such as vaccinating quarantine workers (assuming the vaccine prevents transmission, which appears likely with overall infection rates halved for the AstraZeneca vaccine 11 and perhaps 70% less for the Moderna mRNA vaccine, as indicated by using swab results for asymptomatic infection plus symptomatic cases 12 ). Another risk reduction practice would be using better facilities in rural locations as these have less risk from close contacts in CBD hotels and within-building spread from poor ventilation systems. Furthermore, the level of testing of hotel quarantine workers has been increasing (eg, 13 ; which will find some failures before they have a chance to establish as an outbreak in the community), and there have been other improvements in hotel quarantine in late 2020 (eg, improved security, introduction of mask wearing within quarantine settings, reduction in shared spaces, improved PPE used by workers, and other procedures as detailed in both countries 14 15 ).Limitations of our analysis include residual uncertainty around the cause of some outbreaks (eg, the Auckland August 2020 outbreak), and imprecision with denominator data on traveler numbers for Australia (eg, some travelers were moved between states on domestic flights which is not captured in the official data we used). Additionally, case numbers are constantly changing, due to the number of reclassifications caused by false positives and duplications.To substantially reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 incursion out of quarantine, the most obvious action is to reduce arrivals, or even suspend arrivals, from high infection locations. Beyond this, there are a range of other potential improvements in ongoing arrangements and processes as detailed in Table 2 .Top priority 2. Pre-flight testing plus/minus prearrival quarantineAn expansion of existing requirements for pre-flight testing to additional traveler source countries. Pre-flight testing could be expanded from not only a PCR test within 72 hours of departure to also add an additional rapid test at the airport immediately before departure (given many infected may have started shedding the virus in the previous 72 hours and most, but not all, of such cases will be detected by a rapid test even though it has lower sensitivity). Of note is that such arrangements are considered legally acceptable (see the above row). Pre-arrival quarantine (eg, for a week), would provide additional assurance. But this would probably need to be in a transport hub (eg, at an airport hotel at Singapore or Hawaii) where NZ and Australian officials were permitted access to ensure quality processes.Top priority 3. Use passenger booking systems to reduce infection risk NZ has a system where passengers book spaces in quarantine facilities prior to travel. Such a system could be adopted more widely in Australia and also be used in to promote and document infection control measures by travelers (eg, requiring declarations from travelers about key precautions).High priorityExploring means to reduce the risk of in-flight infection as documented on a flight to NZ. 16 This could be via more stringent enforcement of mask wearing in airports and on flights, use of higher-efficacy masks (and/or double masking), and minimizing talking when masks are displaced during eating and drinking on flights. Improved ventilation and spacing requirements on flights might also be worthwhile.Ensure measures are in place at departure airports and transit hubs to minimize the risk of cross infection (eg, through physical distancing and mask use).Medium priority 6. Improve local transport arrangements There may be a need to have better physical distancing of travelers on arrival and in transit to quarantine (eg, lowering density on buses). For such arrangements, N95 masks could be required.Shifting some or all quarantine facilities to rural military bases or camps where discrete units (eg, mobile homes or caravans) could be appropriately spatially separated. The success (to date -see Table 1 ) of the Howard Springs facility (a converted workers' camp 8 ) should be considered. This approach allows for natural ventilation and eliminates shared indoor spaces. If spaces were limited, then these settings could be used for travelers from the highest risk countries.Our priority rankingsReserving hotel quarantine in large cities to the lowest risk category of travelers, with hotels in more minor cities being used for the highest risk category of travelers. However, the risk/benefit analysis of such changes would need to consider airport access and if the additional travelling to minor cities poses excessive additional risk.High priority 9. Expand use of PCR testing of saliva in facility workers (and travelers)Expand the regular (daily) use of PCR testing of saliva of facility workers to all facilities in both countries. This approach could also be considered for all travelers, albeit potentially still combined with existing testing regimens.High priority 10 . Upgrade processes at quarantine facilitiesFurther upgrading processes at quarantine hotels in terms of eliminating shared spaces (eg, no shared exercise areas and shared smoking areas), in particular ensuring that day cohorts do not mix under any circumstances. Ventilation improvements could also be considered with limiting the use of hotel rooms to those with external windows.Medium priority 11. Prosecute rule breaking in quarantine facilitiesRule breaking, which is relatively common in NZ facilities, 17 could start to be prosecuted (given no prosecutions during 2020). Mandating that hotel quarantine workers use digital technologies (eg, the Bluetooth function on the NZ COVID Tracer smartphone app) to facilitate contact tracing in the event of a border failure. Travelers could be required to use such technologies for two weeks after completing their time in hotel quarantine. There is also a case for travelers using these tools within quarantine as (at least in NZ) quarantine hotels are sometimes evacuated for fire alarms and burst water pipes.Medium priority 17. Accelerate or mandate vaccination for hotel quarantine staff Rapidly accelerating plans to vaccinate all hotel quarantine workers against COVID-19 and even making vaccination a requirement to work in these settings. This measure will be particularly valuable if vaccines are found to prevent transmission in addition to protecting recipients from illness.Auckland August 2020 outbreak A total of 179 cases, with 3 deaths 33 The cause of this outbreak remains unknown, but genomic work probably provides the best evidence to this being a border facility (isolation or quarantine facility) failure: ""There are a large number of similar genomes which are from the UK, which would seem to suggest the UK is the most likely source of any unknown importation"". 34 This was at a time when 40% of cases in NZ quarantine/isolation facilities did not have genomic work on the virus infecting them (ie, there was not enough complete virus in the samples). It was also estimated 34 that there was only a very tiny risk of this outbreak being a continuation of the March/April spread of the pandemic in NZ: ""Our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis … estimates that there is a 0.4% probability that case 20VR2563 is in the ""sister clade""' of the Auckland cluster."" Finally, the chance of the outbreak being from contaminated imported food was also considered very unlikely: ""Our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis … shows that the estimated mutation rate on the branch leading to the cluster is not a lot smaller than elsewhere in the tree, lending little weight to the possibility that the virus lay dormant on packing material for a long period of time."" Border facility maintenance worker infected (August 2020) A single worker A shared lift environment in a quarantine hotel (the Rydges Hotel in Central Auckland was the source suspected by officials, 35 with the sharing being only minutes apart. 34 The genomic sequencing indicated the same virus infecting the worker as per a recent traveler in the same facility. 34 Border facility health worker infected (September 2020)This was a work-related infection associated with a facility used for isolating infected cases. Both this case (and ""Case B"" below) had the virus genome sequencing linked to infection in a group of international mariners in the same hotel facility but with different virus subtypes in each case. 35 ""The finding supports the current theory that there were two separate events infecting both workers at the facility."" These cases of infected health workers appear to have contributed to border control nurses threatening strike action if they were not supplied with improved PPE. 19 One estimate was that 12 of the mariners were infected on arrival in NZ, but with subsequent spread within the facility a total of 31 mariners were ultimately infected. 40 Another border facility health worker (Case B) (see above)This was a separate work-related infection associated with a border control facility -see in the row above.The worker, a co-worker and 4 others (total of 6 cases)This was a work-related infection in a Defence Force worker associated with a hotel border facility in Auckland (used for isolating known infected cases). ""The genome sequencing we have conducted on Case A's test result shows a direct link to two travelers who are part of a family group in the quarantine facility"". 41 The route of transmission to one of the community cases remains a mystery (albeit they worked in the same locality within Auckland City). Associated with these cases, the Prime Minister made statements around the need for further risk reduction. 42 Traveler infectious after leaving a quarantine facility (January 2021) 1 traveler A traveler was identified as being infectious in the community after leaving a quarantine facility (Pullman, Auckland). The traveler reportedly had the South African variant (lineage B.1.351) of the pandemic virus. 43 Genome sequencing has linked this case to another traveler who was in the same facility. 44 The transmission mechanism has not been precisely identified with investigations still proceeding as of mid-February 2021. However officials consider it likely to have been a separate transmission event to the one in the following row.Travelers infectious after leaving a quarantine facility (January 2021) 2 travelers and a contact Two travelers (a parent and child) were identified as infectious in the community after being infected with the South African variant (lineage B.1.351), of the pandemic virus with a link to a quarantine facility (Pullman, Auckland). 45 A close contact (the mother of the child) also became infected. 46 The transmission mechanism has not been precisely identified with investigations still proceeding as of mid-February 2021.Table A2 details the various approaches to hotel quarantine used in both countries. Key features of which are summarised below:• The length of quarantine in all jurisdictions is 14 days.• Detailed information on quarantine programs for each Australian state/territory is limited and in many cases we had to rely on news articles for additional details in compiling Table A2 . Descriptions of PPE required for hotel quarantine staff in different jurisdictions were particularly difficult to identify and information often was not available by staff role (eg, security guards vs cleaners).Tests are required on days 0, 5, and 12. 70 Staff are required to have nose and throat swabs once every 8 days. 71 72 Masks must be worn when opening hotel doors. 70 Returned travelers are only allowed to leave their rooms in an emergency situation.'Hotel staff must wear appropriate PPE and maintain at least 1.5 meters distance from guests at all times'. 73 Travelers must remain within their hotel room. 70 A requirement for a day 16 test for travelers after leaving hotel quarantine may be introduced in February 2021. 74 Additionally, as of 8 February 2021, after the 31 January 2021 date used for data in this table, hotel quarantine workers were required to have daily saliva tests. 74 .Daily testing is required for staff. 15 Travelers are not allowed to leave their rooms unless there is an emergency. 15 Travelers must wear masks when opening the doors to collect their food.Full PPE is required for staff while on shift.There are no shared spaces; returned travelers must remain in their rooms. 15 After the significant failure that led to over 19,800 cases,(1, 2) and over 800 deaths, Victoria began welcoming returned travelers in December with a revamped hotel quarantine system which included a number of improvements, such as daily testing of staff, voluntary regular testing of family members of staff, advanced contact tracing, a ban on secondary face-to-face employment for key staff, strengthened PPE protocols, and dedicated 'health hotels' for positive and suspected cases and their close contacts. 15 room; any exercise must be done inside the hotel room and no smoking is allowed in hotels. 80 quarantine workers, including security guards, cleaners, and catering staff, have been given a 40% wage increase and are no longer allowed to hold a second job. 30 .",Australia,abstract,2021-02-19,02

This industry has changed socioeconomic life of the cane belt population, particularly in the rural areas up to revolutionary level, facilitated commercial agriculture, generated employment in small to medium businesses, established market retailers, cash crop farming practices, medical development, well-being and credit facilities (Davies 1998; Singh 2020) .

The sugar industry contributed economically to Fiji's gross domestic product (GDP) and triggered economy previously, but from early this millennium, sugarcane yields charted decline with the current yields lower than 2 million tonnes per year, lesser than about 4 million tonnes before 2000 (Singh,2020) .The sugar industry in Fiji, which has benefited from numerous agreements and treaties since 1975, is no longer sustainable due to the expiry of the preferential sugar price contracts in 2017 (Singh 2020) . This decrease in sugarcane production is attributed to lower sugar recovery and by product rates, high agricultural costs (including fertilisers, transport and harvesting costs), a decline in sugarcane acreage attributed to untimely and/or non-renewal of land leases, higher labour requirements, and increased adoption by farmers and their young generation of white-collar jobs, and less or no interest towards the industry (The Fiji Sun 2008; Singh 2020). Pandemic COVID-19 triggered a public health crisis and a financial crisis in Fiji. The effects of COVID-19 on the Fijian economy are enormous, particularly in the tourism sector, major disruptions to trade flows, a major downturn in economic activities and a substantial effect on public finances.Indicating the dramatic growth in the number of cases and the continuing possibility of more global dissemination, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the pandemic of COVID-19. In reaction, many countries closed their borders, restricted or banned international travel, annulled mass meetings and, in various cases, even introduced community, regional or national movements restrictions.The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Fiji on 19 March 2020 and increased to five positive cases on 25 March 2020 (WHO 2020). A number of steps had been taken to suspend all passenger flights to and from Fiji, to limit travel within and outside the affected area and to place restrictions on non-essential gatherings. In addition, other steps have since been taken to ensure the health and well-being of Fijians. The Fijian economy is expected to decrease by 4.3 per cent in 2020 after a 0.5 per cent increase in 2019. The economic downturn would be much sharper on the basis of the duration of the pandemic, and the economic repercussions will be much more severe if border closures by major trading partners are prolonged.The economy is expected to rebound in 2021 and 2022, with a broad-based growth projection of 1.9% and 3.0%, respectively (COVID Supplementary Budget, 2020). The Fiji Sugarcane industry amidst COVID-19 has been discussed, and pragmatic measures taken by the government and industry during these challenging times are discussed herein. The economy is projected to recover in 2021 and 2022, with a large-scale growth forecast of 1.9% and 3.0%, respectively (COVID Supplementary Budget 2020). The Fiji sugarcane industry amidst of COVID-19 and practical steps taken by the government and industry during these difficult times are deliberated in this paper.The threat of coronavirus has ravaged Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu. Population at great risk because these countries are having high levels of obesity and healthcare services are still weak. The country's export composition is less diversified than its GDP. It is vulnerable to external shocks due to over-reliance on tourism and remittances, and as regards rural livelihoods, to the high dependence on the sugar sector. The Ministry of Sugar Industry has decided to finalise it's first-ever Sugar Industry Policy. The Ministry of Sugar Industry has been allocated $53.6 million in the 2020-2021 Budget (FBC News 2020).Mills crushed a total of 182,545 tonnes of cane for the period ending 13th July 2020 representing just under 10% of the anticipated seasonal estimate of cane available for crushing which accounts for an improvement of 33% year on year (FSC 2020). Nationally, mill output has shown an upward trend, with running time utilisation 40 per cent higher than last year and average weekly mill stoppages 28 per cent lower. Sugar production of 14,016 tons is 22 percent higher than in the same timeframe in 2019, but cane purity and recoverable sugar volumes stayed below estimates last year. The 2020 sugarcane crushing season started in Labasa on 10th June, with Rarawai Mill due to open on 23 rd June and the Lautoka Mill to follow on 24th June (The Fiji times 2020).Lautoka mill had a pre-crush problem with boiler fan which was resolved, with local refurbishment and repair. A burst bulk water pipeline also had to be repaired which led the mill deliberately run slowly for first few days. Cane supply was adequate from both manual and mechanical harvesting gangs and close to $200 million in sugar and molasses sales revenue expected for Fiji in 2020/21 season which would be a major contribution into the Fijian economy in these challenging times (FSC 2020) .Meanwhile, the FSC reported a combined ratio of 9.9 tons of cane to sugar (TCTS). The Lautoka sugar mill had to crush 13.5 tons of cane to make one ton of sugar last week, while the Rarawai mill in Ba needed 12.5 tons of cane to produce one ton of sugar, and the Labasa mill needed 9.9 tons to make one ton of sugar. The three mills crushed 882,905 tonnes of cane as at September 7, 2020 and produced 77,702 tonnes of sugar. Low cane quality crushed at Lautoka was caused by Rarawai several days old cane delivered during the weekend (FSC 2020). The per cent burnt cane delivered at Lautoka increased to more than 66 per cent which impacted can quality and TCTS negatively. Farmers sent 71 per cent burnt cane to Rarawai mill which affected sugar production (The Fiji times 2020). The Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) began loading more than 40,000 tons of sugar for export to the USA and Spain as the first vessel to ship the two bulk cargoes from the Malau and Lautoka terminals to Labasa on Tuesday 18 th August, 2020. (The Fiji times 2020a).During June about to three hundred lorries laden with cane were parked at the Rarawai mill after a breakdown halted operations at the factory which resulted in farmers from Rakiraki to Cuvu in Sigatoka sending their cane to Ba (The Fiji times 2020a).The government had discussion with the Indian Government on assistance in improving the rail system in Fiji. FSC deployed 23 trucks to cart cane in Tavua and Ba to the Rarawai mill. Government provided support to ease the transportation system in sugarcane industry and budgeted a total of $5.9 million and was given to FSC to procure 44 trucks, out of which 33 trucks will provide services to the cane farmers in Labasa this year at affordable cartage rates. FSC introduced decreases in sourcing to necessary products only; stricter regulation and reduction of maintenance expenditure; locking back resources and contracting activities; pay cuts of at least 15 per cent for senior management, 7.5 per cent for staff officers and 5 per cent for all non-staff employees; audited administration and support functions for the initial four-month period, unpaid leave introduced for some 130 employees identified as due in both processes and retirement and job arrangements (Fijivillage 2020).Despite the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Harold and COVID-19, Government support was provided for cane farming to entice young farmers to secure land for cane farming through the new farmers programme to increase cane productions. In the last two years, 117 new farmers, 18 of whom were females, have been assisted in Labasa mill area. The group of farmers secured leases and have commenced cane farming. Government is also providing cane planting grant of more than $47 million in all mills areas since 2017 (The Fiji Sun 2020). There are 38 cane harvesters in Labasa this year, and FSC has organised training sessions for 30 locals to operate the mechanical harvesters. Around 35 per cent or 231,700 tonnes of cane was expected mechanically harvested this year in Labasa, and it was expected that there would be no stand over cane this season as the mill would close earlier than expected because the Government had increased support for mechanical harvesters (The Fiji Sun 2020a). Sugar cane farmers across the country received their third cane payment from 2nd April 2020 a day earlier than anticipated and became a welcome relief to many farmers and their families who worked tirelessly to revitalise the sugar sector (FBC News 2020a). The Ministry of Sugar introduced seven capital programmes worth $50.9 million in this financial year. The projects will allow farmers to advance cane production through new Cane Access Roads, Sugar Cane Growth & Farmers' Assistance, Sugar Stabilisation Fund, New Farmers' Assistance Program, Fertiliser Subsidy, Weedicide Subsidy and Cane Cartage. The effort was funded by the Project Steering Committee of the Heads of Business Enterprises to provide strategic vision and to oversee the implementation of the programs (FBC News 2020b).Sugarcane is a long-term labour-intensive crop and thus planting and field operations can be affected by lockdowns. Increased emphasis needs to be focused on mechanisation programs for different cultural processes, such as planting, inter-cultural operations, ratooning and harvesting. Specialised equipment and cost-effective farm machinery targeted to small and marginal farmers should be given the highest priority. The sugar sector should explore the potential applications of artificial intelligence in the management of sugar cane production, crop and soil quality monitoring, predictive crop analysis and the growth of smart supply chains. The Fijian sugar industry should step up its efforts to diversify and add value to specialty goods. Emphasis should be put on the production of specialty sugars, low GI sugars, nutraceuticals, medicinal drugs, pharmaceuticals, etc. from sugar cane co-products and sugars. Alternative use of by-products such as bagasse (chemicals, resins), filter cake (e.g. bio-methane, bio-NGC), etc. can be tested (Solomon et al. 2020) . COVID-19 stressed the need to maintain a hygienic condition and the manufacture of hand sanitisers should begin. Better monitoring of contractors engaged in cane access road construction is needed to ensure the development of quality work and to minimise the diversion of government funds. The need is to approach villages and groups and others who have lost job due to COVID-19 pandemic to undertake cane cutting (Pacific Community 2017).Micro-level planning to determine the existing and future developmental needs of the sugar industry is necessary due to the continuing crisis of COVID-19. This is important to ensure that, with limited capital and unfavourable climate, farm and factory production can be sustained and that stakeholders across the supply chain, from producers to traders, can prosper. Many of these impacts may be transient, but interventions such as increased mechanisation in farmers ' fields, diversified cultivation, added value, etc. are here to remain and help, helping the sector to cope with and resolve such unforeseen hard times and difficulties leading to a more competitive sugarcane industry.",Fiji,abstract,2021-02-07,02
2021e98db6c7628cedb329a9e46e0f608e4a8f6b,To appear in: Public Health,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), left countries with little recourse but to adopt layered policies over time to mitigate the virus' impact while researchers investigate therapeutics and vaccines. In the absence of medical interventions, a range of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been employed, including international travel restrictions, traveler screening at ports of entry, border closures, domestic movement restrictions, school and business closures, physical distancing, and hand hygiene 1, 2 . Public policies implemented to support these and other mitigation measures aimed to prevent importation of the virus, limit mobility, and decrease opportunities for virus transmission. The use of international travel restrictions and wholesale limitations on domestic movement is unprecedented and either not mentioned in guidance or presented as an extreme policy option to be taken with great consideration 3, 4 .Countries have taken myriad approaches to the use of NPIs to address the threat of COVID-19. With little data about SARS-CoV-2, policy makers responded as they might to pandemic influenza 5 . Though international travel-related restrictions have been shown to delay but not prevent the spread of influenza once seeded in a country, many countries imposed and maintained travel restrictions despite having local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [6] [7] [8] . Other countries have taken few, if any, steps to mitigate the spread of the virus 9, 10 . In an effort to limit mobility, and eventually social mixing and disease exposure, many countries closed schools and non-essential businesses 11, 12 . Particularly in countries with community transmission, these policies were often followed by stay-at-home orders to limit exposure even further 13 . Such a layered approach in the application of mitigation policies draws on lessons learned from the 1918 influenza pandemic, as well as the SARS outbreak and H1N1 pandemic [14] [15] [16] .The effect of NPIs in the context of COVID-19 is still being investigated. Studies have shown that mitigation policies can slow the spread of COVID-19, though the extent of the effect differs by setting 17, 18 . For example, mobility has been shown to decline in some settings after implementation of mitigation policies. In addition, each policy may come with a human cost and a cost to the economy, now and in the future. It is estimated that global gross domestic product will contract by 5.2% in 2020 and it may take time to recover lost jobs and time in school 19, 20 . School closures and stay-at-home orders may further inflict a cost on children and adults through increased interpersonal violence and decreased access to food [21] [22] [23] . Governments are weighing their ability to stem disease transmission with their implications for the economy 19, 24 . 20 .More information is needed to describe the effectiveness of mitigation policies in diverse settings. To this end, we characterized the timing and trends of select mitigation policies, changes in community mobility, and COVID-19 epidemiology in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. These locations were among the first in the world to report COVID-19 cases, are close in proximity, utilized different policy approaches, and all saw their epidemics peak during the study period.Seven kinds of policy measures to support SARS-CoV-2 mitigation-mass gathering restrictions, international travel restrictions, passenger screening, traveler isolation/quarantine, school closures, business closures, and domestic movement restrictions-implemented by government authorities between January 1 and April 26, 2020, were abstracted from media reports, and government and United Nations websites. These data were examined in conjunction with daily new case counts. Daily new case counts starting from January 22, 2020, were extracted from the COVID-19 dashboard maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at the Johns Hopkins University 25 . A three-day moving average of the daily case count was calculated to account for changes in testing and reporting.Mobility data beginning February 15, 2020, were obtained from Google's Community Mobility Reports; these provide country and territory-level information on the percentage change in visits to or time spent in six location types compared to each country's baseline or median level of activity on that day of the week from January 3 to February 6, 2020 26 . The baseline period was determined by Google Community Mobility Reports and cannot be modified by users. Visits to and time spent in locations were tracked among smartphone users who turned on their phone's Location History setting 26 . Three mobility measures were selected for analysis: visits to retail and recreation, transit stations, and workplaces. Other measures-parks, residential, and groceries and pharmacies-were not included as we would expect visits to parks to increase as other venues closed as well as more time spent in residential areas. Because groceries and pharmacies provide essential services, these were also excluded.Four countries or territories were identified for analysis to reflect different mitigation strategies and epidemics: Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. These locations were chosen due to the relatively early date of their first detected COVID-19 case, and because differences in mitigation policy responses and the ensuing epidemiologic patterns may inform application of these policies elsewhere. Additionally, as neighbors in the East Asia Pacific Region, governments and residents may be influenced by events unfolding in their neighbors.In order to visually represent the effects that mitigation measures might have on community mobility and on the incidence of COVID-19 mitigation over time, mobility, and COVID-19 epidemiology (MME) graphics were developed for each country 27 .The protocol was reviewed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) human research protection procedures and was determined not to be research.Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore all reported their first COVID-19 cases in January 2020 25 . By April 26, 2020, the end of the study period, Australia reported 6,714 cases and 83 deaths, with the number of cases reported per day peaking at 500 on March 28 28 . Japan reported 13,441 cases and 372 deaths. Its epidemic peaked on April 17, with 1,161 cases reported 28 . Hong Kong reported 1,037 cases and four deaths, with the epidemic peaking with 80 cases reported on March 29 28 . Singapore reported 13,624 cases and 12 deaths, with the number of cases reported per day peaking at 1,426 on April 20 28 .Australia enacted its first non-travel-related mitigation policy, a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people, on March 15, 2020, approximately two weeks after identification of its first case (Figure 1) . A succession of other policies over the next two weeks reduced the size of permitted gatherings, banned entry of non-residents, extended the summer school holiday, and recommended that the elderly, chronically ill, and indigenous people remain at home (Table 1) . On April 5, the states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania, which together account for 80% of Australia's population and 83% of national COVID-19 cases on that date, instituted mandatory stay-at-home orders 29, 30 . The largest declines in the targeted mobility outcomes occurred on April 10, a national holiday, and ranged from 76% to 82% below baseline. Australia's mitigation policies were generally requirements rather than recommendations and included penalties for non-compliance. The rapid application of increasingly restrictive mitigation policies was followed by a gradual decline in mobility, with the largest change occurring in public transit-associated mobility (median 45% decrease).Japan implemented its first international travel restriction on January 21, 2020 ( Figure 2 ). Mass gatherings were restricted on February 25, but a limit on the size of the gathering was not set (Table 1) .On February 27, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe asked primary and secondary schools to close starting March 2; a stay-at-home request was made on March 26 for residents of Tokyo, and was extended nationally on April 16. These policies were non-mandatory requests. Community mobility in Japan began declining in late February, then remained stable for one month before beginning a slow and consistent decline around the time of Tokyo's requested stay-at-home order. The largest declines in the targeted mobility outcomes occurred on April 18 and ranged from 26% to 60% below baseline. Though Japan experienced a decrease in daily cases, relative to the implementation of mitigation policies the decline occurred later than Australia's.In Hong Kong, a policy instituted on January 29, 2020 called for non-essential civil servants to work from home, and sports, cultural, and leisure facilities to close (Figure 3 ). Primary and secondary schools were closed on February 3. After daily case counts had remained below 15 for more than one-month, civil servants returned to their offices on March 2, followed by the reopening of sports, cultural, and leisure facilities (Table 1) . Mobility remained below baseline and relatively stable, declining to a low of 26% to 60% below baseline, as case counts increased and mitigation policies were reapplied. The number of daily cases peaked on March 29, the same day that gatherings of more than four people were banned. Bars were closed five days later. Daily case counts declined to less than 10 per day by mid-April.Singapore restricted mass gatherings of over 250 people on March 13, 2020. On March 26, the ban was applied to gatherings of >10 people and some businesses were closed (Figure 4 ). The enactment of these policies was followed by declines in mobility outcomes from 10% to 40% below baseline. During the week of April 7, gatherings of any size were banned, non-essential businesses were closed, schools and universities were closed, and a national stay-at-home order was issued (Table 1) . Mobility outcomes fell sharply by 63% to 83% below baseline. However, Singapore experienced an increase in daily cases with a peak of 1,426 cases on April 20. Many of these cases were in migrant workers living in dormitories housing upwards of 20 people per room 31 .Our findings reveal that mitigation policies were followed by decreases in the mobility outcomes of interest. Across settings, transit-associated mobility declined the most and workplace-associated mobility the least. Between January 1 and April 26, 2020, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore took varied approaches to implementing similar policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Policies were implemented at different times, including after the peak in daily cases, and in Hong Kong, some policies were lifted and reapplied in responses to fluctuations in daily reported cases. The later epidemic peaks in Japan and Singapore, approximately three weeks after the peaks in Australia and Hong Kong, may reflect the consequences of different mitigation strategies.Changes in mobility and case counts following the implementation of mitigation policies were uneven, possibly reflecting differences in enforcement, differential ability of specific sub-populations to adhere to the policies, and the impact of changes in practices by individuals, business, and civic organizations in response to media coverage and personal risk assessment. For example, greater reductions in mobility in Australia compared to Japan might reflect the differential enactment and enforcement of policies in these two countries, with Australia enacting mandatory restrictions, while Japan made recommendations. Singapore's experience of business closures and stay-at-home orders highlights that mitigation policies may not be equally effective for all groups within a population. Memories of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak may have aroused people in Hong Kong and Singapore to take preemptive measures and limit mobility prior to the implementation of mitigation policies.Mitigation policies can be enhanced through careful consideration to avoid inadvertently increasing risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among sub-populations. They can also be tailored for sub-populations and resources can be provided to enhance the ability of sub-populations to adhere to policies. 32 Migrants may similarly benefit from special policies to protect them from COVID-19 and increase their access to health services during the pandemic 33 .Our findings suggest an association between the implementation of select mitigation policies and subsequent changes in relevant mobility outcomes. These findings are limited by our inability to attribute changes in mobility to a single mitigation policy. Furthermore, mobility measures may not fully reflect changes, for example in physical distancing, that impact the degree of contact between people. Further research is necessary to assess the association between mobility and SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and to determine the types and degree of changes in mobility needed to achieve a certain level of reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The application of other mitigation policies, including personal measures such as increased handwashing and the wearing of masks, or engineering controls, such as barriers between cashiers and customers or the use of markers on the ground to indicate where people in a queue should stand, may further modify the effect of mobility by making interactions safer.Our analysis is also limited by restricting it to locations that experienced a peak in the epidemic, and by our use of national mobility data and case counts which may obscure sub-national variations. Potential variation in the implementation of sub-national policies that may have influenced mobility patterns similarly limits a complete assessment of the role of mitigation policies on mobility. Although mobile phone use is high in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, it is not universal, and specific subpopulations may not be accurately reflected in Google Community Mobility data. Younger and bettereducated persons in Australia and Japan are most likely to own a smartphone 34 . The same is likely true in Hong Kong and Singapore where mobile phone penetration is over 100% 35, 36 . Moreover, the number of people and geographic distribution of people represented by these data is unknown. Data from media sources may inadvertently include errors.In Hong Kong, non-essential government workers were told to work from home beginning January 29. Entertainment venues were closed the same day, and on February 3, schools were closed. Any changes in mobility resulting from these policies and occurring through February 6 would have been part of the baseline. As such, it is possible that Hong Kong experienced a greater change in mobility than we have reported due to Google's baseline period.Changes in mobility may differ by locality based on the number of cases reported. In addition, comparison of mitigation and mobility to trends in case counts did not account for the effects of case isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of contacts. Finally, there are many reasons that case counts may be incomplete, including related to testing policies and testing capacity.Our findings highlight seven kinds of mitigation policies governments may enact and the trajectories that epidemics may take. Monitoring mitigation, mobility, and epidemiology graphs (Figures 1-4 ) may help inform countries considering applying or lifting mitigation policies to address COVID-19 37 . MME graphs can provide users with a sense of how mitigation policies are affecting the COVID-19 pandemic. This can inform decision makers as they apply or reapply mitigation policies as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, implementation of mitigation policies, changes in community mobility, and daily COVID-19 case counts varied; differences may be explained in part by differences in enforcement, changes in prevention practices that are not related to imposed restrictions, and differential ability to adhere to policies by different sub-populations. Policy makers can consider these also issued for elderly, chronically ill, and indigenous populations) April 5**: mandatory April 16: recommendation *Japan's limits on mass gatherings, business closures, and stay-at-home orders are recommendations, not mandatory orders. **Regional ***Bold font signifies the lifting of policies NR = none reported J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",Australia,abstract,2021-02-12,02
