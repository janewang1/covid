b47865b3750da5daf11d68f106d9d7ad7f8e2e8b,Special Report The potential association between PARP14 and the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19),"linked to the development of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and if left untreated can culminate in multiple organ failure [2] . This has also been noted in other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [2] . While a rapid and effective immune response is desirable during infection, an excessive response can itself cause damage. Part of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome observed in SARS-CoV-2 is the 'cytokine storm', a mass secretion of cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-1RA IL-6, IL-7, IL-8), and the severity of this cytokine storm is closely linked to disease severity and mortality [3, 5, 6] . It is suggested that an early anti-inflammatory intervention can help prevent immune damage and thus reduce any potential injury to the nervous system [6] .Upstream from the SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm, macrophages, dendritic cells and monocytes are activated and release IL-6, which binds to the IL-6R, activating intracellular signal transducers such as the JAK/STAT pathway (primarily via STAT1 and STAT3 isoforms), JNK proinflammatory pathway, MAPK pathway and PI3K pathway [7] . During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the high activation of these pathways causes the release of inflammatory cytokines which, in excess, become the cytokine storm [5] . IL-6 is further promoted by TLR4 from the NFKB pathway, steering the viral progression toward an excessive activation of the innate immune response, as observed through the inflammatory induced damage to the pulmonary interstitial arteriolar walls [3] . Many COVID-19 investigations focus on IL-6, claiming it is the prime suspect for inducing the proinflammatory response within the body and correlating it positively with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms [5, 6] . Multiple targets have been suggested to halt or suppress this cytokine storm, including the use of tocilizumab -an anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody which blocks the membrane receptor binding of IL-6 -or anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist [5] . PI3K inhibitors have also showed promise in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, along with inhibition of the JNK family impairing the synthesis of H5N1 viral RNA [8] . Future proposals include inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway (e.g., baricitinib, which was proposed using artificial intelligence algorithms) [9] .Furthermore, several SARS-CoVs have been shown both in isolation and in vivo to suppress the cellular interferon response, potentially enhancing the virulence of SARS-CoV. However, the presence of interferon is seen to have a dual role, as demonstrated by Fehr et al.; if CoV-infected murine models lacking IFN-1 signaling (IFNAR -/-) received exogenous IFN-1 prior to the peak virus replication, the mice were completely protected from the disease [10] . These results support the use of interferons as a treatment option for SARS-CoVs and highlight the importance of interferon production in protection against the virus [10] . However, it was also seen that without the initial administration, interferons were rapidly produced later in the infection, recruiting inflammatory monocytes to the lung and causing the production of additional proinflammatory cytokines, eventually leading to lethality. The authors restated that they were unable to confidently predict the role of interferon in IFNAR -/due to this apparent dual role [10] . Other studies report that when interferons are coadministered in vitro with the antiviral ribavirin, their activity is increased compared with administration of interferons alone [11] .Another aspect to consider regarding the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential association with the macrodomain-containing PARP14 is the SARS-CoV macrodomain. Located within the transmembrane nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), this macrodomain is highly conserved across the Coronaviridae subfamily and is suggested to be vital for the virulence of the virus [10] . Many other viruses also encode a macrodomain which acts to bind and hydrolyze ADPr from proteins, and in SARS-CoVs is regarded as essential for its ADP-ribose-1 -phosphatase activity in vitro [10] . Studies by Fehr et al. in 2016 mutated the D1022A, N1040A, H1045A or G1130V residues of the mouse-adapted virus model MA15 to either limit or eliminate the ADP-ribose-1 -phosphatase activity [10] . They found that the SARS-CoV macrodomain suppressed the early interferon and proinflammatory cytokine response for the host immune system, consequentially promoting lung edema and lethality in the infected mice. However, in mice exposed to the virus that lacked the catalytic activity of the macrodomain (N1040A mutation), the virus induced significantly elevated expression of interferon-stimulated genes and other cytokines. Furthermore, when mice were coinfected with both wild-type and N1040A-mutated viruses, they still had better outcomes and increased interferon and proinflammatory cytokine expression than those infected with the wild-type virus alone [10] . The critical nature of the macrodomain has also been observed using the prototypical coronavirus model, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHMV (MHV), as well as the sindbis viruses, in which mutations in the macrodomain render the virus unable to cause severe hepatitis and encephalitis [10] . These results collectively demonstrate the prominent role the viral macrodomain has in promoting virulence. The Fehr et al. study also noted that, although the macrodomain was associated with dephosphorylating ADR-1 -phosphate to ADR, this intermediate had never been detected in a coronavirus infection, suggesting that the macrodomain was more likely involved in deMARylating or dePARylating target proteins [10] . The specific molecular targets of the coronavirus macrodomains still need to be explored; however, given this de-MAR/PAR activity, it is likely that the coronavirus macrodomain has some opposing role to ADP ribosylation, and likely the PARP family.Although the above is not intended as a comprehensive review of the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of action, it does highlight some areas in which PARP14 may have some involvement; in particular, SARS-CoV-2's association with inflammatory cytokines and the interferon response and its potential to reverse the MAR activity of PARP14. As previously mentioned, inflammatory cytokines are a key component of the cytokine storm exhibited in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, in particular those related to STAT1/STAT3 activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This expression is in opposition to those associated with PARP14 activity: PARP14 is involved in promoting the STAT6-dependent transcription of the Th2 immune response, whereas SARS-CoV-2 promotion of STAT1 transcription is associated with a Th1 response [1, 12] , and the predominant cytokine of PARP14 activation is IL-4 compared with SARS-CoV infections with IL-6. This opposition suggests that rather than promoting the release of inflammatory cytokines associated with SARS-CoV-2, PARP14 (if involved) may play a role in the host response to counteract the immune imbalance. A 2020 correspondence by Webb and Saad also suggested that PARP14 may play a role in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by counteracting skewing of the Th1:Th2 cytokine ratio [12] . They support this theory in part due to the 32% structural homology between the macrodomain of PARP14 and SARS-CoV-2, stating that the similarity may be caused by the SARS-CoV macrodomain coevolving with ADPr proteins to counter their activity [12] . However, this potential role of PARP14 counteracting the inflammatory cytokines observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection is purely speculative and will need experimental validation.Another potential mode of action for PARP14 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is via the interferon response. A study by Grunewald et al. in 2019 suggested that there was strong evidence showing that PARP14 ADP ribosylation (ADPr) is involved in the stimulation of IFN-1. This is promising evidence for PARP14's role in host defense against SARS-CoV-2; IFN-1 treatment is often proposed as a candidate treatment during viral infection [13] . The sensitivity of SARS-CoV (using the human coronavirus 229E) to IFN-α treatment was also increased when the coronavirus macrodomain was attenuated [12] . Furthermore, an uncontrolled, exploratory study showed that for patients with COVID-19, IFN-α2b therapy appeared to shorten the duration of viral shedding, accelerating viral clearance from the respiratory tract and reducing the concentration of IL-6 [14] . A more controlled study would need to take place to better validate these conclusions.This association between PARP14 and its potential interferon response is further explored when investigating the coronavirus macrodomain. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain interacts with PARP14. As previously mentioned, coronaviruses with mutated or absent macrodomains were associated with reduced viral loads, as well as increased sensitivity to IFN-1 treatment in cell culture, suggesting that the coronavirus macrodomain counters antiviral activities [10, 15] . A key PARP14 and coronavirus study by Gruenwald et al. firstly looked at the effect of pan-PARP inhibitors (3-aminobenzamide and XAV-939) at high concentrations against the murine hepatitis virus (MHV), finding a resulting decrease in interferon production which was not observed in the wild-type (WT) virus [15] . They inferred that the ADP ribosyltransferase activity was necessary for PARP14's antiviral activity, as the pan-PARP inhibitors target the catalytic domain; however, this is limited as the pan-PARP inhibitors target all 17 PARP enzymes [15] . To look more directly at PARP14, they used the inhibitor 8k, which is selective toward PARP14 when compared with PARP1 (with IC 50 values of 0.78 and 19 μM respectively) and is slightly more selective over PARP10 at 1.4 μM [16] . Using 8k in combination with PARP14 −/− bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), along with human PARP14 knockout (KO) A549 and normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells, the authors showed that PARP14 was required to induce the heightened IFN-1 production during coronavirus infection. This was consistent with other studies detailing PARP14's role in IFN-1 induction following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells and BMDMs [15] .The study also details the creation of the recombinant virus N1347A, which contains an alanine mutation within the macrodomain that effectively removes the ADP hydrolase activity of MHV macrodomains. Within murine models, this virus was shown to replicate poorly and was not disease-causing, highlighting the importance of the viral macrodomain to counter antiviral activities [15] . As in the MHV studies, the authors used siRNA knockdown with the PARP14 inhibitor 8k to show that although 8k did not affect the cell viability, metabolism, or global cellular PARylation, it restored the replication of the N1347A virus in BMDMs significantly [15] , thereby supporting the role of PARP14 blocking N1347A MHV replication [15] . Other PARPs may also be involved in the antiviral activity, as the pan-PARP inhibitors were able to reduce N1347A IFN-1 levels much more effectively than the partially specific PARP14 inhibitor [15] . Together, this study showed that PARP14 was required to inhibit the replication of the mutated coronavirus and demonstrated its importance in interferon expression. Gruenwald et al.were not the only ones to start investigating PARP14's emerging role in viral defense; among a few preliminary studies, an early 2018 paper investigated the previously uncharacterized association PARP14 has with the regulation of IFN-β response in murine macrophages [17] . Following endotoxin stimulation, PARP14 was shown to bind to a small group of specific interferon-stimulated gene-encoded proteins, enabling their nuclear accumulation. This was further reinforced as following the loss of PARP14, the transcription of IRF3-regulated primary response genes was attenuated, resulting in the reduction of IFN-β and the activation of secondary antiviral response genes [17] , again validating PARP14's emerging role in the stimulation and regulation of type 1 interferons during a viral attack.There are three potential pathways in which PARP14 may have a role in aiding the host immune system against SARS-CoV infections; however, all require further experimental validation. A key aspect of investigating the potential role of PARP14 is the availability of potent and selective PARP14 inhibitors. Currently, there are no clinically available PARP14 inhibitors, but there are some promising small-molecule lead compounds. As discussed earlier, one study utilized the PARP14 inhibitor lead compound 8k, which exhibited sub-micromolar potency against PARP14's catalytic domain while also showing the highest selectivity over PARP1 [16] . However, this compound is limited in its ability to be classified as a selective PARP inhibitor, because its potency has not been assessed against all PARP enzymes. Another promising lead has been H10, as proposed by Peng et al., which was found to inhibit PARP14 activity at an IC 50 of 0.49 ± 0.07 μM in vitro [18] . H10 operates as a bidentate inhibitor, targeting both the conserved nicotinamide binding site and the less conserved adenine binding site within PARP14's catalytic domain. To date, H10 is the most potent PARP14 inhibitor; however, like 8k, it requires further assessment against the other PARP family members before we can be confident in its selectivity. Suggestions by Grundewald et al. imply that it is PARP14's catalytic domain which is responsible for its potential antiviral action. However, it would be of interest to investigate whether PARP14's macrodomain also plays a role. This aligns nicely with the current studies that are targeting the macro2 domain of PARP14, in the hope of achieving greater selectivity toward PARP14 over the other PARPs. The most effective macrodomain inhibitors target the macro2 domain and include the carbazole 108, which possesses sub-micromolar activity with an IC 50 value of 0.66 ± 0.03 μM [19] .Furthermore, whilst PARP14 appears to be involved in aiding the host defense against SARS coronaviruses, the earlier DNA-dependent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP1-3) are speculated to have an opposing role. A review by Curtin et al. proposes a clinical investigation of DNA-dependent PARP inhibitors against COVID-19 [4] , highlighting that PARP1 and PARP2 actively increase and prolong inflammation and that the use of PARP inhibitors can limit this tissue damage, as well as decreasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines [4] . They continue to pitch a COVID-19 clinical trial using the clinically approved (for primarily BRCA-mutated cancers) PARP inhibitors, justifying that the doses would likely not need to be as high as those used in oncological applications [4] . Overall, it is a very well-done study that condenses the evidence for the use of DNA-dependent PARP inhibitors in coronavirus treatment.Our original aim was to investigate whether PARP14 plays a role in the pathology of COVID-19 and whether a PARP14 inhibitor would be useful as a treatment option. Overall, there needs to be more experimental evidence to support PARP14's potential role in host defense against SARS-CoV-2. However, we have identified three potential modes of action, including PARP14 counterbalancing the proinflammatory cytokines of the SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm, PARP14's role in the interferon response to aid in clearing the virus, and the relationship between the deMARylating activity of the coronavirus macrodomain and PARP14's antiviral activity. Further investigation of these hypotheses may give us a better understanding of the host immunopathological response to SARS-CoV-2 and aid in our future design of vaccines and treatments. PARP14 inhibitors may be clinically useful in the treatment of cancers and allergic airway diseases, but for coronaviruses the development of selective PARP14 inhibitors is more likely to be of use in furthering our understanding of the immunopathological response. Finally, we emphasize again that there needs to be more evidence-based data to support the potential role of PARP14 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Use and continual development of selective PARP14 inhibitors will help to answer some of these hypotheses, and hopefully will aid us in designing better treatments and reducing the disease burden of COVID-19.• Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative virus for the disease COVID-19.• The SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain is shown to suppress the early interferon and proinflammatory cytokine response.• When untreated, disease progression is closely linked to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

7ff61c3e800d29f5d06630256c843eff9a1c5e3d,Preferences for a COVID-19 vaccine in Australia,"COVID-19 continues to have a profound impact across the globe. As at 13 September 2020, there have been approximately 30 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and almost 1 million COVID-19 related deaths [43] . In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, non-pharmaceutical suppression strategies remain the first and only line of defence. In Australia, this response has focussed on widespread COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, limiting private and public gatherings, restricting attendance at schools and universities, social distancing and closing borders [27] . Australia had 26,607 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 803 deaths as at 13 September 2020 [43] .Whilst there is growing evidence non-pharmaceutical suppression strategies have 'flattened the curve', they come at significant economic and social costs [35] . A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine has been identified as the most sustainable option to manage the current pandemic. This has resulted in an unprecedented international collaborative research effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine using an accelerated pathway [19, 19] .Developing a vaccine is both complex and resource intensive. The time from initial development to final licensure is typically measured in decades rather than months, and reflects strong stakeholder preferences for safety and effectiveness over immediacy. Concerns about vaccine safety is a major contributing factor to increasing vaccine hesitancy which is defined by the WHO as a ''delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services"" and is a significant and increasing public health concern [42, 23] . Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccines [42, 1] . In additional to safety, vaccine hesitancy is also influenced by confidence (trust of the vaccine, the provider, regulatory authority or medical professionals), complacency (perceived need for the vaccine and/or risk of catching the disease) and convenience (access to vaccines including cost) [43, 1, 32 ]. Yet, vaccine safety remains a primary concern as vaccines are given to healthy individuals, often children, to ward off diseases now only known by name, and whose effects are long forgotten [21] .Public trust in vaccines was significantly eroded by the pertussis vaccine controversy in the mid-1970s, and more recently by a publication in the Lancet proposing a causal relationship between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism [39] . Other events that eroded public trust in vaccines include reporting of the H1N1 influenza vaccine increasing the risk of narcolepsy Vaccine j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / v a c c i n e [33] , the RotaShield rotavirus vaccine causing intussusception in healthy infants [2] and the HPV vaccine safety recall in 2013 [36] .In addition to the forgone benefit of disease prevention in individuals, vaccine hesitancy also limits positive externalities offered by vaccine programs [11, 38, 8] . Vaccine hesitancy by even a small subset of the population can have a disproportionate effect on herd immunity and disease spread [23, 26] . Given vaccine uptake is a critical factor in the success of an immunisation program, understanding vaccine preferences and the potential for vaccine hesitancy within a population is critical for public health officials. This is especially the case in the current COVID-19 pandemic when vaccines have been developed according to an accelerated pathway and safety concerns have attracted significant community and media attention.This paper addresses the above issue by providing an assessment of preferences for a COVID-19 vaccine during a global pandemic. Preference data was collected from a sample of Australian residents using a stated preference discrete choice experiment (DCE). Respondents were presented with choice tasks containing three hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and a no-choice option and asked to select their most preferred option. The hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines were described according to an attributes profile which included measures for immediacy, safety, effectiveness, administration and price.In addition, estimates of the uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine in Australia under three different vaccine scenarios is also provided.Data was collected through an online questionnaire completed by 2151 Australian residents between 27 and 31 March 2020. The questionnaire was distributed by The Online Research Unit (The ORU, http://www.theoru.com/index.htm) with respondents paid a small incentive (less than $5) to complete the questionnaire. To ensure the quality of the data collected, The ORU invites respondents to participate to a survey via an email invitation which does not include the topic to avoid respondent bias. As a general practice, The ORU invites respondents to two surveys a week on average to ensure a healthy response rate among panellists and to keep the average response rate around 10 percent. After inspecting the data, 15 responses were removed due to quality concerns resulting in a final sample of 2136 responses 1 . Table 1 compares various socio-demographic characteristics of the final sample with those of the Australian population. Compared to the Australian population, the sample has a higher median age (59 versus 45 years old) and a higher percentage of individuals holding a bachelor degree and above (42.28 percent vs 22 percent). The sample is representative of the Australian population with regard to gender and median income. A greater number of responses were deliberately obtained from less populated states and territories (Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and the Northern Territory) in order to have a uniform distribution of respondents across the various Australian states and territories. During the estimation process, the sample was weighted to reflect the distribution of gender and age in the population.The questionnaire consisted of three main sections. The first section provided respondents with introductory text detailing the scope of the questionnaire and establishing eligibility using quota and screening questions. The second section presented respondents with a DCE to determine vaccine preferences. The final section of the survey captured socio-demographic information of respondents including age, gender, level of education and occupation.The DCE section presented respondents with eight choice tasks with each choice tasks containing three vaccines alternatives and a no-choice option. The vaccine alternatives were described by seven attributes and their corresponding levels ( Table 2) . Given the significant uncertainty regarding a potential COVID-19 vaccine, the attributes and levels used in the choice tasks were informed by a review of the literature, and judgement regarding what respondents were most likely to understand and consider plausible. For example, the levels for vaccine effectiveness reflect those of routine childhood vaccines in Australia.To determine the combination of attribute levels presented to respondents, a Bayesian D-efficient design with uniformly distributed priors was generated using Ngene [4] 2 . The design was programmed to ensure attribute level balance over alternatives, and to avoid dominated alternatives. The design was optimized using a generic algorithm employing 2000 Sobol draws (see [14] ). The Bayesian D-error for the design is 0.4468.The final experimental design contains forty individual choice tasks. Four tasks were drawn from these and designated as 'common' block and undertaken by all respondents. The remaining 36 tasks were grouped into 9 blocks with 4 choice tasks in each block. These blocks were then randomly assigned to respondents. Therefore, respondents undertook a total of eight tasks, the four choice tasks contained within the common block, and four choice tasks contained within the randomly allocated block. Fig. 1 provides an example of choice task presented in the questionnaire.Vaccine preferences are heterogeneous and exist on a continuum with active demand for vaccines at one end and complete refusal of all vaccines at the other [9, 38, 30] . To account for preference heterogeneity, a latent class model (LCM) has been used to identify preference segments within the sample (see [18, 34, 20] ). The theoretical foundation of the LCM assumes preferences are determined jointly by observable attributes and unobservable or latent heterogeneity [14] . Furthermore, it is assumed this latent 1 These responses were removed for speeding (completing the survey in less than 120 s) and inconsistent responses to open-ended type questions. heterogeneity reflects 'preference groups' or 'classes' within the sample and individuals can be sorted into these classes up to some probability. After determining the number of classes required to account for preference heterogeneity, the analyst can link the probability of class membership to covariates such as the sociodemographic characteristics of individuals. In additional to various statistical advantages (see Shen, 2009), the LCM provides the practical advantage of segmenting the population according to preferences which can be used to inform and guide policy development.The final specification of the LCM used in this analysis consists of a class assignment model, (1a) and (1b), and the choice model described by the class utility functions (2).where Cl 1 and Cl 2 are the class assignment functions for the classes 1 and 2 respectively and are described by are described by a constant term, and various socio-demographic characteristics. The assignment function for class 3 is set to zero as this is the reference class. After testing several specifications for the discrete choice component, the following utility model was estimated:where V is the observable (relative) utility and is function of a constant (b 0 ) and eight parameters (b 1 ; Á Á Á ; b 8 Þ measuring the effect of the vaccine attributes described in Table 2 . Finally, the superscript Cl refers to the latent class (Cl = 1, 2, 3).The results are presented in three sections. The first section reports preferences according to classes identified using the LCM. The second section provides a brief discussion on the marginal rate of substitution between vaccine characteristics, including willingness to pay measures. The final section reports the potential uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine under three scenarios.The results of the LCM are provided in Table 3 including the parameter estimates for the class assignment model, the discrete choice model (DCM) and the goodness of fit measures. As per (1a) and (1b), five socio-demographic variables were used to define three latent classes. Heterogeneous preferences between the three classes were found for the mild reactions, the mode of administration, location of administration, price and effectiveness attributes. There was no difference in preferences between classes for availability and severe reactions: irrespective of the class, Australian residents prefer a vaccine available in a shorter time, highlighting the immediacy due to the urgency of the situation; and lower instances of severe side effects.Older respondents and females are more likely to belong to Class 1 and Class 3 compared to Class 2. A higher income is more likely to be associated with Class 2, whilst being single was more likely to be associated with Class 1. Finally, full-time workers are more likely to belong to Classes 2 and 3. Respondents are not deterministically assigned to any specific class, but rather display a probability to belong to any class according to sociodemographic characteristics. The class assignment probabilities summary statistics are reported in Table 4 . Class 2 has the highest assignment probability with 61.56 percent of respondents assigned to this class on average, whilst Class 1 has the lowest assignment probability with 6.81 percent of respondents assigned to this class on average.The parameter measuring the number of cases of mild reactions to the vaccine was negative for respondents in Class 2 and Class 3, indicating a preference for lower instances of mild reactions, whilst the parameter for Class 1 was found not to be significantly different from 0 suggesting indifference to the occurrence of mild reactions. In the case of the vaccine administration, respondents in Class 2 and 3 have a preference for oral over intravenous, whilst respondents in Class 1 are indifferent between the two modes of administration. The three classes expressed strong differences in their preference for location. Class 1 prefers the vaccine to be administered at doctor's surgery, followed by pharmacies and lastly at hospitals; Class 2 prefers pharmacies over hospitals and doctor's surgery (these two locations share the same rank); Finally, respondents in Class 3 prefer hospitals over doctor's surgery. The parameter associated with the price attribute is similar for Class 1 and Class 2 with a preference for a lower, rather than higher price, all else being equal. Price was not relevant for Class 3. In terms of effectiveness, Class 2 and Class 3 prefer, a more effective vaccine whilst the same parameter is not significantly different from 0 for Class 1 indicating indifference towards the vaccine effectiveness.The parameters reported in Table 3 indicate the preferences at the population level given the three classes identified. No information on the individual specific preferences can be inferred by these coefficients. Using Bayes theorem, it is possible to compute the individual specific parameter estimates (see [12] ), which can then be used to derive individual marginal rates of substitutions (MRS). Given the linear functional form of the utility functions in the DCM, the MRS is calculated as the ratio of the two parameter estimates of interest. Whilst it is mathematically possible to derive the MRS for all possible combinations of attributes, some estimates are concep-tually more interesting and useful than others. Table 5 reports the average MRS between attributes relevant for this analysis.The estimated MRS can be interpreted as follows: where the MRS is positive, respondents are willing to increase the quantity of the column attribute by that amount for a reduction in the quantity of the row attribute by one unit. Conversely, where the MRS is negative, respondents are willing to increase the quantity of the column attribute by that amount for an increase in one extra unit of the row attribute. When the column attribute is Price, the MRS is expressed as a willingness to pay (WTP).All other things being equal, respondents are willing to pay $34.44 to reduce wait time until the vaccine is available by one month, willing to pay $41.94 to reduce the number of severe reactions by one individual in 10,000 and $23.92 to increase the effectiveness of the vaccine by one percent. Respondents are only willing to pay $1.42 to reduce the number of mild reactions experience by one individual in 10,000. The relative importance of safety, effectiveness and immediacy can also be expressed in terms of trade-offs.Respondents are willing to wait an additional 0.68 months on average (equivalent to approximately 21 days) to increase the effectiveness of the vaccine by one percent; or willing to wait an additional 0.04 (1.2 days) and 1.2 months (36 days) to reduce the number of cases reporting mild and severe side effects by one individual in 10,000 respectively. In terms of effectiveness, respondents are willing to trade an additional month until the vaccine is available to increase vaccine effectiveness by 1.54%. Similarly, respondents would be willing to substitute an increase of the effectiveness of the vaccine by 0.06% and 1.77% for an extra case reporting mild and severe side reactions, respectively. Respondents are willing to accept 25.42 additional cases of mild reactions per 10,000 to reduce the number of cases of severe reactions by 1 individual in 10,000. In terms of mild reactions, respondents are willing to trade an additional 19.08 cases per 10,000 to have the vaccine one month earlier and 15.59 cases to increase the effectiveness of the vaccine by one percent. In comparison, respondents would only trade 0.92 and 0.60 additional cases of a severe reaction in 10,000 to obtain the vaccine one month earlier or increase the effectiveness by one percent.To assess the expected uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine, a scenario analysis was undertaken for three hypothetical scenarios (Table 6) .Scenario 1 is based on the average levels of the continuous attributes. Under this scenario, the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine will be available in seven months, will only be available at doctors' offices via injection at a cost of $70. In terms of safety, 82.5 persons per 10,000 experience mild side-effects and 8.25 persons per 10,000 experience severe side effects and the effectiveness is 91.50%. Under this scenario, the estimated uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine will be 86.03%.In addition to the average scenario described above, the uptake under ''pessimistic"" and ''optimistic"" scenarios are also provided. The 'pessimistic' scenario uses the worst available attribute levels whilst the 'optimistic' scenario uses the best available attribute levels. These two scenarios are detailed in the last two columns of Table 6 . Under the 'pessimistic' and 'optimistic' scenarios, the expected uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is 20.95% and 99.56%, respectively.Vaccine uptake is a critical factor in the success of immunisation programs. Given increasing vaccine hesitancy and the accelerated development pathway of COVID-19 vaccines, insights into the heterogeneity of vaccine preferences during a global pandemic are of material value to public health officials and policy makers. The findings of this study reflect the individual preferences for a COVID-19 vaccine. Whilst we expect these results to be of interest of public health officials, they do not necessarily reflect public health priorities in Australia.This study has demonstrated that vaccine safety and effectiveness strongly influence vaccine preferences. These findings are consistent with those in other health policy settings such as influenza on a sample of health workers [25] , rotavirus on a sample of young parents [38, 31] , invasive pneumococcal disease on young mothers [31] , meningococcal B on Australian adults and adolescents [28] , hepathitis B on a sample of Chinese residents [13] and the South African population [38] .In addition to the above listed findings, from the analyses it emerges that respondents have a strong preference for vaccine immediacy, expressed as months until a vaccine is available. This result is not unexpected, given this study was undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic when it would be reasonable to expect higher relative preferences for immediacy.Although a direct comparison of the WTP values with other studies is difficult given the difference in diseases and treatment of attributes (e.g., [13] ), several studies have similarly reported positive and significant WTP for an increase in effectiveness and a decrease in adverse cases. For example, Determann et al. [7] found a positive WTP for a vaccine in three different hypothetical scenarios of outbreak (mild/moderate/severe pandemic) and Marshall et al. [28] found positive WTP values when the effectiveness of a vaccine for meningococcal B is above 80%. Guo et al. [13] compute WTP values for a change in effectiveness as well as for changes in the risk of side effects for a hepatitis B vaccine.The present study also reports the marginal rates of substitution (or trade-offs) between other vaccine characteristics. For example, the MRS between effectiveness and adverse cases suggests that respondents would be willing to accept 0.60 more cases reporting severe side effects (out of 10,000) to increase the vaccine effectiveness by one percent. Although the literature does not offer similar findings on COVID-19, other studies report the MRS between the risk of side effects and the other attributes. For instance, Veldwijk et al. [37] estimated the percentage of effectiveness for a vaccine against rotavirus (for their babies) that young parents are willing to trade to decrease the probability of serious side effects. Similarly, de Bekker-Grob et al. [5] calculated trade-offs between effectiveness of protection against cervical cancer and risk of serious side effects (mild and serious) on a sample of girls aged 12-16. Hofman et al. [15, 16] computed the same MRS on a sample of Dutch parents and girls aged 11-15 for a vaccine against papillomavirus.An estimate of trade-off between mild and severe adverse cases is also provided. In this regard, Australian residents would be willing to accept 25.42 more cases reporting mild side effects (out of 10,000) to reduce by one unit the number of serious side effects. A similar high trade-off has been reported by de Bekker-Grob et al. [5] , who estimated that girls would be willing to accept a steep increase (9.7%) risk of mild side effects to decrease the risk of serious side-effects. Other characteristics that could favour the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine are the administration mode and the location. Respondents expressed a strong preference for oral over intravenous administration. Although the diseases investigated are different, similar preferences have also been reported in the literature (see [30, 3] ). In terms of location, the Australian government would observe a larger uptake if allows pharmacies to administer the vaccines.By simulating the population's preference obtained through a LCM, the expected uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine under three different scenarios is estimated. The percentage of citizens that would get a vaccine varies from a minimum of around 21% to a maximum of almost full uptake, and the average scenario is estimated to be 86.03%. Unlike other studies conducted outside global pandemics, our results capture any perceptions of urgency that respondents may have had at the time the experiment was conducted. Unfortunately, perceptions of the urgency are not able to be controlled for due to the wide spread of COVID-19 and therefore the lack of a control counterpart. However, the expected uptake under the average scenario is consistent with that estimated by Determann et al. [7] , who found that 88% of the sample would accept a vaccination in a hypothetical severe pandemic outbreak.The expected uptake for a potential COVID-19 vaccine in the average scenario presented in this study is in line with other findings in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, Dadd et al.'s [6] is the only other study that investigates the Australian population and it reports an expected uptake of 85.80%. Other studies around the world report similar uptakes, ranging from 86% in UK [40] to 90.6% in Chile [11] . A more comprehensive survey conducted by Lazarus et al. [24] involving 35 countries across the globe estimates that on average 86% of the population would not oppose to a potential COVID-19 vaccine.The results reported in this study were derived from a representative sample of Australian residents in terms of gender and median income. The sample was subsequently weighted to reflect the age distribution of the population. Unfortunately, it was not possible to compare the sample to the population in regards to more specific traits, such as the rate of people having chronic diseases and of frontline workers because of lack of data. Further research could investigate the acceptance of a potential COVID-19 vaccine for these categories that are likely to receive the vaccine first.In this study, we identified the factors that would increase the vaccine uptake in Australia using a stated preference discrete choice experiment and a latent class model with three classes. We found that effectiveness of the vaccine has a positive impact on the individual utilities (the higher the better), whilst number of cases reporting mild and severe side effects, months until the vaccine is available and price have a negative effect (the lower the better). We provide different marginal rates of substitutions between the different attributes as well as forecast the uptake of the potential COVID-19 vaccine under three different scenarios.To achieve higher uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials should consider preferences for an oral COVID-19 vaccine over an injectable form. Although there was not a strong preference for location within the sample, a preference for pharmacies over hospitals and doctor's offices was found for class 2 in the LCM (this class is the most represented in the study). To increase uptake, the vaccine should therefore be made available at pharmacies in addition to hospitals and doctor's offices. Finally, public health officials should consider the willingness to trade additional cases of mild reactions for increased immediacy and effectiveness as well as a reduction in cases of severe reactions. The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.",Australia,abstract,2021-01-15,01
9c511091f7363c1d39b3bf11c01df2dcea73f657,An Australian diagnostic microbiology surge response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China in December 2019 and has subsequently spread around the world (Lu et al., 2020) , with a global pandemic declared in early March 2020 (Jin et al., 2020) .SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory illness (COVID-19) with symptoms including fever and cough (Guan et al., 2020) . Myalgia, expectoration, and dyspnea are less common . Chest computed tomography scanning reveals radiological findings of ground-glass opacity in individuals who develop severe respiratory disease (Guan et al., 2020) . While most individuals experience only mild disease, the elderly are particularly susceptible to COVID-19, experiencing higher mortality rates and more severe disease compared to young and middle-aged individuals (Liu et al., 2020) . To date, testing around the world has confirmed cases of approximately 27 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 globally (World Health Organisation 2020) with >900,000 deaths associated with this virus. Over half of these cases have been documented in North and South America.Rapid microbiology diagnostic laboratory testing has been at the forefront of global efforts to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections in individual patients, inform contact tracing efforts and local and national governments in developing public responses to the emergence of the different waves of the pandemic. The current gold standard for the laboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a real-time reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in specimens (e.g., nasal and/or throat swab) collected from patients (D'Cruz et al., 2020) . Since its discovery, a range of commercial SARS-CoV-2 specific-RT-PCR assays and diagnostic platforms have been rapidly developed and deployed to meet the significant global demands for COVID-19 testing. Fortunately, these assays have been reported to have high sensitivity and specificity (D'Cruz et al., 2020) . A role has also emerged for SARS-CoV-2specific serology, particularly in understanding the broader seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community (Theel et al., 2020) . Seroconversion typically occurs within 2 weeks, with the earliest positive results detected by 6 days and the latest by 21 days (Okba et al., 2020) . A 4-fold increase in IgG antibodies can be detected by Day 20 (Haveri et al., 2020) with a 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between acute and convalescent sera collection typically diagnostic of recent infection. Significant interest also exists for the potential use of point-of-care antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 to allow testing in the community rather than the laboratory, although concern exists over the quality of these assays and the studies evaluating them (Dinnes et al., 2020) .In Australia, the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in late January in Victoria. Large numbers of cases were attributed initially to returned travellers from countries with high disease prevalence, as well as cruise ship dockings including the Diamond and Ruby Princess Cruise Liners and outbreaks in aged care facilities (COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team 2020). While early control efforts were initially successful, lapses in the management of returned travelers with apparent concomitant failures to adhere to social distancing and other recommended infection control measures in the community, led to a rapid increase in cases in Victoria, Australia (COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team 2020). This meant that public health authorities had to enforce an extended period of control measures in this state, while the same measures were relaxed in other jurisdictions. A key foundation of these control measures has been high rates of community testing with >5 million SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests performed in Australia from the commencement of the pandemic to the August 16, 2020. The cumulative testing positivity from these samples was <0.3% (COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team 2020).The urgent need to significantly increase diagnostic microbiology testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic has been a challenge faced by urban and regional pathology services around the world. This experience is not a new one, however. During the H1N1 Influenza A pandemic in 2009, reference laboratories in the New York Metropolitan area experienced a 7.5-fold increase in demand for respiratory virus diagnostic testing as the pandemic spread through this region (Crawford et al., 2010) . In response, a range of initiatives were introduced to increase laboratory capacity rapidly, including workforce changes and modifications to the workflows for respiratory virus testing and reporting of diagnostic test results.In this outbreak study, we describe the surge response introduced by our Australian diagnostic microbiology laboratory to meet the urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing with optimized turnaround time, including the local experience, successes, and challenges of instituting and maintaining a new diagnostic platform in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.Our laboratory service of NSW Health Pathology (NSWHP) Nepean, provides diagnostic services for community facilities as well as 3 hospitals in the Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District (NBMLHD) situated in Western Sydney, Australia, with a total inpatient bed capacity of 745. The microbiology department routinely provides highly valuable diagnostic service, and houses an efficient, moderately sized molecular laboratory. Prior to the CoVID-19 pandemic this area was operational between 0830 and 1730 with one 100% full time (1.0 full time equivalent; 1.0 FTE) position allocated to molecular screening, filled from a rotation of 10 staff members with appropriate training. Molecular respiratory pathogen detection was performed using the AusDiagnostics Respiratory Pathogens B (16well), AusDiagnostics Atypical Pneumonia (8-well) and GeneXpert Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assays, and had an average throughput of 24 specimens per day.At the beginning of the pandemic all SARS-CoV-2 PCR requests processed by NSWHP Nepean were sent off-site to NSWHP Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research (ICPMR) Westmead until evaluation and commissioning of the AusDiagnostics SARS-CoV-2 panel by the NSWHP Nepean Microbiology Laboratory was completed on March 25, 2020.A total of 167 cases were confirmed positive at NSWHP Nepean for SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR testing between January 28 and May 15, 2020 with a total of 19,983 tests performed during the period reviewed in this study (Fig. 1) .Our first SARS-CoV-2 PCR request was received by the NSWHP Nepean Microbiology Laboratory on the 28 th of January, 2020. This sample was tested at NSWHP ICPMR Westmead and the result was negative. The first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the NBMLHD occurred on the March 9, 2020 from a close contact of a known COVID-19 case. Both samples were tested and confirmed by an in-house PCR platform at NSWHP ICPMR Westmead between March 1 and 20, 2020, there were a further 11 patients who tested positive, with equal numbers of returned travellers and known close contacts cases in Western Sydney (1 patient with no data recorded). The NSWHP Nepean Microbiology Laboratory commenced testing for SARS-CoV-2 using the AusDiagnostics High-Plex SARS-CoV-2, Influenza and RSV (8-well) assay (hereafter as AusDiagnostics assay) on the March 25, 2020.An influx of new cases was seen following the docking of the Ruby Princess Cruise Ship, a cruise ship which disembarked 2700 passengers into Sydney on the March 19, 2020. The first related case was diagnosed on the March 21, 2020. Cases in the NBMLHD continued to be observed until the April 21, with no deaths documented from this outbreak. During this time, ""Fever Clinics"" were established in the NBMLHD, prompting a significant increase in the requests for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from 43 in the week prior, to 822 and 1516 respectively in the subsequent 2 weeks, with a peak of 3738 requests in the first week of May. These clinics provided access to SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing for the general public who fulfilled the Communicable Disease Network Australia case definition of possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following the institution of testing, the number of SARS-CoV-2 PCR requests decreased by 33% as the case rate of COVID-19 decreased over the period of March 25 to April 8 compared with the week prior.On the April 11, 2020, a healthcare worker in a residential aged care facility was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The facility housed 102 residents at the time the outbreak was confirmed. A screening program was commenced on both symptomatic and asymptomatic residents and staff members, which led to a 5-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 requests between April 14 and 17, 2020. Two other cases of significant public health concern in the NBMLHD were diagnosed on April 24, one a health care worker in an unrelated aged care facility and another, a customer service employee. All aged care facility residents and staff, as well as contacts of both patients were tested. All SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were resulted negative. This influx of screening led to another peak in testing, with a new maximum of test requests of 601 on the April 29, 2020.Contact screening was also required following the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 on the April 28, 2020 in a 4-year-old attending a local childcare facility, with 84 adults and children undergoing testing. A local primary school also was exposed to an infected adult, diagnosed on the May 13, 2020, with testing performed on close contacts. All contacts for both exposures were negative. There were no further cases diagnosed after the May 13, 2020.NSW Health Pathology implemented a ""staged"" introduction of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing throughout NSWHP. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was commenced at our laboratory using a commercial assay developed by AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd on March 25, 2020. This assay uses the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a and ORF8 genes as targets to detect viral RNA using an existing molecular diagnostic platform. Between the March 10 and 20, 2020, the AusDiagnostics assay underwent an internal evaluation process, whereby 218 patient samples and 13 culture cell supernatants were tested and compared with the previously evaluated in house platform. This comparison revealed high concordance (99.1%) and an improved limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 compared to the in-house assays (unpublished observations). The assay was approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration on the March 22, 2020 (Kirkland and Frost, 2020) .In late April 2020, the GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges were supplied to NSW Health Pathology sites, which provided the benefit of rapid laboratory bench turnaround time (approximately 1 hour) from sample receipt to diagnostic test result. The testing kit had been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration on March 22, 2020. A local verification was performed to supplement an initial state-wide verification, prior to the commencement of testing on the April 25, 2020. These individual rapid GeneXpert SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were constrained by global supply chain issues and their use has been restricted to cases that require emergency results for therapeutic purposes or cases with large potential public health implications. A clinical vetting process by each laboratory was implemented at each local health district site to ration the use of the small vendor allocated GeneXpert cartridges.During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic were both local and national shortages of supplies that were critical to SARS-CoV-2 PCR based testing. This included flocked swabs, viral transport media (VTM), and extraction reagents required for SARS-CoV-2 PCR sample preservation and testing.The NSWHP Public Health Pathology division and the NSWHP Incident Management Team (for COVID-19) recognized the need to invest in staff, equipment and stock to facilitate a rapid increase in PCR requests. NSWHP recruited specific staff to manage surge capacity options and the regulatory requirements. The Principal Veterinary Virologist at the Department of Primary Industries veterinary laboratory in South-West Sydney, Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute (EMAI), was approached by NSWHP staff and the veterinary viral testing system was adapted to enable testing for human COVID 19 patient samples, under human diagnostic testing protocols and pathologist supervision. This cooperative arrangement provided test surge buffering for the state pathology laboratories when under pressure from local cluster and outbreak test surges.Chemical reagents, including the NUCLISENS Ò easyMAG Ò Extraction Buffer 1 required for RNA extraction had been depleted worldwide prior to commencement of SARS-CoV-2 testing at NSWHP Nepean in March 2020. It was predicted that, by early April 2020, there would be sufficient local RNA extraction reagent for only 3000 specimens if processed individually. To conserve reagents, sample pooling was evaluated and instituted, whereby up to 4 samples were able to be processed using the same amount of reagent as one specimen. Despite maximizing samples tested by pooling, reagent supply continued to be depleted due to worldwide shortages, and testing at NSWHP Nepean reached capacity. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was sent off-site to EMAI from the April 21, 2020 as per the surge capacity agreement detailed previously. All inpatient and health care workers samples were kept on-site at NSWHP Nepean to maintain short turnaround times for these critical samples. This service was further utilized during periods where on-site testing was unavailable due to failure of critical equipment and/or to conserve rapidly depleting reagents.Prior to the outbreak, UTM swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) were a main product used for viral PCR testing. In the initial period of the outbreak however, demand for these swabs outweighed the supply, with shortages on a local, state and national level. It was recognized that centralizing the process of procurement by NSW Health Pathology for products in serious short supply was critical. Local production of VTM was also investigated by NSW Health Pathology Public Health Pathology division (NSWHP PHP). Again, the established relationship with the Department of Primary Industries state reference testing laboratory, ""Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute"" was used to create a viral media manufacturing capability that could produce a well-characterized and validated VTM for SARS-CoV-2, as recently described (Kirkland and Frost, 2020) . NSW Health Pathology also established resilient international and national supply chains for dry swabs and then assembled appropriate kits to supply to the NSWHP sites including NSWHP Nepean until commercial supplies returned.Between January 28 and March 25, 2020, all SARS-CoV-2 PCR requests processed by NSWHP Nepean were sent to NSWHP ICPMR Westmead, with 4,273 tests were performed at and 104 SARS-CoV-2 positive results (2.4% positivity) identified at this facility. Between March 25 and the May 15, 2020, 9,998 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed at our laboratory (or NSWHP Nepean) with 160 positives identified (1.6%). There were 5712 SARS-CoV-2 tests between April 21 and May 15, 2020 sent offsite to EMAI as part of the surge response detailed in the previous section. Of these 13 samples (0.2%) were identified as positive.At the onset of testing, laboratory capacity for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was estimated to be 150 individually processed specimens per day. The AusDiagnostics assay primarily used for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing consisted of 8 wells and had the ability to process 24 single samples at one time. The theoretical turnaround time (TAT) from time of receiving a specimen at the laboratory specimen reception to verification of result was approximately 4 to 6 hours (including 115 −160 minutes of hands on-time), divided between a number of labor-intensive steps: (1) the manual receipt of samples in the Sample Reception Management section; specific worksheets and labels are then manually generated and applied to samples and associated tubes used through the screening process. Samples are then organized into racks for nucleic acid extraction (40−70 minutes); (2) manual pipetting of each sample while using the NucliSENS Ò easy-MAG Ò (bioM erieux Australia, Norwest, Australia) nucleic acid extraction kits (65−90 minutes); (3) manual preparation of the AusDiagnostics PCR reaction tubes (35−90 minutes); (4) automated amplification steps using the High-Plex machine with user transfer of plates between amplification steps (80−90 minutes); and (5) interpretation and reporting of results (5−10 minutes). As the outbreak evolved, a 2 to 3 hours TAT was maintained for samples from highly suspicious COVID-19 cases requiring urgent clearance.Turnaround times for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing changed over the period of testing described (Fig. 2) . Initially, TAT was >24 hours as samples from the NBMLHD had to be transported to NSWHP ICPMR Westmead. TAT during high demand periods was >24 hours. The longer TAT was due to samples requiring additional transport to NSWHP ICPMR Westmead (located 26 km from NSWHP Nepean), and the high demand testing across NSW. TAT, however, decreased once testing was moved on site. As a result of increasing issues with reagent shortages, sample pooling commenced on the March 26, 2020. Up to 4 patient samples were combined by adding 50 mL of each sample to a single well for nucleic acid extraction and the eluted products tested together. If a well of pooled samples was positive, each patient sample was re-extracted from the primary sample and tested separately. Following the introduction of this measure, testing capacity increased to over 600 specimens per day.The process of referring samples off-site to the Department of Primary Industries, state reference testing laboratory at EMAI, required approximately 1 week to embed and enabled surge testing to occur. Although the EMAI laboratory had a rapid turnaround time with large capacity, due to packaging and transport required for referral of samples to EMAI, the overall TAT average increased (Fig. 2) . Inpatient and critical results remained onsite for processing at NSWHP Nepean to optimize time to results, while ""Fever clinic"" and other outpatient samples were sent off-site. These critical samples were reported on average 5.8 hours faster when compared with samples sent off-site for routine testing, with the most apparent effect on TAT in late April to early May 2020.During the study period, NSW Health policy required repeated testing of health care workers and in-patients at Day 10 of illness, provided that they were asymptomatic within the previous 72 hours. Testing of samples from these patients, resulted in the detection of an additional 110 positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results. For the 29 individuals with multiple positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR samples tested on the AusDiagnostics assay, Ct values were compared and there was trend of overall increasing Ct over time (data not shown).Results from the AusDiagnostics assay were manually entered into the laboratory information system (Cerner Millennium PathNet, Cerner Corporation) by Medical Laboratory Technicians and Scientists. Positive results were then notified to the medical microbiologist on call, who subsequently notified the attending doctor. In the initial phase of testing, negative results were delivered to patients attending the Fever Clinics manually via telephoning patients, with a small task force enlisted comprising of 2 junior medial officers. This was continued until the March 13, 2020, when testing numbers increased to more than 200 per day, and a semiautomated text message service was developed.2.7. Changes to laboratory practice including opening hours, optimization of scientific staff rostering and training of addition laboratory staff in molecular diagnostics methodologiesPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the microbiology laboratory operated from 06:30 to 22:30 with the molecular section operating from 0830 to 1730 with a 1.0 FTE position dedicated to this section, filled from a roster of 10 qualified staff. On commencement of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, rostering hours were adjusted so that additional staff members, starting at 0630 and another at 14:00, were available to extend the operation of the molecular section to match the operating hours of the bacteriology section. Sample extraction was performed in the evening for sample analysis the following morning, which meant sample processing was still occurring even when the laboratory was not physically staffed. There was a significant increase in overtime worked in the study period, with a >1,000% increase compared with the same period in the previous year (270 hours in March−May 2020 versus 18 hours in March−May 2019). There was a 39% decrease in the hours taken in annual leave compared with the same period in the previous year. Due to the increased overtime and likelihood of ongoing demand for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, increased staffing levels were approved and positions for 2 additional 1.0 FTE laboratory technician positions were advertised for dedicated SARS-CoV-2 testing. All existing microbiology staff members were also trained in molecular diagnostics and were assessed via the standard laboratory competency process to increase the pool of available laboratory staff that could be rostered to perform SARS-CoV-2 PCR sample processing and testing.Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Nepean Laboratory performed molecular testing for respiratory pathogens that included the ",Australia,abstract,2021-01-16,01
69773ed627e3bea6a583c42dc6703f8163151d06,The Potential Use of Hypochlorous Acid and a Smart Prefabricated Sanitising Chamber to Reduce Occupation-Related COVID-19 Exposure,"The novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID- 19) has spread globally at an unprecedented rate with over 33 million infected cases and 1,012,341 deaths as of October 1, 2020. 1 In Australia, a suppression strategy has been adopted since the start of the pandemic with the aim of maintaining a low transmission rate close to 1 or below to make sure the healthcare system does not exceed its capacity and proper medical treatment is performed on infected patients. 2, 3 To date, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and risk factors associated with infection are not fully understood; however, a scientific brief conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the main modes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 include contact, droplet, airborne, fomite, fecal-oral and bloodborne with the potential for transmission between humans, mother-to-child and animal-to-human. 4, 5 While strategies with social distancing including different levels of lockdown, mask use and increased personal hygiene are effective in slowing the COVID-19 transmission rate, recent studies have provided evidence on transmission via aerosol 6, 7 or the fecal shedding of the virus, making toilets significant objects of transmission as they aerosolise some of the contaminants within faeces. 8 This indicates the need for further measures to effectively suppress the virus. Individual respiratory protective devices including N95 respirators and medical masks have been used as critical tools to protect healthcare workers against COVID-19. 9 However, studies have found increased levels of discomfort, including higher facial skin temperature and adverse skin reactions, and these could induce non-compliance. 10, 11 As SARS-CoV-2 is known to remain viable for hours in aerosols and for days on surfaces, 6 the importance of containment and prevention of cross-contamination in facilities with a high number of people frequently in contact with COVID-19 patients or people with high risk of carrying SARS-CoV-2 has been emphasised. Incorrect removal of personal protective equipment was known to contaminate 39% of healthcare workers with highly resistant micro-organisms. 12 These containment measures are critical to public health safety especially where movement restrictions are relaxed, and new waves of infection are observed. 13 These groups including doctors, nurses, aged-care workers, hospital staff or quarantine personnel. In the second wave of COVID-19 in Victoria, over 1,400 infected patients were healthcare workers and 70-80% of them were infected at work (as of August 27, 2020). 14 This alarming infection rate not only puts the staff's health at risk but also hinders the response of the health service as trained professionals are isolated instead of giving care to patients. Particularly, more than 600 staff at Frankston Hospital, Victoria were in isolation following an outbreak at the facility. 15 We have initiated a project on the development of a smart prefabricated sanitising chamber (SPSC) by way of aerosolised sanitation to disinfect COVID-19 exposed workers with minimal interruption of their operation and prevent cross-contamination. By minimising potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 at critical facilities such as COVID-19 treatment clinics and quarantine buildings for returned travellers, the use of the smart prefabricated sanitising chamber will help to prevent transmission into the broader community. Finding a suitable sanitiser is crucial to achieve a practical design for a SPSC (Figure 1 ).Wickramatillake and Kurukularatne 16 analysed the viricidal efficacy of chloroxylenol, benzalkonium chloride and common bleaches against SARS-CoV-2, showing their effectiveness after 5 minutes of treatment. Hydrogen peroxide was also found to be used as a disinfectant against COVID-19 but this disinfectant has high reactivity and can act as a powerful oxidiser with metals. 16 However, no commercially available data were shown on the efficacy of these disinfectants in aerosolised form or potential health impacts related to inhalation or contact with the skin. We have reviewed the evidence on the efficacy of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in different settings via different applications and compared bactericidal and viricidal activity of hypochlorous acid to other disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), the most widely used disinfectant in the food industry, at the same free chlorine concentration.HOCl is a weak acid which interacts with structural proteins such as the capsid or surface compounds, lipid envelope and DNA/RNA materials of viruses. 17 The stability of HOCl is preserved by maintaining an optimal pH range of 3.5-5.5. HOCl can be generated by one of three methods: hydrolysis of chlorine gas, electrolysis of salt water, and acidification of hypochlorite. HOCl can be readily sourced commercially or generated inhouse. HOCl is listed in List N: Disinfectants for Use Against Table 1 ). 18 Disinfectants and disinfection techniques should be safe for a long exposure time on personnel, equipment and surfaces used in the fight against coronavirus. Disinfection technologies for indoors are important to reduce transmission, especially in crowded settings. HOCl has been proposed as an effective disinfectant in various settings from food production, handling and preparation (farming and hospitality industry) to healthcare applications, including chronic wound care and eyelid infection management, as listed Table 2 . [19] [20] [21] Efficacy While most disinfectants are tested or studied in their liquid form on non-porous surfaces, the viricidal/bactericidal efficacy of HOCl has also been studied when used in aerosolised/sprayed form and on porous surfaces. Hakimullah et al. 17 present a comprehensive insight into the efficacy of HOCl in spray form to inactivate Escherichia coli and Salmonella with an effective concentration of 50-100 ppm on rayon fabric. Another study 22 found that HOCl exhibited higher bactericidal activity (4.4 log 10 CFU/mL) compared with NaOCl (1.3 log 10 CFU/mL) with the same concentration of 0.5 mg/L. Results from spray experiments 12 also showed that 20-minute exposure to sprayed HOCl of 0.01% was sufficient to reduce 99.5% of Staphylococcus epidermidis.Another study by Wang et al. 23 found the potential pharmaceutical application of stabilised HOCl in the control of soft tissue infection with a kill time of less than 2 minutes for 19 out of 20 pathogens. HOCl also had a shorter kill time than NaOCl and H 2 O 2 . Hao et al. 24 recommended the use of HOCl as a mouth wash and hand sanitiser (at 100-200 ppm) and for surface application. They also recommended spray or fog application with an aerosol size of less than 20 μm, due to the fact that smaller particles in spray form may help HOCl molecules to be suspended in the air for a longer duration. This low settling velocity rate may increase the solution's chance of coming into contact with pathogens and inactivating them. When the aerosol was not sprayed directly onto an inoculated surface, a lower amount of solution had a chance to come into contact with the avian influenza virus. It required at least 10 minutes of contact to be effective. 24 Another work 25 also found the effective concentration of HOCl to be 200 ppm in decontaminating inert surfaces carrying noroviruses and other enteric viruses in a 1-minute contact time. When diluted 10-fold, HOCl solutions at 20 ppm were still effective in decontaminating environmental surfaces carrying viruses in a 10-minute contact time.Disinfection in the form of an effective surface disinfectant, hand hygiene or air disinfection, is the major preventive measure in containing the novel coronavirus. High-risk exposed surface areas need to be cleaned frequently with a suitable disinfectant. The characteristic features of an ideal disinfectant are a low contact time with significant antiviral activity with it being safe for humans, the environment, surfaces and With several studies on the sanitising power and effect of HOCl, it has been shown to eliminate viruses, bacteria and spores at an acceptable reduction log with effective concentration of as low as 20 ppm and a kill time as low as 1 minute. Further research is required to determine the optimum exposure time with non-direct contact spray HOCl to ensure the viricidal efficacy in settings such as the proposed SPSC.In terms of the safety and toxicity owing to the potential direct contact with ocular, skin and respiratory systems, stabilised HOCl has been found to be non-irritating (rabbit eye) and non-sensitising (guinea pig) in animal models. No ocular irritation was observed when 0.013% HOCl was sprayed into the eyes of Dutch pigmented rabbits every 8 hours for 72 hours. 23 Guinea pigs showed no evidence of dermal reaction when concentrations of 0.01%, 0.03%, and 0.10% w/v stabilised HOCl were applied topically. A 28-day toxicity study with the same concentrations as the dermal study showed no evidence of systemic toxicity. 23 HOCl was also found to be an effective disinfectant that was 80-200 times more effective than standard disinfecting procedures while being non-toxic to humans. 26 Van Doremalen et al. 6 and Galvin et al. 27 recommended HOCl use for offices with an emphasis on its use for dental clinics and the importance of fog or mist application 28 of the disinfection given the aerosol property of the virus.HOCl is safe and non-toxic for human and environmental use. It is also inexpensive with the flexibility of applying methods (spray mist, fog, liquid) which makes it an appropriate candidate as a choice of disinfectant for indoor settings on a regular basis. The presence of organic and reducing agents significantly reduces the effectiveness of hypochlorous acid 21 and this is an area that needs to be studied further to provide robust conclusions. This review recommends further study in regard to the safety of HOCl with mist and fog application on respiratory system, skin and eyes, in the smart prefabricated sanitising chamber setting, acknowledging that the deployment of Brio HOCL™ inactivates viruses, bacteria, endospores, and fungi and is safe for human tissues (including eye, lung, and skin). 29 It should be noted that mist applications have already been approved for eyelid infection management, 20 skin 23 and cosmetics 30 with repeated daily exposure for a set period of time. Other reviews by Block and Rowan 31 and Scarano et al. 32 found that hypochlorous acid had high predictability and low cost to disinfect against COVID-19 in oral-maxillofacial clinics by spraying small aerosol Wound care agent and topical application Wang et al., 23 Rasmussen and Williams, 29 Del Rosso and Bhatia 30 Mouth wash and hand sanitizer Hao et al. 24 Biosecurity enhancement in poultry production Hakim et al. 17 Decontamination agent against Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli on fresh beefCap et al. 21 Disinfecting dental unit water lines Martin and Gallagher 19 Cleaning and disinfecting GI endoscopic procedure rooms Overholt et al. 26 Mist application for enclosed area Galvin et al. 27 General surface disinfectant Hakim et al., 17 Hao et al. 24 Rasmussen and Williams 29 particles. This review calls for more investigations into the effect of HOCl in mist and fog form on the skin, eyes, and respiratory system when exposed in the proposed smart prefabricated sanitising chamber, especially in the presence of organic substances.In this review on the use of stabilised hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as a potential disinfecting agent for the smart prefabricated sanitising chamber application, the current evidence on the viricidal efficacy, safety, and toxicity are presented. HOCl stabilised at the pH of 3.5-5.5 is a weak acid which interacts with structural proteins or viral materials to inactivate micro-organisms. HOCl is currently a disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 approved by the US Environmental Protection Association under different brands. HOCl with a concentration as low as 20 ppm was found to be effective in disinfecting surfaces including porous rayon. Aerosolised or sprayed HOCl is effective in eliminating micro-strains such as Staphylococcus epidermidis after an exposure of 1 min to 20 mg/L (equivalent to 20 ppm). The safety and non-toxicity for humans and the environment, the low cost, and the flexibility of applying methods make HOCl an appropriate candidate of disinfectant for indoor settings such as offices, hospitals, and healthcare clinics. Further investigations into the effect of HOCl in mist and fog form on the skin, eyes, and respiratory system especially in special settings such as the proposed smart prefabricated sanitising chamber with presence of organic materials is recommended.",Australia,first author,2021-01-22,01
fe8881c99772de281af59d149265e87a73f21ae7,Designing video feedback to support the socioemotional aspects of online learning,"situation, these instructors are likely to have focused primarily on successfully transitioning face-to-face learning and assessment activities to the online context (Hill, 2020) . As such, they may have had lacked capacity to consider how best to support the socioemotional aspects of learning in this new environment (Heitz, Laboissiere, Sanghvi, & Sarakatsannis, 2020) . Perhaps unsurprisingly, anecdotal evidence suggests that many students who made the rapid mandated shift to online learning experienced feelings of displacement, social isolation, and demotivation (Hall & Batty, 2020; Yamin, 2020) . For some students, these feelings may have been exacerbated by anxiety associated with the pandemic.According to a study by Borup, West, and Thomas (2015) , instructors may be able to bolster socioemotional outcomes for students by making relatively simple design choices in relation to assessment feedback. More specifically, the study found that online students felt more supported, valued and encouraged when instructors provided assessment feedback in the form of asynchronous video recordings rather than text (for a more detailed review of the cognitive and socioemotional impacts of video feedback, see Mahoney, Macfarlane, & Ajjawi, 2019). The socioemotional affordances of video feedback can be interpreted in terms of media richness theory (Daft & Lengel, 1986) , which argues that video feedback conveys rich conversational cues that are not available in text, such as tone and pace of voice, facial expressions and body language. The purpose of this short response is to briefly review the work of Borup et al. (2015) , and in doing so, highlight three key design considerations for the use of video feedback to support positive socioemotional impacts (for additional design considerations relating to video feedback, see Thomas, West, & Borup, 2017) .First, video feedback can and should feature qualitatively different messages than textbased feedback. Content analysis conducted by Borup et al. (2015) showed that text-based feedback tended to feature comments that highlighted specific strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement in relation to the task. In contrast, video feedback more frequently included general and specific praise for the students' work, as well comments aimed at strengthening the relationship between the instructor and student (e.g., use of the student's name). As shown in the broader feedback and online learning literature, both praise and relational comments are useful for improving social presence, strengthening feelings of trust, and helping students feel supported and motivated (Plante & Asselin, 2014; Yang & Carless, 2013) .Second, the use of video feedback should be timed judiciously within the teaching period. Borup et al. (2015) and others (e.g., Crow & Murray, 2020) argue that it is important for instructors to foster a sense of community and belonging in the first few weeks of the teaching period. Furthermore, students may obtain a greater sense of value, support, and social presence when feedback on assessment tasks is provided in a timely manner (Crow & Murray, 2020; Plante & Asselin, 2014) ; in their study, Borup et al. (2015) asked instructors to return feedback comments no more than 1 week after assessment submission. Therefore, in the context of a rapid shift to online learning, students may feel more valued and motivated if they received short, personalised, and positively framed video feedback recordings soon after the shift occurs (e.g., a week after submission of the next assessment task following the shift).Third, video feedback may be more impactful for certain types of students than others. For example, students who are generally moderate-to-high achievers, but who have performed poorly on an assessment task after the rapid shift to online learning (presumably due to health or wellbeing issues) may benefit from the more personalised and supportive style of communication that video feedback affords (Borup et al., 2015) . In these circumstances, Borup et al. (2015) argue that it is important for instructors to be highly cognizant of keeping their body language, expression, and tone of voice positive, so as not to unintentionally convey information that could be interpreted as negative or discouraging.These three design considerations offer instructors guidance for the creation of video feedback recordings in the context of the rapid shift to online learning caused by COVID-19. However, there are two main limitations of the study by Borup et al. (2015) that should be addressed. First, the study was performed across several blended delivery subjects, where students also had the option to attend face-to-face classes. This context differs from the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where online learning and social isolation was unexpected and mandated. Further research is therefore needed to examine the efficacy of the design considerations discussed here in wholly online environments, particularly in situations where both instructors and students had expected to be working in face-to-face modes of delivery. Second, the authors failed to measure the perception and opinions of students from equity groups or diverse cultural backgrounds, or those who had accessibility issues, English-language challenges, or special learning needs. In fact, this is a widespread limitation of the video feedback literature in general, and is deserving of further empirical attention. In particular, additional qualitative studies are needed to explicate whether there are unique needs, perceptions, and preferences among these types of students in relation to online learning and video feedback, and whether their socioemotional needs when studying online differ from the rest of the cohort.conflicts of interest The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.Research involving human participants and/or animals This research did not involve human or animal participants.Informed consent This research did not involve human or animal participants.",Australia,first author,2021-01-11,01
c5062d976f91bcf634f3e8768e486f3edb4a0075,"Control of COVID-19 in Australia through quarantine: the role of special health accommodation (SHA) in New South Wales, Australia","The first COVID-19 cases in Australia were diagnosed on 25 January 2020 in Victoria and NSW. By the end of March 2020 there were 2182 confirmed cases in NSW from 217,030 tests performed [1] . Initial epidemiology showed that the majority of confirmed cases were amongst recent arrivals from overseas and their contacts [2] . Due to this a major feature of Australia's public health response to SARS-CoV-2 has been to restrict population movements, especially through international travel, with the use of legislated quarantine. Quarantine refers to the separation of those that have been exposed to a disease but are not yet symptomatic from others who are susceptible to the disease (close contacts). Isolation refers to the process where people who have been diagnosed with the disease (cases) are separated from those who are not infected. Widespread use of quarantine in Australia has not occurred since the Influenza pandemic of 1918, when Maritime quarantine commenced on 17 October 1918 prior to the first cases of influenza in January 1919 [3, 4] .In addition to quarantine, other public health measures to control COVID- 19 have been implemented such as early and increased case detection through testing, tracing of contacts of confirmed cases, social distancing and prohibition of gatherings [5, 6] . Australian modelling studies showed that in order to mitigate disease spread in Australia, isolation, quarantine and social distancing were required to ensure that Intensive Care Units (ICU) and the hospital system more broadly were not overwhelmed by a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases [7] [8] [9] ..In countries that introduced quarantine as part of their containment strategy, it was recognised that there was a need for a health facility that could manage non-COVID related medical illnesses in those subject to quarantine, as well as ensuring appropriate implementation of the other public health measures required for containment [10] [11] [12] . These measures have been combined in the Special Health Accommodation (SHA), a service that provides a quarantine environment with the ability to test suspected cases, clinically manage suspected and confirmed cases and cohort individuals in a supportive setting. The aim of this paper is to describe the new approach to quarantine developed in the SHA, the first Australian ""health hotel"" for COVID-19-related isolation, quarantine and clinical management, and to document the initial occupancy and COVID-19 management.The NSW Government issued multiple Orders under the Public Health Act regarding COVID-19 restricting movement of returned travellers. The first Order, on 17 March, 2020, mandated self-quarantine for 14 days for any returned travellers to NSW [13] . Australian borders were closed to non-citizens and residents from 9 pm AEDT Friday, 20 March, and a further Order, on 29 March, enforced mandatory quarantine in a quarantine or medical facility for 14 days after arriving in NSW by air or sea [14, 15] .The Sydney Local Health District (SLHD) had established an accommodation service for community members who were required to isolate or quarantine due to COVID-19 in February 2020. However, when the mandatory quarantine order was enacted on 29 March, SLHD rapidly extended the existing health accommodation service to establish the SHA, a unique service designed to support those affected by the NSW public health response to COVID-19. The existing service had been responsible for housing the majority of displaced people from the community in NSW who could not effectively quarantine and isolate following earlier COVID-19 Public Health Orders [16] . It was broadened to include those now subject to the Public Health Orders (COVID-19 Air Transportation Quarantine and COVID-19 Maritime Quarantine) that mandated quarantine in a quarantine or medical facility for returned travellers.Since 29 March 2020 returning travellers to NSW have been assessed and triaged for allocation to appropriate accommodation by trained NSW Health officials. Returned travellers are triaged for accommodation according to their state of health on arrival. Asymptomatic returned travellers are managed in accommodation for quarantine that is run by NSW Police and supported by the NSW State Health Emergency Operations Centre (SHEOC) and Health Care Australia. Returning travellers symptomatic of an influenza-like-illness (ILI) are tested for COVID-19 with a nasopharyngeal swab through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNA). The triage process for allocation to these services from arrival is outlined in Fig. 1 .The SHA provides comprehensive health care services to people that either have COVID-19, are at risk of having COVID-19 or who have complex health needs that are not appropriate for management in the Police managed Quarantine Hotels. The SHA also cares for people from the community who are COVID-19 positive or close contacts of people who are COVID_19 positive and are unable to self-isolate at home. Patients are transferred to Royal Prince Alfred (RPA) Hospital if their condition deteriorates and they are unable to be safely managed in the SHA. By mid-April the accommodation comprised of five repurposed hotel facilities that were negotiated for use by the SLHD. On arrival at the SHA the incoming travellers are met by a nurse in personal protective equipment (PPE) and are then escorted and orientated to their accommodation. There is a 356 room capacity with single, double and family configured accommodation options, specifically designed to ensure that the needs of different traveller groups can be appropriately managed.All travellers quarantined in the SHA are considered virtual patients with an electronic medical record, and their care is managed by health professionals. There is strict physical separation of the patient cohorts on different floors of the service. Stringent infection control protocols and measures are in place with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) used for all staff and patient encounters due to the high risk of development of COVID-19 of those quarantined in the accommodation, and for the management of the confirmed COVID-19 cases completing their isolation. Both contact and droplet precautions and aerosol precautions are used in the SHA, according to the infection control protocol.This service is unique in the state and is able to house any person who enters Australia through NSW. This includes Australian citizens, permanent residents and overseas residents who are returning to Australia. Anyone admitted to the SHA is required to be ambulant, have the capacity to manage their own medications and any pre-existing conditions should be suitable for remote medical management. If any person becomes significantly unwell during their quarantine period, they are remotely assessed by the rpavirtual medical team and then transferred by ambulance to RPA Hospital Emergency Department if they require a higher level of clinical care.The SLHD established a comprehensive governance structure ( Fig. 2) for the SHA to ensure both medical and Public Health matters were managed appropriately. The managers at each site report to the General Manager of the SHA, who is responsible for the planning, directing and ongoing management of the operations. Medical governance is provided by the A/Clinical Director of rpavirtual, the 24/7 virtual hospital service in the SLHD. There is a high level of oversight from the Chief Executive (CE) of the SLHD regarding decisions made within the service. This includes advice regarding appropriate selection and allocation of accommodation, initial investigations for those that become medically unstable and for all patient discharges. Routine data collection of any returned traveller is managed through the SLHD Executive to ensure that appropriate systems review and quality assurance reviews can take place.As outlined in Fig. 2 , a variety of health care workers are on site 24/7 in the SHA. Registered nurses (RN) and assistants-in-nursing (AIN) are present 24/7 on site for health care needs. Additional staff include: the Site Manager, Accommodation Assistant, receptionist, cleaning staff and the building manager. Allied health staff on site consist of dieticians, social workers, psychologists, physiotherapists and speech pathology staff. They are able to cater to the varied needs of the residents as they arise.All staff wear appropriate PPE and their designation is indicated by a sticker so that all patients are aware of the staff they may interact with. Any staff that enter the site answer screening questions for COVID-19 that include symptoms and possible exposures as per the NSW Health Guidelines [17] . Staff who are symptomatic, have been to an identified COVID-19 hotspot or are a close contact of a COVID-19 case are not allowed entry and are required to undergo risk assessment and COVID-19 testing prior to returning to work. NSW Police and security staff monitor the perimeter of the facilities to protect staff, the patients and the community in the event of patients not complying with quarantine requirements. They do not routinely enter the facility unless requested and supervised by clinical staff in the event of an emergency.Clinical management of patients who are positive for COVID-19 occurs through rpavirtual and the SLHD Public Health Unit (PHU). rpavirtual is a virtual hospital operating from SLHD's RPA Hospital campus. This service provides remote, around-the-clock care for COVID-19 and other patients. It is supported by RPA Hospital specialists with an on-call roster for all sub-specialties. The joint management by clinical teams and the PHU is to ensure that patients' clinical needs are met and that appropriate Public Health Guidelines for isolation and clearance testing are applied to each case following their diagnosis. rpavirtual supports both the physical and mental health of these patients, and also provides advice for their families. Soon after implementation of virtual care for COVID-19 patients and in response to the levels of stress and anxiety displayed by patients in SHA quarantine, rpavirtual introduced a roster of psychologists and social workers. If any patient in the accommodation service becomes medically unstable and requires an escalation of their care this is co-ordinated with the rpavirtual Clinical Director, the PHU, NSW Ambulance service and the Emergency Department of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.Welfare checks for all patients in the SHA are undertaken twice daily by qualified nursing staff. These take place through phone call and text messaging, dependent upon the preference of the patient. If there is no reply from the patient then this is escalated to an in-person room check to ensure they are well. Adjustment to the loss of individual autonomy and uncertainty around their individual health has meant that a large range of issues are managed by these staff. The rare episodes of aggressive behaviour are escalated through security as required, and questioning of quarantine requirements is locally managed and then escalated to the Public Health Unit as required.Discharge management of all persons in the SHA occurs in conjunction with the PHU. Each person's individual circumstances are reviewed by rpavirtual, the PHU and the SLHD Executive team to confirm they have met the current recommendations in the COVID-19 Series of National Guidelines and that in approving discharge relevant Public Health Orders are followed [18] . For families with discordant test results, a discharge process is worked out with the family members, to ensure that the case has fulfilled criteria for clearance, and any exposed family members undergo the appropriate 14 day quarantine from their last exposure to the case. The evolution of the discharge process has involved communications with the NSW Ministry of Health and other jurisdictions within Australia, as many people in the SHA do not live within the Sydney Metropolitan area. Discharge planning has required co-ordination with both clinical and public health services in travellers' relevant jurisdictions for them to be able to return to their homes given the current varying travel restrictions and Public Health Orders that exist within Australia.Data reported represent the accommodation occupancy from 29 March 2020 to 29 April 2020. The total number accommodated in the SHA during this time period was 520, with 464 patients returned travellers, and 56 community patients from the SLHD. Community patients in the SHA consisted of people from within the SLHD and those from other sources such as cruise ships. The median age of patients in the SHA service was 35, ranging from 2 months to 86 years. Forty-six patients were children aged less than 18 years. There was an even distribution of gender with 182 female and 191 male patients. Returning travellers came from 5 international regions. The majority returned from North America 34% (n = 128) and Europe 30% (n = 113). In this timeframe cumulatively 9661 returned travellers were resident in the accommodation service managed by SHEOC.A total of 373 people were admitted to the SHA directly from the airport. Of these 337 were symptomatic and tested for COVID-19, the remaining 36 were accompanying family members. From those who were swabbed 88 (26.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV 2, representing 0.87% of the total 10,034 returning air travellers to NSW in this time period. During the same period 902 people of the total 9661, (9.3% of occupancy) in the SHEOC Accommodation were swabbed and 76 people were transferred from SHEOC Accommodation to the SHA during their 14-day quarantine period due to need for remote medical care or a positive COVID-19 swab result. Of all the positive cases in the SHA the day of positive diagnosis varied from Day 1 to Day 13 of their quarantine period. 63.6% (n = 56) of these were diagnosed as positive in the first week of quarantine.Fifty per-cent of people in SHA were referred to rpavirtual for ongoing clinical care, whether due to their positive status, or the need for other medical or allied health assistance. Seven of the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 became medically unstable and required admission to RPA Hospital for ongoing medical care. The distribution of positive results by arrival location is shown in Table 1 .During this time frame 284 of the 373 residents were discharged from the accommodation. The average length of stay in the SHA was 14.86 days (not including patients exempt from quarantine in NSW). The total quarantine length in any accommodation for patients was 16.17 days (including SHEOC accommodation stay). The average length of stay for the 72 discharged positive patients up to 30 April 2020 was 19.21 days (14-28 days).The discharge address location for the patients varied. 58.4% (n = 218) returned to a NSW address and the rest to interstate addresses with the majority to Queensland 19% (n = 70) and 9% (n = 32) from Victoria.An estimated 20% of patients reported concerns about their quarantine period to the SHA management. There were a total of 29 formal incidents notified through the internal SLHD system in this time -14 complaints, 6 security, 5 accident/ occupational health and safety incidents, 3 aggression and 1 fall. On site police were involved in 5 incidents due to aggression from the patients that required escalation.Australia's COVID-19 pandemic response has posed unique challenges as well as opportunities for containment in the island nation. Australia has not faced a challenge to its population that has required this since the Influenza outbreak in 1918 [3] . Australia's COVID-19Public Health approach has been based on containment, as there is currently no effective vaccination or specific therapeutic options. Containment strategies such as quarantine, isolation, early case detection through testing and contact tracing, restriction of gatherings and implementation of social distancing are aimed at reducing person to person transmission as well as fomite transfer [19] . Modelling data which predicted the potential numbers of cases, deaths and impact on health service capacity informed the decisions to implement strong containment strategies and in particular, restrictive border measures, first with restriction of travel from China and then more broadly when analysis of transmission identified travel from other countries and cruise ships as factors introducing the epidemic in Australia [20] [21] [22] .The establishment of the SHA meant that quarantine isolation and management of suspected and confirmed cases, as well as management of close contacts could be comprehensively carried out for the returned traveller group. In NSW prior to the introduction of self-isolation for all returning travellers, notified cases were rapidly increasing, with 58% of cases comprising of returned travellers or their contacts up to 30 April 2020. After the closure of Australia's borders on 20 March 2020, there was a gradual decrease in overall case numbers that was further reduced by the introduction of mandatory hotel quarantine on 29 March. Community transmission was also shown to decrease after this time [13] . Thus quarantine and isolation of returned travellers was a vital part of the Public Health response in mitigating COVID-19 spread in NSW and Australia.The demographics of the returning traveller group reflected that when the borders were closed many families were attempting to return home with their children, and that older travellers and overseas residents were also returning to Australia. The broad age range also influenced the need for a 'health hotel' service, as shown by 51% of returned travellers requiring referral to rpavirtual for some form of remote medical care, with less than half of these being related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.The ability to monitor the health and wellbeing of the patients in the accommodation also meant that early case detection was optimised for an at-risk population. By April 292,020 Australia had performed 544,410 COVID 19 tests with 1.2% of these positive. This represents coverage of approximately 2.1% of the Australian population [23, 24] . Our findings showed that 0.87% of returned travellers in the first month of the SHA tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the Australian positive rates. The availability of testing within the SHA and the accommodation facilities managed by SHEOC throughout the quarantine period meant that new cases could be identified, isolated in an appropriate facility and managed clinically, while preventing ensuring separation from any accompanying at risk family members. The wide range of date of detection found in the returned travellers highlights the need for routine testing at the beginning and end of their quarantine period. Isolation of confirmed cases of COVID-19 until they had been clinically cleared by rpavirtual and the PHU meant that both the needs of the individual and the community were managed. The small number of people that required in hospital care returned to the SHA after discharge for any ongoing quarantine or clearance requirements after their admission.Establishing a health service with multiple stakeholders and an evolving public health policy environment ""on the run"" was not without difficulty. The requirement to mobilise and provide a quarantine accommodation service required rapid recruitment and organisational management from NSW Health, NSW Police and the SLHD. Co-ordination and consistency of the aims of the accommodation was needed to follow the appropriate Public Health Orders as well as providing a high standard of clinical care for any unwell patients. At times, issues were identified only when problems or challenges arose, requiring a flexible, dynamic approach to management.The ability to cater for individual needs was bound by the legal responsibility to ensure that the Public Health Orders were appropriately applied to every individual in the service in order to protect the needs of the community. Compulsory quarantine and isolation ensured that the welfare of the community was prioritised, however balancing the needs of the individual and the community was challenging. The heterogeneity of the patients within the SHA and their varying needs required adaptability and daily review of all patients to ensure that their individual needs were met. The length of stay within the SHA varied considerably due to the timing of diagnosis, length of illness and recovery period that allowed clearance for discharge following the COVID-19 Series of National Guidelines [18] . Length of stay was also increased for family members that required extended quarantine after being exposed to a family member that subsequently swabbed positive for COVID-19. This was one of the challenging aspects of introducing and managing the SHA. SHA management estimated that 20% of patients escalated concerns regarding their quarantine period, however it is likely the true number is at least 50% due to the frequency of patients raising concerns with onsite staff that were not required to be escalated to more senior managers. Compliance with quarantine in previous International examples has varied significantly, and the number of those questioning their quarantine period potentially reflects those that would not adhere appropriately in the community.Understandably, individuals wished to advocate for themselves and their families regarding the conditions of their stay and these concerns needed to be adequately and sensitively addressed. According to the SHA management team, those that challenged their quarantine had four broad reasons for questioning their requirements to follow the Public Health Order. Unfortunately, many patients became verbally aggressive and emotional in this process.Poor understanding of risk for themselves and the community led to many people questioning why they needed to follow the Public Health Order, requiring further detailed discussion. The degree of illness experienced was influential -whether they were symptomatic and requiring a swab, negative or a case that was diagnosed as positive. Those that had mild symptoms seemed more likely to question the need to comply with the Public Health orders and to express dissatisfaction with their care. Some people understood the risks but formed the opinion that the risk did not apply to them. Some questioned the ethics and legality of the Public Health orders as they had been written and the application of them to their individual situation. Many people also found quarantine challenging to maintain due to their personal or family circumstances.The importance of clear and consistent communication, and the provision of information has been shown to be important for the wellbeing of those adhering to quarantine [25] . When queries and concerns were raised, decision makers had the dual pressures of ensuring a timely and appropriate response for staff and patients, and navigating the potential ongoing implications of any decision made on the service and on the community. As the service has evolved, communication channels have become better understood and managed. The clear governance structure and delineation of roles within the management of the service allowed any issue that arose to be managed in a co-ordinated fashion, involving the General Manager of the service, the Public Health Unit, rpavirtual and the Chief Executive of the SLHD.We have described the evolution of a unique health and accommodation service that required rapid recruitment and organisational management from NSW Health, NSW Police, Health Care Australia and the SLHD. This occurred in response to the need to follow the appropriate Public Health Orders while providing a high standard of clinical care for unwell patients. The current Public Health orders that exist in NSW and around Australia restricting the freedom of movement of individuals have not been in place in living memory for the majority of the population.The SHA is a novel and important demonstration of the application of the Public Health principle of quarantine in contributing to the containment of COVID-19 in NSW, Australia. The learning from this process of establishment and management of the service is invaluable for any future disease outbreak requiring widespread quarantine and isolation in the population.Ongoing review of the SHA is being undertaken to ensure that improvements to the service can be made for patients, staff and management. Long term follow up of the patients is planned to evaluate the impact of the quarantine on the health and social circumstances of the patients and staff involved in the service.",Australia,abstract,2021-01-27,01
f5f753566dab35b6010143a8e8addeafcf22a68c,Now we are 30: 10 more years of MASCC,"In 2010, Cindy Rittenberg and colleagues published the oral history of MASCC (Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer) from its incorporation in 1990 and its first meeting as MASCC in 1992 [1] . It was written from the experiences of the founders and leaders of that time. The next 10 years from 2010 can be characterised as encompassing a generational change as new leaders built upon that foundation.MASCC with ISOO (International Society of Oral Oncology) continued to grow and expand its international presence. It began to develop the flexibility that was necessary in a changing external environment by creating new study groups and publishing guidelines in emerging areas of supportive care. The journal Supportive Care in Cancer steadily increased its impact factor, and a Society News was circulated monthly to strengthen engagement with members.The supportive care environment changed significantly. There was a paradigm shift from conventional cytotoxic therapy to biologically targeted therapies and immunotherapies which had a raft of new toxicities to manage and which often increased the financial stress on patients [2, 3] .MASCC has restated its perspective of supportive care, but it is still patient-centred, evidence-based and encompassing physical, psychosocial and spiritual well-being from diagnosis, treatment and survivorship to end-of-life care. It is delivered by an interdisciplinary team of clinicians and allied health specialists. This promotes supportive care making excellent cancer care possible [4] .This history of the past 10 years was pieced together from interviews with 17 members who played significant roles in MASCC and supportive care over that time.There was general agreement that supportive care in cancer as a focus for practice and research has become more prominent over the past decade. Partly, this is due to the need to manage the new side effects of the targeted therapies and immunotherapies, such as the checkpoint inhibitors [2] . However, there has also been more emphasis on addressing the psychosocial needs of patients which include financial toxicity highlighted by the development of newer high-cost anti-cancer treatments [3] .Supportive care of survivors has intensified as survival with stage IV disease increases [5] . Palliative care is also accepted as mainstream, which can contribute to the quality of life in dying patients and also improves quality of life when applied earlier. This was shown for patients randomised at diagnosis of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer to palliative care or standard oncological care, and this study also demonstrated improved survival [6] .The uptake of supportive care has not only been by doctors but also nurses and allied health professionals. Patients and their families have been a part of advocating for better supportive care and articulating their needs. MASCC has been a part of the spreading of supportive care internationally as new members participate in supportive care study groups, at scientific meetings and return home to low-and middle-income countries armed with new resources.Advances over 10 years in specific supportive care topics were identified. Antiemetics to control chemotherapy-induced emesis further improved with trials of olanzapine in combinations improving the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea as well as vomiting [7] . The introduction of oral anticoagulants simplified the management of cancer-associated thromboembolic disease [8] . MASCC continued to produce mucositis guidelines and promote research into mucositis, and also, there are now new insights into the role of the microbiome and the gut-brain axis [9] .However, not all advances were pharmacological. The past decade saw the recognition that exercise was an important ""prescription"" for improving the wellbeing of cancer survivors, particularly with research in areas such as fatigue and anxiety and depression [10, 11] .The improvements in supportive care in cancer in the past decade have resulted from more researchers producing highquality research in this field.Governance Jørn Herrstedt's term as President spanned the end of the second and beginning of MASCC's third decade (Table 1) . There was a change in the governance of the organisation when he accepted Cindy Rittenberg's resignation and he and Dorothy Keefe, who was President-elect, interviewed Åge Schultz for the Executive Officer position. Jørn had known Åge from his days working with ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology), but Åge was new to MASCC.A fresh perspective and experience of a larger society were partly the catalyst for the change in the Society which was built upon the solid basis of the founding group, which was to mark the third decade. Dorothy became the first woman to be President and being Australian, the first from outside the Europe/USA axis to hold the position. She continued a collegial style of leadership which had characterised Jørn's term as President.One of the early tasks was to increase the economic viability of MASCC and Åge; Dorothy and the Board of Directors took it from a near deficit to a healthy reserve by the time Åge retired in 2017. Åge with staff member Anne Young used a MASCC booth at a number of cancer meetings to engage as widely as possible with potential delegates, MASCC membership and partnership societies. It was also the era of transitioning into the digital world which increased the satisfaction and productivity of the small team of staff and contractors and made it easier to manage the organisation. MASCC benefitted from changing conference planning companies which improved the returns on the annual scientific meetings.Dorothy and the Board developed a strategic plan which included strategies for growth of membership and opportunities for financial support beyond pharmaceutical company support of the meetings which had been the major source of income. Educational initiatives using the expertise of MASCC members were among the initiatives pursued.When Dorothy's term ended, she was succeeded by Stephen Grunberg who had been a long-time contributor to MASCC and particularly to the antiemetic study group. He led enthusiastically but was only months into his term when he was diagnosed with the disease that he had spent his life treating and died in September 2013. Prior to that, MASCC Board members made a short video at the Berlin meeting to send to him and show him how sorely he was missed. Subsequently, the annual Stephen M Grunberg Memorial Award in recognition of scientific excellence was created. Many remember the amazing speech of Steve's contributions to MASCC that Richard Gralla gave at the inaugural award ceremony. Dorothy stepped in to cover Stephen's absence and ended up completing his term. She presided over a gradual change in MASCC as more non-physician members joined. This included nurses, senior researchers and allied health disciplines, and she particularly encouraged young non-clinical researchers to become members, leading the way by closing her laboratory during the time of the annual meeting so that her young research colleagues could attend. That was an important feature of MASCC. You could contribute irrespective of your seniority or your discipline and could interact with leaders in the field in a congenial annual meeting environment irrespective of seniority.David Warr was the next President. He had been a longstanding MASCC member and an important contributor to the antiemetic study group. A process of renewal was underway under David's leadership. A strategic planning meeting had taken place in 2014 in Amsterdam. Annual meeting committees became more centralised with meeting chairs and additional support provided to the chair to deliver a timely meeting program. David also emphasised the importance of engaging new members and MASCC began to offer an opportunity for new members to engage with existing members at the annual meeting to start building those connections and network within the MASCC family. MASCC continued to grow, and the 2015 Copenhagen meeting organised by Jørn Herrstedt had the largest attendance up until that time.Ian Olver became President and presided over a time of tremendous change. Firstly, Åge retired and gave us a generous time to find his successor. Melissa Chin became the next Executive Director and had a very different skillset from those who had previously held the role. Her background had been in science augmented with strategy, business and operations as applied to healthcare. She had been working at the University Health Network and more specifically Princess Margaret Cancer Centre including a consulting project to build a toptier cancer centre in Qatar. David Warr had worked with her at Princess Margaret and was instrumental in making the connection.The headquarters of MASCC moved from Copenhagen to Toronto, and although we retained Olexandra (Sasha) Stupak in Europe for his membership and information technology roles, the financial and legal advisors were changed, and we took the opportunity to modernise and simplify the Constitution. The Society News, with Toni Clark as editor, was no longer tied to being published in Supportive Care in Cancer and started to be circulated electronically on time, monthly. Ian commenced a column from the President to keep MASCC members updated about what decisions the Executive were considering, and Toni filled it with news and activities of members. It included pictures, in-depth articles, research highlights and reports of recent and upcoming supportive care conferences. It also became a source for social media content as the Communications Committee added the challenge of engaging in social media to their responsibilities, which became a major focus with Anna Boltong as Chair, increasing our presence and impressions and our understanding of social media best practices and analytics. The website was revamped under the guidance of Beth Hollen. This all served to better connect the MASCC family of members.Soon after the Copenhagen meeting, Åge and Ian met with a facilitator to start organising a strategic planning meeting to be centred on the 2017 Washington meeting. A broad crosssection of members served on several groups to consider our strategic directions in terms of new initiatives, how to increase membership and create new income streams. Many strategic projects began to take shape with foundations laid for partnerships in Japan, South America and India, stimulating MASCC membership opportunities and the MASCC accreditation of supportive care units which will later evolve to the MASCC Designated Centres of Excellence during Ian's presidency. Raj Lalla joined as President-elect, so that the plan could be executed over two terms.Raj Lalla took over as President at the Vienna meeting in 2018. As a dentist-scientist, he was the first MASCC President who was not a physician. He embarked upon an affiliate program whereby 6 national-level supportive care organisations became MASCC affiliates. This added over 530 members to MASCC and strengthened our international collaborations. A MASCC-Designated Centres of Excellence in Supportive Care in Cancer certification program was formed; thanks to efforts by Carla Ripamonti and others. Under Annie Young, the Membership Committee introduced new incentive programs to encourage the recruitment and engagement of new members. As a result of the affiliate program and the membership incentive programs, MASCC membership more than doubled to over 2100 members from over 70 countries.A prominent feature of the decade has been the broadening of international reach of MASCC.In the first 20 years, the annual meetings alternated between the USA and Europe. It was during Dorothy Keefe's presidency that she and Ian Olver raised the idea of moving outside of that axis and bring the meeting down to the Asia Pacific region, specifically to Australia. Initially, there was a concern about the financial risk that this would pose, but the concept was underpinned with a strategy to attract new members from countries in the region to counterbalance any reluctance for US and European members to travel further than usual.In 2016, the MASCC/ISOO scientific meeting was held in Adelaide. The meeting was used to celebrate 25 years of MASCC meetings. It also made the transition into the 21st century by introducing e-poster sessions. Over 1070 registrants from more than 50 countries attended. There was particularly strong support from Japan, Korea and China. Japan had just formed JASCC, the Japanese national supportive care organisation, and they have always invited MASCC members to present at their meetings. They also came to the next MASCC/ISOO meeting in Washington in large numbers and are now part of the affiliate program that Raj Lalla developed. Moreover, the MASCC meeting is due to be held in Japan in 2023. Currently, the MASCC affiliates are the This last decade has truly promoted the multinational nature of the Society.The study groups are the lifeblood of MASCC and drive the dissemination of the science and practice of supportive care ( Table 2 ). The most significant impact worldwide has been from those groups who in over two decades have produced international guidelines, best exemplified by the evidencebased antiemetic, mucositis, neutropenia and oral care guidelines. These have been updated over the past decade, and external guidelines have been endorsed, such as the International Paediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guidelines, and new guidelines such as fatigue are in preparation. The study groups have also produced assessment tools such as the MASCC Antiemesis Tool (MAT), The MASCC Oral Agent Teaching Tool (MOATT) and the MASCC EGFR Inhibitor Skin Toxicity Tool (MESTT).The study groups contribute practical workshops to the annual scientific meetings, often in the last decade, by collaborating with each other. Also, there has been an increased use of videoconferencing between face-to-face meetings to conduct study group projects over the year.To address the issue of variable performance of the groups, performance indicators have been developed, but also, awards have been introduced for outstanding leadership and productivity of the groups. Over the decade despite a reluctance to discontinue groups, but as an example, the respiratory group was disbanded when interest waned. The Study Groups policy was updated to allow for the emergence of new subgroups in areas of emerging interest. Three such subgroups currently exist: immuno-oncology, cancer pain, and digital health. The expectations of groups were standardised, and study group leadership is term-limited to bring new leaders to the fore. The great strength of these groups is that young researchers can work with highly experienced senior members on projects with international impact.The journal of MASCC, Supportive Care in Cancer, has only had two dedicated editors since 1993, and Fred Ashbury has held the role for all of the third decade, having been appointed in 2009. The journal has done much to promote supportive care and has steadily increased its impact factor. It has continued to evolve over the 10 years, having originally focused on the toxicities of systemic therapies to encompass subjects including psycho-oncology, financial toxicity, quality of life and communication issues and, most importantly, guidelines. It therefore has increased its appeal to the interdisciplinary supportive care community. As with most journals, publishing online prior to print allows early access, and yet, the journal still has a printed presence. Access to the journal is an important inducement for MASCC membership. Towards the end of the decade, several senior MASCC members published the MASCC perspective on the nature of supportive care in cancer in the journal [4] .MASCC published the MASCC Textbook of Supportive Care and Survivorship in 2011 and a second edition in 2018 with Ian Olver as Editor [12] . The second edition has 42 chapters and 91 contributing authors largely drawn from the MASCC membership which demonstrates the breadth and expertise of the organisation and its members, and this has been an additional resource on supportive cancer care and source of income for MASCC.MASCC annual scientific meetings have always included a strong scientific program of the worlds' leading experts in supportive care in cancer showcasing international learnings and collaboration. The MASCC annual meeting is held jointly with ISOO (Table 3 ). In this decade, MASCC transitioned from trying to find a local Scientific Meeting Chair to appointing a chair for a 2-year term. Most people, regardless of seniority, learn something new at a meeting. However, when we interviewed members about their most memorable meetings, they found it difficult to remember meetings by specific presentations. There was an appreciation of the larger meetings such as Copenhagen and New York due to the number of presentations and delegates with which to interact, and the collegial aspects of MASCC meetings were noted. The meeting shaped the careers of many emerging researchers, through the opportunities for mentorship and support, being invited into study groups by senior members and ignited or reignited enthusiasm for supportive care in others. It has been a valuable source of networking and developing leadership skills under the guidance of those members with international experience.MASCC/ISOO meetings have often been a focus for lobbying local politicians for increasing supportive care in their countries, as exemplified by the 2009 meeting in Rome when Carla Ripamonti proposed to the Director General of the National Cancer Institute of Milan, and then Andrea Antonuzzo proposed to the Director in Pisa, to open a unit dedicated to supportive care, and now, there are units, doctors and nurses dedicated to supportive care. They also formed their own national society (NICSO), which is now an affiliate of MASCC.It reflects the nature of MASCC, though the networking and social events were what members emphasised. The interesting cities in which meetings were held encouraged many delegates to bring their families, and those from host cities often entertained the visiting delegates.Many of those interviewed mentioned the dinners, such as when the previously restricted President's dinner was opened to general membership in Adelaide, and dancing included delegates crowding into a large Perspex cube used earlier by the entertainers at the dinner. Then, there was the magnificently grand venue in Vienna which was the ornate old Stock Exchange building, where a ""MASCC-cuerade"" Ball was enhanced by face painting, or the more hippy-like vibe of San Francisco captured by its photo booth.The value of MASCC was eloquently expressed by those who remembered a meeting because they had become the President or won the Distinguished Service Award at that time, and they counted those events as their career highlights ( Table 4 ).There is a great confidence that MASCC will continue to grow and increase its influence over the next decade. As an interdisciplinary society, it will continue to diversify. It will continue to expand its guidelines, research tools and educational activates, and its affiliate relationships with national bodies will continue to expand, and it will act as an international umbrella organisation. The study groups must not be allowed to stagnate, and the organisation will have to increasingly embrace the digital world and recognise the changing needs of succeeding generations of members, while retaining its established expertise. MASCC must build its capacity within, in order to support its members and its mission to strengthen supportive care globally for worldwide patients who will benefit from the excellent cancer care that follows. As Raj Lalla was succeeded by Andrew Davies to commence MASCC's 4th decade, the world was being heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 30th Anniversary celebrations planned for the year commencing with the meeting in Seville in Spain did not take place as the meeting was cancelled as the world locked down. However, as senior MASCC members recognised in an Editorial in Supportive Care in Cancer, many of the issues faced by patients with cancer were the psychosocial ramifications of COVID-19, and diverse integrated support mechanisms needed to be developed [13] . While such patients' needs persist, MASCC will weather the storm.",Australia,abstract,2021-01-23,01
d20fea94cc40b5e645ae1fb8a2c81b4117302a9c,Case Fatality Rates for Patients with COVID-19 Requiring Invasive Mechanical Ventilation A Meta-analysis,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) pandemic, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has severely burdened healthcare system capacities in many parts of the world (1) . The World Health Organization reports the global crude mortality rate to be 3.9% (2) .The care of critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been rapidly evolving (3) . Although there have been promising therapies such as remdesivir (4) and dexamethasone (5) , mechanical ventilation continues to be the mainstay of management of severe COVID-19 (6) . Hypoxemia (Pa O 2 ,60 mm Hg) has been commonly reported in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (7) . Early invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was promoted early in the pandemic because of concerns of aerosol generation from noninvasive oxygenation therapies facilitating nosocomial viral transmission (8) (9) (10) .The case fatality rate (CFR) is defined as the proportion of a population with a disease that dies during a specific period (11) . The reported CFRs of critically ill patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV have been observed to be highly variable (12) . Causes of this inconsistency likely include the heterogeneity in the management of these patients and in the presentation of outcome data (12, 13) . Addressing this knowledge gap will assist in intensive care resource planning and public health strategies.The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to report the CFR of critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who received IMV based on the available evidence. The variability in CFR by patient age, geographic region, and study quality was also analyzed in this study.This systematic review and meta-analysis was reported using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses framework (14) and has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020186997). The majority of patients receiving IMV are admitted to the ICU; however, not all ICU patients receive IMV. We therefore included studies explicitly reporting on patients receiving IMV to limit heterogeneity in illness severity. The review process is illustrated in a flow diagram ( Figure 1 ).Only studies reporting on consecutive adult patients (>18 yr of age) with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 receiving IMV were included. Studies were excluded if 1) the sample size of the cohort was less than 10, 2) they did not report the results of original research, or 3) the cohort consisted only of deceased patients. Studies were also excluded if a significant overlap in patient cohorts was identified.Reported CFR. ""Reported CFR"" was defined as the CFR among all patients who received IMV, before accounting for patients who were still receiving care in hospital.Author Contributions: Z.J.L. conceived the project idea, conducted the systematic review and statistical analysis, assisted with data analysis, wrote the initial drafts of the manuscript, created tables and figures, and finalized the manuscript.

All authors critically reviewed the manuscript and approved the final version before submission. Of 57,420 adult patients in 69 studies who met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with severe COVID-19, the overall estimate for the reported CFR was 45% (95% confidence interval, 38-52%). Definitive hospital outcomes were only available for 13,120 (36.6%) patients. Significant variability in CFR was also present by age of patients and geographic location of the study.Range of estimates for CFR. We also provided a sensitivity analysis of the best possible and worse possible CFRs, assuming all remaining hospitalized patients either lived (lowest possible) or died (highest possible) in the subset of studies that reported the number of patients who received IMV who were still hospitalized at the time of study conclusion.Definitive CFR. We examined the number of patients receiving IMV who died divided by the number of patients with a known hospital outcome (died or discharged alive) to calculate the definitive CFR.The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) is a quality assessment tool used to evaluate nonrandomized studies on the basis of an eight-item score divided into three domains. The NOS has been selected for the purpose of this study because these domains assess selection, comparability, and ascertainment of the outcome of interest. The NOS is the most suitable for the purpose of comparing both reported and definitive CFR values. The NOS was used by the two reviewers (Z.J.L. and U.K.) to independently evaluate the quality of included studies and assess for risk of bias (18) . The same set of decision rules was used by each reviewer to score the studies. Any discrepancies from the NOS were reviewed and resolved by two additional authors (A.S. and M.P.R.).The primary outcome was the reported CFR for patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV based on the published studies. However, multiple methods of reporting CFR existed across different studies. Studies have reported the CFR of patients receiving IMV out of all patients receiving IMV, including those still hospitalized, whereas other studies have reported the CFR among patients who have completed their hospital course. This variance in reporting methods therefore resulted in variance in the CFRs reported by authors. As a secondary outcome, we examined the ""definitive hospital CFR"" for the subgroup of studies for whom we were able to ascertain hospital discharge outcomes. For all studies, we also present a sensitivity analysis that includes all patients showing ""lowest possible"" CFR for each study (assuming all patients still hospitalized lived) and a ""highest possible"" CFR (assuming all patients still hospitalized died). Within the appendix, the definitive hospital CFR is calculated by excluding patients who were still hospitalized to report the CFR only among patients with a known hospital outcome. Studies were also stratified based on geographical location (continent), economy (based on United Nations classification 2020), mean age, and study quality.Statistical analyzes were performed using the statistical software package Stata, version 16.1 (StataCorp). Mean and SD were used for numerical data and proportion was used for categorical data. The random-effects model and the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for meta-analysis (19) were used for the pooled prevalence of CFR because these demonstrate better properties in the presence of heterogeneity, accounting for both within-study and between-study variances (20) . Results were presented in forest plots. Heterogeneity was tested by using the x 2 test on Cochran's Q statistic, which was calculated by means of H and I 2 indices. The I 2 index estimates the percentage of total variation across studies on the basis of true between-study differences rather than on chance. Conventionally, I 2 values of 0-25% indicate low heterogeneity, values of 26-75% indicate moderate heterogeneity, and values of 76-100% indicate substantial heterogeneity. Authors conducted subgroup analyzes to identify the possible causes of substantial heterogeneity (21) . Univariable metaregression was used, symmetry of the funnel plots was evaluated, and the Egger's regression test was used to examine for publication bias (22) . Confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate whether differences in CFRs were statistically significant. The 95% CI of prevalence including 0.0% and 100% were calculated using the standard equation (23) . As prevalence cannot fall below 0% or above 100%, the CI is trimmed at 0% and 100% (20) .We also examined the reported CFR based on age stratification for the subset of studies that reported outcomes by patient age. In addition, we compared the CFRs in studies from different geographic regions and examined difference between reports from cities with an early and dramatic pandemic outbreak, such as Hubei, China, and New York, United States, compared with studies from other cities in the same country.A total of 5,322 studies were obtained from the living systematic review with 662 unique studies assessed for eligibility via full-text screening ( Figure 1 ). Sixty-nine studies across 23 countries with reported CFRs were included in the final analysis (13, , including publicly available national registry data from seven countries (29, 56, 59, 65, 66, 80, 90) . A summary of the reported CFRs for adult patients receiving IMV is outlined in Table 1 Figure 2 . Individual study NOS score is illustrated in Table E1 in the online supplement. There was no significant difference in CFR when studies were analyzed based on NOS score ( Figure  E1 ). A simple regression (univariate) analysis and multivariate regression analysis were conducted across the 46 studies with definitive hospital outcome (Table E3 ). Studies were analyzed by common variables, including geographical location (continent), study quality (NOS score), mean age, and economic status. Poor-quality studies reported significantly lower CFRs compared with good-quality studies (P = 0.035). Multivariate regression did not yield any further statistical significance in study quality. A univariate analysis of studies from earlier epicenters (Wuhan and New York) showed significantly higher CFRs within these epicenters compared with nonepicenter studies in the same country (P = 0.010 for Wuhan vs. other studies in China and P = 0.002 for New York vs. other studies in the United States).This is a large international systematic review and meta-analysis to examine global reports of CFRs for adult patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV. The reported CFR was 45% across all 69 studies, but this included patients still in the hospital. Among all 54 studies, lowest possible to best possible hospital CFR ranged from 43% to 67%. Among patients with a known hospital outcome, the definitive hospital CFR was 56%. We observed no statistical difference between continents. Older patients had a higher CFR, and the CFR was higher in the early COVID-19 epicenters of Wuhan and New York compared with that of other studies from the same country. The CFR observed in this review of patients with COVID-19 is similar to that of previous outbreaks of severe respiratory infections. Studies from SARS-CoV in 2003 reported a CFR of 45-48% in patients receiving IMV (93, 94) , and more recent studies from the Middle East respiratory syndrome reported a 60-74% CFR in critically ill patients (95, 96) . In contrast, the CFR is lower in critically ill patients suffering from H1N1 influenza A, in which the CFR of patients receiving IMV was 24.2-26.5% (97) . The reported CFR from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome before COVID-19 was lower at 45% (98, 99) when compared with the definitive CFR from COVID-19.The CFR of patients receiving IMV among studies from Wuhan and New York was significantly higher than that of studies from other regions in China and the United States, respectively. This finding may reflect of the significant challenges faced in the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak (100, 101) . Reports suggest that prone positioning was infrequent in the initial phase (41) , with one Wuhan study reporting only 12% of patients receiving IMV were managed with prone positioning. Variable provider:patient ratios may also have contributed to higher CFR (102) (103) (104) .Several factors may account for the large variance in CFRs between studies. ICUs outside of outbreak epicenters may have had the opportunity of time to obtain equipment and consolidate resources before the pandemic (71) . This has enabled ICUs to continue at standard patient:provider ratios (71) . Closer monitoring and early intensive care for critically ill patients potentially improved patient prognosis (31) . Differences in hospital facilities, patient preferences (for which limitations of care may have been in place), and indications for IMV may have also influenced the CFR (12) . Finally, the change in triage process considering comorbidities, age, and frailty status in allocating ICU beds and ventilators during the pandemic Despite stratifying studies on the basis of location and NOS score, high heterogeneity continued to exist across our meta-analysis. This has been reported in other meta-analyzes studying COVID-19 mortality (109-113). Heterogeneity was the lowest at 83.4% among definitive outcomes from Wuhan ( Figure E6 ). Although the reasons for this are not clear, we believe that studies originating from the same geographical location may provide a less heterogeneous cohort, and hence, the I 2 value was lower. Other potential factors influencing heterogeneity could be differences in illness severity, thresholds for IMV, admission criteria to the ICU, and regional differences in ICU care.As demonstrated in a recent editorial, the CFR is substantially higher among older patients, with more than 70% of patients over 60 years of age receiving IMV dying (12) . It has also been reported that the CFR for patients in their 80s and 90s receiving IMV with comorbidities has been higher (114) . Our findings also suggest that older patients receiving IMV had significantly higher mortality.There are several limitations to this systematic review. First, most of the included studies had very small numbers of patients; only 17 of 69 studies reported on more than 100 patients receiving IMV. Given the available evidence, we conducted a metaanalysis to account for this variability in sample size. Second, multiple studies may have covered similar patient cohorts. However, each study's time period, hospital, and location were considered in the final inclusion of studies to minimize overlap in patient cohorts. Third, 14 studies were not peer reviewed, as they were prepublication articles. However, these studies still provided meaningful data on the CFR of the subgroup of patients with COVID-19 who receive IMV. Fourth, the overall heterogeneity was very high (I 2 .90%), which may preclude a valid conclusion from pooled results. Although we performed various sensitivity and metaregression analyses, the heterogeneity could not be minimized. This is most likely due to the case mix and the structure of age within included populations. Finally, we were unable to examine the influence of timing in the pandemic because timing and region were highly correlated.The reported CFR for existing studies of adult patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV was 45%, but many of these reports included patients still in the hospital at the time of publication. Accounting for patients still in the hospital, we found a best possible CFR of 43% and a worst possible CFR of 64%. The CFR increased exponentially in the elderly. Although CFRs did not vary between continents, higher CFRs were noted in early COVID-19 epicenters such as Wuhan and New York compared with other regions in the same country. Additional studies examining long-term CFRs beyond hospital discharge are needed. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",Australia,first author,2021-01-01,01
e6e37bb2ee90dc98e41700efa2b5d0c6c536b067,Examining Australian public perceptions and behaviors towards a future COVID-19 vaccine,"Finding safe and effective vaccine candidates to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) is an urgent public health priority. There are an unprecedented number of agencies (including biotechnology companies, universities, military researchers, and pharmaceutical companies) aiming to identify and develop a COVID-19 vaccine at an accelerated approach and scale not previously seen [1, 2] . As of late 2020, there are 214 vaccine candidates, of which 47 have progressed to human clinical trials [3] . Based on the results and considering the safety profiles, two of the COVID-19 vaccines has been approved or received emergency use authorization in several countries (UK, US, Russia, Bahrain, and Canada).To ensure community readiness, it is essential that governments determine levels of demand and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine to ensure the readiness of both the public and healthcare providers for a COVID-19 vaccine. It is likely that controlling COVID-19 with vaccination will require a critical proportion of the population to accept and receive the vaccine. A minimal target level may exceed 70% accounting for vaccine effectiveness and mechanism of protection, the size of the population in which the vaccine is contraindicated and other factors. However, having a COVID-19 vaccine available does not necessarily equate to people accepting it, as history demonstrates. For example, compliance with the influenza pandemic specific vaccine in 2009 was low, despite higher levels of reported 'willingness to vaccinate', which highlights the challenges with compliance and acceptance [4, 5] . To support the launch of a COVID-19 vaccine program and to ensure that communication efforts are attuned to factors affecting acceptance, it is critical that governments understand people's perceptions towards vaccination against COVID-19. This study expands on studies published by Dodd and colleagues and Rhodes et al., which also focus on the Australian public [6, 7] . The study by Dodd reported a significant association between reluctance to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and inadequate health literacy and lower education level, whilst Rhodes and colleagues identified a shift in the level of uncertainty towards the vaccine between the earlier work of Dodd (April) and when their study was conducted in June. It is important to note that the later study focused on Australian parents, as part of a Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Poll. Moving beyond the published research, our study examined the demographic and health related factors, as well as the attitudinal aspects impacting on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. In addition, we explored the Australian communities' attitudes towards the prioritisation process as well as their willingness to follow government recommendations.The methods used for this study and the data collection tool have been previously published [8] . In summary, an online survey of Australian residents was undertaken via a market research company (Quality Online Research (QOR)) between 18 and 24 March 2020. A sample size of 1400 provided us with a sample error of ±3%. Proportional quota sampling was used to ensure that respondents were demographically representative of the Australian public, with quotas based on age, gender, and state/territory. Respondents were required to be 18 years or older and to speak English. After reading the respondent information, consent was implied if the person completed the survey and submitted it via the QOR website. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University of New South Wales (HC200190).The questions for this survey were adapted from published studies by Holly Seale during the 2009 influenza H1N1/A pandemic [4, 9] . Questions captured: (1) perceptions of the effectiveness of vaccines in general; (2) priorities for COVID-19 vaccine roll out; and (3) social influences. As a measure of vaccine acceptance, respondents were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: 'Getting myself vaccinated for COVID-19 would be a good way to protect myself against infection'. This item was measured on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. This variable was treated as the primary outcome with responses collapsed into strongly disagree/disagree/neutral = 0 and agree/strongly agree = 1. Risk perception of COVID-19 infection was measured via the following question 'indicate your level of risk of catching COVID-19 during this pandemic', on a scale of 1-5 with 1 = low risk and 5 = very high risk. Lastly data was collected on gender, age, education and employment status, children (including attendance at childcare/school), country of birth/language spoken at home, whether they identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, international travel patterns since 1 January 2020, private healthcare insurance coverage, income protection insurance, the presence of any chronic illness and self-reported health status (very good, good, moderate, poor, very poor). Due to the uncertainty around vaccine development at the time of the survey, respondents were not directly asked whether they would receive a vaccine but rather whether they thought a COVID-19 vaccine would be a good way to protect against infection.Descriptive statistical statistics were reported for sample demographics. Mean scores and standard deviations of the risk perception score and the vaccine acceptance response were calculated by demographic characteristic. Univariate associations were ascertained with each demographic variable and the outcome variable, vaccine acceptance. The risk perception score of those who would accept the vaccine was compared to those who would not using an independent samples t-test and ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. A multivariable logistic regression model was created with backward elimination model selection and a threshold P value of 0.25 for inclusion of predictor variables [10] . Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) analysis was also performed to estimate the predictive ability of significant factors (from the regression model) as estimated by Area Under the Curve (AUC). For all analyses, P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 26.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL, USA).The demographic characteristics of the 1420 respondents by their risk perception and stated vaccine acceptance are presented in Table 1 . In summary, 678 (48%) were male, 829 (58%) were in some form of employment, 363 (25%) had a chronic health condition, while 830 (58%) had private health insurance. Respondents generally held positive views towards vaccination, with 1188 (83%) agreeing with the statement that 'vaccines are effective at preventing diseases', while 305 (21%) indicated that 'diseases provide better immunity than vaccines do'. Among all respondents, 88% (n = 1252) had heard that a COVID-19 vaccine was being developed. Of those who were not aware, 129/168 (77%) were aged under 50 years (lowest awareness levels were in the youngest age group i.e., 18-29 years (n = 62/168, 37%)). One thousand one hudred ninety-five respondents (84%) agreed that they generally do what their healthcare professional recommends.Eighty percent (n = 1143) agreed with the statement that getting myself vaccinated for COVID-19 would be a good way to protect myself against infection, while a further 194 (14%) were uncertain, leaving 83 (5.8%) to disagree with the sentiment ( Table 2) . Beyond individual perceptions, respondents were asked to comment on perceived support from family and friends towards receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine, of which 1118 (78%) agreed that they would be supported. A similar level of support was given to the statement 'to protect the health of the community, we should follow government guidelines about vaccines' with 1190 (84%) agreeing.When it came to prioritization of target groups for a future COVID-19 vaccine, respondents were strongly in favour of healthcare workers being the first ones to get the vaccine (n = 1198, 84%). Only 51 (3.5%) respondents disagreed with that sentiment, while the remaining respondents were neutral (n = 171, 12%). The same level of support was shown to the prioritization of patients with risk factors, with 1211 (85%) agreeing that they should be the first ones to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Again only 58 (4.1%) respondents disagreed. Interestingly, there was equal distribution across age groups and chronic health conditions for both variables.The median score for risk perception of COVID-19 infection amongst those who would not accept the vaccine was 3 (IQR: 2-4) compared to a median of 4 (IQR: 3-4) among those who would accept the vaccine (P < 0.001). Mean risk perception scores was significantly higher among Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander respondents (P = 0.03) compared to non-Indigenous respondents, those who were working full time/part time (P < 0.001) compared to unemployed people. Respondents who had a trade/apprenticeship/certificate or a University degree had significantly higher mean risk score compared to respondents with educational level year 12 or below (P = 0.02 and P = 0.009 respectively). Similarly, respondents having private health insurance (P = 0.01) and those with chronic health conditions (P = 0.02) perceived their mean risk score higher than those without.There was variation in the proportion of people who agreed that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 would be a good way to protect myself against infection by demographic characteristics. These differences were significant for gender, Indigenous status, educational attainment, private health insurance, international travel in 2020 and self-reported chronic health condition (Table 3) . Overall, 83% of females agreed with the statement compared to 78% of males (aOR = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.8); P = 0.03). Those above 70 years of age (91%) compared to those between 18 and 29 years of age (77%) reported higher level of agreement (aOR = 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.1); P = 0.008) Agreement was also higher for those who self-reported having a chronic disease (aOR = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-2.0); P = 0.04) and who had private health insurance (aOR = 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3-2.3); P < 0.001) ( Table  3 ). These significant variables combined together had a high predicting ability for vaccine acceptance (AUC = 0.748, 95% CI: 0.720-0.776, P < 0.001). Figure 1 shows the ROC curve for the ability of significant predictors in predicting the vaccine acceptance.The survey was conducted in March 2020, at a time when the first wave of COVID-19 cases was increasing in Australia, there was intense media coverage and community members were being encouraged to adopt hygiene and physical distancing strategies. At that point, there was no lockdown enforced in Australia. From our survey, we found that 80% agreed that receiving the COVID-19 vaccine would be a good way to protect themselves. The level of agreement amongst our respondents varied in comparison to other studies. An online survey of the French population conducted in May found that 74% would use a vaccine [11] . A similar acceptance rate was reported in other surveys (conducted between March and May) of residents in the United States (67-69%) [12, 13] , Indonesia (67 to 95% depending on the effectiveness of the vaccine) [14] and 73% for parts of Europe (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the UK) [15] . The difference in acceptance rate documented in this study may be due to a single or combination of factor(s) including: (1) the variation in the wording of the question;(2) high level of confidence and trust in the Australian government [8] or (3) due to concerns about increasing local transmission which were high at the time. However, our results align with other Australian studies, which have reported willingness levels between 76 to 86% [6, 7] . Both studies collected the data in April 2020. Since those early studies, a recent online survey has documented that intentions to get vaccinated have dropped in some countries including Australia (88 to 79%), China (97 to 85%), Spain (72 to 64%) and Brazil (88 to 81%) [16] . However, this data was also captured prior to the administration of any of the vaccines outside of a clinical trial setting and so it is critical that efforts are made to not only map variations in willingness but to qualitatively drill down into the factors contributing to them. It has been well documented that the same psychological factors that influence acceptance of national immunisation program vaccines apply during pandemics [17] . Studies conducted in 2009 examining the acceptance of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine found that perceptions of risk and severity played a key role in whether people agreed with the necessity of vaccination [4, 18] . At the time that the H1N1 pandemic immunisation programs were commenced in Australia, it was well after the peak of the pandemic (which was already deemed as 'moderate' by governments and other agencies). This affects the perceived personal risk of infection, as well as how people perceived the severity of the infection, which resulted in low levels of vaccine uptake [4, [19] [20] [21] . While the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are vastly differently to the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, it is important that we consider how we are going to engage and communicate with those in the community who perceive their personal risk as low. In mid-March, we identified that 74% of our study respondents ranked their personal risk of acquiring COVID-19 as 'intermediate' to 'very-low' [8] . With this group, it may be necessary to draw on the influence of anticipated regret, which has been found to be an important determinant of intention to vaccinate [22, 23] . While the expectation of anticipated regret is primarily cognitive, it also likely has an affective component, as imagining an unpleasant future may elicit emotion in the present [24] . People may act to reduce what they expect to experience by acting. Examples could be: (1) anticipated regret of not getting the COVID-19 vaccine, as a family member gets infected, encourages vaccination; and (2) anticipated regret of not getting the COVID-19 vaccine, as a person is unable to travel abroad to visit friends and relatives (hypothetical situation of COVID-19 vaccination operating in the same manner as yellow fever vaccination), which encourage vaccination.To translate early willingness into actual vaccine receipt, we will need to draw on key behavioural insights from past studies. For example, a recommendation from a healthcare provider is a key driver of routine immunisation uptake [25] [26] [27] [28] . Amongst our respondents, the majority agreed that they follow the advice of their healthcare professionals. To support this action, there is a need to equip healthcare professionals with the understanding about the COVID-19 vaccine (including how it was developed, safety profiles), the skills to take a presumptive approach to recommending the vaccine and the confidence to answer questions. For example, there may be a need to support peoples understanding around the rational for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, especially amongst those who believe that they may have been already infected during the pandemic. Around a quarter of our respondents agreed with the statement that 'diseases provide better immunity than vaccines do', while a further 40% were neutral about the statement. Health professionals will have a strong effect on uptake since they both recommend, and in this case, are likely to be the first eligible for the vaccine.In settings like Australia where vaccines are delivered predominately in primary care settings, the focus will be on supporting General Practitioners and Practice Nurses. However, given the adult risk groups likely targeted with a COVID-19 vaccine, other providers will need to be considered. For example, hospital and private practice specialists (medical and nursing) may be a trusted source of information about the COVID-19 vaccine for those people with chronic medical conditions [29] . There may be high levels of confidence in vaccine information being provided by these specialists, as they are experts in a specific chronic medical condition [29] . This may be especially important if the vaccine has any contraindications or precautions for people with any chronic conditions or who are immunosuppressed. There may be other providers that need to be supported to effectively communicate about this vaccine. Given that not all adults regularly connect with primary care, there will be a need to support community-controlled health organisations to promote uptake among their local communities. Public health campaigns may also need to consider enlisting other partners, outside of traditional medical and public health communities, to support activities that promote awareness and acceptance of the vaccine. These may include peak bodies which are not-for-profit non-government health-condition specific organisations that focus on one health condition/disease and disseminate evidence-based information related to their conditions and health [30] . Information delivered by these groups would be relevant and credible to their constituents. Populations at risk of COVID-19 infection are diverse in social, behavioural, cultural and health practices as well as their understanding of COVID-19. Racial and ethnic disparities in the severity of COVID-19 illness have been identified [31] . In non-pandemic periods, people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds can be disadvantaged by the factors that contribute to health inequity and have been documented as resulting in lower uptake of recommended vaccines including influenza [32] . To support access to this vaccine and equity in the delivery, it is critical that engagement approaches are tailored so they meet the needs of all communities, in terms of messages and vaccine dissemination strategies [33] . For example, communicating messages about the vaccine to CALD communities is not just a question of providing translations of information that meet readability assessment scores. Previously, Mileti and Darlington (1997) found that people from CALD backgrounds generally prioritize social networks and interpersonal communication when seeking information and prefer to receive information from people with similar attributes as themselves [34] . There will be a need to involve community leaders with the promotion of a vaccine including cultural and religious leaders, and Aboriginal elders. Use of these community influencers may support the engagement of Aboriginal communities and CALD groups including newly arrived migrants who rely on informal information sources through social networks and particularly in early stages of settlement [35] . These actors may have heightened success in delivering relevant culturally appropriate messages via formats and venues which may not be reached by mainstream mass communication approaches. Beyond ensuring that messages are effectively disseminated into all parts of the community, there is also a need to think about access in terms of convenience, location of vaccine services, and time-costs associated with receive it. There may be a need to think beyond primary care to reduce access barriers for some communities [36] . When the first trials commenced in the US, rumours began to circulate that fake vaccines were being used, while in the UK, the first subjects enrolled in vaccine trials were forced to clarify that they were still alive [37] . Mis-and disinformation is going to continue to circulate during this pandemic and will surge with the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. To respond to the ""infodemic"", the WHO put together a framework based on a crowdsourcing exercise to support governments to manage the issue [38] . The work culminated in six key principles that governments could start to consider when planning their activities around the promotion and delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine. One key area highlighted was the need to slow down and streamline the flow of information of all kinds. Having transparent information, which is adapted to local languages, literacy levels, is regularly updated, and focuses on common/known mild reactions to new vaccines may assist with stemming the flow of misinformation about the safety of the vaccines [38] . The importance of this was identified in 2009 by Eastwood et.al who reported a critical link between willingness to accept a pandemic H1N1 vaccine and the availability of easily interpretable vaccine safety data [5] .The strengths of our study include a large, representative cross-section of the adult Australian population. However, the work is subject to several limitations including that we recruited a convenience sample of respondents. People who could not communicate in English were excluded from the sample, which may have affected representation of ethnic minorities. We also had under-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and those residing in remote settings. Our study was also unable to examine for differences in responses between the states/territories. As participation in our study was on a voluntary basis, this study has potential for self-selection bias by community members who are particularly concerned about this pandemic. Lastly, the study was conducted via an online market research company and so required respondents to have access to the internet which may have limited the participation of some members of the community. However, given the level of internet access in Australia, this should not have been a problem.Throughout this pandemic, there have been issues with communication, shifts in recommendations and fluctuations in cases, which all have the potential to undermine trust in governments. To support an effective launch of new COVID-19 vaccines, governments need to understand the community's concerns, and identify strategies that will support engagement. There is a pressing and critical need to start planning public health communication strategies that are designed to support healthcare professionals and those in civil society who may play a role, as well as engage all members of the community.",Australia,abstract,2021-01-28,01
5c53345a8f400b9072d2c4b6cec5cd42a3cdd8be,,"Work-life balance is important for individual well-being, and the spheres of employment and home ideally should not overlap (Robinson 2006) . However, the public policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom necessitated major changes to this separation as the government closed schools, most public places and transport, and many businesses. These policies meant that as of 26 March 2020, schooling was to take place at home. While many schools carried out teaching and learning activities online, they were reliant on parents to ensure the continuation of these programmes. Individuals with children were forced into an involuntary amalgamation of their two life domains, all the while living under an enforced lockdown, social isolation, and the fear-or the consequence-of losing their jobs. Even individuals without children had to make adjustments as those who could work from home did so by setting up temporary home offices in kitchens and bedrooms.The enforced social isolation adopted by the UK and several other governments around the world as a response to COVID-19 have coincided with the deterioration of people's mental health (Banks and Xu 2020;  for evidence from the US, see Adams-Prassl et al. 2020) . Being in quarantine raised feelings of fear, nervousness, anger, grief, and anxiety-driven insomnia similar to the experiences of the Ebola and SARS outbreaks in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Reynolds et al. 2008; Desclaux et al. 2017; Caleo et al. 2018) . The fears associated with the pandemic were compounded by the closure of schools and the shutdown of many workplaces, and the ensuing massive loss of employment even if layoffs were temporary.The deterioration in mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown and the increased pressure on the household's financial resources associated with the policy response are not unrelated. Financial loss increases emotional and psychological stress and lowers health status (Grafova 2015; van Hal 2015) , especially during economic crises (Friedman and Thomas 2009; Kondilis et al. 2013; Mucci et al. 2016) . Financial uncertainty can lead to increased levels of stress and allostatic load -the effect of chronic exposure to stress on the body-which negatively affect health and behaviour such as increased rates of smoking or drinking (Grafova and Monheit 2019) . Research has also shown that stress due to the sudden change in available resources and potential risk of material hardship generates distinct effects among men and women (Breunig et al. 2007; Kukk 2019) . The most severe effects are experienced in households with children (Cobb-Clark and Ribar 2012), especially if their net worth is below the median value (Gallo et al. 2006; Leung and Lau 2017) .Social isolation, job losses, working from home, and home-schooling generated competing time demands and financial concerns that also contributed to reduced productivity as shown by research on previous pandemics where individuals reported suffering from increased depression and anxiety because of social distancing (Brooks et al. 2020) . Depression alone, for example, was estimated to have led to 200 million lost working days each year at the cost of USD 30-40 billion (Gabriel and Liimatainen 2000) . High levels of stress can lead to mental and physical illness, aggressive and violent behaviour, alcohol abuse, and decreased work performance (Cohen and Willis 1985; Whitley and McKenzie 2005) .In this paper, we aim to unpack the link between financial security, working from home, and childcare as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown policies introduced in March 2020. In particular, we (1) document the damage to the financial security of working parents during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK; (2) explain the relationships between financial insecurity and the homecare of children and the mental well-being of working parents; and (3) explore the heterogeneity of these relationships across gender and economic status among working parents.To do so, we use data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), otherwise known as Understanding Society, which has been collecting information on UK households since 2009. Beginning on April 2020, a COVID-19 special survey has been running to examine the impact of the pandemic on the participants of UKHLS. Using this dataset, we are able to compare working parents to workers without children, i.e. workers who are likely to be under less pressure to reallocate time between home (including childcare) and work life.We contribute to the literature in a number of ways. First, our study is the first focus on the well-being of working parents during the COVID-19 pandemic using high-quality longitudinal data. In particular, we use pre-COVID-19 information to control for pre-existing characteristics of working families. Second, in examining the well-being of working parents, we pay special attention to financial insecurity and childcare and home-schooling responsibilities. Third, we demonstrate that the burden between men and women, and between rich and poor households, are distinctly unequal. Since this heterogeneity exists in the distribution of burden, targeting both financial and non-financial aid can lead to more efficient and equitable outcomes.Our analysis is based on Wave 9 of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and the April and May 2020 waves of the UKHLS COVID-19 survey. Wave 1 of the UKHLS, which started in 2009-2010, included around 40,000 households in the United Kingdom, collecting information on a range of socioeconomic and behavioural domains. Wave 9 (pre-COVID-19) consists of individuals surveyed during the period 2017-2018.On April 2020, selected respondents of the UKHLS were invited to take part in the first wave of the new COVID-19 special survey, which includes important questions on the impact of the pandemic on the well-being of individuals, families, and wider communities. Participants were asked to complete one survey per month until July 2020, followed by a survey every two months from September 2020 in order to track changes in their circumstances and environments. There were 17,452 individuals who completed a full post-COVID-19 survey in April 2020, and 14,811 individuals completed the survey in May 2020 (Institute for Social and Economic Research 2020). We use data from the first two months of the survey. It includes information about, among others, caring responsibilities and family life, employment and financial situation, financial well-being, home schooling, and mental well-being.We restrict the sample to individuals who work (either being employed or selfemployed) and have non-missing information on important socioeconomic characteristics, including age, gender, family structure, the region of residence, education, employment, and household income. Individuals are defined as a working parent if the person is employed or self-employed and lives with a child younger than 18 years old. We do not distinguish among natural, adoptive, and stepparents. There are 6795 (43%) working parents in the estimation sample, of which 57% are female. The final estimation sample consists of over 15,500 observations of individuals who completed at least one post-COVID-19 survey. We show proportions and means of important characteristics in Table 1. 1 Mental health is measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The GHQ Caseness score is constructed from the responses to 12 questions covering feelings of strain, depression, inability to cope, anxiety-based insomnia, and lack of confidence. The 12 answers are combined into a total GHQ score that indicates the level of mental distress, giving a scale running from 0 (the least distressed) to 12 (the most distressed). In Table 2 , we show that working individuals were, on average, less mentally distressed before COVID-19. We find the same results if the sample is restricted to working parents only.In order to broadly capture financial insecurity, we consider seven indicators as follows ( Table 2): 1. Looking ahead, how do you think you will be financially a month from now: will you be better off, worse off, or about the same? 2. Have you asked your bank for a mortgage holiday? 1 Our focus is on working parents. However, for completeness and at the request of an anonymous reviewer, we run separate regressions over all individuals (i.e., working and non-working), including a model which includes an interaction between parental status and employment before the pandemic. The results from these regressions-presented in the appendix-are consistent with the main findings. 3. Have you applied for/received a payment holiday on any credit product other than a mortgage? 4. Have you given financial help to, or received financial help from, family or friends who do not currently live in the same house? 5. Have you applied for Universal Credit 2 (asked if not already receiving it in January or February 2020)? 6. If your household is now earning less than in January or February 2020, did you borrow from a bank or use a credit card to deal with this? 7. How likely it is that you will have difficulties in paying your bills (in %)?Only the first question on the respondent's expectation about her or his own financial situation in the future is asked before and after the COVID-19 pandemic started. Questions 3 and 7 were only asked in the May 2020 round of the COVID-19 special survey. Table 2 shows that more working individuals expect their financial situation to be worse after COVID-19, both among those who are working and among the restricted sample of working parents only. For instance, the mental well-being of working parents worsened by 64% as the pandemic was unfolding. The survey shows that working parents are in worse mental health and are less financially secure-irrespective of which measure of financial insecurity is usedthan the sample of working individuals (compare Columns 1 and 3 of Table 2 ).The intensity of engagement in childcare or home schooling is captured by the time spent on these activities. Based on the empirical distribution of this variable, we create four groups of working parents (quartiles): those who spend less than an hour, those who spend between 1 and 7 h, those who spend between 7 and 20 h, and those who spend 20 h or more per week on childcare or home schooling.In Table 3 , we show that about a third of working mothers spend more than 20 h per week on these activities, but less than a quarter of working fathers spend a similar amount of time looking after or schooling their children. Over 30% of working fathers spend less than an hour each week on childcare or home schooling. More than half of working parents with younger children (less than 5 years old) spend more than 20 h per week on childcare or home schooling. Finally, there is a strong propensity among parents with a tertiary or higher qualification to engage in childcare or home schooling. Parents with low or no educational qualification tend to spend less than 1 h per week in these activities. 3We estimate the parameters of the following model which controls for observable confounders:where Y it represents an outcome pertaining to financial insecurity for individual i at time t, WP it is an indicator of being a working parent, x it is a vector of individual and family characteristics, and ε it is the unobservable determinant of the outcomes that varies across i and t. The vector x it includes variables such as age, ethnic group, gender, education, labour market activity at the COVID-19 waves and previous wave, marital status, gross household income before COVID-19, and region of residence. Equation (1) operationalises the conceptual framework described in the introduction -that is, we expect working parents to experience greater financial distress relative to working non-parents because of the presence of children at home, the additional difficulties in reconciling work and family life, and the increased pressure on financial and family responsibilities, during a time of widespread insecurity. The dataset allows us to examine this relationship over different measures of financial insecurity.We also examine the relationship between financial insecurity, different levels of time spent in childcare or home schooling, and parental mental well-being by estimating the following model:where MH it represents mental well-being for individual i at time t, FI it is the index of financial insecurity constructed usingfactor analysis, 4 TCH it is a variable representing hours spent in child care or home schooling (grouped into four categories based on the empirical distribution of the variable), x it is a vector of individual and family characteristics, and ε it is the error term. The vector x it is the same as in Eq.(1), with the addition of the GHQ-12 Caseness score at the last pre-COVID-19 survey (Wave 9), which is similar to the idea behind controlling for previous trends in mental health (Banks and Xu 2020) . Estimating Eq.(2) provides us with the relationship between financial insecurity and mental health while controlling for the time spent on childcare or home schooling. The latter is important since the increased demand on parental time by children is likely to be associated with mental distress, especially for those parents who are already experiencing financial insecurity. When making comparisons between different levels of financial insecurity and mental health, we control for time that is spent by parents on childcare and home schooling. Table 4 shows the OLS estimates of the associations between being a working parent and a series of measures of financial insecurity (Eq. (1) in Section 3). The different outcomes, which are displayed as separate columns, are binary variables indicating financial distress. Rows A to H correspond to eight different regressions, distinguishing different types of working parents according to when they were surveyed (pre-or post-COVID-19 waves) and the number and ages of their children. Panel B of Table 4 contains the regression results using the pre-COVID-19 wave, where only the first outcome appears and without the rest of the indicators for financial distress. Each coefficient estimate is from a separate regression with different types of working parents as the explanatory variable of interest.Irrespective of the measure of financial insecurity, working parents are more financially insecure relative to workers without children during the COVID-19 period (Panel A of Table 4 ). They are more pessimistic about their financial future (Column 1), and they are more likely to have received some sort of financial assistance such as a mortgage or credit holiday, loans, and transfer payments from the state via Universal Credit (Columns 2-5). When we restrict the sample to the pre-COVID-19 wave (Panel B), we observe no statistically significant difference in expectations about financial security between workers with and without children. We conclude that any changes in expectations regarding the financial futures of these two types of workers must have occurred after the start of the pandemic.The overall picture shown in Table 4 demonstrates that working parents with more children and working parents with younger children (less than 5 years old) fared worse after COVID-19 as measured by indicators for financial well-being.We further explore the heterogeneity of our findings by gender and income group in Table 5 , where we show that both mothers and fathers experience the same changes in financial insecurity during the pandemic. Except for the probability of having a mortgage holiday (Cell B2; probably because mortgages are typically shared by a couple), all the point estimates are larger for mothers. This implies that mothers experienced relatively harsher financial hardship than fathers in the sample. Neither mothers nor fathers expected their financial situation to be worse when asked the question before the pandemic (Cells C1 and D1). 5 Control variables: ethnic background, age, age square, gender, employment status, education, employment status at previous wave, couple, household gross income at wave 9, GOR (Government Office Region). Each coefficient estimate is from a separate regression with different types of working parents as the explanatory variable of interest *p < 0.1; **p < 0.05; ***p < 0.01 Table 5 COVID-19 and financial insecurity by gender (employed or self-employed)(1)(3) Control variables: ethnic background, age, age square, gender, employment status, education, employment status at previous wave, couple, household gross income at wave 9, GOR (Government Office Region). Each coefficient estimate is from a separate regression with different types of working parents as the explanatory variable of interest *p < 0.1; **p < 0.05; ***p < 0.01In Table 6 , we group households by income before the pandemic. In particular, we create two groups based on whether the household was above or below the median income before the pandemic. Parents with a lower pre-pandemic income are particularly exposed to financial insecurity. Point estimates are larger for working parents whose income before the pandemic was below the median income relative to those whose income was above the median. Since Universal Credit was designed for lowincome households, it is reassuring that the estimate is not statistically significant for those households with income above the median (Cell B5). Regardless of whether the household was above or below the median income before the pandemic, there was a deterioration about their future financial situation after the pandemic (compare Cells A1 to C1 and B1 to D1).The results presented in Tables 4, 5, and 6 indicate that the perceived financial security of working parents has deteriorated after the start of the pandemic. This change in circumstances is likely to be associated with the mental well-being of working parents. To explore this, we estimate the relationship captured by Eq. (2) in Section 3-that is, whether declining financial well-being is reflected in worsening mental health while controlling for other relevant factors, particularly the time spent on childcare and home schooling.In Table 7 , we show the corresponding coefficient estimates of Eq.(2). The measure of mental health that we use is the GHQ-12 Caseness score, which goes from 0 to 12, where higher numbers are associated with worse mental health. 6 The index of financial insecurity is constructed using factor analysis and the different measures of financial well-being described in Section 2. For ease of interpretation, the mean values of the GHQ-12 Caseness score for different subgroups are available in Table 2 .Overall, we see that a one-standard-deviation increase in the index of financial insecurity is associated with an increase in the Caseness score of 0.411 (Cell A1), which is equivalent to 13% of a standard deviation. To put this figure into perspective, this effect is higher than the effect of many other important variables, including mental health and employment status at previous wave, and household income.Other studies have reported a similar relationship: an increase in anxiety, depression, and other negative feelings are connected with the financial difficulties and economic downturn associated with the pandemic and resulting isolation policies (Holmes et al. 2020 ; Academy of Medical Sciences 2020). In these early days of the COVID-19 lockdown, mental health deteriorated significantly across the households in the UK (Chandola et al. 2020 ; Davillas and Jones 2020) although non-cognitive skills, particularly self-efficacy, seem to predict psychological resilience (Johnston et al. 2020) . For Australia in particular, Broadway et al. (2020) use the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) longitudinal survey as well as the recent Taking the Pulse of the Nation survey to show similar results for parents.That financial insecurity predicts worsening mental well-being is true for both households below and above the median income in the pre-pandemic wave (Cells A2 and A3), as well as for both mothers and fathers in the sample (Cells A4 and A5). Control variables: ethnic background, age, age square, gender, employment status, education, employment status at previous wave, couple, household gross income at wave 9, GOR (Government Office Region). Each coefficient estimate is from a separate regression with different types of working parents as the explanatory variable of interest *p < 0.1; **p < 0.05; ***p < 0.01The relationship is stronger for poorer households and for fathers. Conti (2020) similarly showed that households at the lower end of the income distribution experienced the worst effects with reference to stress levels.Having children does not have a significant relationship with mental health. However, spending 20 or more hours per week on childcare or home schooling is associated with worsening mental health. Based on the whole sample, working parents who spend 20 h or more on childcare or home schooling have a Caseness score that is higher by 0.525 (equivalent to 16% of a standard deviation) relative to individuals who spend less than 1 h on the same child-related activity (Cell F1). Working parents whose household income are below the median (pre-pandemic) do not show a significant relationship between the time spent on childcare and home schooling and mental health. 7 Andrew et al. (2020) note that, during the lockdown, the amount of time devoted to paid work reduced to an average of 3 h per day while that of housework increased to 9 h per day.Mothers and working parents whose income were above the median (pre-pandemic) exhibit the strongest relationship between child-related activities and mental health. That women are faring worse under the pandemic was confirmed by other studies (Etheridge and Spantig 2020; Banks and Xu 2020; Andrew et al. 2020) . Mothers tended to find childcare more stressful than fathers (Roeters and Gracia 2016) , and this is confirmed by the larger coefficient estimate on ""20 or more hours"" (0.404 vs 0.580, Cells F4 and F5). With school closures, the learning materials have been delivered remotely, and it is likely that mothers have taken on the task of ensuring schooling is taking place at home. Working mothers were, in any case, more likely to have lost their jobs during the pandemic (Andrew et al. 2020 ). In addition, GHQ Caseness Score ranges from 0 to 12, and higher values represent higher levels of mental distress. Control variables: ethnic background, mental health at previous wave, age, age square, gender, employment status, education, employment status at previous wave, couple, household gross income at wave 9, GOR (Government Office Region). Standard errors are clustered at individual level *p < 0.1; **p < 0.05; ***p < 0.01 7 We also estimated the relationship between the components of the GHQ-12 caseness score and the index of financial well-being and hours spent on childcare or home schooling. The results are presented in Table  10 of the appendix. Financial insecurity is significantly related to all components; the majority of the components are also significantly related to spending 20 h or more on childcare or home schooling. maternal time with children is largely invariant to macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in the labour market (Bauer and Sonchak 2017) .The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a range of policy prescriptions enacted to preserve public health and to secure the future of the UK economy. Measures have included an economic lockdown, physical distancing both in private and in public, and-in extreme cases-complete self-isolation. On top of this, school closures have shifted a large part of the responsibility for children's education to parents within the home environment. This has all but obliterated the notion of a healthy work-life balance, where competing time demands and the sudden precariousness of their economic position have meant that working parents have had to endure financial distress and a deterioration of their well-being, especially their mental health. We document the financial insecurity of working parents around the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. In addition, we examine their mental well-being as it relates both to their increased financial insecurity as well as the increased time spent on child-related activities, particularly childcare and home schooling. Our results show that working parents experience significantly higher levels of financial distress relative to working counterparts without children.We also show that the post-pandemic burden of financial insecurity and worsening mental health is neither equally shared between men and women, nor between rich and poor households. Women are more substantially affected, which is congruent with the results of previous studies (Etheridge and Spantig 2020) . Poorer households are also worse off. Bayrakdar and Guveli (2020) note that poorer families send their children to schools which do not have adequate facilities to cater to the online learning environment.The heterogeneous distribution of the post-pandemic burden implies that public policy decisions ought to account for these underlying inequities. Working parents, especially mothers, are experiencing a worse mental and financial position. The burden can be eased by amplifying support for childcare and home schooling, including nonfinancial assistance such as training in educational content delivery. The increased conflict between work and life domains, especially for those with children, can be mitigated by policies that acknowledge the varied circumstances in which households find themselves.Our results strongly suggest that while the COVID-19 lockdown policies put in place by the UK government were well-intentioned, the 'one-size-fits-all' approach resulted in less effective measures for working families. As financial and mental distresses are not equally distributed across the populations, our results highlight that the most precarious groups of society are disproportionately more affected by mental distress. Addressing this imbalance requires a more targeted approach to policy and emergency management to ensure that the burden of home schooling and financial distressing is no worse than the mental health problems caused by COVID-19.Acknowledgements The Understanding Society COVID-19 study is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Health Foundation.

50c8ff2647df591aa281c8ec4f67a14ad0dac60c,,"Globally acute respiratory infection (ARI) including pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children aged less than five years. Respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remain the leading causes of ARI in under five children [1] . The immature immune system have been linked to increased risk of infectious diseases, particularly respiratory viral infections in infants [1] , However, as the research on ongoing pandemic (Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) caused by a novel respiratory virus, Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to grow, it appears that young children are less susceptible to this SARS-CoV-2 [2] . Current research suggests that the lowered susceptibility in children is likely due to the scarcity of the SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the respiratory tract in children, meaning that the virus has less receptors to bind to and take hold within a child's respiratory tract [3] . It is also hypothesised that higher rates of prior infection with other human coronavirus in children may provide protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children [4] . Additionally, emerging evidence suggest most laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children results in mild disease, with severe disease in children considered rare [2] . Limited data are available relating to host immunologic response to COVID-19 infection in young children; nevertheless, it is evident that children do get infected with COVID-19 and around 12-18% of infected children are aged < 12 months [5, 6] . Few studies have reported potential of transmission of COVID-19 infection from mothers to newborns, but understanding of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infections is still limited [7] [8] [9] [10] .As of 28th July 2020, globally there have been 16,646,987 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 656,608 deaths [11] . The magnitude of the crisis has led to unprecedented speed in developing an effective vaccine. There are nearly 200 candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection at different stages of development with at least two being in advancedd stages of clinical trial [12] . It is possible that a safe and efficacious vaccine may become available for clinical use by late 2020 or early 2021 [13] . The World Health Organisation (WHO) is working with various stakeholders to ensure that when a vaccine is developed, they will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of the vaccine to people globally, prioritizing people at the greatest risk [14] . Often vaccines for respiratory infections, such as influenza and pneumococcal disease are highly recommended to groups of population at increased risk of severe disease including children aged less than five years, pregnant women, people with chronic morbidities and elderly population (aged > 65 years) [15, 16] .At the time of writing this paper (July 2020) the pandemic had been present for 6 months, with many considering this the first wave of the pandemic. According to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SARS-CoV-2 literature database [17] , >35,200 research studies and case reports have been published which provides updated information relating to how the pandemic has evolved in different sub-groups of people in different parts of the world. However, there is a lack of comprehensive epidemiological data relating to the pandemic specifically in children aged less than five years, the most at-risk paediatric age-population for respiratory infections and a priority population for vaccine globally. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compile existing literature and analyse published data to provide a robust understanding on epidemiological and clinical pattern of COVID-19 infection in children aged less than five years to inform clinical decisions and guide a road map for prevention strategies including COVID-19 vaccine in young children.This systematic review and meta-analyses of available literature on epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 infection in children aged less than five years was conducted following standard PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181936).Relevant articles and reports published as of June 4, 2020 in the electronic databases including Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus reporting epidemiological and clinical data on laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in children of any age were searched. The search strategy included a combination of free search terms and MESH terms with no language restriction. One review author (MUB) with previous experience of searching literature in electronic databases developed the search strategy. The following terms were included but not limited to the database search: ''2019 nCoV"", ''2019ncov"", ''2019-nCoV"", ''2019 novel coronavirus"", ''Novel coronavirus 2019"", ''COVID 19"", ''COVID-19"", ''COVID19"", ''Wuhan coronavirus"", ''Wuhan pneumonia"", ''SARS CoV-2"", ''SARS-Cov-2"" and were limited to ''all child (0-18 years)"", and ''Human"". Once the initial search was complete, we also looked into WHO coronavirus database to ensure that no relevant key articles were missed. The detailed search strategies applied for different databases are available in Supplementary table 1. EndNote was used to manage literature search output.The primary eligibility for inclusion of studies were published studies investigating epidemiology, transmission and clinical features of COVID-19 infection in children confirmed by laboratory diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 from any type of biological specimen (e.g. respiratory specimen, stool etc.) through reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as per the case definition from WHO [18, 19] . Only infection of COVID-19 in children confirmed by RT-PCR were included to ensure comparability of data extracted from multiple studies conducted in different countries. Details of study inclusion and exclusion criteria are in the Box 1.Two reviewers conducted the initial search (MUB and NH). MUB compiled all articles identified through literature search. Two reviewers (MUB and ES) independently screened the title and abstract of all publications to confirm eligibility and ensured the screened publication reported data for children younger than five years. All publications in Chinese language were translated by one of the investigators (MC) who is a Native Chinese speaker and a health professional (research nurse) . Any discrepancies in primary screening were initially discussed by two reviewers and resolved by consensus, otherwise a third reviewer (NH) resolved any disagreements. The risk of reviewer publication bias was minimised by involving two independent reviewers and a third reviewer when required, and by using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify all relevant studies.The following information was extracted from each eligible study: the year of publication, location, study year and timeline, total number of children with COVID-19, average age (median or mean, if both reported, then median was preferred over mean), duration of illness, symptoms (including asymptomatic children), number of children who developed severe illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and number of deaths. For studies which included both adults and/or children of all ages, only data relating to children younger than five years were extracted.Extracted data from each publication was recorded in a spreadsheet.Risk of bias in the included studies was evaluated using a methodological quality assessment tool formulated by Murad et al. [20] for case series and case reports, and by Hoy et. al [21] for all retrospective and prospective studies included in the review. The study characteristics including study design and country were tabulated. The clinical signs and symptoms were categorised under broad clinical headings: a) Upper respiratory included rhinorrhoea, cough and blocked or stuffy nose; b) Lower respiratory included tachypnoea and dyspnoea; c) Gastrointestinal included vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and abdominal distention and, d) Other signs and symptoms that included, headache, poor feeding/decreased oral intake, hypothermia, tachycardia, paroxysmal crying, fatigue/drowsiness and hypotension. Disease severity was classified as mild (no hospitalisation required or discharged from emergency room), moderate (required hospitalisation) or severe (required admission at ICU or high-dependency care unit (HDU) or mechanical ventilation support). Descriptive analysis with available data, was performed on socio-demographic characteristics for children aged less than five years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, clinical signs and symptoms, disease severity and outcomes and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 positive mothers.The meta-analysis included all studies with the exception of case reports and case series and where n = 1.Pooled estimates on key demographic (age, sex) and clinical characteristics (upper respiratory symptoms, lower respiratory symptoms, other symptoms, disease duration and severity, treatment received) were assessed using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine method, with a random effects model in R statistical software [22] . We intended to estimate the proportion of children aged < 5 years positive among all children who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, as there were very few publications where the denominator (total number of children tested for SARS-CoV-2) was reported, proportion positive could not be calculated Heterogeneity was assessed by Pearson v 2 (Q statistic) test and I 2 statistics was used to report variations [23] . An I 2 value of < 25% was taken to indicate low heterogeneity, 26%-74% moderate heterogeneity, and > 75% high heterogeneity [23] .We identified 1,964 articles from electronic databases and manual search (Fig. 1) . After removing duplicates (n = 844), titles and abstracts were screened for 1,120 articles and 185 were eligible for full-text examination. Of 185 full-text articles, 65 articles including 39 which were observational studies (retrospective medical record review and prospective cross-sectional studies) and 26 case studies and case reports were included in this review. The main characteristics of the studies are presented in Table 1 .The included 65 studies were conducted in 11 different countries: China (n = 49), United States (n = 6), Iran (n = 2), Vietnam (n = 1), Lebanon (n = 1), Iraq (n = 1), France (n = 1), United Kingdom (n = 1), Malaysia (n = 1), Canada (n = 1), and Germany (n = 1) ( Table 1) , and from four different WHO regions (European region, n = 3; Western Pacific region, n = 52 Pacific American region, n = 6; Eastern Mediterranean region, n = 4). Risk of bias was assessed separately for case-reports and case-studies (n = 26) (Fig. 2) and observational studies (n = 39) (Fig. 3) . Given the Exclusion criteria.Systematic reviews of COVID-19 in children or policy and casemanagement guidelines or abstracts only or opinion pieces or editorials or letters to the editor.Studies of children and/or adults where the data for adults and children >5 years could not be excluded. majority of observational studies included only COVID-19 confirmed children, there was low risk in regard to generalisability to similar paediatric population.A total of 1,214 children younger than five years with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection (further mentioned as COVID-19 cases) were included in this systematic review (Table 1 ). There were 474 COVID-19 cases from China, 720 from United States of America and Canada, eight from United Kingdom, five from Iran, two from Malaysia and one each from Vietnam, Lebanon, Iraq, France, and Germany. Of 1,214 COVID-19 cases, age-distribution data were available for 1,135 (93%) cases. The age of 1,135 COVID-19 cases ranged from zero days to less than five years: 596 (53%) were less than one year (infant) ( Table 1) . Among the 596 COVID-19 infant cases, five (1%) were newborns. Of the included 65 studies, 45 studies reported gender distribution for 179 COVID-19 cases: 117 (65%) were male. Source of infection was reported for 1,211 cases, of which 1,186 (98%) cases had a community acquired source.Of 1,214 COVID-19 cases, symptomatic status was reported for 880 (72%) of children: 834/880 (95%) were symptomatic and 46 (5%) were asymptomatic ( Table 2) . Where data available, detailed clinical symptoms were extracted for 196 children: fever (75/196, 38%) was the most frequently reported symptom followed by any upper respiratory symptoms (69/196, 35%), gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were reported in 7.7% (15/196) . Disease severity (mild, moderate or severe) were extractable for 345 children: the majority were mild illness (n = 155, 44.9%); 22 cases required simply oxygen therapy and 4 cases required invasive ventilator support. Treatment information was reported for 102 COVID-19 cases. A total of 64 (63%) of COVID-19 cases (20 studies) received at least one antiviral treatment, the most common medications reported were Interferon (includes both interferon beta-1b and interferon alfa-2b) (n = 31, 47.7%) and Oseltamivir (n = 20, 30.8%). Similarly, antibiotic treatments were reported in 17 studies and 29 COVID-19 cases (29%) received at least one antibiotic, with the most commonly reported antibiotic being Azithromycin (n = 8, 27.6%). Steroid treatment was reported in nine cases: all received Methylprednisone.Disease outcome was reported for 121 cases (43 publications), of these cases 120 cases were discharged from hospital or recovered with one death. The deceased case was a 10 month-old female infant with no underlying medical conditions or no history of preceding exposure to a known COVID-19 case [26] .Of the 65 were diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to delivery [28, 29, 31, 39, 42, 43, 57, 68, [74] [75] [76] 78, 82, 86] . Of the 149 deliveries, 133 (89%) were caesarean section (C-section) (Supplementary table 2) . Of the 151 babies born, 25 (16.5%) were born preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks) and 15 (10%) had low-birth weight (<2500 g). Five (3.3%) newborns were COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR at age 30 h to 17 days. All the five mothers completed at least 40 weeks of gestation and all five newborns were delivered by C-section. All but one mother developed respiratory symptoms before delivery. Of five newborns, three of them showed at least one respiratory symptom including fever, cough, shortness of breath and vomiting. None of them required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation. The hospital stays of newborns ranged from 16 days to 30 days.A total of 31 studies (COVID-19 cases, n = 1,181) (excluding case-reports and case-studies) were eligible for meta-analysis, studies excluded from the meta-analysis included studies were n = 1. Using data, when available, the outputs from meta-analysis are presented in Table 3 . The pooled estimate showed that among children aged less than five years with COVID-19 infection, 50% (95% CI: 36% to 63%) of children were aged less than one year (Fig. 4) and 53% (95% CI: 41% to 65%,) were male (supplementary Fig. 1 ). Using studies that reported both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, the pooled prevalence showed 43% (95% CI: 15% to 73%) were asymptomatic. We estimated 40% (95% CI: 6% to 78%) required no hospitalisation. Of the children who required hospitalisation (moderate/severe disease), 49% (95% CI: 12% to 86%) required oxygen therapy (not inclusive of mechanical ventilation). The pooled prevalence for antiviral treatment was 99% (95% CI: 92% to 100%) using data from 10 studies comprising 48 COVID-19 cases and similarly, for antibiotics was 71% (95% CI: 46% to 92%) using data from 5 studies comprising 14 COVID-19 cases, many cases reported combined treatments for patients. We were unable to extract data on transmission source and death for the meta-analysis.To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, specific for children aged less than five years with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our systematic review suggests that the prognosis of COVID-19 in children aged less than five years aligns with current published research, with >90% of children developing mild to moderate disease. These results are similar to recent reviews by Castagnoli et al [88] and Hoang et al [89] in all children < 18 years. This also follows trends that only 7% of cases in our review were severe cases requiring ICU or HDU admission, compared to 53% of adults recorded with severe COVID-19 disease requiring ICU admission [90] . This is a particularly important finding given that infants and young children aged less than five years are already at high risk of severe disease associated with other respiratory infections including influenza and RSV. It is likely that many COVID-19 infections in young children were classified as moderate illness (requiring hospital admission), were in fact mild disease, as those reported to have a hospital admission were due to isolation requirements only, not necessarily due to severity of clinical condition. This is also likely that many asymptomatic children were not tested and thus only the children with clinical manifestations were included in this study. Thus, the proportions we reported for severe and moderate cases could be higher than the true proportions.Emerging data suggest that children with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection can present with Kawasaki-like syndrome which has been termed as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 [91] [92] [93] . While such inflammatory syndrome has been documented in paediatric population in the United States, United Kingdom and also Italy, in our systematic review we did not find any reports of Kawasaki disease like syndrome or MIS-C in COVID-19 cases < 5 years to be included in this systematic review.This systematic review of >1,200 children aged less than five years with COVID-19 infection showed half of these cases were aged less than one year. Infants are particularly at higher risk of infectious disease during the first few months of their lives due to the inadequately developed immune system and are often targeted for prevention strategies. We also found that a handful of newborns (<4%) from COVID-19 infected mothers had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection within several hours to days of birth. Nonetheless, the vertical transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear as none of those studies could persuasively claim mother to neonate transmission. Recent reviews addressing immunological assessment, concluded with no evidence of intrauterine transmission during delivery from mothers to their fetuses [9, 42, 94] . These findings are analogous to data reported during previous influenza pandemics and novel coronavirus strains, associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) epidemics [95, 96] . Vaccine remains one of the most effective public health interventions to prevent transmission of infectious diseases. However, the immature immune system of newborns also makes them unsuitable for many vaccines. Maternal immunization during pregnancy has been proven to be an effective strategy in providing protection to infants, against many vaccinepreventable diseases including pertussis, tetanus and influenza during the first few months of life. Maternal immunization during pregnancy has two benefits, it protects the mother and fetus and it also protects the newborn through transplacental transfer of maternal antibody [97] . To date, we do not have an effective vaccine against COVID-19, but there are several vaccines in advanced clinical stages that may become available for clinical use within next 6-12 months [12] . In a situation where the COVID-19 vaccination is deemed to be unsuitable for infants, maternal immunisation could be a viable preventive approach. We found the majority (>95%) of the COVID-19 infections in children reportedly had a community source of infection, however, familial clusters were common in four case reports included in the review. Young adults and children have a high likelihood of developing COVID-19 due to household transmission, once a family member tests positive to COVID-19 [24] . However, there is limited evidence of secondary infection from children to others, suggesting that the role children play in the transmission pathways of COVID-19 remains unclear. Longer duration of virus shedding through the gastrointestinal tract can play a role in potential faecal-oral transmission of the virus, however this is yet to be confirmed [72, 73] .Our systematic review suggests while many children younger than five years were treated with antivirals, 71% were treated with antibiotics, despite having a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. This is a concerning proportion of antibiotic use as a treatment for the viral disease in children, given the inappropriate use of antibiotics in under five children is a significant contributor to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance globally [101, 99] . While prophylactic treatment with antibiotics in infants with unknown source of infection, is routine in preventing bacteraemia, urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia, this still has limitations in populations of increased antimicrobial resistance [100, 101] .The major strength of our study is it provides comprehensive epidemiological and clinical data on COVID-19 infection in a very specific age-group of children considered to be at highest risk of morbidity and mortality associated with ARIs including pneumonia. We were able to include available and eligible literature that were published in Chinese language (n = 17) during the very early stage of pandemic and inclusion of these articles added to the evidence base of this systematic review. Additionally, this allowed us to include a large number of young children (n = 1,214) in our analysis further strengthening the review. However, our review had some important limitations as well. The final search of the databases was concluded in early June, which meant that many geographical regions such as the United States and Europe that had resurgence of COVID-19 cases during a second wave were not included in our review. Nevertheless, as more literature become available, our systematic review will provide a comprehensive evidence base to further investigate epidemiological and clinical pattern of COVID-19 in children aged < 5 years. We had 26 case reports and hence the data could not be used in our meta-analysis which might have impacted the generalisability of the results. Additionally, only few studies provided detailed information on clinical outcome of the disease, which could be extracted for the pooled analysis. Hence, high level of heterogeneity was observed for some of the key clinical variables in the meta-analysis. In order to incorporate the betweenstudy variations, random effect models were used to estimate the summary effect size. There were only two studies from two European countries other than United Kingdom and none from Italy, Sweden, or Spain where the impact of pandemic has been extensive. In our search, we could not find any eligible studies from any country in the South East Asian Region (SEARO) region, where the response to the pandemic capacities remain insufficient. These areas are of particular concern as they tend to have a higher burden of childhood ARI. Additionally, we did not find articles reporting COVID-19 in Indigenous or ethnic minority paediatric populations although these groups of children have higher risk of respiratory infections. Lastly, even though we used comprehensive mesh terms for searching, it is possible we missed some articles.Our systematic review has shown that young children aged less than five years generally develop mild COVID-19 disease and these infections are often acquired through community sources. Half of the children aged less than five years with COVID-19 infection were infants. Additionally, a large proportion of the young children with COVID-19 infection are asymptomatic, underpinning the need for ongoing surveillance to monitor COVID-19 disease epidemiology in this paediatric population, strengthening prompt laboratory identification for case isolation and clinical management. Future research to understand risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection will help guide policy decisions around maternal vaccination when an effective vaccine becomes available.Funding NoneThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.",Australia,first author,2021-01-22,01
5742c04055670e3f4d356e98fc077f31566b27a7,Pop goes the tumour! Spontaneous haemorrhage of a hepatocellular carcinoma tumour,"Spontaneous haemorrhage of a liver tumour is a rare event with significant morbidity and mortality [1] . Hepatic adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the two most common associated pathologies [1] . HCC is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide [2] . A spontaneous haemorrhage occurs in 3-26% of HCC cases with a 32-75% 30-day mortality, which may be attributed to atypical presentation compounded by poor overall condition [1, [3] [4] [5] . Factors associated with poor prognosis include poor liver reserve, advanced disease and severity of haemorrhage [5] . Patients on anti-coagulant pharmacotherapy do not have an increased risk of spontaneous haemorrhage or poorer prognosis [1] .An 84-year-old male was brought in by ambulance to a rural hospital's emergency department with acute epigastric pain associated with haemodynamic instability on a background of ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. His surgical history included coronary artery bypass grafting and the insertion of a dual chamber pacemaker. Regular pharmacotherapy included lowdose aspirin, rivaroxaban, sotolol and atorvastatin. He had no underlying liver disease or any significant risk factors for liver disease.He was hypotensive (systolic 60 mmHg) with a grossly distended abdomen that was tender to palpation in all quadrants with associated guarding and localized peritonism in the right upper quadrant. A bedside ultrasound of the abdomen suggested a peri-hepatic collection. After initial resuscitation, haemodynamics improved and the decision was made to perform a computer tomography (CT) angiogram to identify a bleeding source. This confirmed a peri-hepatic collection predominantly located around the left lobe of the liver with contrast extravasation from a prominent vessel extending towards the liver capsule ( Fig. 1 ). Resuscitation continued with the activation of a massive transfusion protocol. Prothrombin concentrate and tranexamic acid were administered to partially reverse rivaroxaban, after coagulation studies revealed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 6.7. A Child-Pugh score of 9 (Class B) was calculated, placing the patient at a 30% risk of peri-operative mortality.The patient proceeded to an exploratory laparotomy. Induction of the patient followed COVID-19 guidelines by the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, which suggested limiting theatre personnel to the anaesthetic team only, requiring personnel to wear N-95 face masks and intubating the patient under a clear plastic sheet. Once the patient was intubated, the surgical team re-entered the theatre and proceeded with a laparotomy. Laparotomy confirmed haemoperitoneum with active haemorrhage from a lesion in the segment II/III of the liver. The Pringle manoeuvre was applied for 15 min, allowing haemostasis to be achieved with the application of sutures in the liver to approximate the bleeding edges of the lesion and packing of the right upper quadrant. Haemodynamic stability was achieved allowing transfer to a tertiary centre for ongoing management.On arrival to the tertiary centre, the patient was admitted to an intensive care unit for ongoing resuscitation. The patient subsequently underwent selective angioembolization of a segment II/III artery using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles (250-350 μm) and four micro-coils (Fig. 2) . Seventy-two hours after presentation, the patient underwent a re-look laparotomy with a left lateral sectionectomy of the liver to resect the identified lesion.Histopathological assessment revealed an 85-mm moderately differentiated HCC with evidence of vascular invasion that was completely excised with a 20-mm clear margin [TNM Staging (AJCC 8th edition): pT2] (Fig. 3) . The patient's recovery postprocedure was routine with transfer back to the rural hospital 13 days post-liver resection.From the rural hospital, the patient was referred to a rehabilitation hospital and subsequently discharged home a week later. At the time of discharge, the patient had a Child-Pugh score of 7 (Stage B) and was Stage A on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging. The patient was reviewed by a hepatologist 3 months after the liver resection. A triple phase CT was performed at the time, which did not show any residual liver lesion. Biochemistry revealed an elevated alpha-fetoprotein. The patient was commenced on sorafenib with a plan for review in 3 months.Resuscitation, diagnosis and intervention are the management goals of a spontaneous HCC haemorrhage [1, [3] [4] [5] . Resuscitation incorporates haemodynamic monitoring and regimen with infusion of blood products based on haemodynamic status and degree of anaemia. Correction of coagulopathies is crucial [1] . Diagnosis is aided by medical imaging. Ultrasonography can be performed at bedside in the unstable patient and may detect intra-peritoneal fluid, intra-hepatic haematoma or a liver lesion [1, 5] . In the stable patient, a triple phase CT of the abdomen can identify peritoneal collection, a bleeding source (if rate of bleeding is 1 mL/min) and/or a liver lesion [1, 5] . The immediate goal in intervention is to arrest haemorrhage. Selective angioembolization is currently the treatment of reference in stable or persistently unstable patients [1] . The associated morbidity is less than surgery, but decompensation of the underlying liver disease is a material risk [1] . Two options for emergency surgery are liver resection or local haemostatic procedures [1, 3] . The outcome of emergency liver resection is average with no survival benefit compared to patients undergoing resection at a later stage [1] . Emergency haemostatic procedures incorporate the principles of damage control surgery with definitive management performed at a later stage once the patient is resuscitated [1, 3, 5] . Advancement in resuscitation practices, imaging modalities and intervention have decreased the mortality associated with the spontaneous haemorrhage of a liver tumour [4, 5] .",Australia,abstract,2021-01-31,01
533f07fcf2cb60536fa75645dabf34ed4caecffa,"Environmental impacts of COVID-19 on Victoria, Australia, witnessed two waves of Coronavirus","The new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has caused many problems around the world and impacted almost all countries. The virus has spread to more than 83.9 million people and caused about 1.8 million deaths (WHO, 2020) . Currently, several countries are dealing with the second or third wave of the virus with far worse effects than the first wave.The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected the environment directly and indirectly. For example, because of the social distancing and curfew policies, it has been predicted that the greenhouse gas emissions could reduce to levels never before been observed since the Second World War (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020) . Considerable reductions in nitrogen dioxide concentrations and PM 2.5 levels were observed in major cities of China because of the shutdown of some industrial facilities and power plants, the curfew, and strong social distancing measures . Similarly, it has been reported that air pollution has significantly reduced in Europe (Giani et al., 2020) . According to UNCTAD (2020) , the global Coronavirus lockdown led to a 5% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Liu et al. (2020) reported that global CO 2 emissions reduced by approximately 8.8% for the same period.Although the pandemic has had some indirect and shortterm positive environmental impacts, it caused more severe adverse effects on solid waste management and plastic production. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the municipal solid waste management in many countries (Daryabeigi Zand and Vaezi Heir, 2020) . For instance, due to the concerns about the spread of the virus, some states in the USA temporarily closed recycling centres, suspended curbside recycling pickup, and onboard recyclables collections (Staub, 2020) . Similarly, in some European countries, the sorting of household wastes has been prohibited. To fight the spread of the virus, a huge surge in demand for plasticbased products has been observed, and some policies on plastic production and plastic bag bans have been suspended. This is simply because of (1) the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare system and community, (2) the recommended or mandatory face mask use policies around the world, and (3) the generation of typical packaging plastic waste because of the significant increase in online shopping and home delivery services (Sharma et al., 2020) . Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge pressure on the landfills in developing countries, where solid waste materials and hazardous wastes are dumped in poorly managed and open landfills, which can pose health and environmental threats (Rowan and Laffey, 2020) .Victoria is the most densely populated state in Australia, with a population of over 6.68 million. Melbourne, the capital of the State of Victora, is the second-most populated city in Australia, having a population of more than 5 million. Similar to highly populated and large states and provinces around the world, the state of Victoria has not been excluded from the impacts of Coronavirus; however, Australia is among one the most successful countries in managing and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The first case of the novel Coronavirus was confirmed in Victoria on 25 January 2020. Then, the first wave of infections in Victoria emerged during the period of early March 2020 to the mid of May (Fig. 1 ). Victoria's second wave of the COVID-19 spread was mainly caused by the hotel quarantine scandal in Melbourne. Thanks to the efforts of the state's government and the Australian government, and endless efforts of healthcare workers as well as the cooperation and patience of people, the Victorians can now beat the spread of the virus before the situation gets out of control. It is worth to mention that the first restrictions came on 13 March 2020, and on 16 March, new rules came into effect and a state of emergency was declared by the Victorian Government. The second wave, which was 10 times harder than the first wave, could last for more than 5 months. In total, 20,345 confirmed cases and 819 deaths were reported in Victoria by 27 October 2020. By the end of the second wave, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Victoria constitutes about 74% of the total number of confirmed cases in Australia, while approximately 90% of the total deaths in Australia occurred in Victoria (Australian Government Department of Health, 2020).During the second wave of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures and curfew policies were applied by the Victorian Government. In early July, during the stage 3 restrictions, the residents were allowed to leave their homes for only four reasons, including medical care or caregiving, daily exercise, work or school, or purchasing food and supplies. The face-covering rule became mandatory on 22 July. Due to the surge in the number of confirmed cases, more strict rules were introduced in Victoria from the beginning of August until the end of October. The rules included curfew from 8 pm to 5 am, leaving home for shopping within 5 km from home, 1-hour limitation of exercise per day within 5 km, schools returned to remote learning, public transport services reduced, closing of many stores, shops, and retails, etc. The curfew and most of the strict rules were lifted after cases of Coronavirus were eliminated on 27 October 2020. One hundred eleven days of lockdown ranks among the toughest in the world. However, some rules, such as the mandatory face mask use in the whole of Victoria, are still in place. Consequently, all of the rules and strict policies during the lockdowns had effects on the environment of Victoria, primarily the metropolitan Melbourne.Previous studies mainly focused on health issues directly related to the SARS-CoV2 Coronavirus. Little attention has been directed to the pandemic's influence on the environment. This paper discusses the negative and positive indirect impacts of COVID-19 on the environment of the State of Victoria, Australia. Mobility trends and traffic Figure 2 demonstrates the changes in the mobility trends in Victoria and Melbourne City. It can be seen that the mobility trends changed significantly compared to the period before the Coronavirus outbreak in Victoria due to the strict rules during the stage 4 Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Victoria. Besides, the mobility trends for retail and recreation venues, public transport hubs, and workplaces dramatically reduced, which could be related to the enforced restricting rules, mainly working from homes, staying within 5 km from homes, and closing of the shops, stores, and retails.Compared to the mobility trends in the State of Victoria, more significant changes in the mobility trends were observed in Melbourne City. For instance, from 11 September to 23 October 2020, public transport hubs, retail and recreation venues, and workplaces witnessed a considerable reduction in movements at 85%, 83%, and 76%, respectively, compared to the baseline, which is the average value of the same day of the week for the period of 5 weeks from 3 January to 6 February 2020. Also, higher reductions in the mobility trends were observed during the second lockdown compared to the first one (Katestone, 2020a) . In Melbourne City, residential was the only category that experienced an increase during the pandemic (Google, 2020) . The mobility trends for retail and recreation venues, public transport hubs, workplaces, supermarkets and pharmacies, and parks dropped significantly from the beginning of the first wave to the end of the first wave. However, the mobility trends experienced a mild increase between the end of the first wave to the beginning of the second wave. This is mainly because of easing some restrictions between the first and second lockdown periods. During the second lockdown period, mobility trends decreased slightly and remained relatively constant.During the lockdowns and because of the social distancing restrictions, peak-hour gridlocks in the most common congested areas of Victoria have disappeared. Figure 3 shows the traffic volume change in Melbourne during the pandemic. The traffic in Melbourne dropped significantly during the lockdowns compared to the first 2 weeks of March 2020 (Charting Transport, 2020). An easing of some restrictions after the first wave resulted in an increase in the traffic volume during 25-31 May and the whole of June. A relatively larger Air quality affects human health or comfort, but more than 90% of the world population lives in poor air quality areas. When solid particles, liquids, or gases in the air are sufficient to cause damage to the environment or adversely impact human health, air pollution occurs (Zhang et al., 2017) . Salt spray, wind-blown dust, bushfires, industrial activities, and exhaust from motor vehicles are the main reasons of air pollutions. Poor air pollution is responsible for about 8% of the total deaths in the world (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). Figure 4 shows diurnal profiles of PM 2.5 and CO at two sites of Alphington and Footscray in Melbourne and compares the measurements from 16 March to 1 May 2020 with the corresponding period in the past 4 years (2016-2019). On average, PM 2.5 levels were observed to be lower by 23% at Alphington and 24% at Footscray for 2020 compared with the average PM 2.5 levels in the past 4 years. A comparison of the average CO levels revealed that a 39% reduction occurred at Alphington (Katestone, 2020b,c) . In Seoul, Korea, PM 2.5 showed a considerable drop of 36% in March 2020 compared to the same time of 2017-2019 (Seo et al. 2020) . A decrease of 20.6% in PM 2.5 levels in the USA was also observed in March 2020 relative to March 2019. Moreover, pollution concentrations reduced by 12.5% for CO and 15.4% for PM 2.5 in China from January to March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (Liu et al., 2020) . A reduction of 28% to 31% for PM 10 was reported by Tobias et al. (2020) in Barcelona, Spain, during the March lockdown.On the other hand, it is worthy of evaluating the effects of stage 4 lockdown restrictions in Victoria (started from the beginning of August 2020) on the air pollution levels. Figure 5 compares the monthly average NO 2 concentrations at two sites of Footscray and Alphington in 2020 compared to the monthly average NO 2 concentrations in the past 10 years (2010-2019). As can be seen from the figure, from March to April 2020, during the first lockdown, a considerable decrease in NO 2 concentrations was observed at both sites compared to the monthly average NO 2 concentrations in the past 10 years. This can be attributed to the significant drop in the mobility trends and traffic volumes from March to April 2020, mainly because of the restrictions imposed during the first wave. In fact, the reduction of fossil fuel combustion and industry emissions resulted in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. A similar decrease of NO 2 was reported for the USA (14.32%) and China (4.53%) in March 2020 compared to March 2019 (Liu et al., 2020) . A decrease in tropospheric NO2 was also observed in Delhi, India, during the pandemic (Singh and Chauhan, 2020) . Bauwens et al. (2020) reported a considerable decrease of 20-38% of NO 2 in western Europe. During June 2020, the NO 2 concentrations returned almost to the average levels, while the NO 2 concentrations witnessed an increase in July 2020 compared to the average levels. This is simply because of the easing of some restrictions after the first wave of the pandemic. Due to more strict restrictions, the concentrations of NO 2 during the second lockdown reduced significantly compared to the first lockdown and previous years. For instance, in early August 2020, the concentrations of NO 2 reduced by 31% and 38% at Footscray and Alphington, respectively, compared to July 2020.Environmental noise, which is an unwanted sound, generally generates from industrial, commercial, and construction 1-7 June 22-28 June 29 June -5 July 6-12 July 13-19 July 20-26 JulyEnviron Sci Pollut Res activities, and traffics. Environmental noise pollution may increase the risk of many diseases and change the ecosystem's conditions (Zagubień and Wolniewicz 2021) . Lecocq et al. (2020) reported that the COVID-19 restrictions led to significant changes in human activities, which resulted in the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction in recorded history and caused a 50% drop in global median high-frequency seismic ambient noise from March to May 2020. During the lockdowns in Victoria, imposing the strict social distancing measures and curfew policies enforced people to leave their homes for shopping within specific ranges, returned students to remote learning, and obliged many people to work from home. Compared to the first lockdown period, tougher restrictions during the second lockdown led to a reduction in some public transport services, decreasing the traffic levels, and closure of many retail stores, restaurants, and factories. These changes resulted in a further dropping of environmental noise levels in Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne during the second lockdown period compared to the first lockdown period.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused not only health-related issues such as mental health problems, job and economy losses, and socio-economic hardships but also waste management issues in many countries (Acter et al., 2020; Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020) . It has put immense pressure on the existing waste collection and management system and caused inappropriate waste management strategies such as local burnings, mobile incinerations, and direct landfills (Adyel, 2020) . For instance, Singapore households generated extra 1334 tons of plastic waste in April 2020, which can be attributed to the Fig. 4 The concentrations of a PM 2.5 and b CO in Melbourne from 16 March to 1 May 2020 compared with the corresponding period in the past 4 years (2016) (2017) (2018) (2019) change in consumer behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. . During the first lockdown, the City of Melbourne reported a 70% increase in illegally dumped waste in April 2020, compared with the same period in 2019 (Farrer, 2020) . This could be related to the rise in home improvements and renovations, packing waste from shopping online, dumping of unwanted possessions, and used PPE such as gloves and masks.Although single-use plastic products are banned in many countries, there is a setback in using and management of plastics in the fight with the Coronavirus pandemic (Naughton, 2020) . Using PPE is among one of the effective announced guidelines for reducing the spread of the Coronavirus, which resulted in mandatory face mask use in more than half of the countries around the world or recommended face mask use in almost all of the countries (Royo-Bordonada et al., 2020) . Consequently, huge amounts of plastic-based PPE, such as masks, gloves, waterproof shoes, protective clothing, face shields, and hand sanitizer bottles and packaging made with polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate are produced around the world every day. The improper management of plastic-based PPE waste can potentially increase the spread of the virus (Mol and Caldas, 2020) . Therefore, to avoid the further spread of the virus, it is crucial to consider the waste management issues of the generation of plastic-based PPE caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Klemeš et al., 2020) .Wearing a face mask was not mandated in Victoria during the first lockdown but became mandatory on 22 July 2020 (during the second wave of the virus). There is no exact data on the number of face masks used in Victoria. Thus, it is worthy of using the following model proposed by Nzediegwu and Chang (2020) and Sangkham (2020) to estimate the daily face mask use in Victoria, D FM .where P is the population of Victoria, which is about 6,689,400 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2020); U P is the urban population in Victoria, which is about 80%; F MAR is the face masks acceptance rate, which is considered 65% during the first lockdown and 100% during the second lockdown in Victoria; and F MGP is an assumption that how many masks are used by a person in the general population each day, which is considered 1 in this study. Therefore, by using Eq. (1) and the assumptions mentioned above, the daily face mask use in Victoria during the first lockdown and second lockdown can be estimated at 3,478,488 and 5,351,520, respectively. Taking the average weight of a mask as 30 g, which is the weight of a surgical mask (lowest weight among other masks), it is estimated that about 104 and 160 tonnes of used face masks were generated each day during the first and second wave of the Coronavirus in Victoria, respectively.As shown in Fig. 6 , the used face masks can be spotted everywhere from parks to streets to beaches due to an uptick in littering. Even if they are disposed at a landfill, wind and rainwater can blow or move the lightweight masks into rivers and oceans, and the non-biodegradable plastic-based masks will be fragmented into microplastics (Prata et al., 2020) .A comparison of the traffic and air quality data before and during the lockdowns revealed that the lockdowns improved air quality in Victoria substantially since there were far fewer vehicles on the roads during the lockdowns. The reduction in air pollution can also be attributed to declining industrial/ construction activities and significantly decreasing international flights due to the border closures. Compared to the first lockdown, mobility trends and air pollutants reduced considerably during the second lockdown because of more strict restrictions. The reasons mentioned above also contributed to a substantial reduction of environmental noise pollutions in Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne. It can be seen from the results that after easing of restrictions, mobility trends, air pollution, and traffic shifted to a typical situation before the lockdowns within 1-2 month(s). For instance, during July and August in Melbourne, the air pollution experienced a Fig. 5 The monthly average NO 2 concentrations at two sites in Melbourne in 2020 compared to the monthly average NO 2 concentrations in the past 10 years considerable increase even higher than before the pandemic. Therefore, when the pandemic ends, the lockdown-induced positive environmental effects will disappear in a relatively short period. Traffic congestion and air pollution will return to ""business as usual"". One possible way to reduce traffic for the post-COVID-19 pandemic future is to allow more people to work from home after the Covid-19 crisis.The social distancing restrictions can lead to higher municipal solid waste generations, as observed in Melbourne, due to increased home renovations, packing waste related to online shopping, and single-use plastic-based items. Furthermore, to control the spread of the virus, a mandated or recommended face mask use policy results in the generation of huge amounts of PPE such as masks and gloves. The improper management of the plastic-based waste results in plastic pollutions and microplastics that cause many environmental issues, such as killing animals and marine life (Fadare and Okoffo, 2020) . It is worth to mention that despite the suspended recycling programs in several countries around the world, due to the COVID-19, the planned and ongoing recycling programs in Australia and especially in Victoria have not been stopped. Victorian government and EPA Victoria declared that the facilities of waste and recycling industries remain open during the pandemic, and the industries and councils need to continue to provide waste services to the public (EPA Victoria, 2020).Based on the comparative study results of the current work, it can be concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic can cause short-term positive impacts on the environment, but the negative effects are more severe. For example, many countries, including Australia, are facing challenges in the waste management of used PPE which are made of non-biodegradable plastics that can take hundreds of years to break down in the environment. According to the estimations of the current study, about 104 and 160 tons of used face masks were generated daily during the first and second wave of the pandemic in Victoria. A noticeable decrease of 85%, 83%, and 76% was observed for the respective mobility trends of public transport hubs, retail and recreation venues, and workplaces during a period of the second wave of the pandemic in Victoria compared to the period of 5 weeks from 3 January to 6 February 2020 (i.e. before the pandemic). Also, PM2.5 levels were lower by 23% at Alphington and 24% at Footscray from 16 March to 1 May 2020 compared with the average PM2.5 levels in the past 4 years. But decreasing air pollution, traffic, and noise pollution during lockdowns are not sustainable ways to improve and clean the environment. More importantly, as was observed in the case of Victoria, which experienced the second wave of the pandemic, the positive environmental impacts related to COVID-19 can be vanished in a short period after easing of restrictions. Moreover, similar to the much worse situation of the second wave compared to the first wave in terms of the number of cases in most countries, the negative environmental effects of a given wave of the COVID-19 can be harsher and more long-standing than its previous wave. Therefore, all countries need to pay attention to the impacts of the pandemic on the environment as it can cause more and long-lasting environmental problems.A cross-disciplinary collaborative approach is urgently required to address the current environmental issues caused by the indirect negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to reduce the dependency on single-use PPE and reduce pandemic-generated waste. Repurposing the used PPE is an effective way to prevent a large amount of pandemic-generated waste from ending up in the landfill. The authors have already done a feasibility study of using the shredded face mask with recycled concrete aggregate as a road pavement material (Saberian et al. 2021) . The results show that building a two-lane 1-km-long road would require approximately 3 million used face masks that would otherwise go to landfill. The feasibility study also found that introducing the used masks to the recycled concrete aggregate can improve the strength, ductility, and flexibility of pavements base/subbase. To keep air and noise pollution at low levels, local governments and policymakers should implement emissions and vehicle efficiency standards, encouraging consumers to use electric vehicles that produce no carbon dioxide emissions and less noise compared to conventional vehicles. This paper presents preliminary findings based on the limited data available. More studies, particularly a large-scale national or cross-national (regional/international) assessment, are required to fully understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment.",Australia,abstract,2021-01-28,01
de984874b4472e748f4f42255592cbcb002061df,"16 5 DonateLife, The Australian Organ and Tissue Authority, ACT 2601","In contrast to the high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 46 coronaviruses, endemic human coronaviruses (hCoV) circulate worldwide but typically cause common colds with only limited morbidity and mortality 1 . Endemic hCoV encompass two alpha-48 coronaviruses (aCoV), NL63 and 229E, and two beta-coronaviruses (bCoV), HKU1 and OC43 1 . 49Sero-epidemiological studies suggest that infection and seroconversion to hCoV occurs during 50 early childhood (typically by 4 years of age) 2-4 , although there are discrepant reports on the 51 prevalence of each virus within distinct geographical cohorts 2,5 . Despite the early development of 52 immunity against multiple hCoV, most adults remain susceptible to periodic reinfection 6-8 , with 53 increased susceptibility among immunocompromised individuals 9-11 . This suggests the 54 magnitude and/or quality of hCoV-targeted immunity in adults is insufficient for sterilizing 55 protection but instead may limit the burden of disease to asymptomatic or mild infection 8 . 56Defining the extent of serological and/or cellular immunity required to protect individuals from 57 reinfection or severe disease remains a key question in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As 58 neutralizing responses wane after CoV infection, it is likely that a combination of serum 59 antibody and B cell / T cell memory provide longer-term protection from the recurrence of 60 disease 12,13 . The study of hCoV-specific T and B cell memory can therefore provide a key 61 preview into the development of durable, protective SARS-CoV-2 immunity. 62Characterisation of population-level immunity to hCoV can also inform our understanding of 63 cross-reactive immune responses between high pathogenicity and endemic CoV. Studies of 64 SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in uninfected individuals clearly demonstrate pre-existing 65 cross-reactive antibody 14-16 , B cell 16 and T cell responses [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Nevertheless, it is currently 66 unclear what contribution, if any, cross-reactive immunity plays in modulating the response to 67 SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination 23 . Detailed analyses of cross-reactive T cells suggest the 68 majority of such responses are dominated by CD4 T cells and directed toward non-RBD epitopes 69 of the spike (S) protein 18,21,24 . To date, however, consensus regarding the origin of these cross-70 reactive responses is lacking, with evidence both for 18 and against 25 a major contribution from 71 hCoV-specific memory T cells. 72Deconvolution of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 responses and de novo SARS-CoV-2 immunity 73 requires a more detailed understanding of hCoV-specific serological and cellular memory. 74Relatively little is known about population-level T or B cell memory to hCoV in adults, despite 75 evidence suggesting an impact of recent hCoV infection on COVID-19 severity 26 . Several 76 groups find widespread but modest CD4 T cell responses to hCoV proteins, with estimates for 77 the prevalence of memory responses ranging from 70-100% of study participants 24, 25, 27 . 78Detection of hCoV-specific CD8 T cell responses has been less reported 27 , and the prevalence of 79 cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific responses in these cohorts varies substantially 24, 25 . 80Furthermore, data comparing hCoV-specific T or B cell responses in the circulation with the 81 presence or absence of such responses in the respiratory tract or secondary lymphoid organs 82 (SLO) is lacking. Studies in animal models suggest that respiratory infections can generate long-83 lived T cell memory in lung draining lymph nodes (LDLN) 28 , raising the possibility of analogous 84 responses following hCoV infection. 85To address these knowledge gaps, we assessed the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of 86 hCoV spike-specific antibody, memory T cell and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 87 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected adults. We find that the magnitude of hCoV immunity is independent 88 of age and is characterized by robust antibody titres, widespread CD4 T cell memory within both 89Tmem and cTFH populations, and an enrichment of T cell memory in LDLN. In contrast, 90Results 95We recruited a cohort of 42 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected adults (n=21 male, n=21 female), ranging 97 in age from 18-67 years with no recent cold or COVID-19 symptoms ( Figure 1A ). Consistent 98 with previous studies 15, 16 , we detected baseline plasma antibody responses to one or more hCoV 99 S antigens in all participants, with substantially lower reactivity toward SARS-CoV-2 S (herein 100CoV-2; Figure 1B ). Plasma IgG endpoint titres for hCoV antigens ranged from 1:176 to 1:18268 101 To determine the distribution of CD4 T cell memory responses, we stimulated PBMC with 105 recombinant S antigens and quantified antigen-specific Tmem (CD3 + CD4 + CD45RA + CXCR5 -) 106 by measuring upregulation of the activation markers CD25 and OX-40 by flow cytometry (a 107 well-established activation-induced marker (AIM) assay 29-31 ) ( Figure 1C ; gating in Supplemental 108 Figure 1 ). Across the cohort, 88% of individuals exhibited a memory response greater than 109 0.01% above background 32 to any hCoV S antigen ( Figure 1D ). Interestingly, the prevalence of 110 responses was highest to HKU1 S (86% of participants), and lowest to NL63, with only 50% of 111 individuals exhibiting NL63 S-specific responses ( Figure 1D ). The magnitude of responses to 112 hCoV S antigens ranged from undetectable to a maximum of 0.84% of the Tmem compartment 113 ( Figure 1E ). Among individuals with above-background responses, median antigen-specific 114Given divergent host receptor specificity and possible differences in tissue tropism among 126 hCoV 1 , we assessed whether memory or chemokine receptor phenotypes differed among S-127 specific CD4 T cell populations (gating in Supplementary Figure 1B) . Similar to the parental 128 Tmem population, hCoV S-specific and CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cells were predominately 129 CD27 + CCR7 + , classically defined as central memory T cells (TCM; Figure 2A -B). In contrast to 130 the bulk Tmem population, however, hCoV S-specific cells were substantially enriched for 131 CCR6 expression (with or without co-expression of CXCR3; Figure 2C -D). When comparing 132 intra-individual responses, hCoV S-specific Tmem phenotypes were generally similar across all 133 S antigens ( Figure 2E ). Prior studies have also described a dominant CCR6 phenotype of CoV-2 134 S-specific Tmem among convalescent COVID-19 subjects 33 , and here we find that CoV-2 cross-135 reactive responses are similarly highly CCR6 biased ( Figure 2D-E) . 136 137 hCoV reactivity is detected among circulating T follicular helper cell (TFH) memory 138Median frequencies among responding donors were highest to HKU1 (median 0.241%, IQR 148 0.147-0.531), followed by OC43 (median 0.213%, IQR 0.126-0.424), 229E (median 0.126%, 149 IQR 0.061-0.340), NL63 (median 0.096%, IQR 0.050-0.210) and CoV-2 (median 0.085%, IQR 150 0.050-0.195) ( Figure 3A) . 151It is currently unclear whether CoV-2 cross-reactive T cell responses arise primarily from hCoV 165 memory or reflect cross-reactivity from a broad array of antigen specificities 18,25 . Among the 166 cohort, subjects with CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cell responses frequently exhibited memory 167 responses to multiple hCoVs ( Figure 4A ). We assessed the relationship between the frequency of 168CoV-2 and hCoV memory responses and found significant correlations only between βCoV and 169 CoV-2 cross-reactivity (p=0.006 for HKU1, p=0.018 for OC43; Figure 4B ). This association is 170 consistent with a greater sequence homology among βCoV strains (CoV-2, HKU1 and OC43) 171 compared to the aCoV 229E and NL63 42 . 42 Among the subset of donors with cross-reactive 172 responses, only HKU1 memory correlated with CoV-2 cross-reactivity (p=0.030, Figure 4B ). 173Despite periodic re-infection, most adults experience only mild or asymptomatic hCoV infection, 252suggesting the presence of at least partially protective immune memory. We find that, in addition 253 to near-universal plasma antibody reactivity to hCoV, memory T cell responses to both aand 254 bCoV are widespread. In contrast, the relatively modest neutralization activity against NL63 and 255 low frequencies of S-specific MBC suggest that sterilizing humoral immunity is likely absent. Consistent with other cohorts 17,19 , we find evidence for CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cells in 279 uninfected donors. In vitro expansion of CoV-2 cross-reactive T cell clones has demonstrated the 280 potential for shared specificity with all hCoV 18,24 . However at a cohort-wide level, we find the 281 frequency of CoV-2 cross-reactive cells correlates most strongly with HKU1 memory, although 282 no immediate immunological or demographic features distinguish HKU1-reactive individuals 283 with or without cross-reactive CoV-2 responses. Larger population-based studies will be required 284 to determine any associations between particular HLA class II alleles and cross-reactive CD4 285 responses. Although it has been speculated that pre-existing cross-reactive T cell immunity could 286 be beneficial in the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 23 , it should be noted that only CXCR3 + , 287 but not CCR6 + , cTFH responses appear to correlate with neutralizing antibody titres during 288 COVID-19 convalescence 29,31,48 . While recall of the CCR6 + cTFH could induce expression of 289 CXCR3, currently available evidence suggests the highly CCR6-biased responses to hCoV may 290 not be beneficial in the context of vaccination or re-exposure. 291Overall, these data clarify the characteristics of long-term immunity to endemic coronaviruses, 292 which have comparable magnitudes and share phenotypic features of S-specific antibody and T 293 cell memory across all four hCoV. Insight into the homeostatic maintenance of hCoV immunity 294 is likely to provide a preview of long-term CoV-2-specific immunity established in the 295 population after vaccination or wide-spread infection. 296Subject recruitment and sample collection 299 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected controls were recruited as part of a previous COVID-19 study 29 , and 300 relevant demographic characteristics are indicated in Figure 1A .

e1fe94fce8960d355bc0ddb3eee016fd1e788cb5,Early View Plasma ACE2 activity is persistently elevated following SARS-CoV-2 infection: implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis and consequences Revision 2 ERJ-03730-2020 Plasma ACE2 activity is persistently elevated following SARS-CoV-2 infection: implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis and consequences,"COVID-19 causes persistent endothelial inflammation, lung, cardiovascular, kidney and neurological complications as well as thromboembolic phenomena of unclear pathogenesis [1] . SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for host cell entry [2] , which is thought to downregulate membrane-bound ACE2, and thus contribute to ongoing inflammation due to loss of a degradative pathway for angiotensin II. In healthy individuals, ACE2 exists primarily in its membrane-bound form with very low levels of the catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 present in the circulation [3] . However, in patients with cardiovascular disease, there is increased ""shedding"" of ACE2, and higher circulating levels are associated with downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2 [4] .In this prospective observational study in recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes leading to increased plasma ACE2 activity levels.We measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based in-house assay as previously described [3] [4] [5] in a cohort of Australians aged 18 years (n=66) who had recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR testing) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Of the 66 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients, 23 agreed to provide follow-up samples. The severity of COVID-19 infection was defined according to National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines [6] as mild (predominantly upper respiratory tract infection), moderate (lower respiratory tract infection) or severe (hospitalisation). The immune responses in a subset of the overall cohort in this paper have been previously reported [7] , and for the purpose of this study, we also obtained information on medications and comorbid conditions including hypertension (diagnosis of hypertension and/or antihypertensive treatment), hyperlipidaemia (treatment with lipid lowering agents), obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m 2 ), diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The study was approved by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (#2056689); all participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Data were analysed with SPSS version 26.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corp©, USA). Plasma ACE2 activity was compared using the Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test and significance adjusted by Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. Fisher's Exact test was used to compare categorical variables. Serial ACE2 activity levels were analysed using the Friedman test for repeated measures; after post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with a Bonferroni correction applied. Two-tailed P-values <0.05 were considered significant.The controls and SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects were matched for age (54  11 vs. 53  14 years, p=0.47) and gender (37 (53%) vs. 39 (59%) male, p=0.49) (mean ± SD). With regard to risk factors and/or comorbidities, hypertension was present in 7% (n = 9) of all subjects, hyperlipidaemia in 8% (n = 11), obesity in 2% (n = 3), diabetes in 1% (n = 1) and cardiovascular disease in 2% (n = 3), with no difference between controls and SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects (all, P >0.05). There was no difference in the use of antihypertensive (n = 7), lipid lowering (n = 11) or antiplatelet therapy (n =4) between controls and SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects (all, P >0.05).At a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-38 days], plasma ACE2 activity was significantly higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 subjects compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p<0.0001, Figure 1A ). Plasma ACE2 activity differed according to disease severity (p=0.033) with severe COVID-19 associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (11. 2 This is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated in patients after COVID-19 infection compared to uninfected age and gender matched controls with similar comorbidities, and the first with long-term data to indicate that plasma ACE2 activity remains elevated out to a median of 114 days post-infection, the last time point sampled. It is already known that males have higher plasma ACE2 activity than females [5, 8] , but this is the first report that plasma ACE2 activity levels are increased in those with more severe COVID-19 infection. Although the pathophysiologic cause and consequences of elevated plasma ACE2 activity in the setting of COVID-19 are unknown, we reported that increased plasma ACE2 was an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiac events in patients with aortic stenosis [4] and coronary artery disease [5] . Others have recently shown that higher plasma ACE2 concentration was associated with increased risk of major cardiovascular events in a large global population-based study [8] .In conclusion, we suggest that binding of SARS-CoV-2 to membrane ACE2 has at least 2 effects. First, it downregulates membrane ACE2 causing a dysregulated local renin angiotensin system (RAS) that favours inflammation and ongoing tissue damage secondary to excess angiotensin II [9] . Second, the dysregulated local RAS is associated with prolonged shedding of the catalytically active site of ACE2 into the circulation.In addition to the early multisystem effects of COVID-19, a proportion of patients experience prolonged ill-health commonly known as ""long-COVID"", the nature of which remains to be fully characterised [10] . Larger studies are now needed to determine if persistently elevated plasma ACE2 activity may identify people at risk of prolonged illness or cardiac events following COVID-19 infection, as well as studies that address whether therapeutic strategies directed at a dysregulated RAS can reduce COVID-19 complications.

5172bafd54e3665ab7bdeffed3d2f293c5450b94,Screening and development of monoclonal antibodies for identification of ferret T follicular helper cells,"| (2021) 11:1864 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81389-z www.nature.com/scientificreports/ to engage with their respective ligands, PD-L1/PDL-2 and ICOSL, which are expressed by GC B cells to support the development of Tfh cells 12 .Here, we describe the screening and development of ferret Tfh marker monoclonal antibodies and identification of ferret Tfh cells using these antibodies. We first identified two commercial anti-human/mouse BCL6 antibodies which had cross-reactivity with ferret lymph node (LN) cells. We next developed mouse anti-ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies using single cell PCR-based method. Finally, we detected Tfh cells in lymph nodes from influenza infected ferrets using these antibodies.Screening of commercial anti-human or mouse BCL6, CXCR5 and PD-1 antibodies for cross-reactivity with ferret lymph node cells. BCL6 expression is the canonical transcription factor that distinguishes Tfh cells from other CD4+ T cells in human and mouse [15] [16] [17] . However, high co-expression of CXCR5 and PD-1 serves as surrogate or confirmatory surface markers for the Tfh population in human and mouse lymphoid tissues 18 . Commercial anti-human/mouse BCL6 antibodies were screened for cross-reactivity against ferrets by staining LN cell suspensions recovered from influenza infected ferrets. The gating strategy to identify live lymphocytes in the ferret LN is shown in Fig. 1a . We found that clones K112-91 and IG191E/A8, originally developed for human BCL6 15, 16 , showed cross-reactivity with ferret cLN cells (Fig. 1b) . The BCL6+ B cell (CD79a+) population represents a putative GC B cell population, while BCL6+ CD4+ cells are likely to mark Tfh cells although additional markers are needed.We next screened commercial antibodies raised against mouse or human CXCR5 (clones L138D7 and RF8B2) and PD-1 (clones 29F.1A12 and EH12.2H7) for ferret cross-reactivity. Unfortunately, all screened murine and human antibodies showed no cross-reactivity with ferret lymph node cells (data not shown) although they showed good reactivity with mouse or human lymph node cells. Thus, we initiated the generation of ferret CXCR5 and PD-1-specific monoclonal antibodies.Homology analysis of ferret, human and mouse BCL6, CXCR5 and PD-1. Comparison of amino acid homology of ferret, human and mouse BCL6, CXCR5 and PD-1 confirmed ferret BCL6 was a highly conserved, with high homology to both human BCL6 (95.47%) and mouse BCL6 (93.78%) ( Table 1 ). In contrast, ferret CXCR5 had only moderate homology with human CXCR5 (84.22%) and mouse CXCR5 (87.43%) and ferret PD-1 had low homology with both human (67.24%) and mouse PD-1 (54.48%), consistent with the lack of ferret cross-reactivity of commercially available CXCR5 and PD-1-specific monoclonal antibodies.Generation of mouse anti-ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. Due to the low sequence conservation, we initiated the de novo development of anti-ferret PD1 and CXCR5 monoclonal antibodies for flow cytometric use (workflow in Fig. 2 ). The cDNA sequence of the ectodomains of ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 were identified using a NGS dataset (Wong et al. in press) . These genes were synthesized and cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing human IgG1 Fc tag used for protein purification. Recombinant proteins were expressed by Expi293 cells and purified by protein A agarose. Next, we immunized C57BL/6 mice with recombinant ferret CXCR5 or PD-1 proteins. At day 21 post-immunization, we isolated draining lymph nodes from the mice, stained lymph node cell suspensions with a panel of antibodies as well as immunogen probes. The murine GC B cells binding to the fluorescent ferret CXCR5 or PD-1 probes were single-cell-sorted into 96-well PCR plates. The BCR sequences of sorted B cells were then recovered by single cell PCR with mouse IgG heavy or light chain primers 19 . The variable domains genes of heavy or kappa chains from clonally expanded families of B cells were synthesized and cloned into mammalian expression vectors containing mouse IgG1 or kappa chain constant domain gene. Antibodies were expressed in Expi293 and purified by protein G agarose.Validation of anti-ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies by ELISA. The binding specificity of the putative mouse anti-ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 antibodies was first assessed by ELISA. An irrelevant antigen with the same Fc tag as recombinant ferret CXCR5 or PD-1 proteins was used as a control. Anti-ferret CXCR5 clone A09 (feX5-A09), B04 (feX5-B04), C05 (feX5-C05) and E04 (feX5-E04) showed high binding activity with ferret CXCR5 proteins with an EC50 of 0.0109 μg/ml, 0.0036 μg/ml, 0.0027 μg/ml, 0.0033 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 3a) . Anti-ferret PD-1 clone CL1 (fePD-CL1) similarly displayed high binding activity with ferret PD-1 proteins with an EC50 of 0.0052 μg/ml while clone CL2 (fePD-CL2) showed no binding activity with ferret PD-1 proteins by ELISA (Fig. 3b) . All antibodies showed no binding with control proteins, demonstrating that the antibodies were not targeted against Fc tag region of the recombinant proteins.The ability of mAb feX5-C05 (anti-CXCR5) and fePD-CL1 (anti-PD1) to stain ferret lymphocytes was examined using flow cytometry. Single cell suspensions from the LN of influenza infected ferrets were stained with a panel consisting of anti-BCL6, CD4 and CD79a antibodies and anti-CXCR5 (feX5-C05) and anti-PD1 (fePD-CL1) conjugated to biotin and PE, respectively (gating in Fig. 4a ). CXCR5++ PD-1++ CD4 T cells display elevated expression of BCL6 relative to non-Tfh cells (CD4+ CXCR5− PD−1−), consistent with a Tfh cell identity (Fig. 4b) . Furthermore, the CXCR5 and PD-1 expression pattern of ferret CD4 T cells is similar to that of mouse and macaque CD4 T cells (Fig. 4c ). In addition to CD4 T cells, CXCR5 is highly expressed by mouse and macaque B cells (Fig. 4d) . Consistent with mouse and macaque data, we found that ferret CD79a+ B cells were also predominately CXCR5+ (Fig. 4d) . Taken together, these data show that ferret Tfh cells are detected by our in-house developed anti-ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 antibodies or combination with a commercial cross-reactive anti-BCL6 antibody. Ferrets are a useful animal model for studying the pathogenicity and transmissibility of several human viruses and for pre-clinical evaluation of the in vivo protective efficacy of vaccines. The help signal provided by Tfh cells is a critical factor which determines the magnitude and quality of antibody responses 20 . Identification of Tfh cells in ferrets could greatly assist providing an immunological rationale for the design of novel vaccines against the infection of influenza and other viruses, including SARS-CoV2. However, key immunological reagents, such as ferret reactive Tfh marker monoclonal antibodies, were lacking until this report.In the present study, we developed ferret-specific CXCR5 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies and identified Tfh cells in ferrets. Identification of Tfh cells by surface CXCR5 and PD-1 staining is of great utility if live Tfh cell staining is needed (such as for antigen induced activation or RNA studies) since intranuclear BCL6 staining involves cell fixation and permeabilization. In addition, CXCR5 could be a surrogate surface B cell marker if intracellular staining is not warranted or wanted since the currently available marker for ferret B cells (a commercial cross-reactive CD79a antibody) requires intracellular staining. Furthermore, anti-ferret PD-1 antibody can be useful for studies of non-TFH T cell activation or exhaustion in this animal model (as demonstrated in Fig. 4) , thereby increasing the complexity and detail of immunophenotype studies.Ferret Tfh responses remain largely unexplored, and basic questions, such as what the magnitude and quality of ferret Tfh responses are in the context of virus infection or vaccination, and how Tfh responses correlate with antibody responses following vaccination, remain to be answered. With these ferret-specific CXCR5 and PD-1 antibodies, these questions can be investigated, including longitudinal tracking of Tfh activity following virus infection. Results from ferret Tfh response studies can provide useful insights regarding how Tfh cells influence In summary, we developed ferret-specific CXCR5 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies which were next used for detection of ferret Tfh cells. As these reagents identify surface-expressed antigens, they are compatible with live cell sorting and downstream RNA sequencing analysis, which can be challenging with antibodies requiring cell permeabilization and intracellular staining. The sequences of the heavy and light chain variable domains of anti-ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 antibodies are provided (Fig. 5) so that the field can use these reagents to advance the study of ferret Tfh. Recombinant antibodies can be expressed in a short time frame by transiently transfection of mammalian Expi293 cells. These ferret specific CXCR5 and PD-1 antibodies provide a starting point to allow in-depth study of the Tfh responses to viral infections, such as influenza and SARS-CoV2. Further reagents (such as anti-ferret CD154 monoclonal antibody) that are in critical need to identify antigen-specific Tfh are under development and will be made publicly available in the future. As a comparator for pan-species expression of CXCR5 on T and B cell population, we assessed macaque Tfh and B cell phenotypes from lymph node samples. The macaque samples used in this were obtained from a macaque influenza vaccination trial and were processed as described previously 21 .Sequence analysis and recombinant protein generation. The nucleic acid sequences of ferret, human and mouse BCL6, CXCR5 and PD-1 were extracted from Ensembl website 22 and Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Amino acid homology of ferret, human and mouse BCL6, CXCR5 and PD-1 were compared using Geneious.The ectodomain of ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 were identified using the NGS dataset (Wong et al. manuscript submitted). The gene sequence of ectodomains of ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 were codon-optimized and synthesized (GeneArt) and cloned into mammalian expression vector containing human IgG1 Fc tag. Plasmids were extracted using NucleoBond Xtra Midi Plus plasmid DNA kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL). Recombinant ferret CXCR5 and PD-1 proteins were expressed by transient transfection of Expi293 (Thermo) suspension cultures with 2.7 μl ExpiFectamine (Thermo) and 1ug DNA/ml cell culture. At day 5 post-transfection, proteins in culture supernatant were purified by protein A agarose affinity chromatography and gel filtration. RT-PCR. The BCR sequences of sorted ferret CXCR5 or PD-1 specific B cells were recovered as previously described 19 . Briefly, the mRNA of sorted single B cells was reversely transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo) and random hexamer primers (Bioline). The sequences of heavy and light chain variable domains were then amplified by nested PCR using HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and mouse immunoglobulin heavy and light chain primers 19 . PCR products were sequenced in Macrogen.Antibody generation. The gene of heavy or kappa chain variable domain was synthesized (GeneArt) and cloned into mammalian expression vector containing mouse IgG1 or kappa chain constant domain. Heavy and kappa chain plasmids were extracted using NucleoBond Xtra Midi Plus plasmid DNA kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL). Antibodies were expressed by transient transfection of Expi293 (Thermo) suspension cultures with 2.7 μl ExpiFectamine (Thermo) and 1ug DNA (heavy: kappa = 1:1)/ml cell culture. At day 5 post-transfection, antibodies in culture supernatant were purified by protein G agarose affinity chromatography. For flow cytometric application, antibodies were conjugated to biotin or PE using biotin or PE conjugation kit (Abcam). .

1a34d096b1ce9fd947e09345b32daabc3c7eac9a,Deficient hand washing facilities in public toilets in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in one high-income country,"The COVID-19 pandemic has focused international attention on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to reduce pandemic spread prior to vaccination roll-out. Such NPIs include hygiene practices such as appropriate hand washing, which is an evidence-based measure for preventing respiratory virus transmission. 1 More specifically, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance on COVID-19 and hygiene/sanitation. 2 This guidance highlights the importance of hand washing facilities (with water and soap) and of having separate toilets ""for people with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection."" Also ""the toilet should be flushed with the lid down to prevent droplet splatter and aerosol clouds."" The latter recommendation is supported by data from a COVID-19 quarantine room study which found that ""the inner walls of toilet bowl and sewer inlet were the most contaminated sites with the highest viral loads."" 3 Another such study reported that ""there was extensive environmental contamination by 1 SARS-CoV-2 patient"" with toilet bowl and sink samples being positive for viral RNA. 4 There has also been one study indicating circumstantial evidence of fecal aerosol transmission of COVID-19 via an apartment drainage system, 5 similar to an outbreak from fecal aerosols of SARS-CoV-1 in 2003. 6 While improving hygiene in a pandemic is highly desirable, it is also beneficially for reducing the spread of other respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza and norovirus infection. For example, one review identified six studies that implicated bathroom surfaces as primary sources of human norovirus infection. 7 In our case study country, New Zealand, there was community spread of the pandemic virus (SARS-CoV-2) on a number of occasions during the 2020 year, but elimination was successfully achieved and re-achieved after a series of border control failures. 8 9 This success arose largely from a combination of tight border controls (quarantine and isolation), a strict lockdown and widespread testing/contact tracing. Actions related to hygiene included:• Mass media messages relating to hand washing, cough etiquette, staying home when sick, and mask use. • Actions by organisations to install hand sanitisers and posters with hygiene messaging in workplaces and various public places. • Public toilets were all closed at the highest lockdown level.• Actions by some local government agencies to increase soap availability in the public toilets they maintain (eg, by Napier City Council 10 ) and to include posters with hygiene messaging in these facilities.Given the latter point, the aim of this study was to identify the provision of water and soap for hand washing (along with related health messaging) in New Zealand public toilets at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to make comparisons with a pre-pandemic survey 11 that included a sample of the same facilities.By way of context, New Zealand is a high-income country, but one where there has been reported shortages of public toilets, especially in areas with high numbers of international tourists. 12 13 Previous research has also shown deficiencies with public toilets in the country, in terms of lacking hand washing water (4%) and lacking soap (39%). 11 14 Another study of toilets in one New Zealand city (mainly at cafés and public facilities), found that some had no handwashing facilities (2%) and no soap (13%). 15 Within this sample, the lack of soap was highest in the public toilets at 38%. Another New Zealand study of primary school toilets also reported that only 28% had facilities meeting the relevant code of practice ie, there was a lack of hot water, lack of drying facilities and lack of soap. 16 Inadequate hand hygiene has also been recorded, with public toilet users in New Zealand sometimes not washing hands (13%) or using soap (28%). 17The sample frame was comprehensive for the public toilets in three contiguous cities with a combined population of 389,000, with additional convenience sampling in cities and rural areas, based on author travel plans for other reasons around New Zealand from 18 July 2020 to 2 January 2021. We expanded the sample to a total of 400 toilets, which we estimated would be at least 10% of the facilities nationwide. But we also aimed to replicate a previous survey of facilities in public toilets in the lower North Island in 2012/2013. 11 The public toilets were located by:• Online city council maps of public toilets were used for the comprehensive three council area survey. [18] [19] [20] However, data could not be collected on a minority of these (<5%) due to closure for repairs and/or being padlocked shut, suggestive that they were only opened for specific sporting events. • Using 'Google Maps' to locate a 'city/town/district', and then in the map searching for 'public toilets'. • Using the smartphone app version of 'CamperMate'. 21 • Roadside public toilet signs when travelling by car.We excluded from the sample, public toilets that were not directly open to the outside (ie, which were inside of other buildings such as within shopping complexes; council-owned facilities such as libraries; and within railway or ferry buildings, some of which were signed as for ""patrons only""). Where facilities were closed or were being cleaned, we attempted repeat visits where this was convenient.Data collection: At each toilet facility, we surveyed all the men's and unisex toilets. Toilet facilities contained from one to six self-contained ""toilet units"" with a separate door that opened to the outside -albeit some units of ""men's toilets"" would include multiple hand washing basins, a urinal and multiple toilet bowls. Data were collected on the availability of water and soap for handwashing. Toilets with empty soap containers were counted as without soap. We also photographed all health-related signage (eg, relating to COVID-19 and handwashing). Requirements for touching (or not) of taps/buttons/levers for activating tap water and flushing the toilet were noted. The presence of lids for toilet bowls was documented, given concerns around potential virus dispersion when flushing when the lid is not down (see Introduction).We compared results for the three city council comprehensive sample with the supplementary convenience sample. Comparisons were also made with the exact same facilities involved in the previous survey conducted in 2012/2013 (albeit excluding 14.7% (22/150) which were not readily accessible or which had subsequently been closed down). Statistical analysis used OpenEpi (v 3.01) and Mid-P exact values were calculated (2-tailed).To provide context for our survey, we estimated the total number of such public toilet facilities in New Zealand using the following steps:• We then extrapolated the three city council results to the other 12 LAs in New Zealand which were city ones; and the Wairarapa results to the other 51 LAs which were council districts.Survey results for 2020/21: Our survey comprised 400 toilet units at 242 toilet facilities. We estimated that nationwide the total number of such toilet facilities was around 985 in city councils and around 760 in district councils, ie, around 1864 in the whole country (3.7 per 10,000 population). So our sample was estimated at 13.0% of the estimated total (242/1864), which was greater than our target of a 10% sample.Most of the sample of 400 toilet units were from the comprehensive survey of three contiguous city councils (n = 228), relative to the additional convenience sample (n = 172). The former grouping was all in the lower North Island, were more likely to be unisex (vs men's toilets), and involved more toilets in cities (but fewer in towns and rural areas) ( Table 1) .The proportion of all the 400 toilets without water for hand washing was 2.5%, with this being higher in the convenience sample than the three urban councils sample (5.2% vs 0.4%; risk ratio (RR) = 11.9; 95%CI = 1.53 to 93.3; p = 0.0030). Absence of soap was 14.8% overall, and this was also higher in the convenience sample vs the three councils sample (21.5% vs 9.6%; RR = 2.23; 95%CI = 1.37 to 3.64; p = 0.0011). Most soap was dispensed as a liquid or foam ( Figure  S1 -3), but at 6.0% of toilets it was available in a cake/bar form. A number of toilets had containers for liquid soap, but they were empty (Table 1 ).In terms of ""no touch"" activation, this was available for hand washing water at 28.0%, for toilet bowl flushing at 18.5%, and for urinal flushing at 80.5%. Toilet bowl lids were not present for 32.8% (many were designed or built this way) ( Figure There was no signage that promoted toilet lid lowering prior to flushing.This survey found a deficient provision of soap (14.8% of toilet units with none), and to a lesser extent water (2.5% with none). These findings suggest that while there has been some statistically significant improvement in soap provision (but not water provision) in the eight year period since the previous survey, the attempts by some local government agencies to increase soap provision at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic 10 needs to be further augmented.The higher water (5.2% vs 0.4%) and soap provision (21.5% vs 9.6%) in the comprehensive three urban council sample vs the convenience sample respectively, is likely to reflect the more modern facilities in the former and/or a higher quality maintenance schedule. As New Zealand is highly urbanised, we suspect that the true nationwide results would be closer to those of the three council survey than the convenience sample ones.The relatively low level of health related signage was a problematic finding, especially the COVID-19 related health messaging (at 19.5%), the COVID-19 QR code (12.3%), and generic hand washing signage (1.8%). These deficits are likely to represent both long-term lack of signage relating to hand washing, as well as an inadequate response to the COVID-19 threat.Also of note from a hygiene perspective was the limited extent of ""no touch"" activation of devices (ie, for hand washing water at 28.0% and for toilet bowl flushing at 18.5%). These should ideally be expanded with the potential long-term goal being to have maximally ""no touch"" facilities (including automated: door opening and locking via hand waving in front of a sensor, water dispensing, soap dispensing, toilet flushing and hand drier activation). Automation could extend to the toilet bowl lid being closed before flushing.This is the largest such survey to date in New Zealand that we know of, and it was able to compare a sub-sample of the same facilities after an eight year period. It was also conducted at a time where there was greatly heightened need for hygiene due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Nevertheless, the study was limited by only being comprehensive in three contiguous council areas, with the rest being convenience sampling. This was owing to this being an unfunded study with no budget for travel. The convenience sampling is likely to have involved surveying facilities that were more accessible to the researchers by being on main roads. These may be relatively newer and have a better maintenance schedule than facilities in small rural towns. This may have resulted in some under-estimation from the convenience sample of the extent of the problems outside urban areas (eg, with water and soap availability).A fundamental research issue is to better quantify the risks of infectious disease transmission associated with use of public toilets (eg, from any aerosolisation of faeces and from touching contaminated surfaces). This is not only relevant to SARS-CoV-2, but also other infectious diseases (eg, norovirus infection and seasonal influenza).Nevertheless, surveys such as this could be improved upon by making them fully random at the national level and collecting additional data on the facilities to compare them with local standards (eg, as per New Zealand ones, 22 albeit from 1999) or more state-of-the-art Japanese designs. 23 Research on ways to minimise the vandalism of public toilets is also needed, as this has been a reported barrier to soap dispensers in New Zealand in the past. 10 Art work inside toilets and on exterior walls is used in some New Zealand toilets (Figure S1-1) and might be worth expanding if it is found to be effective against vandalism.Policy goals for local government could be to ensure all facilities have water and soap, and to move towards designs that are maximally ""no touch"". Built-in redundancy (eg, two separate soap dispensers) may be desirable to minimise the risk of running out of soap, and cakes of soap should probably be avoided as these are more vulnerable to theft. If fully automated taps are not installed, then tap levers or floor pedals for activating water flow could be an alternative. Levers allow users to use the back of their hands and levers can also be more suited than conventional taps for people with disabilities such as arthritis.Central government could set and enforce minimum standards for council-owned public toilet facilities and the extent of their provision. It could also boost funding support for these purposes, at least partly from border charges collected from international tourists (a funding system already in place in New Zealand). The extent of the funding needed should be seen in the context of the huge costs of COVID-19 and future pandemics, and from other respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza and from norovirus infection.To conclude, despite the serious threat and great costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while there has been some improvement in soap provision in the eight year period since the previous survey, the attempts by some local government agencies to increase such provision need to be further augmented. There are also other design and maintenance deficiencies that would improve hygiene in public toilets. There is a major scope for improving health messaging at these sites, and this might be a low-cost and quick intervention to reduce pandemic spread. ",New Zealand,abstract,2021-01-20,01
6225c0b1fde3867217b7a5fae681e60fe00ab3c8,Converting the maybes: Crucial for a successful COVID-19 vaccination strategy,"Introduction Countries continue to fight devastating first and second waves of COVID-19 infections. Australia has, seemingly, just negotiated a challenging second wave. As communities and governments grapple with reintroducing lockdowns and ongoing economic uncertainty, a COVID-19 vaccine offers the best chance of restoring societal function. The World Health Organisation has identified 48 vaccine candidates currently in clinical evaluation [1] . Scholars of vaccine hesitancy and uptake are advising governments and the scientific community that an effective vaccine is just the beginning. Based on previous experiences with pandemic vaccines and vaccine hesitancy more generally, a well-researched strategy for rollout and acceptance will be necessary in every country.Australia has agreements with four potential suppliers of different COVID-19 vaccines, and has invested in doses for its entire population [2] . Australians are highly supportive of vaccination in general, with recent studies finding that 87% of the population believe vaccines to be safe, effective, and necessary [3] ; only 5.6% of Australians do not believe vaccines are safe [4] . However, most recent pandemic experience-the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, saw low vaccine uptake amongst adults, one study finding that 26% of refusers were concerned about safety and 17% did not believe in the vaccine [5] .Recent studies globally have reported relatively high acceptance rates for a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., around 74%-77% in France [6] , and 67-69% in the United States [7, 8] ). In a comprehensive survey of 19 countries, 72% of participants indicated they were either likely or very likely to take a vaccine, ranging from 89% in China, to 55% in Russia [9] . Concerningly, however, studies conducted in Australia indicate a potential drop in support over time, with one study in April 2020 finding 86% of respondents willing to vaccinate [10] , and a separate study in June finding 75% willing to vaccinate [11] .Importantly, most recent COVID vaccine studies have not examined the undecided (i.e., instead collapsing response scale points into positive and negative categories or using 'indifferent' or 'no opinion' as the mid-point on a yes/no scale). Even those that have collected data on those who are undecided [11] did not treat this group as the subject of analysis. Those who are currently undecided are likely to be substantial in number and crucial to the success of an effective COVID-19 vaccination program both locally and internationally. The present study examined the acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine among a national sample of older Australian adults, with a focus on those who were uncertain about whether or not they would accept a COVID-19 vaccination.The onset of COVID-19 in Australia converged with the onset of influenza season, leading to government authorities and health professionals making strong recommendations for Australians to not delay their seasonal vaccines [12] . Limiting the numbers of influenza cases would protect hospitals' surge capacity, and reduce incidences of misdiagnoses, quarantine, and testing [13] . Take-up was vigorous, as influenza vaccines are nationally funded for at-risk groups, including children, and affordable for others through workplace clinics and community pharmacies, as well as being available through General Practitioners [12] . Our study also explored intentions regarding influenza vaccination in a context of COVID-19 risk and strong government encouragement. We used data from Time 4 (COVID wave) of The Values Project (https://osf.io/w6uen/). At Time 1, in 2017, The Values Project recruited Australian adults to answer a series of short surveys over time, following a cross-sequential sample design; with a target of 500 respondents in each of 14 age categories from 18 to 75 years of age. Thus, the original sample was intentionally drawn to over-represent older Australians. Despite this, the sample was largely reflective of many socio-demographic characteristics in the Australian population [14] . The study was approved by The University of Western Australia Human Ethics Committee (RA/4/1/8647). The present study was administered between May 18th and May 29th, 2020 to 1,869 Values Project panel members. Participants provided informed consent online via a check-box after reading information about the study. Of these 1,316 completed all study questions (see S1 Table for completed versus missing sample descriptives): 60% were female, mean age was 58 (SD = 13.20); 31% were parents with children living at home. At the time of the survey, administered prior to the relaxation of social distancing measures in many states, 13% of respondents reported having a household income above or significantly above the Australian average of $120,200. Most had completed high school (M = 13.70 years of education; SD = 3.43).Intention toward the COVID-19 vaccine was measured with one item: If a COVID-19 vaccine were available today, would you get it? (Yes, Maybe, No). Intention toward the flu injection was measured with one item: Do you intend to have, or have had, a flu injection this year? (Yes, Maybe, No). Disease severity was measured with a 7-item scale [15] . Example items include I believe that COVID-19 is severe and I believe that the COVID-19 threat is significant (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Trust in the scientific community was measured with one item, measured on an 11-point scale (0 = no trust at all to 10 = complete trust), added to a longer scale measuring Political Trust in Authorities and Specific Institutions [16] . COVID-19 as a Hoax was measured with a one item scale: The social media are full of stories telling that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax and that all the lockdown measures are a hysteric overreaction. Do you believe in these stories? (YES, I do believe in these stories; NO, I don't believe in these stories).A multinomial logistical regression was used to predict the three vaccination intention responses for a COVID-19 vaccine: yes, maybe, and no. Average marginal effects were estimated, that is the change in probability of each response, for each variable with robust standard errors. In addition, relative risk ratios for each pairing of responses (e.g. maybe vs no), with their 95% confidence interval, were estimated to facilitate comparisons. Regressions were estimated in Stata v16 using the mlogit function. The multinomial logit assumes independence of irrelevant alternatives, which was evaluated, and not rejected, using the mlogtest program. Related, a likelihood ratio test of whether any response categories could be combined (e.g. no with maybe) was rejected [17] .We found that 65% respondents were willing and 27% were undecided about whether to get a COVID-19 vaccine if one becomes available (Fig 1) . In contrast, intentions regarding influenza vaccination were much more polarized, with fewer people being undecided. We found 69% percent of our respondents having received or intending to have a flu vaccine this year, 21% saying no, and only 10% maybe.Respondents were more likely (RRR>1) to be in the COVID-19 vaccine 'maybe' than 'yes' group, if they (a) perceived COVID-19 to be less severe (RRR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.25 to 1.91), (b) had less trust in science (RRR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.51), (c) were less willing to have a flu vaccine (RRR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.81 to 2.55), and (d) were female (RRR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.64). Compared to the 'no' group, respondents were more likely to be in the 'maybe' group, if they did not perceive COVID-19 to be a hoax (RRR = 7.70, 95% CI: 3.02 to 19.6). Respondents were less likely (RRR < 1) to be in the 'maybe' group relative to the 'no' group if they (a) did not perceive COVID-19 to be severe (RRR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.91), (d) did not have trust in science (RRR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.97), and (c) were not willing to have the flu vaccine (RRR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.65). There were no gender differences between the 'maybe' and 'no' groups (Table 1 ).Our study is one of a small but growing number of papers examining COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Australia, in the lead up to a vaccine becoming available [10, 11] . However, we are the only paper to date showing that the 'maybe' group differs significantly from those willing or unwilling to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Our study had a lower number of 'yes' responses than other studies, however it is difficult to compare this number with existing studies, as they employed different methodologies (e.g., collapsing a 4-point agreement scale into two groups [10] , or using 'neutral/no opinion' as a mid-point rather than 'maybe' [9] ) and sampled different target populations (e.g., focus on parents, most of whom were younger than our sample [11] ).Our finding that over a quarter (27%) of the sample were undecided about a COVID-19 vaccine suggests that this group will be important to the effective nationwide rollout of the vaccine. Even with high vaccine efficacy [18, 19] , high coverage will be required to suppress and eliminate community COVID-19 activity.One argument for the high proportion of people who remain undecided is that Australia, at the time of the study, had only been mildly affected by COVID-19 by world standards. However, by mid-March, cases were doubling every three days or so, and Australia's trajectory was being compared to that of the USA, UK, and Italy. Borders and businesses were closing, and governments strictly enforced social distancing, including stay at home orders. Exposure to COVID-19 news was extensive and for many overwhelming [20] , and remained so in the lead up to the current survey.A more compelling argument for the large number of undecideds relates to the tremendous uncertainty about a potential COVID-19 vaccine, including effectiveness, side effects and availability. Uncertainty, combined with the speed of development of a range of potential vaccines, means that knowledge about existing vaccination programs is unlikely to be transferable to COVID-19. This is evident in the fact that our respondents were much clearer about whether they would, or would not, receive an influenza vaccine, with only 10% being undecided. The influenza vaccine is well established and has far less uncertainty factors than COVID-19 vaccination, meaning that individuals are more likely to stay fixed on positions that they have previously developed regarding receipt of influenza vaccines, whether positive or negative. This likely explains why the 'no' group for influenza vaccine was much larger than the 'no' group for a COVID-19 vaccine, despite Australia experiencing high demand for flu vaccine in 2020. These findings highlight that flu vaccine attitudes and behaviours do not directly translate to COVID-19 vaccine intentions, and hence the need for continuing qualitative and quantitative studies to track attitudes to a new pathogen in uncertain times. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance research is being conducted in wildly fluctuating contexts, with the virus and policy responses driving dramatic social and economic changes on a continual basis around the world. Since our study in May 2020, the state of Victoria has undergone a gruelling second lockdown, other states such as Western Australia have enjoyed a return to almost-normal life within a hard state border, while after a period of normality South Australia lurched back into lockdown. More recently, states are now reopening borders to each other. Given these divergent experiences, even within the same country, future research should explore their impact on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, including whether people are more or less certain about accepting the vaccine in scenarios where the virus is out of control.On the back of announcements regarding multiple vaccines showing both safety and effectiveness in clinical trials [18, 19] , and governments touting imminent rollout and introducing vaccines under special permits overseas, we might expect the 'maybes' to decrease in number due to greater certainty. However, we did not find this when we asked a subset of 636 participants the same COVID-19 vaccine uptake question on 18-23 November 2020. We found 56% said yes, 31% maybe and 13% no, demonstrating remarkable similarity (in fact, a slight increase) in the proportion of 'maybes'. This finding comes despite numerous changes regarding available vaccine information, including greater certainty about manufacturers, likely rollout times, and the Australian Government indicating its priority groups to receive the vaccine [21] .Given all of the above, understanding the correlates of the likelihood of acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine is of crucial importance, particularly due to the large size of the 'maybe' group. Our study indicated that belief in disease severity and trust in science are important factors that differ between those who are on the fence and those who would (and would not) accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Greater levels of uncertainty amongst women indicates that messaging oriented towards female audiences should be investigated further; Detoc and colleagues in France found men were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine than women [6] , and Goldman et al found that fathers were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for their children than mothers in a study conducted in the US, Canada, Israel, Japan, Spain and Switzerland [22] . This gender divide is likely to matter, then, not just for accepting vaccines for oneself, but also for one's children.Additional research, including qualitative studies, is needed to uncover the beliefs and sentiments of COVID-19 vaccine fence-sitters, as well as the specific kinds of public communication strategies that can convert them to accept the vaccine. A homogenous approach, or one that draws lessons from previous pandemics, will not be sufficient-we need to understand people's uncertainty around vaccinating against this current pathogen at this current moment. Researchers need to proactively engage with vaccine program developers and governments to seed the understandings gleaned from such studies into policy and programs. Governments, likewise, need to invest in appropriate programs of social research that segment populations into sub-groups and interrogate the values and beliefs that underpin hesitancy and uncertainty.Our study has shown that a significant number of people remain undecided about whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine, despite the ongoing devastating consequences of the virus for individuals, communities, and economies. This is alarming, given that many governments around the world are formulating policy on the basis that a vaccine for COVID-19 will solve the current crisis. Further research is urgently needed regarding the attitudes, beliefs, and potential mind-changing factors for those who remain undecided about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine.Supporting information S1 ",Australia,first author,2021-01-20,01

To identify target genes with highly conserved regions and a suitable GC-content for MCDA, 1216 SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID (all available complete, high coverage genomes (> 29,000 bp) with low coverage flags excluded up until March 26, 2020) 6 were aligned against the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome: NC_045512.2 using Snippy (v4.3.6) with the -ctgs flag and default settings (https ://githu b.com/tseem ann/snipp y). A sliding window approach was then applied to identify conserved 300 bp windows with GC content > 43%, low SNP number, and low total SNP number (total SNPs was defined as the number of strains with a SNP in a given window). Three 300 bp conserved regions were identified and selected for MCDA primer design with two regions in ORF1ab (NC_045512.2: 515-831 and 12,968-13,288) and one in the N gene (NC_045512.2: 28,345-28,647).For each region, 4 sets of MCDA primers were designed as previously described 5 .Each primer set consisted of 2 cross-primers (CP1/CP2), 2 displacement primers (F1/F2) and 6 amplification primers (C1/C2, D1/D2, R1/R2) (Supplementary Table 1 ). Non-specific primer binding was assessed using BLASTN against 14 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses used in Lamb et al. 7 , human genome (hg19) and 11 other common bacterial and viral respiratory pathogen/microbiome species.Preparation of DNA/RNA standards. For Table 2 ). Each fragment contained a T7 promoter for transcription and M13 adapters for amplification. Seven DNA standards from synthesised gene fragments were prepared for ORF1ab (100,000, 10,000, 5000, 1000, 500, 250 and 100 copies/µl) while eight DNA standards were prepared for the N gene (100,000, 10,000, 5000, 1000, 500, 250, 100 and 10 copies/µl). For RNA, 1 pg of synthesised gene fragments were transcribed overnight at 37 °C using T7 RNA polymerase (Sigma). Overnight DNA digestion was performed using the turbo DNA free kit (ThermoFisher) and further treated with DNase I (NEB) until all traces of DNA were removed. Complete DNA removal was confirmed after each round of DNase treatment using rt-PCR with the SensiFAST SYBR kit (Bioline) and F1/R1 MCDA primers (Supplementary Table 1 ). The transcribed RNA was serially diluted and used as input. Since the amount of RNA transcribed was below the 250 pg/µl limit of detection for Qubit HS RNA assay (ThermoFisher), the input RNA copy number could not be determined. Therefore, the lowest detectable dilutions were used for sensitivity comparison.Initial evaluation of MCDA primer sets and optimisation of isothermal amplification temperature. MCDA reactions were performed using the WarmStart LAMP (DNA and RNA) kit (NEB) which contains a warmstart RTx reverse transcriptase and Bst2.0 polymerase for simultaneous reverse transcription and isothermal amplification. Antarctic thermolabile UDG was also added in each reaction to prevent carryover contamination.For each primer set, a primer mix containing: 3.3 μM of F1 and F2, 6.67 μM of C1 and C2, 10 μM of R1, R2, D1 and D2 and 20 μM of CP1 and CP2 was used. Standard desalting purified primers were used for the initial evaluation and optimisation tests while HPLC purified primers were used for sensitivity and speed comparison against LAMP and rt-PCR tests.For the initial evaluation of each MCDA primer set, a 10 µl reaction was used and contained: 5 µl of 2 × Warm-Start master mix, 0.2 µl of 50 × fluorescent dye, 1.2 µl of MCDA primer mix, 0.2 µl of 1U/µl Antarctic thermolabile UDG (NEB), 0.7 µl of 10 mM dUTP, 1.7 µl of H 2 O and 1 µl of 1000 copy/µl DNA template (final reaction concentration = 100 DNA copies/µl). The final concentration of each MCDA primer in the reaction was 0.4 μM of F1 and F2, 0.8 μM of C1 and C2, 1.2 μM of R1, R2, D1 and D2 and 2.4 μM of CP1 and CP2. Specificity of MCDA primer sets were also evaluated using purified human genomic DNA (Sigma) and a microbial community DNA standard (Zymo Research). MCDA reactions were performed in triplicates in the Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) with isothermal amplification at either 60 °C, 63 °C or 65 °C for 1 h and real time fluorescence detection every 60 s, followed by enzyme inactivation at 95 °C for 5 min and a final melt curve from 50 °C -99 °C to ensure correct MCDA product. Table 1 ). For LAMP, two published primer sets from Zhang et al. 3 which targeted the same region as our MCDA were compared. For rt-PCR, there were no suitable published primer pairs which targeted the same ORF1ab region, therefore only primers submitted by the National Institute of Health, Thailand against the N gene was compared 8 . All primers were HPLC-purified grade.MCDA, LAMP and rt-PCR were tested in three independent runs (biological replicates) using the same aliquot of DNA/RNA. Each run contained 3 technical replicates. The limit of detection was defined as the highest dilution where all 9 replicates (3 biological replicates × 3 technical replicates) were detected.To reduce between run variations, 10 µl MCDA and LAMP reactions were set up and performed simultaneously in the same run. MCDA reactions were prepared as described above. For LAMP, each 10 µl reaction contained: 5 µl 2 × WarmStart master mix (NEB), 0. For rt-PCR using DNA templates, 10 µl reactions containing 5 µl SensiFAST probe No-ROX mix (Bioline), 0.5 µl rt-PCR primer mix (40 µM F and R, 10 µM probe), 3.5 µl of H 2 O and 1 µl DNA template were used. The final concentration of each rt-PCR primer and probe in the reaction was 2 µM F and R and 0.5 µM probe. The cycling conditions were 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 secs and 55 °C for 30 secs.For rt-PCR with RNA templates, 10 µl reactions were set up containing 5 µl SensiFAST probe No-ROX One-Step mix (Bioline), 0.5 µl primer mix (40 µM F and R, 10 µM probe), 0.1 µl reverse transcriptase (Bioline), 3.4 µl of H 2 O and 1 µl RNA template. Reverse transcription was performed at 45 °C for 20 min followed by rt-PCR amplification as described above for DNA.To compare the speed of rt-PCR, cycle threshold (Ct) was converted to time using the following equation: Time = (Ct × 50 s) + 120 s. The detection time required for rt-PCR was calculated based on the cycling conditions (45 s per cycle plus an initial 120 s hold) and the ramp rate for the Rotor-gene Q (5 s per cycle). The ramp rate for the Rotor gene Q is 15 °C/s for heating and 20 °C/s for cooling according to the manufacture's technical information (https ://www.qiage n.com/us/resou rces/downl oad.aspx?id=2120a f5e-8daf-4184-b277-aeb6e f5bbc 05&lang=it-IT).Development of MCDA assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Three 300 bp conserved regions suitable for MCDA primer design were identified from the genome alignment of 1216 SARS-CoV-2 strains. Two regions, designated as region 1 and 2, belonged to the ORF1ab gene at NC_045512.2 position 515-831 and 12,968-13,288 respectively. One region, designated as region 3, corresponded to the N-gene at NC_045512.2 position 28,345-28,647. Four MCDA primer sets for each region were designed and evaluated (Supplementary Table 1) .Each MCDA primer set was initially tested at 3 isothermal amplification temperatures (60 °C, 63 °C and 65 °C) using 1000 DNA copies/reaction as the starting template. As seen in Fig. 1 , regardless of the primer sets used, the slowest amplification time was observed at 60 °C. Amplification at 63 °C and 65 °C were similar and 65 °C was chosen as the isothermal amplification temperature used.To maintain MCDA assay robustness against SNPs which may affect MCDA primer binding and amplification efficiency, primer sets from two different regions were chosen for further development as a duplex assay. Primer sets in region 2 also had very high variation between technical replicates (data not shown). Therefore region 2 was removed from further evaluation. Region 3 amplification of the N gene was the fastest with primer set 2 followed closely by primer set 3 ( Fig. 1G-I) . Primer set 1 and 4 were the slowest for region 3 and were therefore eliminated from further testing. We also observed that primer set 2 had tighter technical replicates compared to primer set 3 (data not shown), thus region 3 primer set 2 was chosen as our final MCDA primer set for further sensitivity and specificity testing.Within region 1, primer set 3 was the slowest with fluorescence appearing at ~ 35 min (Fig. 1C ). This primer set was removed from further consideration. Primer set 1 was the fastest primers to amplify region 1 and was chosen for inclusion in our MCDA assay. Therefore, the final primer sets chosen for MCDA SARS-CoV-2 detection was region 1 (ORF1ab) primer set 1 and region 3 (N gene) primer set 2 (Fig. 2) . Both primer sets showed no non-specific amplification when tested against human and microbial community genomic DNA.speed for MCDA, LAMP and rt-PCR were then compared for two SARS-CoV-2 genes. For the N gene (region 3), detection by MCDA was consistently faster than LAMP, by ~ 10-13 min, for most DNA dilutions tested ( Table 1 ). The average fastest detection time for MCDA was 5.2 min at 10,000 copies/µl while for LAMP it was 15 min. MCDA also had higher sensitivity with the limit of detection at 100 copies/µl while for LAMP it was 500 copies/ µl. This limit of detection was equivalent to an rt-PCR Ct value of 32.4 and 30.3, respectively. A greater number of sporadic detections for higher dilutions were also observed for MCDA compared to LAMP. MCDA was also significantly faster than rt-PCR by ~ 20 min for lower dilutions and 10 min for higher dilutions. At 10,000 copies/µl , the detection time for rt-PCR was 23 min. However, rt-PCR had the highest sensitivity with the limit of detection at 10 copies/µl and sporadic amplification at 1 copy/µl. Similar results were also observed using RNA template with rt-PCR being the most sensitive technique, detecting RNA at 10 -6 dilution. For MCDA, the lowest RNA dilution detected was 10 -4 , with only sporadic detection for LAMP at this dilution.For ORF1ab, LAMP was more sensitive than MCDA with the limit of detection at 50 copies/µl and had more sporadic detection at higher dilutions ( Table 2 ). The limit of detection for MCDA was 500 copies/µl . LAMP was also slightly faster than MCDA by ~ 1-3 min for concentrations above the limit of detection. The fastest time to detection for ORF1ab LAMP was 8.4 min while for MCDA it was 9.7 min. www.nature.com/scientificreports/Our results showed that MCDA is the fastest nucleic acid amplification method tested for SARS-CoV-2 detection with detection of the N gene as fast as 5 min. However, this was contingent on the gene targeted and the primer design with the NEB designed LAMP assay for ORF1ab 3 showing similar speed to our equivalent MCDA ORF1ab assay. rt-PCR remains the most sensitive nucleic acid amplification method for SARS-CoV-2 detection compared to MCDA and LAMP. This result is in agreement with previous LAMP SARS-CoV-2 assays which showed rt-PCR having greater sensitivity 9,10 . The limit of detection for our MCDA N gene assay was 100 copies/µl or an equivalent N gene average Ct value of 32.4 ( Table 1 ). The median rt-PCR Ct value in 324 clinical COVID-19 samples from a range disease severity was found to be 31.15 in Singanayagam et al. 11 while in Passomsub et al. 12 the median N gene Ct value in saliva samples and nasopharyngeal/throat samples were 31.8 and 30.5, respectively. This suggests that our MCDA assay has the potential to detect SARS-CoV-2 but with lower sensitivity and consistent with our comparison using synthetic templates. Furthermore, Lamb et al. 7 developed a COVID-19 LAMP assay with a limit of detection of 0.08 fg or an equivalent rt-PCR Ct value of 30.3 and were able to validate their LAMP assay in 19/20 positive clinical COVID samples. Our MCDA assay has increased sensitivity and speed compared to LAMP, suggesting that MCDA has the potential for similar applications as LAMP with better sensitivity and speed.For MCDA, this is the first study to directly benchmark the speed and sensitivity of MCDA to rt-PCR against the same targets. Previous MCDA studies only compared gel-based PCR 4 , different rt-PCR gene targets 13, 14 or used rt-PCR sensitivity results previously reported in other studies 4,5 (as 100 copies in different studies may not be equivalent due to pipetting differences, differences in the method used to measure nucleic acid concentration (Nanodrop vs Qubit) or differences in machine calibration, etc.). In order to benchmark different nucleic acid techniques, we used and recommend the same reaction volume, same machine, same DNA standards and aliquots, and where possible the same run is used for comparison.This study found that different nucleic acid amplification methods offer different advantages and this should be considered depending on the application. rt-PCR was the most sensitive method tested and should remain the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the portable nature and speed of MCDA makes it suitable for settings where rt-PCR would be too slow. Although the fastest time to detection for MCDA is ~ 5 min, MCDA amplification should be performed for at least 20 min to ensure reliable results for negative samples while for rt-PCR, the current amplification time, not including reverse transcription, is 30-40 min. Additionally, reverse transcription and amplification for MCDA and LAMP can occur simultaneously. This removes the need to sequentially perform an initial 20 min reverse transcription step prior to amplification as required for rt-PCR, making MCDA even faster. Therefore, it is estimated that the total time saved using MCDA compared to rt-PCR is 30-40 min. An additional advantage of MCDA is that it uses the same Bst polymerase and reverse www.nature.com/scientificreports/ transcriptase as LAMP, which are more resistant to inhibitors than rt-PCR Taq polymerases 15 . LAMP has been shown to amplify SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracted using simple extraction procedures such as boiling [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, it is anticipated that MCDA can also be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracted using these same procedures. MCDA (and other isothermal amplification methods) is less sensitive than rt-PCR, making it less attractive to develop it further as a clinical diagnostic test. However, there may be situations where these methods will be useful such as rapid screening of samples with high viral RNA content. The addition of a colorimetric dye instead of a fluorescent dye can further simplify MCDA for rapid screening. Further studies in a variety of settings will be required to determine where MCDA and other isothermal nucleic acid methods can offer an advantage in certain settings where rapid test turnaround time or test simplicity is paramount.All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article (and its Supplementary  Information files) .Received: 4 October 2020; Accepted: 5 January 2021",Australia,first author,2021-01-21,01
b4d9ae5f1c71e414867472be7c5793acd326740d,Effects of social distancing on the spreading of COVID-19 inferred from mobile phone data,"Effects of social distancing on the spreading of COVID-19 inferred from mobile phone data Hamid Khataee 1 , Istvan Scheuring 2,3 , Andras Czirok 4,5 & Zoltan Neufeld 1* A better understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic responds to social distancing efforts is required for the control of future outbreaks and to calibrate partial lock-downs. We present quantitative relationships between key parameters characterizing the COVID-19 epidemiology and social distancing efforts of nine selected European countries. Epidemiological parameters were extracted from the number of daily deaths data, while mitigation efforts are estimated from mobile phone tracking data. The decrease of the basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) as well as the duration of the initial exponential expansion phase of the epidemic strongly correlates with the magnitude of mobility reduction. Utilizing these relationships we decipher the relative impact of the timing and the extent of social distancing on the total death burden of the pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic started in late 2019 and within a few months it spread around the World infecting 9 million people, out of which half a million succumbed to the disease. As of June 2020, the transmission of the disease is still progressing in many countries, especially in the American continent. While there have been big regional differences in the extent of the pandemic, in most countries of Europe and Asia the initial exponential growth has gradually transitioned into a decaying phase 8 . An epidemic outbreak can recede either due to reduction of the transmission probability across contacts, or due to a gradual build up of immunity within the population. According to currently available immunological data 1,2 at most locations only a relatively small fraction of the population was infected, typically well below 10%, thus the receding disease mostly reflects changes in social behavior and the associated reduction in disease transmission. Changes in social behavior can include state-mandated control measures as well as voluntary reduction of social interactions. However, especially with the view of potential future outbreaks, it is important to better understand how the timing and extent of social distancing impacted the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.Previous studies estimated the effect of social distancing on the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic either by direct data analysis or by modeling methods 7, [15] [16] [17] . A statistical analysis of the number of diagnosed cases, deaths and patients in intensive care units (ICU) in Italy and Spain have indicated that the epidemic started to decrease only after the introduction of strict lock-down action 3 . This was especially visible in Italy, where the final strict social distancing has been reached in a number of consecutive steps. A statistically more comprehensive analysis of hospitalized and ICU patients in France identified a 77% decrease in the growth rate of these numbers after the introduction of the lock-down 4 . The comparison of social distancing efforts in China, South Korea, Italy, France, Iran and USA 5 revealed that the initial doubling time of identified cases was about 2 days which was prolonged substantially by the various restrictions introduced in these countries. Epidemic models are widely used to estimate how various intervention strategies affect the transmission rate, however, the quantitative relationship between social interventions and epidemic parameters are hardly known 6, 7 .In this paper, we quantitatively characterise the time course of the COVID-19 pandemic using daily death data from nine selected European countries 8 . Statistical data on COVID-19-related deaths are considered to be more robust than that of daily cases of new infections. The latter is affected by the number of tests performed as well as by the testing strategy -e.g. its restriction to symptomatic patients -which may be highly variable across countries and often changes during the course of the epidemic. The time course of daily deaths can be considered www.nature.com/scientificreports/ as a more reliable indirect delayed indicator of daily infections. We thus do not address apparent differences in the case fatality ratio, and restrict our focus to the recorded COVID-19-associated death toll. Our choice of countries was motivated by the requirements that each of these countries (i) had a relatively large disease-associated death toll (i.e. typically above 10/day and more than 2000 overall) so we can assume that the deterministic component of the epidemic dynamics dominates over random fluctuations. (ii) The selected countries spent a suitably long time in the decaying phase of the epidemic, thus allowing its precise characterisation. Based on these two criteria, we analysed data from the following, socio-economically similar countries, each implementing a somewhat distinct social distancing response: Italy, Spain, France, UK, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden.To characterise social distancing responses we used mobile phone mobility trend data from Apple Inc. 9 . Our aim is to quantitatively determine the characteristic features of the progression of the epidemic, such as initial growth rate, timing of the peak, and final decay rate and investigate how these parameters are determined by the timing and strictness of social distancing measures. We demonstrate that the overall death burden of the epidemic can be well explained by both the timing and extent of social distancing, often organized voluntarily well in advance of the state-mandated lock-down, and present quantitative relationships between changes in epidemiological parameters and mobile phone mobility data.Daily COVID-19 death data, D(t), is presented in Fig. 1 for the nine countries analysed. We selected the t = 0 reference time point as the date when the daily death rate first exceeded 5 deaths. In each country D(t) indicates the presence of a well defined exponential growth phase, followed by a crossover region and later an exponential decay stage. The initial growth and final decay regions are characterized by fitting the exponential D (t) as where the fitted functions are distinguished from the actual time series using a tilde. R 0 is the basic reproductive number (i.e. number of new secondary infections caused by a single infected in a fully susceptible population) based on a simple SIR dynamics 10 and γ is the inverse average duration of the infectious period. For calculating the basic reproductive number we use γ = 0.1 day −1 . The exact value of γ is somewhat uncertain at present 11, 12 , however our analysis and results do not rely on the value of this parameter or on any modelling assumption regarding the disease dynamics.To characterize the growth and decay phases, the values of R 0 1 and R 0 2 are approximated, respectively, by fitting Eq. (1) to the death data points (see Fig. 1 ). Least-squares fitting of Eq. (1) was performed using Mathematica (version 11, Wolfram Research, Inc.) routine NonlinearModelFit; see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 . The initial growth rate R 0 1 is similar in the selected countries except in Sweden where it is substantially lower. This difference may reflect weaker social mixing, different cultural habits or a somewhat lower population density -an interesting problem outside of the scope of this report. The reproductive number in the decaying phase R 0 2 is more variable across the different countries: in particular the decay is significantly slower in Sweden and somewhat slower in the UK.A third parameter characterizes the transition from the growth to decay phases, i.e., the peak of the epidemic in terms of deaths. We define (t c ,D c ) as the intersection point of the two fitted exponential functions. This is a more robust estimator than the actual maximum in daily deaths D c as at the time of transition daily deaths can exhibit a plateau, hence the value and location of the maximum is sensitive to stochastic fluctuations. The gradual transition from exponential growth to decay in the actual data D(t) can be due to gradual implementation of social distancing as well as to the case-to-case variability of the time elapsed from infection to death.The total death toll of the disease can be estimated analytically using the three parametersApproximations by Eq. (2) are compared with the actual total death toll, D tot , calculated as the area under death data points added to the area under the decaying curve (blue curve in Fig. 1 ) approaching zero. As Fig. 2 demonstrates, despite the substantial variation in death toll among the nine countries, it can be fairly well estimated by the expression (2) . Specifically, details of the cross-over region, which do not fit well to the two exponential functions, contribute only around 10% to the overall death toll, while variations in the three epidemiological parameters ( R 0 1 , R 0 2 , t c ) can change the death burden by an order of magnitude.The timing and strictness of the often voluntary social distancing is quantified from the average mobility data (green circles in Fig. 1 ), by fitting the following piece-wise linear function:where M 1 and M 2 are the average mobility levels before and after social distancing (i.e., before t 1 and after t 2 ), respectively. To fit Eq. (3) to the mobility data, we used the data recorded over 90 days starting from 13-January-2020. The mobility data show a relative daily volume of requests made to Apple Maps for directions by(3) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ transportation type per country compared to a baseline volume on 13-January-2020. Data is sent from users' devices to the Apple Maps service and is associated with randomised rotating identifiers so that Apple does not have a profile of individual movements and searches. The availability of data in a particular country is subject to a number of factors, including minimum thresholds for direction requests made per day. A day is defined as midnight-to-midnight, US Pacific time 9 . Although the mobility data may have bias in the mobility signal, it may have relatively little direct effect on data reported for the countries studied here. In the 90-day period considered in this study, the data indicates the mobility levels before and after implementing the social distancing. For clarity, to set a unique time-scale for the mobility data for all the countries, we added more data points after t 2 in Fig. 1 . These additional data points were not used in the fitting. The walking, driving and transit data are first averaged, then Eq. (3) was fitted to the average mobility level using Mathematica routine NonlinearModelFit. The fitted values of t 1 , M 1 , t 2 , and M 2 are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . The mobility data with average pre-pandemic value scaled to unity, M(t)/M 1 , is shown in Fig. 1 . We characterize the extent of social distancing by the ratio µ = M 2 /M 1 < 1 . A strict restriction of social interaction is expected to be reflected as µ ≈ 0.Using the fitted parameters t 1 and t 2 obtained from Eq. (3), an effective social distancing date is approximated. The mobility data shows a transition period in dropping the mobility level due to the social distancing. We define the midpoint of this transition period as an approximation for the average date when the social distancing becomes effective, given by:The Supplementary Table 3 summaries the approximated t eff . It is noteworthy that t eff often preceded the official national lock-down t NL .(4) t eff = t 1 + t 2 2 . Next, we investigate how the timing and extent of the social distancing changes the epidemic parameters, and as a consequence, the total death toll. First, we note that surprisingly neither the date of the official national lock-down t NL nor the effective date of social distancing predicts well -in itself -the time of the epidemic peak t c (Fig. 3) . As the average time between infection and succumbing to COVID-19 is 18 days 13 , a delay of approximately 18 days is expected (dashed line in Fig. 3 ) between the introduction of social distancing and the change in the trend of the daily death count. Instead, we find that the time to the peak from the official national lock-down t c − t NL varies in a range from 10 days in Italy to more than 3 weeks in case of Switzerland, and the time from the change in mobility to the peak, t c − t eff , ranges from 19 days (Italy and Spain) up to 34 days (Sweden) as shown in Table. 1. Furthermore, neither the time of the peak t c nor the parameters characterising the time and strength of social distancing t eff , t NL , µ correlates-as a single parameter-well with the total number of deaths (Fig. 4) . For example, Belgium registers a very high per capita death toll despite an early official lock-down, 5 days before the reference time t = 0 , and even earlier change is observed in mobility data ( t eff = −10 days). On the other hand, a moderate social distancing in Germany, indicated by the mobility ratio µ = 0.4 , led to the lowest death toll within this group of countries. Thus, we decided to investigate more carefully how social distancing affects the three epidemic parameters R 0 1 , R 0 2 and D c -with the hypothesis that the non-linear, multi-factor relationship (2) effectively masks correlations between the death toll and any single control parameter.As Fig. 5 indicates, we found two strong relationships between the epidemiological parameters and measures of social distancing. Figure 5a indicates a strong positive correlation between the drop in basic reproductive number, R 0 1 − R 0 2 and the restriction of mobility µ . The relationship can be well approximated by the quantitative formula:with ρ = 0.56 ± 0.09 and ζ = 3.18 ± 0.11 . Furthermore, the time elapsed between the peak and the social distancing, t c − t eff , correlates negatively with the severity of the mobility restrictions (Fig. 5b) as where τ 0 = 17.04 ± 1.62 days is comparable with the mean value of the time from infection to death in fatal COVID-19 disease 13 , and η = 1.50 ± 0.40 is the factor characterizing the lengthening of the delay for less severe reduction of mobility. Thus, the peak follows strict lock-downs (small µ as in Italy and Spain) by around 18 days. For less restrictive social distancing ( µ ≈ 0.6 as in Sweden), however, the peak can be delayed by as much as 5 weeks. This delay is of crucial importance, as the peak of the daily death toll D c is determined as www.nature.com/scientificreports/ where D (t eff ) is a natural measure of how early the social distancing took place relative to the dynamics of the epidemic. As D (t) is the exponential fit equation (1) instead of the actual daily death count D(t), unfortunately it is difficult to know in real-time. The country-specific values of D (t eff ) are listed in Table 2 .Our analysis thus indicates that social distancing has two effects: it reduces the basic reproduction number of the infection as expected, and shortens the time required for the epidemic to peak. This latter effect is unexpected, as changes in behavior should reduce transmission immediately, which, after a fixed delay -involving manifestation of symptoms and in a fraction of the patients death -should also appear in the daily death toll D(t). We propose that the increased time between the peak and the time of the social distancing may indicate the presence of subpopulations in which the disease continues to propagate with the initial reproduction number R 0 1 . In these populations the transmission is eventually blocked, not by the overall social distancing efforts within the society, but by some other means. As a potential mechanism, we suggest that the local outbreak can reach such a magnitude that it either triggers an intervention or allows the establishment of herd immunity. Prominent examples of such events that collectively expand the duration of the initial growth phase are outbreaks in nursing homes, meat processing plants, warehouses and prisons -which become more likely when the overall social distancing is weak. Furthermore, weak overall social distancing could also fail to protect and segregate these vulnerable subpopulations specifically, thus increase the effective size of such subpopulations.In this paper we analysed the interdependence of epidemic and mobility data and identified a quantitative relation between parameters of social distancing and key characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sample consisted of 9 European countries where suitable data was available at current time. We found that the total death toll does not correlate well with any single parameter such as the timing of the official lock-down or the strictness of social distancing extracted from mobile phone location data. The total death toll, however, could be well estimated by a non-linear combination of three parameters: exponents characterising (i) the initial exponential growth rate (or reproductive number, R 0 1 ) and (ii) the final decay rate of the epidemic, R 0 2 , and (iii) the peak death rate D c which separates the two stages. The initial growth rate is an intrinsic parameter which may vary somewhat across different countries, but is not affected by control measures or social responses to the pandemic. Based on our data analysis we find that the two remaining parameters, R 0 2 and D c can be related to the timing ( t eff ) and strength ( µ ) of social distancing. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Since the estimated daily death toll at the peak increases exponentially with the difference between the effective lock-down time ( t eff ) and time of the peak ( t c ), small changes in t c − t eff can yield substantial differences in the total death toll. The per capita values of D (t eff ) are fairly similar: within the range 0.1-0.16 for 7 of the countries analysed, suggesting that social distancing started at similar stages of the epidemic. The important exception is Germany, where a much smaller value of 0.02 corresponds to roughly a week earlier response. According to the analysis presented here, this explains the substantially lower German death toll, in spite of the relatively moderate social distancing. The slightly higher value of D (t eff )/population in Spain (0.23) was compensated by a strict lock-down (lower µ).The higher death toll in Belgium cannot be explained by the proposed set of parameters ( R 0 1 , D(t eff ), µ ) as all three values are close to the average of the sample. This anomaly can be traced to Fig. 5(b) , where the deviation of the Belgian data point from the fitted curve indicates that the peak of the epidemic was delayed by approximately www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 4 days compared to what could be expected based on the proxy measure for social distancing µ . While the high Belgian death toll is often attributed to the different methodology of recording COVID-19 related fatalities, including suspected deaths which were not confirmed by lab analysis, such a difference in methodology cannot explain the markedly high time distance between the effective date of social distancing ( t eff ) and the epidemic peak ( t c ); see Fig. 5 (b). As we propose that t c − t eff reflects the presence of subpopulations in which the disease can spread unmitigated by social distancing efforts, we suggest that such groups were relatively larger in Belgium than in the other countries within our sample. While in the case of Sweden the initial growth rate was the slowest and even the timing ( D(t eff ) ) was similar to other countries the weakness of the mobility restriction (i.e. large µ ) led to high death toll resulting from a strongly delayed peak. We would like to emphasize, that this delay was unexpected at the time of social distancing efforts, and still unaccounted by the typical SIR-based epidemiological models 10 .In the case of the UK the timing of the social distancing ( D(t eff ) ) is similar to other countries, however the mobility restriction appears to be weaker (i.e. higher µ ) compared to similar countries (Spain, Italy and France) which results in a slower decay of the epidemic.The phone mobility data is an indirect measure of the social distancing and disease transmission probabilities. However, it can be compared to more traditional measures in the Netherlands, where a study directly determined the number of daily personal interactions before and after the lock-down. Using questionnaires, the study identified a 71% decrease in interactions on average, which is fairly close to the 65% drop estimated from the phone mobility data 14 . While mobile phone tracking data thus can characterize the relatively early stages of social distancing efforts, it may be less useful to detect more subtle efforts like wearing masks or staggered working shifts at later stages of the pandemic.In conclusion, we demonstrated a quantitative relation between social distancing efforts and statistical parameters describing the current COVID-19 pandemic. We identified an unexpected extension of the exponential growth phase when social distancing efforts are weak, which can substantially increase the death toll of the disease. Future studies are required to extend this analysis to countries with a markedly different socio-economical arrangements.",Australia,first author,2021-01-18,01
fcf5356bb3bab66418e25da5372fb866b25e3d67,Momentum contrastive learning for few-shot COVID-19 diagnosis from chest CT images,"The latest coronavirus, COVID-19, was initially reported in Wuhan, China toward the end of 2019 and has since spread rapidly around the globe, leading to a worldwide crisis. As an infectious lung disease, COVID-19 leads to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is accompanied by a series of side effects that include a dry cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, etc. As of October 18th 2020, more than 39 million individuals around the world have been confirmed as having COVID-19, with a roughly 6.3% case fatality rate, according to the World Health Organization. 1 So far, no effective treatment for COVID-19 has been found. One of the major hurdles is the lack of efficient diagnostic methods. Therefore, an accurate and rapid diagnosis platform is urgently required to conduct COVID-19 screening and prevent its further spread. Currently, most tests are based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, each RT-PCR test can take several hours to produce results. With the current spread rate of COVID-19, this is not acceptable. Further, the limited number of test kits exacerbates the situation [1] [2] [3] . Recent studies also show that the RT-PCR suffers from low sensitivity and accuracy, often requiring repeated entries [4, 5] . This prevents patients from being confirmed in a timely manner, increasing the potential risk of spreading.In order to address these challenges, scientists around the world are trying to develop new diagnostic systems. Some studies [6, 7] have demonstrated that chest computed tomography (CT) imaging can help in diagnosing COVID-19 rapidly. Salehi et al. [8] concluded that chest CT imaging is sensitive for diagnosing COVID-19 even when patients do not have clinical symptoms. Specifically, three typical radiographic features, including consolidation, pleural effusion and ground class opacification, can be easily observed from the CT images of COVID-19 patients [9, 10] .With this in mind, several methods based on chest CT images been developed for diagnosing COVID-19. For instance, some studies used a 3D CNN to diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest CT scans [11] . Mei et al. [12] adopted ResNet to rapidly iden- Fig. 1 . The overall architecture of our approach. Top: The pre-training stage, which includes data augmentation and representation learning. The pretext task is an instance discrimination task.

Query sample embeddings are compared with the centroid of training sample embeddings and used to fine-tune the pre-trained encoder.tify COVID-19. Besides diagnosis, several works also used the segmentation techniques for detection [13, 14] . However, all existing methods are trained using the limited samples available from a small number of patients and may not generalize well to new patients. It is well-known that a lack of labelled training data is a common challenge since deep learning methods generally require a large volume of data for accurate training. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to alleviating this problem through, for example, data augmentation or generative adversarial networks (GANs) [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, these methods are highly sensitive to parameter selection. Hand-tuned data augmentation methods like rotation may lead to overfitting [19] , images generated by a GAN cannot simulate the real patient data which, may introduce unpredictable bias in the testing phase [15] . Recently, few-shot learning attracted significant attention in medical image analysis. In general, few-shot learning aims to leverage existing data to classify new tasks from similar domains. The basic workflow for few-shot learning is to pre-train an embedding network on a large dataset (e.g. ImageNet), then fine-tune the weights of this network, and finally apply it to a small unseen dataset [20, 21] . However, the performance is only marginally improved this way. One reason lies in that ImageNet contains a broad range of categories and pre-training on this dataset often introduces irrelevant information, which does not help in learning effective embeddings for improving lung-specific feature representation. In addition, pre-training on ImageNet incurs a high computational cost; for example, ImageNet-1B typically required over 50 GPU days.To address this challenge, we develop an end-to-end trainable deep few-shot learning framework that can provide accurate predictions with minimal training on chest CT images. Specifically, we first use the instance discrimination task to enforce model to discriminate two images are the same instance or not. Different views of the same images are then generated to augment the original dataset. As our goal at this stage is to increase variances other than discrimination, we are able to effectively avoid the disadvantages of data augmentation mentioned previously.We then deploy a self-supervised strategy [22] powered with momentum contrastive training to further boost the performance.The key idea is to build a dynamic dictionary to perform (key, query) look-up, where the keys are sampled from data and encoded by the encoder. However, the key in the dictionary is noisy and inconsistent due to the back-propagation [23] . We apply the momentum mechanism to mitigate this effect by updating the key and query encoders at different scales. Finally, we utilize two public lung datasets to pre-train an embedding network and employ the prototypical network [24] to conduct the few-shot classification, which learns a metric space for classification by measuring the distances to the derived prototypical representation of each class. Extensive experiments on two new datasets demonstrate that our model provides a promising tool for quick COVID-19 diagnosis with very limited available training data.Due to the shortage of annotated COVID-19 CT images, normal classification methods may not work properly. As such, we formulate COVID-19 diagnosis as a few-shot classification problem. Fewshot learning is designed for cases in which only a few samples of new class are available for classifier training. It can be defined as a M-way, C-shot episodic task [25] , where M represents the number of classes and C represents number of samples available for each class. The training set, which has never been seen before, can bewhere d is the number of samples in the dataset. We randomly select the support set and query set from D : (i) The support set S can be partially or fully made up of M classes but only contain C + 1 samples. (ii) We randomly select one sample from the C + 1 samples to form the test set (query set). Hence, COVID-19 diagnosis can be represented as a two-way, C-shot learning problem.In this section, we will introduce our proposed self-supervised COVID-19 diagnosis method. The overall flowchart is illustrated in Fig. 1 . We will describe the three major components of our method, which include data augmentation, representation learning and the few-shot classification. Three possibilities for random cropping. Dashed boxes are augmented views. Crops A, C, E will have random color distortions applied, while B, D, F will not change if method (2) is chosen. All the cropped sections will be resized back to the original input image size. For the instance discrimination task, the goal, given B, D, F is to determine whether or not A, C, E are in the same instance.Data augmentation has been widely used in unsupervised representation learning and supervised learning [26, 27] . A few existing approaches define the contrastive classification task as changing the structure of images. For instance, Hjelm et al. [28] and Bachman et al. [29] used global-to-local view for contrastive learning as shown in the first example in Fig 2 . Meanwhile, Oord et al. [22] and Henaff et al. [30] achieved neighbor prediction using the adjacency view (middle example, Fig 2 ) . An overlapping view of the two approaches can be seen in third image of Fig 2 . In this study, we apply a stochastic data augmentation T which randomly transfers a given example image x into two different views, denoted as x i , x j . We consider the pair x i , x j as positive. Further, we apply two simple augmentation strategies in sequence: (1) random cropping, followed by a resizing operation back to the original size with random flipping; or (2) random cropping with color distortions followed by a resizing operation. When a new image is fed into the model, one of the above methods is randomly selected for augmentation. This process is repeated twice to generate two different views. Note that we implement color distortions using the torchvision 2 package in PyTorch [31] .Using contrastive learning to learn visual embeddings was first explored by Hadsell et al. [32] . Given an image set {I = i 1 , . . . , i p } , x i ∈ R d , the goal of the task is to find a mapping func-where s (·, ·) is a function used to measure the similarity between two inputs. G is designed for dimension reduction and representation learning. Finally, x + , x − represent the positive and negative samples, where x + is similar to x and x − is dissimilar. It is worth mentioning that the contrastive learning is a type of unsupervised learning. A simple framework for contrastive learning was proposed by Chen et al. [33] . Specifically, the representations are learned by maximizing the agreement between differently augmented views x i , x j of the same data example x via a contrastive loss in the latent space. We adopt this framework in our model. Specifically, our representation learning stage consists of three modules: the encoder, projection head and, contrastive loss function.Encoder The neural network based encoder f (·) can extract representations from the augmented images. This framework is flexible for adopting any type of network architecture without constraints. In this study, we adopt ResNet [34] to obtain the repre-of the average pooling layer. Projection head The projection head g(·) is a function that can map the resulting representation into the application space of the contrastive loss. The most common projection head used is the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer [33] . In this case, we can express the z i (as well as z j ) as:where W 1 , W 2 are the weights of the hidden layer and output layer, respectively. The σ (·) is the non-linear ReLU activation function, which can be defined as:We will examine the effectiveness of this projection head in Section 4 .The contrastive loss function is defined for the contrastive pre-text task. It was first proposed by Hadsell et al. [32] and is used to calculate the value when the query is similar to the positive key and dissimilar for all other keys. In this manuscript, we only consider the instance discrimination task [35] .Given a set { x k } including a positive pair x i , x j , the contrastive task aims to identify x j in set { x k } k = i for a given x i . We define the contrastive task on pairs of augmented images from a randomly selected minibatch with N samples. The augmentation process results in 2 N data points. To create the contrastive task, we need enough negative samples to construct the loss function. Similar to Doersch et al. [36] , we treat the other 2 N − 2 examples as the negative samples. The similarity function s (·, ·) can be defined as the cosine similarity:where v , u are two vectors. Based on this, we can define the loss function for a pair of positive samples (i, j) as:Here 1 k = i ∈ { 0 , 1 } is the indicator which has a value of 1 when k = i and 0 otherwise, and τ is the temperature parameter. This loss is known as the normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss [22, 29] . However, Eq. (5) only considers the positive samples and ignores negative samples. Note that, the margin based contrastive loss function [32] has the same problem only considering about the positive keys. This may lead to potential bias. To avoid this, we introduce the momentum mechanism into our model. Contrastive learning can also be expressed as training an encoder to conduct a dictionary lookup task. Consider an encoded query q and encoded samples x i , . . . , x k , which are the keys of the dictionary. If the query q is similar to the sample x + , there is a match. For the negative samples x − , there is no match in the dictionary. Based on this definition, He et al. proposed an unsupervised learning-based framework MoCo [23] , by adopting contrastive learning.Based on the above definition, the goal of contrastive learning is to build a discrete dictionary for high-dimensional continuous inputs. The core of MoCo is to maintain a dictionary with a queue. The benefit of this is that the encoder can reuse the encoded keys from the previous mini-batch. In addition, the dictionary can be much larger than the mini-batch and easy to adjust. As the number of samples that can be included in the dictionary is fixed, once the dictionary is full, it will progressively remove the oldest records. In this way, the consistency of the dictionary can be maintained as the oldest samples are often out-of-date and inconsistent with the new entries. Another approach, called Memory Bank [35] , tries to store the historical records of the encoded samples. This approach maintains a bank of all the representations of the dataset. The dictionary then randomly samples from the memory bank directly for each mini-batch without back-propagation. However, this method will lead to inconsistency when sampling. To overcome this, back-propagation should be conducted to keep the sampling step up-to-date. A simple solution is to copy the key encoder f k from the query encoder f q without the gradient. However, the encoder changes constantly, which can lead to a noisy key representation and poor results. The momentum contrast was introduced to address this problem, using a different method to update the gradient for f k :where θ k is the parameter for f k , θ q is the parameter for f q and m ∈ [0 , 1) is the momentum coefficient. We use back-propagation to update the parameter θ q and use Eq. (6) to update θ k . Benefiting from the momentum coefficient, the update of θ k is smoother than θ q . According to the different update strategies, the query and key will eventually be encoded by different encoders.Based on the above discussion, we use the dictionary as a queue to allow the encoder to reuse the previous encoded sample. The loss function for the pre-trained model can be written as:Different from Eq. (5) , here we need to consider the queue and the negative cases, so we slightly modify the loss function to fulfil this requirement by introducing the positive examples k + and negative examples k − , where q k = k + ∪ k − . In the instance discrimination pre-text task, a positive pair is formed when a query q and a key k are augmented from the same sample; otherwise, a negative pair is created. Once the pre-training step is finished, we extract the pre-trained encoder f (·) and integrate it into our classification module. It is worth mentioning that the triple loss [37] is another popular loss function that considers both positive and negative examples. However, the triple loss does not converge easily and is time-consuming. Hence, it is normally only used in identification [38, 39] or fine-grained image classification tasks. For our task, using the contrastive loss is adequate as we are dealing with instance discrimination task.Another step in our workflow is classification. In this stage, meta-learning is applied to fine-tune the pre-trained encoder to fit the class changes required by few-shot learning. Then we use Prototypical Networks [24] for few-shot classification. The prototypical network learns an embedding that maps all inputs into a mean vector c in the latent space to represent each class. The goal of the pre-trained encoder is to ensure that similar images are close and dissimilar images are separate in the latent space. The prototypical network has a similar goal, so it is used to fine-tune our pre-trained encoder. For class m, the centroid embedding features can be written as:where ψ (·) is the embedding function from the prototypical network. As the prototypical network is a metric based learning method, we use the Euclidean distance to produce the distribution for all classes for a query q .Eq. (9) is based on the softmax function over the distance between a query set's embedding and the features of the class. The loss function for this stage can be defined as:Algorithm 1 shows the whole pre-training workflow of our Algorithm 1: Training algorithm for the pre-training.Select two data augmentation functions from T : t , t ; We evaluated our proposed model using two publicly available annotated COVID-19 CT slices datasets: (1) COVID-19 CT 3 and (2) a dataset provided by the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology 4 and preprocessed by MedSeg. 5 It is worth mentioning that there is no overlap between COVID-19 CT and MegSeg as they come from different countries. When dividing the support and query sets for classification, we divided the datasets at a patient-level instead of CT level to avoid any possible overlap. The basic statistics for the COVID-19 CT dataset and MegSeg are 3 https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT 4 https://www.sirm.org/category/senza-categoria/covid-19/ 5 http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/ summarized in Table 1 . We combined the two datasets for testing. Note that all CT slices were resized to 512 × 512 using opencv2. 6 A proper pre-training is required for our proposed model. Different from other existing methods, such as Self-Trans [20] , that used ImageNet to pre-train the model, we adopted DeepLesion [40] and the Lung Image Database Consortium Image Collection (LIDC-IDRI). 7 DeepLesion contains over 32,0 0 0 lung CT images while LIDC-IDRI includes 244,617 ones. Both datasets are public and focus on lung diseases. We used the two datasets without labels to pre-train the encoder network.For pre-training, we used the SGD optimizer with a weight decay of 0.0 0 01 and momentum of 0.9. The momentum update coefficient was 0.999. The mini-batch size was set to 256 in eight GPUs. The number of epochs was 200. The initial learning rate was 0.03, which was then multiplied by 0.1 after 120 and 160 epochs, as described in [35] . ResNet-50 was used as the encoder. The twolayer MLP projection head included a 2048-D hidden layer with a ReLU activation function. The weights were initialized by using He initialization [41] , and the temperature parameter τ was set to 0.07. For the classification stage, we followed the default settings of the prototypical net. The experiments were conducted on eight GPUS which includes six NVIDIA TITAN X Pascal GPUs and two NVIDIA TITAN RTX.We evaluated model performance using four metrics: (i) Accuracy, which measures the percentage of correctly classified samples over the whole dataset; (ii) Precision, which measures the percentage of true positives (TP) over all predicted positive samples; (iii) Recall, used to measure the percentage of TPs over all positive samples; and (iv) Area-under-the-curve (AUC) which measures the relation between FPs and TPs. We trained and tested each of the compared methods on COVID-19 CT and MegSeg dataset using 10fold cross-validation at a patient-level with the cross-entropy loss function.The experimental results are summarized in Table 2 . We found that the designed two-way, one-shot model yielded very similar performance to ResNet-50. In addition, we found that the obtained classification performance is worse when the model is pre-trained on ImageNet. As discussed previously, an extra step may be required to conduct transfer learning from common items to lung CT slices.As previously mentioned, our method used few-shot learning. We were thus interested to see how varying the number of shots would affect the model performance. Accordingly, we conducted an experimental analysis to explore the relationship between the classification performance and the number of shots. The results are shown in Table 3 , where ResNet-50 is used as a baseline method for the comparison. As can be seen, the classification performance of our model is gradually improved with the increase in the number of shots. Specifically, our model achieved significantly improved performance when using four shots compared with one shot and outperformed ResNet-50, but no obvious further improvement was observed when using more than five shots. These results indicate that the pre-trained encoder effectively captured the features from unknown images to improve the classification performance. Additionally, we provide visualizations of the features learned by different methods including our method, Pretrain with ImageNet, DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50 in Fig 3 . Here, both DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50 were directly trained on the COVID-19 dataset described in Table 1 . As can be seen, our method learned more features that focused on the lung area, improving the classification accuracy in comparison with approaches. Table 4 summarizes the training time taken by different methods for a comparison of the computational cost. As our method was not trained on the COVID-19 dataset, the corresponding training time was not available. The method trained on ImageNet took about 150 h.In this section, we conducted extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the importance of each component in our model. The default setting of our method was two-way, one-shot and ResNet-50 used the same setting as in the previous section. We investigated the following research questions: (1) How would data augmentation and projection head affect the performance? (2) How important is the fine-tuning stage? (3) How would the resizing operation affect the performance? (4) Is the result significantly affected when using a different encoder?First, we explored the role of the data augmentation and projection head. We conducted the experiments on our model without augmentation and without projection head, respectively.The results summarized in Table 5 show that data augmentation had a significant effect on the model performance while the projection head yielded only a slight improvement. One possible reason why the projection head was not able to provide an obvious improvement would be that it was only used to extract the most important information from the similarity vector. As such, it simply worked as a filter without introducing additionally useful features.In addition, we also investigated that the impact of different data augmentation strategies. Specifically, we compared the classification results between random-cropping of using three augmentation strategies and only using a single one. All the com- Table 2 Performance comparison between our proposed model and other methods. Our model and the method pretrained on ImageNet use a two-way, one-shot strategy. pared data augmentation methods are shown in Fig. 2 . In Table 6 , we summarize the classification results and use AB-cropping, CDcropping, and EF-cropping to represent each of the three strategies. The results demonstrate that the model performance de- Table 5 The effect of data augmentation and projection head. Table 9 Effects of using different encoders on model performance. Moreover, we also examined the effects of the fine-tuning process on the model performance. To do so, we first pre-trained the embedding network and modified the few-shot classification stage by replacing the prototypical network with a linear classifier with frozen features. We directly applied the linear classifier into the learned embedding network without any update on weights. The results are summarized in Table 7 which show that the fine-tuning process can significantly improve the performance.In addition, we also investigated the impact of the resizing operation during the data augmentation process. To this end, we compared the model performance with and without the resizing operation (see Table 8 ). As can be seen, the resizing operation slightly affected the performance. Moreover, as the cropping operation may generate different-sized images, the resizing operation is necessary to ensure that all these generated images can be fed into the neural network for model training.Finally, we examined the effect of using different encoders on model performance. We used the same settings as mentioned in Section 4.2 , but changed the encoder network from ResNet-50 to ResNet-152, DenseNet-161, and VGG-16 for performance comparison. The results reported in Table 9 show that ResNet-50 achieved the best performance. This justified the use of ResNet-50 as the encoder in our proposed model.CT imaging is attracting increasing attention as a screening tool for COVID-19. It provides visualization for monitoring disease progression and can help to evaluate the severity. However, the lack of annotated CT scans is a significant challenge in CT imaging-based medical studies. In this work, we proposed a new deep-learning based method that can be used for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 with limited samples. Moreover, we demonstrated that our method achieved superior performance over ResNet-50 when the number of available samples is larger than three. ResNet-50 is a well-known and widely used supervised learning model for med-ical image analysis. As our developed model used a self-supervised strategy based on unsupervised learning, the fact that it can outperform than ResNet-50 is remarkable.We expect that our method will be useful for other medical imaging analysis tasks facing the same data shortage problem. In the future, we plan to apply the proposed method to more COVID-19 datasets to validate its generalizability. Moreover, we will also investigate how to use knowledge distillation to reduce the size of learned embedding and further increase the classification accuracy.",Australia,first author,2021-01-16,01
38c0ddef69026ceaf8114cffee34a356808b4471,,"Advancements in digital technologies have substantially changed the manner in which individuals interact with media. Over the last 40 years, and especially since the advent of mobile and internet technologies, media consumption in the forms of listening to music, playing video/computer games, watching TV/movies/streaming videos, and using social media, has become a ubiquitous part of everyday life. Many youth spend more time with media than any single activity other than sleeping-the average American aged 8-18, for example, uses media for over 6 h per day (Roberts and Foehr, 2008) . Researchers have provided insights into the evolving nature of media consumption, the psychological drivers of such consumption, and the effects of media consumption on various groups (e.g., Roberts and Foehr, 2008; Hoge et al., 2017) . Such research is important given the prominence and ubiquity of media use in modern society; however, COVID-19 has changed the landscape of media use and its possible effects. Research is needed to highlight the changing nature of media use through stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reveal the extent to which media use impacted life satisfaction during these stages.Around the world, COVID-19 quickly disrupted everyday life (Sundarasen et al., 2020; Zhang W.-R. et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) , causing significant physical harm for a large proportion of the community (Sibley et al., 2020) . With the goal of curtailing the spread of the virus, many governments implemented strict quarantine, and spatial distancing measures. However, such measures have been associated with an increased mental health burden (Brooks et al., 2020; Fischer et al., 2020) , with data obtained during COVID-19 reinforcing previous evidence that quarantine and stayat-home orders increase anxiety, irritability, stress, insomnia, anger, uncertainty, and confusion (e.g., Bai et al., 2004; Cava et al., 2005; Brooks et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Sønderskov et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020) . For many, life satisfaction during COVID-19 has been negatively influenced by reduced social interactions resulting from restrictions (Ammar et al., 2020) , increased fear concerning COVID-19 (Satici, 2020) , and the severity of COVID-19 in one's geographical location (Zhang S. X. et al., 2020) .In order to successfully protect both physical and psychological health during COVID-19, individuals were required to adapt to new circumstances and develop new routines (Bu et al., 2020, p. 2) . There is clear evidence of changes to people's behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, people's leisure activities were sharply curtailed, with many activities, such as shopping and sport participation, prohibited (Bu et al., 2020, p. 2) . People spent considerably more time (than pre-COVID-19) at home, exercised less, and consumed more alcohol (Koopmann et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) . In addition, many individuals turned to screen-based activities and consumption of other types of media content (such as listening to music) as a coping resource in response to the stress caused by the pandemic (Zheng et al., 2020) . It is this behavior-individuals' interactions with selected media content (notably, listening to music, playing video/computer games, watching TV/movies/streaming videos, and using social media)-upon which the present study is focused. Although the reasoning behind individuals' increased use of media during COVID-19 is clear, the extent to which media use during this period predicted life satisfaction is yet to be fully elucidated.For at least two reasons, the relationship between media use and life satisfaction during COVID-19 is likely to be nuanced and complicated. First, although research points to certain wellbeing and social connection benefits from some media consumption (e.g., Graham and Nikolova, 2013; Docan, 2016) , it may also be possible to have ""too much of a good thing."" Király et al. (2020) , for example, noted that although watching TV, using social media, playing video games, and using the internet are often used to reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression, these are potentially addictive behaviors that may give rise to unhealthy and problematic functioning. With high levels of media exposure, people can experience increased anxiety and stress as well as other unintended negative health consequences such as misplaced help-seeking behaviors (Garfin et al., 2020) . Thus, a non-linear relationship may exist between (at least some forms of) media use and life satisfaction. Second, different types of media consumption have been shown to relate in different ways to wellbeing outcomes. For instance, people often listen to music in order to self-regulate their mood (Lonsdale and North, 2011; Boer and Fischer, 2012; Schäfer, 2016; Baltazar et al., 2019; Lonsdale, 2019) , reduce negative emotional states (North et al., 2004; Sloboda, 2010) , and help relieve or manage everyday stress (Laukka, 2007; Krause et al., 2020) . Findings regarding the benefits of watching TV/films and using social media are more mixed (e.g., Frey and Benesch, 2008; Cuñado and Pérez de Gracia, 2012; Arampatzi et al., 2016; Groshek et al., 2018) . In general, then, different types of media use may elicit different effects on life satisfaction, and we will explore this possibility in the current study.Guided by the possibility of nuanced effects of media use on life satisfaction, we explored relationships between various types of media use and life satisfaction. A repeated assessment research design was utilized to capture relationships at both withinand between-person levels. Specifically, the study aim was to determine whether people who used more media had higher (or lower) life satisfaction, and whether individuals reported higher (or lower) life satisfaction when they reported more media use. The target population for this work was university students, a group for whom the COVID-19 pandemic changed many areas of life. Students were required to adapt to new learning environments, change their peer interactions, cope with financial stressors (e.g., loss of employment), and address concerns about family health (Lyons et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . The psychological well-being of university student cohorts around the world decreased in the early stages of COVID-19 (Idowu et al., 2020) , with research showing a negative impact of the pandemic on students' social connectedness (Lyons et al., 2020) , stress, and anxiety (Kobbin et al., 2020; Lyons et al., 2020; Odriozola-González et al., 2020; Savitsky et al., 2020; Son et al., 2020; Sundarasen et al., 2020) .The aim of this study was to investigate whether life satisfaction was related to the use of different types of media among university students during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous literature points toward positive relationships between music consumption and wellbeing, and we hypothesized such a relationship at both within-and betweenperson levels in this study. Due to prior mixed findings with respect to relationships between other types of media consumption and wellbeing, we offered no hypotheses in relation to associations between other types of media use and life satisfaction.A total of 127 individuals participated in the study. All participants were students at a university in Queensland, Australia. Of the sample, 24% identified as male, 74% as female, and 2% as non-binary. Participants were aged 18-53 (M = 24.73, Mdn = 20, SD = 8.96). The majority of the sample (83.47%) were of Australian nationality. A total of 44% of the sample were full-time students, 37% worked part-time, 6% worked fulltime, and 12% were unemployed. Participants were recruited using a university participation scheme. As compensation for taking part in the study, students who accessed the study obtained credit toward their coursework. The Human Research Ethics Committee at James Cook University granted ethics approval (Approval number: H8074). Data was collected as a part of a larger study examining Australian students' experiences of COVID-19, and the present study involved only the data concerning media use and life satisfaction across the study period.The present study used a repeated measures design. Participants were asked to complete a set of six surveys, each of which was separated by a period of 2 weeks. Participants consented to take part in the study in April, 2020. At this time, the participants had recently begun experiencing the strictest restrictions put in place by the Queensland government, and only virtual means of university attendance was permitted 1 . The questions on the first survey asked participants about their experiences prior to any lifestyle changes due to COVID-19. The final (sixth) survey was completed in mid-July, 2020. The administration of the sixth survey corresponded with both the re-opening of state borders and the resumption of children's sport locally in the State.Participants accessed the online questionnaires (hosted using Qualtrics) using direct web links. Individuals read the participant information, gave their informed consent (indicated by clicking ""yes"" or ""no"" on the online consent webpage), and created a unique, anonymous code prior to completing the first questionnaire. This code was entered at the start of the subsequent questionnaires, which were completed as a series of webpages. Following completion of the final questionnaire, participants were thanked for their participation and debriefed.When responding to the first questionnaire, participants were asked to provide demographic information (age, gender, nationality, occupation and country of residence). On each of the six questionnaires, participants responded to questions concerning four media-based leisure activities, namely: listening to music; video/computer gaming; TV/movies/streaming videos; and social media. In particular, they were asked to indicate how often they partook in each of the four activities (noting that responses on the first questionnaire pertained to ""prior to any lifestyle changes due to COVID-19""; and responses on the other questionnaires pertained to ""in your everyday life over the previous week""). Participants responded using a five-point scale (1 = never, 5 = at least once a day).A single item was used to measure participant life satisfaction on each questionnaire (Bu et al., 2020) . This item was phrased 1 The severity of COVID-19 as well as government-led restrictions in Australia varied between states van Agteren et al., 2020) . The following information is offered to contextualize participants' experience of the COVID-19 pandemic with regard to what was happening in Queensland, Australia, at the time of data collection (drawing on information reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-28/coronavirus-timeline-queensland-tracking-spread/12077602). While the Queensland government declared a public health emergency on 29 January 2020, the shutdown of non-essential services and State border closures was announced on 23 March 2020. The Queensland Premier tightened social-distancing and lockdown restrictions with a two-person household rule and banned travel (except for the essential reasons of getting food, medical reasons, work, and exercise) on 30 March 2020. At that time, the student participants experienced a pivot from faceto-face teaching to virtual teaching, which remained in place for the rest of 2020. The first easing of restrictions in Queensland was announced on 26 April 2020, with pubs, clubs, restaurants, and cafes permitted to reopen with restrictions on 16 May 2020. In July 2020, Queensland implemented ""stage 3"" easing of restrictions with the State border reopening to travelers from other states and territories (excluding Victoria) on 10 July 2020. as, ""All things considered, how satisfied have you been with life as a whole this past week?"" (or in the case of the first questionnaire, ""prior to any lifestyle changes due to COVID-19?""). Participants were asked to use a slider to indicate their response, where 0 = completely dissatisfied and 100 = completely satisfied. Single-item life satisfaction measures have been shown to perform similarly to other, multi-item measures (Cheung and Lucas, 2014; Atroszko et al., 2017) .In total, there were 470 assessments from 127 participants. Most participants completed 6 (n = 32, 25%) or 5 (n = 26, 20%) surveys, with 18 participants (14%) completing 4, 11 (9%) completing 3, 20 completing 2 (16%), and 20 (16%) completing 1 survey.Intraclass correlations (ICCs) were used to evaluate how much life satisfaction and media use changed over the six assessments. The hypotheses were tested using multilevel modeling, to account for nesting of data within-person, in the lme4 (Bates et al., 2015) package of R (R Core Team, 2019). To test how life satisfaction and media use changed over time, the study variables were regressed onto time. In a priori assumption testing, it was found that change across time in life satisfaction and media use was nonlinear; therefore, time was treated as a categorical variable (1-6 assessment time points) in the models with the reference being the first assessment reflecting ""everyday life prior to any lifestyle changes due to To test between-and within-person associations between life satisfaction and media use, life satisfaction was regressed onto between-and within-person partitions of time spent listening to music, playing video/computer games, watching TV/movies/streaming videos, and using social media. Betweenperson variables were calculated as each individual's average value across the six time points; within-person variables were calculated as the deviation from each individual's average per time point (Shiffman et al., 2008) . Table 1 depicts study variable descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations. The ICCs revealed that life satisfaction and media use displayed variability at the between-and within-person levels, with using social media and listening to music the most stable over time, and watching TV/movies/streaming videos and life satisfaction the most variable over time. Listening to music was positively associated with watching TV/movies/streaming videos and using social media. Life satisfaction showed no significant associations with any media use variable. These bivariate associations do not account for nesting within-person; therefore, multilevel modeling is needed to appropriately assess between-and within-person associations.The models testing whether life satisfaction and media use changed across the six 2 weeks assessments are shown in Table 2 . Life satisfaction scores were lower than pre-COVID levels until time points 5 and 6, when they were no longer statistically significantly lower than pre-COVID. The box plot depicting this trend is shown in Figure 1 . There was little change from pre-COVID to during COVID for listening to music, although there was a slight dip in time spent listening to music at time point 3. The box plot depicting listening to music over time is shown in Figure 2 . There was an acute increase in video/computer game playing at the time point following the pre-COVID assessment, but this trend dissipated back to a null difference from pre-COVID time for the rest of the time points (see Figure 3) . Time spent watching TV/movies/streaming videos was reported more often during time points 2 and 6 compared to pre-COVID, but there were not significant differences between pre-COVID and time points 3-5 (see Figure 4) . Time spent using social media was higher during time points 2-4 but dropped back to pre-COVID levels for time points 5 and 6 (see Figure 5 ).The model testing between-and within-person associations of life satisfaction with media use (Table 3) revealed that there were no significant between-person associations. At the within-person level, however, listening to music was positively associated with life satisfaction, and watching TV/movies/streaming videos was negatively associated with life satisfaction. That is, on occasions when people listened to more music than was usual for them, they reported higher life satisfaction, and on occasions when people watched more TV/movies/streaming videos than was usual for them, they reported lower life satisfaction.In the present study, we explored university students' media use and life satisfaction during COVID-19 restrictions in Australia. Findings reinforced previous work demonstrating positive associations between listening to music and well-being. Consistent with our hypothesis, data showed that life satisfaction FIGURE 2 | The trend of time spent listening to music across six 2-week assessment occasions with the initial assessment reflective of ""everyday life prior to any lifestyle changes due to was higher than typical levels on occasions when individuals increased their time spent listening to music. We offered no hypotheses in relation to associations between life satisfaction and other types of media use; however, data indicated that when individuals watched more TV/movies/videos, they reported lower life satisfaction. One interpretation of these findings is that people's media engagement leads to changes in life satisfaction; however, it is important to note that the directionality of these relationships is unclear. For instance, it is possible that people might listen to more music and find that it improves their life satisfaction, yet it is also possible that when people are feeling good about life, they are prone to listening to more music. Consistent with other research undertaken during COVID-19 (e.g., Kamarianos et al., 2020; Lyons et al., 2020; Son et al., 2020) , we found high overall engagement with media throughout the assessment period. Listening to music was uniformly popular at FIGURE 3 | The trend of time spent playing video/computer games across six 2-week assessment occasions with the initial assessment reflective of ""everyday life prior to any lifestyle changes due to COVID-19.""FIGURE 4 | The trend of time spent watching TV/movies/streaming videos across six 2-week assessment occasions with the initial assessment reflective of ""everyday life prior to any lifestyle changes due to the different time points (as demonstrated in Figure 2) , whereas other types of media were used most frequently in the early time points (when more government restrictions were in place).In the COVID-19 context, these findings align with other research considering people's leisure behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, although the present study did not address directionality, the results align with Bu et al. (2020) findings that reading, hobbies, and listening to music were associated with improvements in mental health and well-being, whereas watching TV and following the news on COVID-19 were associated with declines in mental health and well-being. Moreover, our findings broadly support previous research that has linked TV watching with lower levels of happiness/life satisfaction, while music listening is related to higher life satisfaction (e.g., Frey and Benesch, 2008) . While the present data cannot disentangle the reasons for the difference in associations with life satisfaction between music listening and TV watching (streaming), one might speculate as to whether it has to do with the level of user control. Previous research has indicated FIGURE 5 | The trend of time spent using social media across six 2-week assessment occasions with the initial assessment reflective of ""everyday life prior to any lifestyle changes due to COVID-19.""TABLE 3 | Multilevel model regression estimates for testing between-and within-person associations between life satisfaction and time spent listening to music, playing video/computer games, watching TV/movies/streaming videos, and using social media. that listening to music is a relatively active (rather than passive) activity and that greater individual control over what is heard is linked to more positive outcomes (e.g., Krause et al., 2014 Krause et al., , 2015 . Work on social media use (e.g., Verduyn et al., 2015) has also shown that passive use (rather than active use) is associated with declines in well-being. Thus, it is possible that music listening involves higher levels of individual input than watching TV, which may be associated with positive outcomes. An awareness of the associations between media use and life satisfaction may be useful in informing guidelines around leisure and well-being during COVID-19, as well as during other periods of social lockdown . People often interact with media as a coping strategy. Thus, understanding the associations between common media interactions, employed as coping strategies, on life satisfaction has implications for assisting people in modifying their leisure behaviors. This pertains to everyday life, but also is especially important relative to experiences of social isolation and loneliness, prominent during COVID-19. As feelings of loneliness can negatively impact people choosing healthy coping behaviors (Moore and March, 2020) , the present findings demonstrate that not all media use aligns with positive well-being outcomes. Despite being unable to establish causation from our findings, it is possible that music listening might be an adaptive coping strategy during times of social isolation. It is interesting to consider this in light of recent work highlighting how listening to music may reduce loneliness and act as a social surrogate (Krause, 2020; Schaäfer and Eerola, 2020; Schaäfer et al., 2020) . While individuals seek comfort and company by engaging in both music listening and TV watching, music listening evokes memories and is used to temporarily satisfy needs for social relatedness (Schaäfer and Eerola, 2020). As Schaäfer and Eerola (2020) noted, when people want to connect with specific people, they turn to music rather than TV. Given that the COVID-19 virus affected people's isolation and interaction, it is possible that even private music listening could convey the presence of other people, thereby acting as a social surrogate. Lyrics of popular music, for instance, typically involve singers speaking about themselves or to ""you""-such narration may create ""conversation"" between singer and listener.The current findings, in alignment with other work on the benefits of music listening for well-being, support music listening as a potential strategy to improve life satisfaction. Music is widely available, low cost, and enjoyed by a large majority of the population (Schäfer et al., 2013) . Taking advantage of these benefits is especially crucial for vulnerable groups, such as students-there is growing evidence that university students report many barriers to seeking help with mental health concerns (Gulliver et al., 2010; Son et al., 2020) . It may be beneficial, then, to explore the benefits of music therapy or music listening for students during periods of social isolation and hardship. Phone applications that use music to support mindfulness and well-being may be important to promote during such times. Additional future research might consider how best to embed music listening into existing mental health interventions (de Witte et al., 2020) .The current study is not without limitations. Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that the sample draws on university students and that these students resided in only one area of Australia during the pandemic limiting the study's generalizability. One strength of the repeated measures design was that participants' responses were captured over a period of time aligned with changes to COVID-19 restrictions. Although as noted in the section ""Materials and Methods, "" it was still limited to only one period of COVID-19's global timeline, which contextualizes the findings. Moreover, it must be acknowledged that the pre-COVID-19 data is based on recall rather than direct experience and that only around half of the sample completed measures at five or six time points. Secondly, the online data collection methods capitalized on self-report, Likertscale and sliding scale responses. In this way, the data are limited as the method did not capture variations between each assessment period (such that the entire period was not captured) or allow participants to qualify their experiences. Nonetheless, administering the study online was ideal for rapidly responding to COVID-19 with samples from cyber-connected nations, like Australia (van Agteren et al., 2020) .Future research is needed to deepen the level of detail concerning the use of media-based leisure activities as a coping mechanism in everyday life, and during crises like the COVID-19. Data collection methods that permit monitoring of actual media usage, other longitudinal methodologies (e.g., diaries, experience sampling), real-time assessment (e.g., eventcontingent assessments) and mixed-methods approaches would facilitate such efforts. Further, the current study did not include measures of participants' mood, health, or well-being, which might influence people's leisure and media engagement as well as their level of life satisfaction. Other variables could additionally be considered; for instance, it would be interesting to consider people's living situation (e.g., the number of people residing in the home) as well as how leisure and media use might relate to social interaction and feelings of both loneliness and isolation. This is especially important given the use of digital technologies can bridge physical distance (Galea et al., 2020) , making it likely that greater use of digital technologies will continue given social distancing and lockdown measures are still in place.Future work could probe relationships between coping mechanisms (and motivations) and stressors. It would be interesting to consider how media use motivations might map onto the perceived functions and consequences of the media use. With such work, it would also be fruitful to further interrogate media preferences, access, and use. For instance, demarcating the use of different technologies to engage in these mediabased leisure activities (e.g., listening to music via mobile phone collection vs. streaming music videos on YouTube) may address the role of contextual elements of people's leisure experiences such as the level of user input and control. In addition, it would be important to consider long-term stress and trauma at later phases in pandemics (Son et al., 2020) . Informed by findings concerning time use and well-being, longitudinal research that spans later, ""recovery"" phases of the pandemic would afford opportunities to capture ""both risk and resilience mechanisms"" (Dvorsky et al., 2020) . This is especially important because the COVID-19 pandemic is still a global concern, and, additionally,we are yet to see the ""full aftermath"" of both the physical and mental health problems brought on by the virus (Amaya and Melnyk, 2020, p. 7) . As Amaya and Melnyk (2020, p. 7) stated, ""there is likely to be a tsunami of these issues stemming from the pandemic."" With little doubt that COVID-19 will continue to have a major impact (Dvorsky et al., 2020) , this research lends to the broader body of work that works to consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's well-being and life satisfaction.The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because ethical approval for this project was granted on the basis that participants would explicitly consent to the possible re-use of their data by the researchers, but ethical clearance was not obtained for the sharing of the collected data.

e097a3194d097a68750a4fced03d6d96ed2a2639,Reduction in Ophthalmic Presentations to Australian Emergency Departments During the COVID-19 Period: Are We Seeing the Full Picture?,"In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have taken extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of disease and ensure safety of the general population. In many cases, these measures have included lockdowns, with forced closures of businesses, schools and other public venues, and restrictions on movement and gathering of people. In the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, legislation in the form of Public Health Orders was introduced between March 18 and 26, 2020 requiring: closure of many businesses including bars, clubs, restaurants, cinemas, places of worship, gyms etc; prohibition of nonessential gatherings of more than 100 people and prohibition of gatherings with less than four square meters of space per person. 1, 2 On March 29, 2020, further Public Health Orders were introduced limiting people leaving home other than for work, study, shopping, access to medical care or exercise. 1, 2 In addition to legislation, Australian Government public health messaging encouraged high risk groups including people over the age of 70 years, those with chronic medical conditions and, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to specifically stay at home where possible. 3 In NSW, lockdown measures were somewhat relaxed on June 1, 2020 with reopening of businesses including pubs, clubs, cafes, restaurants, and museums, lifting of restrictions on the general population for leaving home or intrastate travel (eg the population was allowed to travel to regional areas for holidays etc). 4 In preparation for surges of COVID-19 patients, emergency departments (EDs) in many countries increased their patient capacities. Despite increased capacities, many EDs have reported changing patterns of presentations of non-COVID-19 pathologies. 5, 6 While reductions in some acute presentations have been seen (eg infectious diseases), decreases in certain high acuity presentations such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stroke have also been reported. [5] [6] [7] A retrospective analysis from Italy of 547 patients revealed a significant reduction in patients admitted with ACS during February and March 2020 (13.3 per day) when compared to the same time period in 2019 (18.9 per day). 5 Another example is that of Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in northern Italy where stroke presentations in February and March 2020 averaged approximately six cases a month compared to an average of 51 presentations per month over the same period in 2019. 6 Similar patterns, if observed for time-sensitive, vision threatening ophthalmic presentations, will be important for guiding public health messaging on timely presentation for emergency treatment, and for informing requirements for and importance of providing continuity of ophthalmic care in the current and future pandemics. Understanding how presentation patterns change in the post-lockdown period, particularly how quickly presentation patterns return to normal and whether any surges in non-COVID pathologies occur, will also be important for public health policy planning.The aims of this study were to examine changing patterns of presentations of ophthalmic presentations to EDs during the lockdowns associated with first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Australian context, and the changing patterns of ophthalmic presentations to EDs as these lockdowns were lifted.NSW is the most populous state in Australia with almost a third of the nation's population (8, 129 ,000 of 25,522,200 people as of December 2019). 8 Within NSW is the Western Sydney Local Health District, a publicly funded metropolitan health network with a 1925-inpatient capacity over four hospitals (each with EDs) serving a catchment population of over 950,000 people. It is NSW's second largest health network by catchment population and is forecast to become the largest by 2021. 9 Within the Western Sydney Local Health District and Westmead Hospital is the Westmead Eye Clinic, a quaternary referral ophthalmology unit that serves a broader catchment population of 3,000,000 people, providing over 30,000 patient consultations per year.To explore changing patterns of presentations of emergent ophthalmic presentations to the district's EDs and by extension the Westmead Eye Clinic during Australia's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we retrospectively audited triage coding using the NSW Ministry of Health ED Presenting Problem Code Set (EDPPCS), a code set based on SNOMED CT terminology, 10, 11 International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, Australian modification (ICD-10-AM) final diagnosis coding, and separations data for ED presentations to the four hospitals within the Western Sydney Local Health District. Data from March 29 to May 31 in 2019 and 2020 (the COVID-19 lockdown period and corresponding period of the previous year), and from June 1 to July 31, 2019 and 2020 (the post-lockdown period and corresponding period of the previous year) was audited. All patients seen during the period were included in the audit, with no exclusions.The number of ophthalmic presentations triaged per day (EDPPCS specifying an eye complaint) and number of seven common and/or time-sensitive, vision threatening ophthalmic diagnoses (ICD-10-AM diagnosis) were further examined. These diagnoses were atraumatic retinal detachment, keratitis, glaucoma, uveitis, eye trauma, conjunctivitis, and eye pain (not resulting in another submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comClinical Ophthalmology 2021:15 diagnosis). These diagnoses were selected as they have been reported internationally (atraumatic retinal detachment, uveitis, eye trauma), 12 they were among most common ophthalmic diagnoses seen in our EDs-eye trauma, eye pain (not resulting in another diagnoses), conjunctivitis-or they did not fall in those categories but were potentially vision threatening without timely treatment (keratitis).Differences in mean daily presentation numbers for the total number of presentations and for each diagnosis during the COVID-19 lockdowns and post-lockdown period were assessed with non-paired Student's t-test with Bonferroni correction. All data analysis was performed in Excel (Microsoft). This study was approved by the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee as a quality assurance project and was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.Overall, total ophthalmic presentations per day between March 29 and May 31, 2020 (the lockdown period) fell by 16% compared to the corresponding period in 2019 (13.0 ± 4.0 in 2019 vs 10.8 ± 3.3 in 2020, mean ± standard deviation; difference −2.1 presentations per day; 95% confidence interval: −1.6 to −0.5, p=0.01). This fall was reflected across the acuities of presentation (as measured by triage categories) and final dispositions. In particular, there was a dramatic decrease in patients who did not wait to be seen (down 80%, p<0.01) ( Table 1) . Seven common and/or time-sensitive, vision threatening presentations were examined further (Figure 1 ). There was a significant decrease in presentations of atraumatic retinal detachment, conjunctivitis, and eye pain (not resulting in another diagnosis). While average daily presentations with diagnoses of glaucoma, eye trauma and uveitis were higher in 2020 compared to 2019, the differences were not statistically significant. Our audit has demonstrated that during the lockdowns associated with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, there was a fall in the total number of daily ophthalmic presentations to EDs compared to the previous year. In particular, there was a decrease in the number of presentations with atraumatic retinal detachments, conjunctivitis, and eye pain (not resulting in another diagnosis). In the two months following easing of lockdown restrictions, the total number of daily ophthalmic presentations to EDs returned to the same levels as the previous year.Incidences of the presentations described with year-onyear declines may have truly fallen. For example, social distancing may have limited spread of infectious conjunctivitis. Reductions in presentations of atraumatic retinal detachments and eye pain, however, are harder to explain and may reflect issues beyond decreased incidence.In the worst case, reductions in presentations of atraumatic retinal detachments and eye pain may represent delays in patients seeking appropriate medical attention for symptoms of visual loss/dysfunction. Suspension/closure of outpatient clinics, elective procedures, non-urgent clinical care, and primary care provision has affected access for patients in health care settings globally. 13, 14 In the case of urgent/emergent ophthalmic care, reduced access to primary care facilities such as optometrists and general practitioners may have further exacerbated issues around access to service as many patients are familiar with initially seeking advice from primary care practitioners as a pathway to specialist care. 12 This may have been further compounded by the general public's anxiety and the stigma associated with presenting to a hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. 15 Volumes of keratitis, glaucoma, eye trauma and uveitis presentations during the COVID-19 lockdown period were not significantly different to the preceding year. Considering the widespread reduction in outpatient ophthalmic services however, this may also indicate a failure to seek appropriate medical attention as increase in these types of presentations to EDs would be expected if other outpatient services were not available. Interestingly, there was no increase in presentation of any condition, which might have been expected due to decreased non-urgent follow-ups/treatment in the community or delayed non-urgent surgery. 16 Our findings in terms of decreased total ophthalmic presentations in the Australian context reflect findings seen in the UK but to a lesser degree. In our study, the number of ophthalmic presentations per day over the lockdown period decreased 16% compared to the preceding year. At the primary campus of Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, UK, total attendances to their accident and emergency department and their emergency telehealth service for the period March 15 to April 25, 2020 fell 60% compared to the previous year. 12 The lesser degree to which presentations have fallen in the Australian context may be a reflection in the difference in the impact of COVID-19 in Australia vs the UK. Early in the pandemic, the UK was one of the hardest hit nations, with shortages of personal protective equipment, high daily death rates and, surging intensive care unit demand, [17] [18] [19] In comparison, Australia achieved relatively rapid control of disease spread and thus potentially lower levels of public anxiety and suspension of normal medical services. 1 In terms of reduction in the number of retinal detachment presentations, our findings also reflect those from recent reports from the UK. In our study, the number of retinal detachment presentations per day over the COVID-19 lockdown period fell 80% compared to the preceding year. In the period of March to April 2020, the Moorfields Eye Hospital saw a 62% drop in the average number of retinal detachment operations performed per week. 12 Similarly, across all vitreoretinal units in Scotland, a 55% decrease in the number of retinal detachments was seen in the five weeks following introduction of lockdowns (March 25, 2020 to April 29, 2020) compared to the average of the four five-week periods (excluding Christmas and New Year) leading up to March 25, 2020. 20 These changes may reflect issues beyond decreased incidence as outlined.Delayed access to appropriate care due to COVID-19 will likely have long-lasting impacts. 15 For example, a recent report across all vitreoretinal units in Scotland found a decrease in the proportion of retinal detachments that are macula-on at presentation from 44.2% in the pre-COVID lockdown period to 34.9% following COVID-19 lockdowns. 20 As the visual outcomes of macula-on retinal detachments are superior to macula-off, this is likely to represent a significant ongoing burden of disease. 21, 22 This study has several limitations. Firstly, as ICD-10-AM coding data was used, there is a potential for coding errors, eg due to coder training, variance in electronic record keeping, and/or misspecification. 23 In this study, however, these errors are unlikely to have substantially affected the findings of our study for two main reasons: one, we have a team of submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comClinical Ophthalmology 2021:15 professionally trained coders in our hospitals and, two, the rate of errors is likely to be similar between periods. Secondly, due to this study's focus on ED presentations and diagnoses, it may not accurately reflect the true diagnoses patients have had following specialist review, ie any changes in diagnoses following a patient's discharge from ED (particularly if they were discharged to the Eye Clinic for input, the final diagnosis would not be reflected in the study data). Finally, as the study was focused on a group of hospitals within a geographically focused metropolitan health-care network, there is a limitation on its validity to the rural Australian context.There are, however, some strengths to this study. Firstly, it is a multicenter study including all sites of one of the largest health-care networks in Australia, thus increasing its validity to the broader metropolitan Australian context. Secondly, by capturing and studying a period of lockdown easing, this study provides an indication of expected returns of presentation patterns in the post-lockdown period. This will be valuable to services planning their post-COVID recovery strategies.COVID-19 has profoundly affected health-care delivery globally. Our analysis shows concerning year-on-year reduction in total ophthalmic presentations and selected vision threatening diagnoses in the Australian context. These may represent delays in patients seeking appropriate medical attention and may have implications on patient morbidity long after the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies of patients presenting to ophthalmic services as they reopen will be required to fully appreciate the lasting implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.",Australia,abstract,2021-01-29,01
cb606bf3dbf961379e3d7f7f540067e74a657a7b,"Does High Public Trust Amplify Compliance with Stringent COVID-19 Government Health Guidelines? A Multi-country Analysis Using Data from 102,627 Individuals","Compliance to public health policies and regulations is critical to people's health, particularly in the time of an infectious disease crisis such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To contain the spread of COVID-19, governments around the world have implemented a variety of movement restrictions and quarantine measures as well as issued public health recommendations. However, the effectiveness of the government response to the pandemic largely depends on the level of citizens' compliance in following public health advice, especially while pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines are still under development or not widely available.Adherence to the recommended government health guidelines (eg preventative measures such as social distancing, avoidance of mass gatherings, usage of masks and better hygiene practices) is critical to arrest the rapid growth of COVID-19 spread and avoid stringent lockdown, as well as associated economic and health costs. Higher compliance levels also help health systems to cope with increasing demand for health services, which is particularly relevant to the countries with weaker health systems and lower health-care capacity. However, despite the various preventative measures and public health regulations that have been implemented and largely standardized around the world, the compliance levels between and within countries differ significantly. Thus, understanding what drives this heterogeneity in compliance is essential to the success of the policy interventions and public health strategy.Previous research on compliance during this and past infectious disease epidemics show that individuals who have a high perception of risks of being infected and experience negative health consequences are more likely to comply with government restrictions and public health guidelines. 1, 2 In addition, societal response and adherence to regulations and public health guidelines are often dependent on the level of public trust in government and its institutions. [3] [4] [5] [6] This is not surprising as public trust is central to the legitimacy of government's decisions, 7, 8 especially in cases when the individual liberties (eg lockdowns, curfews, travel movements) are restricted in order to protect society and manage the health crisis more effectively. In this regard, the literature suggests that trusting residents who are more likely to accept the government's decisions and follow public health guidelines better than distrusting individuals. 4, 9 The recent outbreak of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018-2019 provides a vivid example of how a broad environment of distrust makes it difficult to combat the spread of the disease due to poor compliance despite the availability of vaccines and significant international and local efforts. 10 The widespread belief in misinformation about Ebola virus disease and low levels of trust in government institutions were strongly associated with limited effectiveness of public health response such as compliance with social and behavioral recommendations, refusal to seek medical care and acceptance of vaccines. 10 Emerging empirical evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic also supports this positive relationship between trust in government measures and compliance levels, showing the importance of high trust levels in achieving success with public health interventions. 3, 5, 11 Differential compliance may also be driven by the stringency measures and how individuals and companies perceive the costs and benefits of following government policies. For example, public health recommendations of wearing masks, following frequent hand washing practices and maintaining social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic do not impose high costs on individuals. They are likely to be complied with, while stay-at-home orders and mobility restrictions carry a more significant burden on the public, especially in developing countries where economic and health resilience is mostly constrained. Yet, prolonged stringent government restrictive measures are challenging to maintain as defiance and resistance to restrictions can build up, and evidence-based justification and transparent communication become critical to convincing citizens to continue to comply. The impact of stringency on compliance may also be compounded by the level of trust in government-due to the people's belief as to whether the governors are acting in the best interest of the governedand the high public trust possibly reinforces compliance behavior in response to the rising level of restrictions.There has been a growing debate as to whether the character of the political regime has a role to play in how effective the government is in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. 5, 12, 13 Despite their differences, all political systems have legal frameworks for delegation of discretionary authority to executive branches of power during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the functionality of the political apparatus in autocracies and democracies differs, with democracies having a mechanism for checks and balances translating into accountability of those in power. Thus, there is a question of whether authoritarian regimes, with fewer limitations on power, have a higher capacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and whether the adherence to government health guidelines is modified by the public trust in government differently compared with democratic countries.This study aims to investigate the effect of the stringency of government policies on citizen's compliance and whether the public trust levels amplify this impact on compliance. We will also explore how this effect may vary across the country's political regimes. Furthermore, we hypothesized that high public trust is positively related to compliance with stringent government health guidelines, and people living in countries with a nondemocratic regime have increased adherence to strict government policies. We used data from multiple sources in this study. Firstly, we used a large-scale publicly available survey on COVID-19 14, 15 attitudes and behavioral measures to examine the connection between public trust and individual compliance to government pandemic policies. The survey was conducted during the first wave of the global spread of COVID-19 between March 20, 2020 and April 7, 2020. Details on data collection techniques and survey instruments have been previously described in Fetzer et al. 14, 15 Although the survey consisted of more than 111,000 people from 177 countries, we restricted our analysis to observations from only 58 countries with at least 200 participants. Table 1 present the summary characteristics of the 102,627 observations included in this study.Secondly, we obtained data on COVID-19 government response policies and measures of the strictness of restrictions on people's behavior from the Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker (OxCGRT). 16 These data allow us to examine the effect of the stringency of government policies on citizen's compliance and whether the public trust levels amplify this impact on compliance. The stringency index comprises information on the level of public information campaigns and implemented closures and containment policies with respect to schools, workplaces, public events, gatherings, public transport, stay-at-home requirements, internal movements, and international travel. The index has a 0-100 range with higher values representing higher stringency of health guidelines implemented. The OxCGRT data and details on the index calculation are described in Hale et al. 16 The OxCGRT country-by-day panel is combined with the survey data based on the date when an individual completed the survey and thus reflecting the restrictions and policy environment at that time.To measure our primary outcome variable-compliance with government restrictions and public health guidelineswe use five questions relating to protective behavior exercised in the past week: (1) stayed at home; (2) not attended social gatherings; (3) kept a two-meter distance from other people; (4) if had symptoms of sickness, would have informed people around; and (5) washed hands more frequently than a month ago. Each of these questions was asked on a scale 0 to 100, where ""0"" meant the statement did not apply at all and ""100"" applied very much. The perception of public trust was measured by asking the respondents to rate the following questions using a five-point Likert scale with (1) how much they trust their country's government to take care of citizens, and (2) how factually truthful they think the government has been about the coronavirus outbreak. We coded the answers to these questions as indicators with ""1"" being assigned if a person reported some or strong level of trust or truthfulness, and ""0"" otherwise.To estimate the effects of public trust and stringency on people's compliance level, we used linear regression models and exploited individual and daily variations in country-level stringency of government public health guidelines. We assumed that each observation is independent and treated daily samples as ordinary cross-sectional data. However, we needed to control the effect of timeand country-level variability on the dependent variable of interest (compliance level). Our baseline model specification is given by:where y itc is the compliance index calculated for an individual i at day t from country c. Trust itc and Stringency tc represents public trust in government of the individual and stringency index, respectively. We test the amplifying effects of public trust by examining the coefficient α 3 for the interaction of trust variable and the stringency index. We also include in our regression models the vector x itc which represents demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors. Previous research on people's compliance with government restrictions during epidemics showed that females and older individuals respected preventative measures more than other groups. 3, 11 We also included a cohort of time Time t ð Þ and country Country c ð Þ fixed effects to account for the potential unobserved differences in compliance between countries and across time and u itc denotes an error term. Lastly, we examined how the dynamics between public trust, the stringency of restrictions and policy compliance change with respect to political regimes by performing subsample analyses for democracies, anocracies, and autocracies. Our main regression models are estimated using analytical weights in order to improve the representativeness of the sample at the country level. The weights are based on the participant's gender, age, income level, and years of education, see Fetzer et al 14 for more details on the construction of the weights. Standard errors were clustered at the country level to accommodate potential within-country correlation structure for the errors. Table 1 reports the summary statistics for the compliance index (our outcome variable) by trust, socioeconomic, demographic variables and regime. This preliminary analysis shows that there are statistically significant differences in means of compliance across all characteristics, making them important to include as controls in the regression analysis. For our public trust variables of interest, individuals with high trust in government and those who believe that the government has been truthful about the COVID-19 pandemic have on average higher compliance level. Shown by the correlation between stringency and compliance indices, imposing stricter government regulations corresponds to more responsible behavior. Compliance is also higher on average for females, people with higher income, and in better health. Countries with autocratic and democratic regimes showed higher compliance index on average than anocracies (Table 1 and Figure S1 ). Table 2 presents the results of the four regression model specifications. In models 1 and 3, we examine the effects of public trust in government and perceived truthfulness of the government, respectively on compliance. In contrast, in models 2 and 4, we include interaction terms between the stringency index and public trust variables to examine the amplifying effects of public trust with respect to stringency on compliance. Across all models, we find that the effect of stringency of the government restrictions is statistically significant and the imposing of stricter government regulations leads to higher compliance level. For example, mandating the cancellation of public events accounts for an increase in the stringency index by 11 points. This policy change translates to an increase in the predicted compliance level by 1.8 points if the coefficient for the stringency index of 0.162 in models 1 and 3 is used. The magnitude of the 1.8-point increase in compliance index is not trivial and is similar to a person moving from the lowest to the highest income quartile.In models 1 and 3, the effects of trust in government and truthfulness on compliance, although they showed positive relationship, are statistically insignificant. However, demographic and socioeconomic control variables are generally statistically significant across the models and point in the expected direction with females, older adults, more educated and wealthier individuals reporting higher compliance levels.In models 2 and 4, the results suggest that whether individuals exhibit low or high public trust makes a difference in the effectiveness of stringency level on compliance. We found that the impact of stringency on compliance was reinforced by the higher levels of public trust in government and government truthfulness, respectively. Using the Wald test, we also show that including interaction terms in models 2 and 4 significantly improves the fit of the models in comparison to models 1 and 3. Figure 1A and 1C shows that the marginal impact of stringency has a greater effect on compliance for individuals with high trust. The slope of the regression line for the high trust group is 0.222 (95%CI: 0.155-0.289] and is almost twice that of the low trust group 0.117 (95%CI: 0.065-0.170). Figure 1B and 1D provides important evidence that these differences between low and high trust groups are only statistically significant at the low and high stringency levels as the slopes for high and low trust groups intersect. Thus, the predicted compliance for the high trust in government group is higher than for the low trust in government group at stringency values of 75 and above. In comparison, the compliance is higher for the low trust group at the stringency index of 40 and below. A similar pattern of interaction effects is also present for the government truthfulness variable.The results in Table 3 suggest that the effect of public trust in government in autocracy regimes on people's compliance increases with an increase in stringency level of restrictive government measures. The high trust group in Figure 2A consistently shows higher values than the low trust group across the range of stringency values. The differences in average marginal effects (AMEs) between high and low trust groups in Figure 2B are statistically significant and increase with stringency from 3.2 to 5.3 points in predicted compliance. This amplification of stringency effect on compliance due to the trust in government is not trivial considering that the impact of being a female (one of the common predictors found in the literature) is associated with 1.8-2.0 increase in compliance.For democratic countries, Table 3 and Figure 2E and 2F suggest that public trust compounds the effect of strict restrictions on compliance. Similar to the main results in Table 2 , low trust individuals show higher predicted compliance when the policies are less restrictive than the high trust group. However, the reverse is true once more stringent restrictions are implemented. The results for countries who are in the middle of the political regime spectrum (ie anocracies), the impact of stringency index on compliance is not heterogeneous with respect to the trust in government variable (see Figure 2C and 2D).The high burden associated with the highly contagious COVID-19 disease cannot be overemphasized; there is a benefit when the public complies with public health guidelines. However, policy compliance is not without cost. Stringent restrictions, such as lockdown orders and school closures, may bring not only work but also social life disruptions that affect people's mental health [17] [18] [19] and negative economic and financial consequences on micro and macro levels. 20, 21 Previous studies have shown the importance of public trust on the effectiveness of government restrictions. 22 We contribute to the literature by providing empirical evidence that an increase in public trust during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic significantly amplifies citizen's compliance with an increased level of government stringent public health policies. The impact of strict measures on compliance is twice as large for individuals with high trust in government than for those with low trust; however, when governments measures are less restrictive, individuals with lower trust level are more likely to comply.We posit that this asymmetry in response could be influenced by the way individuals view the merits of the restrictions conditional on their underlying trust attitudes towards government and its institutions. In the situation of high uncertainty, especially during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, the higher the predicted compliance at low levels of restrictions by people with low trust is not surprising. This can be potentially viewed as a self-protective behavior in response to the perception that the government is not implementing a suitable level of restrictions or has not been truthful with them about COVID-19. Conversely, if an individual generally believes that the government acts in the best interests of the people, the compliance to the restrictions is likely to be positively reinforced.Public distrust in government may lead to a lower level of compliance with government measures and thus, unsuccessful public health interventions. 3, 5, 11, 23 For example, Goldstein and Wiedemann 5 reported that higher political and social trust measures are associated with improvements in compliance with stay-at-home orders in the US. The authors underscored the importance of trust in state capacity and the different levels of trust resulting in asymmetrical compliance, compounded by partisanship behavior. 5 In Nigeria, large-scale political distrust due to corruption was said to undermine public adherence to government COVID-19 policies. 23 A study by Lalot et al revealed that absence of concern and trust significantly reduce people's compliance with restrictive government measures put in place in Italian and French cities. 24 This is also consistent with the findings among young Swiss adults. 25 Furthermore, in situations when the majority of the population comply with government restrictions and public health advice, the created public good and incentives will extend to free-riders as well. In other words, some individuals (noncompliers) enjoy the benefits of public health practices without respecting them. As in other free-riding problems, the prolonged noncompliance reduces the benefits of cooperative behaviors of the compliers, and in the case of epidemics, leads to a spike in new infections. To mitigate this problem, governments can penalise noncompliers, thus making the incentive to Our analysis also revealed that compliance is higher for females, elderly and people with higher income and in better health. Previous research on people's compliance with government restrictions during epidemics showed that females and elderly respected preventative measures more than other groups. 3, 11, 26 Perhaps the fear of being infected incentivizes individuals, especially those who are vulnerable, to change their behavior and comply with public health advice. 1,2 As the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 is the highest for older adults, 27,28 it is not surprising to find that this group has been associated with greater compliance and the incremental increase in compliance across a broad age range mirrors the evidence that the risk for severe illness and mortality from COVID-19 increases with age. Our results are consistent with findings from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of young adults conducted during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland revealed that younger adults were less likely to comply with Swiss government public health guidelines. 25 We also found these dynamics between public trust, the stringency of restrictions, and policy compliance to be heterogeneous between political regimes. In democracies, people who have high trust in the government have lower infection avoidance behavior when the government does not call for it, whereas they have higher infection avoidance behavior when the government does call for it. This is not true in autocracies or anocracies, in which government-trusting individuals always tend to have higher infection avoidance behaviors. Perhaps this suggests greater reliance and trust in both low-risk messages and highrisk messages from the government in democracies.This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, it was based on survey data sets conducted during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there could be an overrepresentation of individuals who were likely more concerned with the spread of the disease. Secondly, there are response bias concerns, particularly social desirability bias, which might have led to the underreporting of noncompliance behavior. However, this might be less of a problem as individuals self-completed the questionnaire anonymously and via an online channel which helps to elicit true preferences and answers. 29 In summary, we have shown how important it is for a government to build and maintain public trust and citizens' cooperation in managing public health response. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought significant health and economic challenges around the world, but also provided an opportunity for governments to restore and strengthen trust at a time when it is most needed. Moreover, as the number of new infections stabilizes, public trust will be among the crucial factors for recovery on the other side. Our findings indicate that public trust is strongly associated with compliance and amplifies the impact of the government preventative measures. Yet, the dynamics of this amplification differs among political regimes.",Australia,first author,2021-01-26,01
d9b4ebc8b1ed2376ed0bd733854ac2ddcb3cb914,Sex bias of females in survival from cancer and infections. Is X the answer?,"One of the striking features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been the higher death rates in men even though the infection rates seem similar between men and women. 1 Similar findings were reported from Wuhan where men had 2.4 times the death rate of women 2 and in New York where press releases stated twice the death rate of men compared with women. 3 Although men had higher rates of comorbidities, these differences were not considered sufficient to explain the higher death rates and other explanations have been sort. Women are considered to have stronger immune responses against infective diseases and a higher rate of autoimmune diseases, so this has questioned whether the lower death rate may have an immune basis.A sex bias is not only seen in infections, but also in cancers where a strong sex bias in survival from cancer is well documented. 4, 5 For example, women in Australia have approximately half the death rates from melanoma as males. 6 A number of explanations have been proposed to account for these major differences in melanoma, such as higher sun exposure in males 7 and higher mutation rates 8 in melanoma from males. When stringent statistical analyses are carried out, however, female sex remains as the major contributor to longer survival. 4 Melanoma is not the only cancer to show improved survival in females and previous researchers have asked whether this may be due to differences in the sex chromosomes between male and females. In a mammoth study, Dunford and colleagues examined information in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) from 21 different tumour types from 4100 cancers. 5 They found that 6 out of 783 X chromosome genes had loss-of-function mutations with tumoursuppressive function in males but not in females. There were no similar differences in 18,055 non-X autosomal genes. Importantly, four of the six genes were known epigenetic regulators, such as KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A), KDM5C (lysine-specific demethylase 5C), ATRX (Alpha thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) and DDX3X (DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked). 5 These findings point to important differences in X chromosomes between the sexes. The Y chromosome codes mainly for genes that determine male sex, but X chromosomes are quite large and code for >800 genes many of which are involved in immune responses. 9 To equalise the number of genes between the sexes, one of the X chromosomes in females undergoes inactivation (Xi) of its genes. 10 The silencing process is, however, not perfect and between 10 and 20% of the genes on the X may be expressed in females depending on the tissue involved. It is probably of significance that failure to silence genes may be particularly high in activated lymphocytes. 11 As a result of this phenomenon, females have double expression of many genes involved in immune responses compared with males. Biologists have speculated that this is an evolutionary mechanism to protect the species by enhancing immune responses in females against harmful infections.Analysis of data in the TCGA on 458 melanoma patients revealed that KDM6A expression was strongly related to improved survival from melanoma in female patients. ATRX had prognostic significance in both sexes. Analysis of another series of 678 patients with earlier melanoma referred to as the Leeds Melanoma Cohort confirmed the association with KDM6A expression and also identified KDM5C and DDX3X as being related to improved survival. 12 Immune responses are known to be critical in survival from melanoma and the TCGA analysis allowed us to link high KDM6A to components of the immune system considered important in killing of melanoma. This was particularly so in the production of interferon γ in female patients which is a key cytokine needed by the immune system to kill cancer cells. Gene set analysis also showed downregulation of Myc and other oncogenic pathways that may have contributed to the improvement in survival. 12 These data add to a number of studies implicating KDM6A in immune responses against viral infections and in autoimmune diseases. 13 At a molecular level, KDM6A is known to have an opposing role to EZH2 (enhancer of Zeste homologue 2) in the PRC2 complex in methylation of Lys 27 on H3 histone. This role may explain some of the effects of KDM6A on the immune system in that we previously reported that EZH2 was associated with the repression of several genes associated with antigen presentation and chemokines involved in T cell responses. 14 www.nature.com/bjc Although these studies are compelling in linking KDM6A to immune responses, it is still questionable whether it has a role in immune responses against COVID-19. If this was the case, we would expect that women being treated for severe COVID-19 infections in intensive care would have lower KDM6A expression than those with infections not requiring such care. 15 We examined the RNA-seq data from blood samples of 102 COVID-19 patients. This included 38 women and 64 men, where 17 women and 34 men were admitted to intensive care unit. The analysis of KDM6A levels in the women showed that treatment in intensive care unit was associated with higher KDM6A expression (GSE157103, 15 data not shown). Although this was unexpected, it may indicate that KDM6A expression was linked to stronger responses causing higher inflammation in organs such as the lungs. No differences in KDM6A levels were detected in men irrespective of whether they were admitted to intensive care or not.Female patients with bi-allelic expression of KDM6A may induce the expression of interferon γ pathways which enhance anti-tumour immunity by recruiting immune modulatory cells (Fig. 1) . These results point to the need for a better understanding of the role of X-linked genes in immune responses and whether EZH2-mediated suppression of immune modulatory genes have a role in infections as well as in cancer. In cancers and infections that have worst outcomes in males versus females, one approach might be to target (inhibit) the EZH2 epigenetic regulator that opposes KDM6A (Fig. 1) . Another option may be to increase levels of KDM6A by administration of oestrogens. Oestrogen α receptors are expressed in practically all lymphocytes and were shown to physically interact with KDM6A to create a permissive chromatin state on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targets such as C-X-C chemokine motif receptor 4. 16 It was transactivated by ER to form a feed-forward loop. Administration of 17β-oestradiol has been suggested by others as treatment for COVID-19 infections. 17 These studies have therefore raised many questions that require more detailed study to identify how the powerful survival benefits of the X-linked epigenetic regulators might be used to improve the therapeutic outcome in patients.Ethics approval and consent to participate Written informed consent of all participants in the TCGA was obtained by the TCGA research network. Ethical approval for the studies on COVID-19 patients was obtained from the Albany Medical College Committee on research as referred to in by Overmyer et al. 15 All the studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Data availability All sources of the publicly available data used in the study are quoted in the commentary.Competing interests The authors declare no competing interests. Fig. 1 Proposed model of sex-biased role of the X-linked KDM6A gene in promoting immunity. Males harbour one X chromosome with no functional Y chromosome homologue. Hence, mutation in the X-linked epigenetic modifier KDM6A with tumour-suppressive or immunomodulatory role will probably lead to cancer or infection in males. Immune-related genes will be repressed by EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 deposition resulting in low KDM6A protein and immune evasion in male patients. In females, with two X chromosome, [one active (Xa) and one inactive (Xi)], a single mutation (m) in KDM6A is less likely to develop cancer or infections since another functional allele escapes X inactivation. Cells with high KDM6A level would be expected to demethylate H3K27me3 resulting in activation of the interferon γ pathway resulting in inactivation of natural killer (NK), dendritic or cytotoxic T cells to induce anti-tumour immunity and adaptive immunity against virus-infected cells.",Australia,first author,2021-01-19,01
97abbdbc7fca54971cf5021a4cc9e54ebcdf722b,CSF rhinorrhoea post COVID-19 swab: A case report and review of literature,"CSF leaks can be categorized based on aetiology, anatomic site, age of patient, or underlying ICP. Historically, accidental trauma from closed head injury (CHI) is the most common aetiology of CSF leaks, and they occur in approximately 1%-3% of all CHI. Traumatic CSF leaks usually begin within 48 h, and 95% of them manifest within 3 months of injury [1] .The coronavirus pandemic as of March 2020 has brought the world to a standstill. One of the pillars of management and containment of the pandemic is community testing. To date, over 9 million tests have been conducted in Australia. Of those tests conducted, less than 1% have been positive [2] . Nasopharyngeal swab is one of the 4 recognised methods of testing and most commonly instigated; others being saliva, sputum and blood [3] . The alternative upper airway testing method is bilateral deep nasal and oropharynx swab which has now become standard of practise.CSF leak post nasal swab for COVID-19 has only been reported once in the literature. The case was of a woman in a 40 s presenting with a unilateral rhinorrhoea, headache and neck stiffness post nasal swab as part of screening prior to elective surgery. The patient had a background of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and previous nasal surgery for polyp removal. The fluid was confirmed to be CSF via B-2-transferrin assay. A CT and MRI confirmed an encephalocele extending through the right ethmoid fovea into the middle meatus and a right sphenoid wing pseudo meningocele. The patient underwent endoscopic repair of CSF leak [4] .A 59 year old male presented to ED in July 2020 with unilateral rhinorrhoea present for 2 months. He previously had presented to ED in May 2020 with a runny nose from both nostrils and cough. He was sent to Liverpool hospital COVID clinic for a nasopharyngeal swab. The test was conducted by a registered nurse and it was negative. The patient represented because his flu like symptoms subsided but the rhinorrhoea from his left nostril persisted.His past medical history was significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes melitus and dyslipidaemia. He denied any history of major skull base trauma, recurrent sinusitis, meningitis or previous nasal/sinus surgery. He denied any headaches or raised ICP symptoms.Clinical exam revealed persistent nasal discharge of clear fluid on bending forward from the left nostril. The rate of fluid egress increased with valsalva.His case was discussed with the on-call ENT specialists and they requested a beta-2-transferrin as well as a CT brain and sinuses. The CT brain showed a communication between the left middle cranial fossa with the left sphenoid sinus via a defect in the lateral wall of the sella turcica with the left temporal horn being drawn through the defect Fig. 1 . His beta-2-transferrin returned as positive and the patient was referred to neurosurgery for combined management.He was promptly referred to ophthalmology for formal visual testing and fundoscopy which showed no findings consistent with raised ICP. His MRI subsequently confirmed a skull base defect in middle cranial fossa with an encephalocele herniating through it. It appeared that the temporal horn was being drawn through the defect as well Fig. 2 . He underwent a traumatic LP which showed an opening pressure of 5 cm H20 with 780 red cells and 2 white cells with a 50/50 differential for polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells there was no organisms noted on gram stain as well as extended PCR. Given the lack of raised pressure symptoms in history and exam as well as low opening pressure, the patient underwent excision of encephalocele and skull base repair endoscopically with a vascularised nasoseptal flap without any plans for permanent CSF diversion. The operative specimen resected from the sphenoid sinus contained a mixture of mature astrocytes and neurones with reactive microglia confirming the clinical diagnosis of encephalocele. The patient was discharged day 1 with oral antibiotics. He remained asymptomatic for 25 days then had recurrence of CSF leak with associated headaches. This required repeat endoscopic repair with placement of a dumbbell fat graft and instillation of a lumbar drain. The lumbar drain remained till day 4 and then removed the patient was discharged day 6 with no leak. The patient remained asymptomatic with no leak at 2 month follow up.Iatrogenic CSF leaks most commonly occur after nasal surgery with damage to the cribriform plate being the most common cause [5] .Directions for the safe collection of nasal swabs has been made available through multiple health organisations. The current recommended mode of swab collection in Australia is the bilateral deep nasal and oral swab which replaced the nasopharyngeal swab as preferred collection method on the 1st of April as per the Public health laboratory network (PLHN) guidance. The PLHN guidance was adapted from the United States Centre for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. The described method involves the patients head being tilted up and rested against a wall (CDC recommendation for head tilt is 70°) with the swab being inserted parallel to the palate to a depth of 2-3 cm until resistance is met. Prior to 1st of April the nasopharyngeal swab and oral swab was described which involved a swab being inserted parallel to the nasal floor from a line drawn from the nasal ala to the ear lobe, note no depth is specified in this case. The authors feel that improper technique where the swab is not entered parallel to the palate due to parallax error from head tilt compounded with the depth of insertion for a nasopharyngeal swab increases the risk of complications. The average distance from the nasal opening to the sphenoid ostium in cadaveric specimens was 6.2 cm and was reached at an angle of 34.3°, the average height from the palate to the anterior skull base is 4.5 cm [6] . With most of commercially available swabs exceeding these dimensions (Fig. 3A) improperly directed swabs can cause mucosal damage as well potential damage to the skull base.Encephaloceles within the sphenoid sinus (SS) are subdivided by their location into a medial, peri-sellar type and a lateral, sphenoid recess type. The lateral sphenoidal type is exceedingly rare. Congenital abnormalities of the SS are likely to occur at the fusion plane of the ossified cartilaginous precursors of the sphenoid bone during development. It acts as a weak spot of the skull base, which may lead to development of a temporal lobe encephalocele protruding into the lateral recess of the SS.In this case as in the previously documented case in the literature it is believed that the patient had a pre-existing defect and the nasal swab inserted at an incorrect angle and depth disrupted the mucosa surrounding the encephalocele causing the CSF leak.This case showcases that despite samples being obtained by medical professions, adverse events may still occur and highlights the importance of education for safe administration of nasal swabs with understanding of the nasal anatomy as well. The Public Health Laboratory Network recommendation of inserting the swab 2-3 cm or ''until resistance is met"" as well as confounding information about nasopharyngeal swab collection with head tilt may lead to increased complications, especially in specific populations (previous skull base surgery/trauma, history predisposing patient to Fig. 3 . A: Examples of some commercially available nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs with ruler as reference. 3B: Diagram depicting safe (blue triangle) as well as unsafe (red triangle) trajectories of nasal swab with corresponding angles. The average depth to the nasopharyngeal wall is 8.2 cm. The angle and depth to the sphenoid ostium is 32.5°a nd 6.2 cm respectively [7, 8] .increased risk of skull base erosion e.g. IIH). Education about safe angles and depths of insertion (Fig. 3B ) as well as an understanding of potential complications will reduce the overall risk profile of this necessary testing modality in a pandemic.This case report was compiled post informed consent from the patient about relaying clinical history and management with view of publication.

59a07c14560c94f306a76fff48be6614b274d268,,"The unpredictable and overwhelming COVID-19 pandemic has completely and radically changed our lives and lifestyle in a way comparable with the most traumatic events in history, such as a World war. With millions of people infected around the World and already thousands of deaths (Dong et al. 2020) , there is still a great uncertainty on the actual evolving of the crisis, as well as on the possible post-crisis scenarios, which depend on a number of key variables and factors (e.g. a treatment Felsenstein et al. 2020 , a vaccine Le et al. 2020 or some kind of immunity Weitz et al. 2020) . Despite the optimism enforced by the positive results recently achieved to produce a vaccine, uncertainty is probably still somehow the predominant feeling (Chater 2020) .The whole scientific community is currently committed to face the challenging situation and to provide solutions and mitigation plans as a response to the complex dynamics at different levels. Indeed, the actual impact of COVID-19 on the different aspects of life (e.g. socio-economic Bashir et al. 2020 , environmental Collivignarelli et al. 2020 and psycological Fofana et al. 2020 ) is still not completely clear. Even relatively obvious or largely predictable macro-effects, such as a huge economic recession, present great elements of uncertainty at the moment (Altig et al. 2020) . Additionally, a large number of studies have been conducted to explore the role of different factors [e.g. temperature Jamil et al. 2020 and air pollution Fattorini and Regoli (2020) ].From a more philosophical perspective, the COVID-19 drama is also a kind of stresstest for our system and, probably, an opportunity to reconsider some aspects underpinning it, as well as its sustainability (Naidoo and Fisher 2020) . However, in order to re-design the World and our lives accordingly, we should first of all fully understand them. We definitely recognise the importance of cultural factors, opinions, personal values and beliefs. At the same time, we believe that it would be valuable to understand global performance in a data-driven and relatively systematic way.In this article we focus on the pre-crisis situation by combining a number of selected global indicators to represent macro-categories that are likely to represent measures of different aspects of life: how was the World actually performing before pandemic ? We believe that answering the previously stated research question by adopting a relatively unbiased and customizable analysis framework can first of all (1) contribute to have a concise understanding of global development evolution and its priorities in the pre-pandemic period; additionally, it should (2) facilitate a better holistic understanding of the post-pandemic scenario; last but not least, (3) a similar approach can be adopted to estimate and analyse more specific aspects (e.g. global or country resilience to pandemic).Previous work and background This paper is based on the method proposed in Pileggi (2020) which adopts a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) philosophy (Ishizaka and Nemery 2013; Velasquez and Hester 2013) . That paper focuses on the method in itself, which is explained in detail and applied to a number of examples using real data. This work is conceptually different and addresses the result, as the method previously defined has been applied to concretely measure global performance from heterogeneous criteria with emphasis on sustainable development (Hopwood et al. 2005) . The idea of indices in such an area (e.g. Bravo 2014; Shaker 2018; Barrera-Roldán and Saldıvar-Valdés 2002) is a well consolidated concept. Furthermore, many studies explicitely focus on underlying correlations (e.g. Shaker 2018 Shaker , 2015 .As discussed later on in the paper, the original method has been slightly modified for this concrete application: on one side, the definition of the categories and their relation with numerical indicators has been simplified (see Sect. 3.1); on the other side, some extension has been provided in the weighting phase to better model the trade-offs existing among the different aspects considered (see Sect. 4.1). Last but not least, the interpretation of computations has been better formalised (see Sect. 5).Structure of the paper This introductory part is followed by a detailed description of the research methodology. Each of the three phases identified in the methodological section is object of one of the core sections which deal, respectively, with the selection of criteria (Sect. 3), the weighting of such criteria (Sect. 4) and the performance analysis based on the resulting computations (Sect. 5). The paper finishes with a typical conclusions and future work section.The methodology adopted in this study is summarised in concept in Fig. 1 . The target system is modelled by selecting a number of categorised indicators, which are global indicators in this study. The model also assumes weights and semantics associated with indicators and it's the input for the computational method (Pileggi 2020) . Interpretations are based on both qualitative and quantitative metrics. The three main seamless phases are briefly discussed in this section both with key design decisions, possible biases and uncertainties.Criteria selection: macro-categories and representative indicators The normal approach (adopted also in previous work (Pileggi 2020) as well as by many reputable studies and publications, such as Our World in Data) is to group the different indicators in classes which represent, therefore, an abstracted categorization of the considered indicators. It is very useful, especially considering the great availability of data, dependencies and the need to consider multiple aspects together.In the context of this work, we have defined a number of categories of interest, each one represented by one single indicator that should be chosen to effectively characterise the target category. In terms of model ( Fig. 1) , given M categories and N indicators, we are assuming N = M and cardinality 1:1. Such a simplification allows an easier weighting and modelling within the method adopted (Pileggi 2020) . We are assuming the definition of categories and the selection of representative indicators as an intrinsic bias, which is referred to as selection bias. Additionally, as the different indicators are expressed by different units and scales which don't necessarily reflect their relevance in the resulting Fig. 1 Method in concept. The target system is modelled by a number of categorised indicators and by the weights and the semantics associated. Such a model is the input for the computational method. Results are analysed by adopting qualitative and quantitative metrics system or model, we assume a second kind of bias called numerical bias. The latter will be further discussed in Sect. 3.1.Weighting Weighting the target categories or indicators is a critical step. Indeed, while indicators themselves may be considered objective measures, their weighting should reflect the different relevance/importance of the various criteria in the context of the considered system or model. Weights may be estimated in different ways. For instance, they may reflect the opinions within a given group or community, normally elicited by surveys or interviews. Alternatively, weights may be inferred by capturing input parameters by the users of tools that adopt the method (Pileggi 2020) . Either ways, to be relevant, the weighting should be based on a significant number of samples. Moreover, in general, survey/interview defines a static approach as it is based on a concrete selection of indicators. Changing indicators implies the need to re-estimate weights. Such a process is very demanding and definitely it is not agile.In this study we have adopted a more pragmatic and, at the same time, flexible approach to establish weights that are inferred by analysing reports on global priorities, issues or challenges. Although, due to the different intent and extent of the selected reports, it is not possible to define a systematic method to infer weights, this approach assures weighting according to different foci and perspectives. As proposed later on in the paper, the analysis of different reports leads to weight configurations that may vary very much from each other.Last but not least, unlike in the original method, in this work we assume finite resource for weighting to better model the trade-offs raising in a limited resource world (see Sect. 4).Computation and analysis The final step is the computation of the results based on the input as defined in the two previous phases. The computational method should support the systematic combination of heterogeneous indicators and associated semantics, measure uncertainty and biases, as well as provide a framework for the interpretation of results. Results based on the application of the original method (Pileggi 2020) with the modifications previously explained are discussed in Sect. 5.The very first logical step of the study assumes the definition of macro-categories and the consequent selection of representative indicators. Such a step is described in the following subsection, while Sect. 3.2 deals with numerical bias and its minimization.Inspired by Our World in Data, we have defined our own marco-categories (summary in Table 1 ) reflecting different aspects of life as follows:• Environment/sustainability Several indicators might represent this macro-category as either global environmental measures (e.g. temperature anomaly or CO2 emissions) or indicators in sub-categories (e.g. energy) potentially express the performance trend. In the context of this work, we consider temperature anomaly ( Index Hausmann et al. 2014) are normally understood at a country level and might be not very indicative if considered globally. The GDP represents somehow an economical model that assumes never ending growing. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global economy is expected to be much more consistent than in recent crisis (Kotz 2009 ) and to be comparable with the second World war. • Poverty/inequality We consider that the number of people living in extreme poverty (Roser and Ortiz-Ospina 2013; Ravallion 2015) is the ideal measure to properly integrate economic indicators that express a generic increasing well-being by introducing the concept of inequality. Although we recognise an intrinsic interdependency, we prefer to keep this category separated from the previous one as we want to be able to differentiate ideas and concerns related to the economic growth in itself from the others that explicitly address poverty and inequality. • Human rights/freedom By considering democracy as one of the most relevant achievements of all times, we believe that the number of people living in democracy (Roser 2013a ) may be an effective representative for human rights and, more in general, freedom. Indeed, we consider democracy as a condition necessary (although not always sufficient) to create a socio-political environment in which individual freedom and human rights are likely to be fully respected. • Violence/instability The selection of a single indicator to express violence and instability in general terms is not easy. Looking at recent happenings, we consider that measures related to terrorism ) may be a very reasonable choice. From one side, it's not always easy to understand terrorism and classify terrorist attacks according to the same criteria worldwide. However, a clear definition for terrorism and a number of unanimously recognised principles currently exist . Terrorism is normally generated by situations of war or local conflict and it definitely causes uncertainty, violence and instability.All indicators selected are based on objective measures, while others that result from perceptions or opinions (e.g. happiness Frey and Stutzer 2012) have not been included. For the numerical analysis proposed in the paper, we are considering recent years and, more concretely, the time range 2000-2015. Unfortunately, it is not possible to include in the study later years as the indicator measuring people currently living in democracy is available only up to 2015. As per previous explanations, we consider such an indicator as very relevant for the extent and the intent of this research, so we prefer to keep it and reduce the target time range. Additionally, the indicator on people living in extreme poverty is measured at a different granularity of all others, which are available by year. We have indeed adopted approximations considering the available values for the years 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015. In terms of wished trends (Table 1) , we want the temperature anomaly, people living in poverty and deaths caused by terrorism to decrease, while an increasing trend is wanted for life expectancy, people living in democracy and GDP. The actual trends in the considered time range is shown in Fig. 2 on the left. In the same figure, the contribution to global performance by considering the wished trends (Pileggi 2020 ) is shown on the right. According to this view, positive trends in the chart contributes positively to global performance. Likewise, negative trends have a negative impact on the performance.Looking at the data reported, health/demographics, economy, poverty/inequality and freedom/human rights are positively performing. On the other side, environment/sustainability and violence/instability present strongly negative performance.At a more theoretical level, the definition of a restricted number of meaningful categories in the extent and intent of the current study can be considered a kind of bias in itself. It's somehow inherent in study design.At a practical level, it is almost impossible to provide a numerically balanced set of indicators. Indeed, indicators are normally very heterogeneous, adopts their own units of measure and may present very different numerical variations. In general, the variation of a given indicator is not comparable in terms of relevance with the variation of another indicators. Therefore, numerical proportions are not semantically relevant for the purpose of the considered study, meaning that numerical variations are not necessarily proportional with the relevance in the system or model.We have represented all indicators uniformly as the percentage variation with respect to the initial state. As shown in Fig. 2 , for the considered set of indicators, the variation of deaths by terrorism is numerically much more relevant than any other. Also the temperature anomaly presents a strong pattern in this sense. However, it is not numerically comparable with the previous. As both indicators contribute potentially in a negative way on global performance, the resulting indicator framework is strongly biased (numerically) in this case and may affect the fairness of the computation.The numerical differences among the considered indicators imply the need to deal with different scales when computing the different aspects together. In order to minimise numerical biases, we adopt the mechanism described in Pileggi (2020) in addition to weighting. A detailed description of such an adaptive mechanism is out of the scope of the paper. An example of the numerical bias using and not using the mechanism is reported in Fig. 3 . Once target criteria are defined, the weighting stage may result extremely subjective. The most natural way to weight criteria is probably by survey, as it is relatively simple to map weights into an opinion-based survey. In such a way, opinions from a generic public as well as opinions within defined communities may be captured and converted in a corresponding set of weights.However, capturing people's opinions in a meaningful way requires a large number of samples. Therefore, we have preferred to adopt a completely different and more pragmatic approach that aims to infer weights from the analysis of popular reports (e.g. from United Nations 1 and Global Economic Forum 2 ). On one side, the simplified approach adopted in the selection phase allows to weight categories rather than single indicators. It makes the mapping much easier. On the other side, the interpretation of certain kind of report may be subjective.In the following subsections, we first describe an extension to the reference method to better model existing trade-offs and, then, we discuss the inference of weight sets from different sources of information.The original method (Pileggi 2020) doesn't assume specific constraints for weights: the different indicators are weighted independently within a minimum value W min and a maximum value W max . Thus, any indicator i is associated with the corresponding weight W min ⩽ w i ⩽ W max , for instance in a range [0,10].That independent weighting intrinsically assumes an infinite resource model. For instance, it is possible to associate the maximum weight with all indicators ( w i = W max , ∀i ). It doesn't force decisions which should model the trade-offs existing among the different aspects of life. In order to model such trade-offs in a more effective way, we introduce a constraint for the overall weighting value, W tot = ∑ n i=1 w i ≤ nk , where n is the number of considered criteria and k is a value between W min and W max . In the context of this work we are using six different criteria ( n = 6 ) and weighting in the range [1, 10] ( 1 ≤ w i ≤ 10, ∀i ) rather than [0,10] as we want all criteria to contribute to overall performance. We consider k = 5 , which implies W tot = 30.In this sub-section we propose different weightings based on the analysis of different sources of information. As previously explained, probably such an inference cannot be completely objective. In order to minimise the impact of interpretations and biases in the analysis, for each case considered, the criteria and conclusions are explained and briefly discussed. Additionally, we have restricted the analysis to sources of information that allow a relative easy mapping. We have excluded those sources that potentially provide very good insight but are objectively hard to be converted in a clear weight set to the target criteria.A summary of the weights produced by analysing the different reports is proposed in Fig. 4 . Each case is separately analysed and explained in the remaining part of this sub-section.Weighting based on the analysis of UN Global Issues The UN Global Issues report proposes 22 different global issues. Each issue in the report can be associated to no-one, one or more than one of the categories identified in this study.According to our analysis, the category Environment/Sustainability is associated with 5 issues from the report (Atomic Energy, Climate Change, Food, Water), Health/Demography with 5 issues (Africa, Ageing, AIDS, Health, Population), Economy with no issue directly, Poverty/Inequality with 6 issues (Africa, Children, Decolonization, Ending Poverty, Food, Water), Human Rights/Freedom with 6 issues (Africa, Democracy, Gender Equality, Human Rights, International Law and Justice, Refugees) and Violence/Instability Fig. 4 Weighting based on the analysis of different sources. Each weights set is compared with an homogeneous distribution of the resources-i.e. Neutral Weighting with 2 issues (Africa, Peace&Security). Resulting weights are reported in Table 2 . As previously discussed, the minimum weight assumed is 1.Weighting based on the analysis of WEF 10 biggest global challenges (2016) The WEF 10 biggest global challenges [8] is a report with a much more economic focus. The criteria to map the 10 challenges in the report into weights are the same as in the previous case.From our analysis, Environment/Sustainability is directly related to 2 challenges (Food Security, Climate Change), Health/Demographics to 1 challenge (Healthcare), Economy to 5 challenges (Inclusive Growth, Unemployment, Financial Crisis, Global Trade, Investment Strategy), Poverty/Inequality to 2 challenges (Food Security, Inclusive Growth), Human Rights/Freedom to 1 challenge (Gender Equality) and Violence/Instability to no challenge. The resulting weighing is reported in Table 3 .Weighting based on the analysis of 10 most important global issues from The Borgen Project The Borgen Project, a nonprofit organization that is addressing poverty and hunger, has provided a list of 10 most important global issues [5] .According to our analysis of such a source, Environment/Sustainability is directly associated with 3 of the 10 issues (Climate Change, Pollution), Health/Demographics with 4 (Pollution, Security and Wellbeing, Malnourishment and Hunger, Substance Abuse), Economy with 1 (Unemployment), Poverty/Inequality with 3 (Lack of Education, Malnourishment and Hunger, Security and Wellbeing), Human Rights/Freedom with 1 (Government Corruption) and Violence/Instability with 3 (Violence, Security and Wellbeing, Terrorism). The resulting weights are reported in Table 4 .Weighting based on the analysis of Global Shapers Survey 2017 Global Shapers Survey 2017 by WEF reflects opinion of millennials. Business Insider Australia has recently provided a list of the 10 most critical problems in the World according to millennials based on the Global Shapers Survey. In order to assure uniformity and consistency with previous cases, we have considered the list of problems provided but not the relevance associated with each of them.According to our analysis, Environment/Sustainability matches with 2 problems (Food and water security, Climate change/Destruction of nature), Health/Demographics with 1 (Safety/Security/Wellbeing), Economy with 1 (Lack of economic opportunity and unemployment), Poverty/Inequality with 4 (Lack of education, Food and water security, Poverty, Inequality), Human Rights/Freedom with 1 (Government accountability and transparency/ Corruption) and Violence/Instability with 3 (Safety/Security/Wellbeing, Religious conflicts, Large scale conflict/Wars ). Weights are reported in Table 5 .Performance analysis is based on two main metrics as follows:• Score This is the primary metric for analysis and it is based uniquely on the absolute performance according to computations (Pileggi 2020) : positive scores are associated with positive performance, as well as negative scores correspond to negative performance. • Interpretation It is a relative metric defined by comparing the score of a given computation with the corresponding neutral computation, which assumes fair weighting (Pileggi 2020) . In qualitative terms, scores higher than neutral computation correspond to an optimistic interpretation, while lower scores are associated with a pessimistic interpretation.The two metrics as defined are completely independent as all qualitative combinations of the two metrics (positive/optimistic, positive/pessimistic, negative/optimistic and negative/ pessimistic) are possible.Looking at the analysis framework more holistically, two additional analysis factors may be considered:• Uncertainty In the context of this study, rather than a proper uncertainty, such a metric defines higher and lower bounds based on the potential weighting variance. Such an estimation provides a more consistent support for analysis in context. • Numerical bias Even though it is limited by the method adopted, numerical bias directly affects the absolute result. It is expressed by the neutral computation and can play a relevant role not only in the analysis phase but also when selecting criteria, as it can drive the selection of balanced set of indicators.Computations for the different weight sets are presented in Fig. 5 , while a qualitative summary of results is presented in Table 6 .Looking at Fig. 5 , the score associated with the different weight sets is represented by the blue line. Such a score is compared with the corresponding neutral computations in the charts on the left, while it is represented both with extreme computations in the charts on the right.Weights from the analysis of UN Global Issues propose a relatively balanced distribution with a priority on Poverty/Inequality, Human Rights/Freedom, Health/Demographics and Environment/Sustainability. Additionally, there is a relative low priority for Violence/Instability and no economical focus. The resulting computation shows contrasting results, including a negative performance but also an optimistic interpretation. The weight set resulting from the analysis of the 10 biggest global challenges by WEF presents a much more economic oriented focus with a significant attention also for Environment/ Average weights are reported in the last chart in Fig. 4 . As shown, the different case studies considered seem to balance each other. The average case proposes however a priority on Poverty/Inequality. Computations for the average case point out negative performance and optimistic interpretation (Fig. 6) .As expected, the priorities defined by the different weight sets play a key role in the final assessment of performance from a quantitative perspective. However, as shown, it's the contextual interpretation of such metrics that is considered the final assessment. We believe that the research framework proposed can be simple and effective to assess holistically the post-pandemic scenario, as well as to properly assess and reflect mindset and priorities changes behind the numerical estimations or measures.Looking at possible interpretations of the results, we would like to remark that the method adopted works in terms of dynamic trend rather than of static snapshot, according to a philosophy of continuous evolution of the World. Such an approach is reflected in the computation of metrics. Therefore, a positive score in a given time-frame should be understood like the World is becoming a better place rather than the World is a good place (Pileggi 2020) . 6 Conclusions and future workBy adopting a MCDA-based method, we considered 6 different macro-categories to measure global performance. The method provides a relatively fair analysis framework which allows the systematic combination of heterogeneous criteria. The weights associated with the different criteria play a key role in terms of final result. We have adopted a model that assumes finite resource in order to empathize the trade-offs existing among the different aspects considered. In order to assess global performance and, more in general, global development trends, we have considered four different case studies with a very different focus. Results show that economic-oriented priorities correspond to positive performances, while all other distributions point to a negative performance. Additionally, balanced and economy-focused distributions of weights propose an optimistic interpretation of performance regardless of the absolute score.Future work is expected to be developed in different directions. In line with the current focus, we will aim more fine grained studies at a country level. We will explore further secondary data sources to infer priorities accordingly (e.g. World Values Survey-http:// www.world value ssurv ey.org/). We will also propose and analyse in context additional case studies with a more community-oriented focus to be established by survey (e.g. Danowski and Park 2020) .The results obtained contribute to provide a concise understanding in context of the global development evolution and its underpinning priorities in the pre-pandemic period. We believe that such a dynamic snapshot can be useful to facilitate a better holistic understanding of the post-pandemic scenario that will be object of our future research. Indeed, we expect a significant mindset change triggered by the pandemic that will probably have an impact in setting priorities for a sustainable development. Last but not least, we will adopt a similar approach to estimate and analyse more specific aspects (e.g. global or country resilience to pandemic).

dec86ce8d0b273c9f2fbddd8329e7444ef6aaf80,,"The Australian lockdown commenced shortly before the author was to commence a broad investigation into the psychological wellbeing of domestic and international students in Australia. The author believed an exploration of psychological wellbeing at this time would be incomplete without direct examination of students' psychological responses to contagion.Interest in psychological responses to contagion has increased in the early 21st century in the wake of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Ebola outbreaks (World Health Organization, n.d.) . Compared to other health threats, contagion engenders fear because of its imminence (i.e., its spread is inevitable), invisibility (i.e., its presence isn't apparent), and transmissibility (i.e., it spreads easily and without discrimination; Pappas et al., 2009 ). This contagion-related fear is heightened by perceptions of the speed of transmission and exposure to contagion-related misinformation (Amin, 2020; Pappas et al., 2009) .A search of the pre-2020 literature revealed a dearth of quantitative measures of contagionrelated fear. Research emerging from the most recent comparable epidemic, the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004, mainly used semi-structured interviews and general measures of fear, trauma, and psychological wellbeing (Ho et al., 2005; Stuijfzand et al., 2020) . SARS research also tended to focus on the experiences of healthcare professionals (Ho et al., 2005;  theoretically unrelated constructs (i.e., religiosity). Convergent validity was further examined in terms of via examination of factor loadings and average variance extracted.Participants were domestic and international university students studying in Australia between 5 May 2020 and 7 June 2020, a period of nation-wide COVID-19-related selfisolation and social restriction in Australia. Data from three culturally distinct university student groups were analyzed: Australian domestic students; Indian university students studying in Australia; and Nepali university students studying in Australia. All participants were aged 18 or over and were fluent in written and spoken English as required for admission to Australian universities.The Australian group comprised 154 Australian domestic (i.e., citizens and permanent residents of Australia) university students. They ranged in age from 18-60 years with a mean age of 25.45 years (SD = 9.04). The Australian group included 99 women (64%), 50 men (32%), 3 participants who identified as non-binary (2%), and 2 participants who did not indicate their gender (2%). will be assigned to SARS wards). In the present study, the factor originally labelled 'Insecurity' was renamed 'Existential Threat' to better reflect the non-specific sense of threat to one's existence, rather than fear, described in these items.For the present study, the six items making up Ho et al.'s (2005) fear of infection and existential threat factors were retained, providing a focused, 6-item measure. Each item included the stem, The current COVID-19 pandemic makes me…; the name of the disease or outbreak can be changed as necessary. Participants responded to each item on a 4-point Likert scale, as used in the original study, where 0 = Definitely false and 3 = Definitely true.A short form of the 42-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1996) , the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) is a 21-item scale comprising three 7-item subscales measuring symptoms of depression (e.g., I felt that I had nothing to look forward to), anxiety (e.g., I felt I was close to panic), and stress (e.g., In non-clinical populations, DASS-21 total scores and subscale scores are typically at the very low end of the scoring range. DASS-21 total scores have been reported between 8.9 -11.51 (Crawford et al., 2011; Sinclair et al., 2012) . Mean subscale scores have been reported ranging from 1.57 -5.03 for Depression, 1.44 -4.51 for Anxiety, and 1.79 -7.27 for Stress (Lee, 2019; Praharso et al., 2017; Sinclair et al., 2012; Zanon et al., 2020) .The The 5 Analyses were carried out in SPSS v.26 (descriptives, normality, correlations, reliability, validity, exploratory factor analysis) and AMOS v.27 (confirmatory factor analysis).Significant Shapiro-Wilk statistics suggested all six contagion-related fear items were nonnormally distributed, however, examination of the Q-Q plots indicated all distributions werenormal. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the Australian data in SPSS v.26with Maximum Likelihood and Promax rotation. A determinant value of 0.16, greater than the required 0.00001 was obtained and, for all six items, tolerance values were greater than .2and VIF values less than 10, indicating an absence of multicollinearity (see Table 1 . The other variables reported in this study (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity) were selected prior to the emergence of the pandemic so were not chosen specifically for their proposed relationship with the contagion-related fear items.However, depression, anxiety, stress, and subjective wellbeing scores were expected to be associated with (and, thereby, demonstrate the convergent validity) contagion-related fear items as they represent negative, and in the case of subjective wellbeing, positive affective states. As religiosity is theoretically unrelated to affective state (Koenig and Bussing, 2010), it was used to demonstrate the divergent validity of the contagion-related fear items.To determine factor structure of the six contagion-related fear items, an exploratory factor analysis was carried out on the Australian group data (n = 154 All items correlated significantly with one another at ≥.3, again, with the exception of this item. Any gain in internal consistency achieved by the removal of this item would be offset by the reduction of one factor to, at best, an uninterpretable two items. For this reason, all items were retained, and the six items deemed suitable for factor analysis.The exploratory factor analysis was carried out with Maximum Likelihood extraction and Promax rotation, as recommended by Carpenter (2018) = 3.19, p = .53, and was retained for further investigation.Confirmatory factor analysis of the two-factor solution was conducted using with Maximum Likelihood extraction on the data from the Australian, Indian (n = 111; KMO = .77; Bartlett's Table 2 ). The two-factor model demonstrated excellent goodness of fit across all three groups (see Table 3 ). Multigroup CFA revealed measurement invariance across the three groups at the configural and metric levels but not at the scalar level (see Table 4 ). Table 3 . CFA goodness of fit statistics for the two-factor model in Australian, Indian and Nepali university student groups. Note: x 2 = chi square; df = degrees of freedom; CFI = comparative fit index; RMSEA = root mean square error of approximation; CI = confidence interval; Δ = change; * p < .05.Correlations for CFTS total and factor scores and the DASS-21 total and subscale scores, Subjective Wellbeing scores, and DUREL scores are shown in Table 5 .Across all three groups, mild to moderate correlations were found between the CFTS total, Fear, and Threat scores and DASS total, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scores with the exception of Fear and Anxiety and Fear and Stress in the Nepali sample. Across all groups, Subjective Wellbeing was mildly to moderately negatively associated with CFTS total and Threat scores. Subjective Wellbeing was also negatively associated with Fear in the Australian group. Across all groups, CFTS total, Fear and Threat scores were unrelated to It is notable that, across all groups, Fear scores were higher than Threat scores and Threat scores were more strongly related to DASS-21 total and subscale scores and SubjectiveWellbeing scores than were Fear scores. This may be explained by the nature of the two CFTS subscales. The object of Fear of Infection is specific and external to the self (i.e., COVID-19 infection). Existential Threat, however, has no specific object, rather it is an unanchored and subjective experience of threat to one's own existence, albeit triggered, in this case, by the COVID-19 pandemic. The moderate relationship between Threat and DASS total, Depression, Anxiety and Stress scores can be understood as capturing the subjective and non-specific character of these constructs (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1996) . Similarly, Subjective Wellbeing represents satisfaction with a range of life domains rather than a specific domain such as Standard of Living or Personal Health.As all participants were studying in Australia at the time of data collection, features specific to the Australian experience of this first wave of COVID-19 are likely to have moderated CFTS full, Fear, and Threat scores. At the time, restrictions were swiftly implemented, actively enforced, and broadly adhered to in Australia (Australian Government, 2020).Furthermore, Australian infection rates were low by global standards, all participants had access to socialised, high-quality healthcare, and the capacity of health system was not at risk of being overwhelmed (Australian Government, 2020).Futhermore, data were collected around six weeks after Australia's first wave peak of daily cases, when new infections were typically in the single digits. At that time, COVID-19 hadn't taken a hold in India and Nepal which were still weeks away from their first wave peak of daily infections (Roser et al., 2020) . So, while COVID-19 was recognized (Ho et al., 2005) as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof a significant threat in Europe and the Americas during May and June 2020, the threat was objectively less for Australian, Indian and Nepali students in Australia and their families in India and Nepal.Participant age may also have affected CFTS full, Fear, and Threat scores. In Australia, although people in their 20s (90% of the current sample) are more likely to contract the disease, people over the age of 70 are far more likely to die from the disease. Compared to older age groups, the present sample may not have perceived COVID-19 to be lifethreatening (covid19data.com.au, 2020; .The CFTS should be administered to people from a range of age groups and countries at different stages of pandemic to determine its psychometric performance across the lifespan and across pandemic waves. Translation of the CFTS is encouraged to determine whether the scalar measurement noninvariance found here is an artefact of speaking English as an additional language.Finally, the psychometrics of the English and translated CFTS should be explored alongside those of the other recently developed measures of COVID-19-related psychological responses in relation to both COVID-19 and other impending epidemics such as measles and polio (World Health Organization, 2020) . Each of these measures has been devised for a distinct purpose; it is anticipated the more COVID-focused measures will have limited usefulness beyond the current pandemic.",Australia,abstract,2021-01-27,01
d78376a3c8e4775297b274200c4b7eeb0216ccef,Is Lockdown Effective in Limiting SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic Progression?-a Cross-Country Comparative Evaluation Using Epidemiokinetic Tools,"Starting in fall 2019 in Wuhan, China, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has rapidly spread worldwide. 1 In the absence of effective antiviral therapy, social distancing, handwashing, and face covers were promoted to control SARS-CoV-2 spread. 2 However, due to increasing severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) presentations and critical care bed saturation, almost all governments decided on lockdown. 3 Lockdown, variably including stay-at-home orders, workplace restrictions, and school and venue closures, was applied on an unprecedented scale during 30-90 days then progressively released following reduction in SARS-CoV-2 spread.The risk/benefit balance of restrictions and optimal lockdown modalities to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are controversial. [4] [5] [6] As more data become available, predictive models are updated, limiting reasonable accuracy to shortterm projections and empirical fitting of data trends. 7, 8 Whereas daily numbers of COVID-19-related fatalities, critical cases, and hospital admissions are trustworthy, numbers of daily new contaminations (I), useful for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 spread, are underestimated due to limited testing.Modeling used to guide non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdown policy is based on the compartmental susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. 7, 8 Introduced in 1927, the SIR model aims to predict the number of individuals who are susceptible to the infection, are actively infected, or have recovered from infection at any given time. 9 According to their disease status, the individuals of the studied population are divided into three mutually exclusive groups determining the susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments. A susceptible individual, counted in the S compartment, may become infected following a contact with another infected individual. He is assumed to be contagious and starts to be counted Bruno Mégarbane and Fanchon Bourasset contributed equally to this work.in the I compartment until moving to a non-contagious stage named recovery (that may include effective isolation or death). Thereafter, he is counted in the R compartment.Interestingly, the SIR and derived more stochastic models share similarities with compartmental pharmacokinetic models. The SIR model structure resembles a closed threecompartmental pharmacokinetic catenary model describing drug absorption and elimination processes as the sum of an input and output function. 8 If translated to pandemic kinetics, the input function could represent the epidemic progression phase or ""infection rate"" and the output function its regression phase or ""recovery rate"". We considered that overall kinetics could be assessed by considering (I) as the best endpoint to measure the disease progression rate despite restricted testing.Although many models of infectious disease transmission in general and of SARS-CoV-2 in particular continue to utilize the basic framework of SIR, they typically incorporate additional information into their estimation of the three main SIR parameters. Our purpose was to propose a simpler model, based on fewer parameters, able to provide similarly and early accurate predictions. We aimed to compare lockdownattributed effects on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic progression in nine countries with various lockdown scenarios. Applying the analogous tools of pharmacokinetics to quantify the transmission kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 allows estimating the time-toreach the plateau and epidemic length in each country. These parameters may prove to be useful for health authorities to rapidly determine the effectiveness of the undertaken restrictions and inform the population on their expected duration.For each country, we collected 7-day interval (I) from 23 Feb 2020 to 14 Jun 2020 published by the World Health Organization (WHO; https://covid19.who.int/) and calculated the daily case rate as follows:We plotted I(t) versus time using the excretion-rate pharmacokinetic method at mid-point, 9 developed to assess the urinary drug excretion rate by considering that successive drug amounts (X u ) excreted within defined time intervals can be plotted versus time using the excretion rate (dX u /dt) at the midpoint of this time interval. This method allowed averaging the effect of sample collection variability, as observed in declared (I) with underestimated values each weekend corrected on the first-days of the following week.We fitted I(t) using equations (1+2) and used the estimated parameters to simulate the kinetics in the susceptible (S(t)) and recovered (R(t)) compartments using equations (3+4) (Fig. 1 ). Aware that (I) could be only determined by this approach once the epidemic ends, we used simple linear regressions to build S(t) at an early stage of the epidemic. We calculated the mean ± SEM of S = Ic (dayn) − Ic (dayn-1) /Ic (dayn-1) × 100 each 7-day period, where Ic represented cumulative (I). S(t) was fitted versus the mid-point time interval.Since no consensual definition of lockdown exists and since its exact content varied between the countries and along its application time, we considered the stay-at-home order decided by the government as the start of the studied exposure and the decision of stopping the main policy measures as the end of exposure.Modeling was performed using Phoenix64-WinNonlin™ (Certara, USA). All parameters of the models were estimated and not fixed to avoid any over-determination of the models. We determined the maximum rate of new cases (I max ), the maximum S at t = 0 (S 0 ), the infection (β) and recovery (γ) rate constants, the corresponding half-lives (t 1/2β = ln2/β and t 1/2γ = ln2/γ), and the basic reproduction number (R 0 = β/γ). 8 We also determined the lag-time (Tlag) as the time difference between the lockdown start-time and the input phase end-time (t i ). Criteria to evaluate the modeling included (1) fits between observed and predicted data; (2) Akaike criteria, lowered as possible to minimize the gap between estimated and observed data; (3) coefficients of variation < 30%; and (4) weighted residuals versus time plot that must be randomized above and below zero.Using the WHO's published observed (I) data, we modeled I(t) in nine different countries (Fig. 2 ). We build S(t) using simple linear regressions (Fig. 3 ). Using these estimated parameters, we simulated S(t), I(t), and R(t) curves of our SIRbased model (Fig. 4) . The kinetic parameters and model adequacy criteria with the observed data are presented in Table 1 . All criteria were satisfactory, with the majority of the coefficients of variation below or at around 30% and correlation coefficients greater than 0.9 for each modeling, showing a satisfactory congruence of the model with the observed data.Based on our models, two groups of countries could be distinguished. Sweden (no lockdown) and the USA (variable lockdown abruptly ended) (named as group 1) exhibited a prolonged plateau of infections, (terminal t 1/2β , 23 and 40 days), non-ending recovery (t 1/2γ , 112 and 179 days), and R 0 of 4.9 and 4.6, respectively. All other countries (named as group 2) showed rapid decrease in infection (t 1/2β ≤ 14 days), accelerated recovery (t 1/2γ ≤ 18 days), and R 0 ≤ 1.5. In group 2, New Zealand, France, Spain, and Germany with early-onset and progressively ended lockdown showed Tlag ≤ 15 days and t i ≤ 21 days, whereas the UK, Italy, and the Netherlands (with delayed, area-dependent, and loose lockdowns, respectively) exhibited Tlag ≥ 20 days and t i ≥ 30 days (Fig.  2) .Our findings support the effectiveness of lockdown in reducing (I) and shortening the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.Lockdown-attributed effects on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic regression can be satisfactorily modeled using pharmacokinetic principles. Our affordable epidemiokinetic method relies on the predictive power of the input function as a surveillance tool. Although underestimated due to limited testing, (I) represents an actual sample allowing the confident quantifying of SARS-CoV-2 spread irrespective of the country policy. We Figure 1 The epidemiokinetic models used to calculate the parameters of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based model adapted from Tolles and Luong (2020) . During the input phase, susceptible individuals (S) become infected (I). The infection rate constant (β) drives the input in the infected compartment. During the output phase, infected patients recover (R). The recovery rate constant (γ) drives the output from the infected compartment. I(t) (N/day) is fitted from the observed data (see Fig. 2a ). S(t) can be fitted from the observed data (S given in %; see Fig. 2b) or simulated by using Eq. (3) and parameters (S 0 (N/day) and β) estimated by fitting I(t). R(t) can be simulated by using Eq. (4) and parameters estimated by fitting I(t) from the observed data (see Fig. 2a ). used (I) as epidemic progression rate rather than an absolute dimension marker as done in epidemic surveys. This marker allows fitting I(t), estimating β and γ, and thereafter simulating S(t) and R(t) to build the SIR-based model. Our approach's strength was to allow estimating β and I max using simple linear regressions. Hence, only three points (i.e., 10 days if a 3day interval collection period is chosen) would be necessary. Our β estimates by fitting I(t) or S(t) were similar (Table 1) . Compared with the sophisticated susceptibleexposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, 11 our method allowed obtaining similar γ estimates for Spain (0.05 versus 0.04 day −1 ) and the second period in the USA (0.004 versus 0.005 day −1 ). Our approach points to some universality, suggesting that simple mean-field models are helpful to evaluate epidemic kinetics and lockdownattributed effects. Government-imposed social distancing was shown to reduce the daily case growth rate over time 12 and presumed to decrease R 0 mainly by reducing β. 8 Our findings supported that coherent lockdown strategies divided t 1/2γ by~6.2-fold and R 0 by~3.3-fold. We confirmed that lockdown alters interindividual SARS-CoV-2 transmission but showed that R 0 is preferentially steered by γ than β (~6.2-and~1.5-fold decrease in Sweden versus group 2 countries, respectively). Interestingly, despite its heterogeneity, lockdown in the USA resulted first in a~2.7-fold and~1.6-fold decrease of t 1/2β and t 1/2γ , respectively, in comparison with Sweden, suggesting that restrictions were effective. However, as suggested, 11 the abrupt deconfinement scenarios adopted later lead to a~4.8fold and~2.6-fold increase in t 1/2β and t 1/2γ , respectively, in comparison to the initial period with a pattern similar to Sweden, which deliberately chose a non-lockdown strategy. Comparing pre-order with post-order slopes, US state-level stay-at-home orders were shown to reduce confirmed case rates. 13 However, estimated cases increased in border counties in Iowa without stay-at-home order compared with Illinois with stay-at-home order. 14 Consequently, re-ascension in (I) since mid-June could be expected as actually observed in the USA and several other countries worldwide.Stringency of government responses to SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (scale, 1-100) did not predict their appropriateness or effectiveness. 10 Here, shorter Tlag and t i , attenuated I max , and shortened epidemic plateau duration were observed in countries with optimal restriction strategies, especially in New Zealand with strict border control and where the lockdown was started ≤ 1 month after the first SARS-CoV-2-infected case, whereas it started~1.5 months after the first case in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands and~2 months after the first case in the UK and USA. Our data support that early-onset lockdown with sufficient duration and progressive ending are the key determinants of effectiveness, especially since SARS-CoV-2 contagion lasts~14-20 days. Our data shows that early-onset lockdown was associated with reduced R 0 especially in New Zealand where R 0 was 1, suggesting that lockdown was efficient to totally remove the epidemic from the population. Interestingly, the more recent figures of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (October 2020) confirmed that New Zealand is also the unique country among those studied not to experience a second wave. Our findings suggest that optimal lockdown may prevent hospital saturation and limit fatalities. Stay-at-home orders effectively deviated cumulative hospitalizations for COVID-19 from their projected bestfit growth rates. 15 By analogy to pharmacology in which it is possible to calculate both absorption and elimination half-lives, our method allows estimating the time-to-reach the plateau and epidemic length in each country (e.g., 3.3-fold t 1/2β and t 1/2γ , corresponding to~90% of the case accumulation and epidemic regression, respectively). Hence, these times are prolonged in group 1 versus group 2 countries (i.e.,~100 days versus3 3 days and~1 year versus~38 days, respectively). However, caution is requested due to the tremendous amount of uncertainty surrounding what we do and do not know about this virus and since the number of susceptible people in the population is unknown and may account for uncertainty of the model. Additional conditions may also influence the epidemic progression including early use of possibly effective treatments, natural herd immunity, and population susceptibility.Our study has significant limitations. Our model accounts for smooth short-term variation in contamination reporting (e.g., for weekend-related delays), but it may less account for larger sources of variation between and within countries and over time. However, since focused on the contamination progression (slope), our approach is mildly dependent on the exact range of contaminations on condition that testing was performed in a similar manner during the whole study period in one given country. Extremely large variations have been observed between countries as well as within countries and over time in the intent of their lockdown policies, and the fidelity of implementation/ adherence by their respective residents (e.g., enforceable/ enforced mandates versus recommendations). There were also tremendous variations in other strategies intended to reduce transmission such as universal facemask wearing, quality of contract tracing, and availability of temporary housing for isolation and quarantine. We acknowledge that our simplified modeling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics did not account for all variations that are mandatory to be definitively useful for policy and practice. We also acknowledge that we did not provide direct comparisons between our simplified model and alternative more complex models regarding the relevance to , maximum S at t = 0; t i , the estimated time of the epidemic input phase; Tlag, the observed time between the lockdown start-time and the end-time of the input phase; R 0 , the basic reproduction number estimated by dividing β/γ; 9 *peak stringency score during the studied period according to the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker 10 real-world clinical or policy decisions. However, different outputs from our model (e.g., the estimated time-to-reach plateau or the epidemic length) could be used to inform a policy decision. Health authorities' decisions should almost certainly depend not only on the derivative/marginal/relative changes in the rate of transmission but also on the magnitude of transmission on an absolute scale, as possibly provided by our outputs. Noteworthy, interpreting the global transmission dynamics in the USA may be simplistic since many if not most decisions are (and should) be taken at the level of each single state. Finally, the main question to be asked of lockdown policy effectiveness is not categorical (does it work or not?) but rather a suite of more nuanced questions related to the marginal contributions to transmission reduction of various strategies and their combinations, supporting our cross-country comparative study design.To conclude, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic regression is well described by our epidemiokinetic approach. Lockdown effectiveness to reduce the infection growth rate and shorten the epidemic is better predicted by its early onset and progressive ending than its stringency. However, the optimal lockdown strategy able to reduce demand on healthcare utilization and fatalities remains to be determined.",New Zealand,abstract,2021-01-13,01
f0b67b48c5fcc6c6f587becfce08af8c1eeec030,Productivity-Adjusted Life-Years: A New Metric for Quantifying Disease Burden,"The PALY is calculated by multiplying a 'productivity index' by years lived (Fig. 1) . The productivity index ranges from 0 (completely unproductive) to 1 (completely productive), and is estimated from data on time worked by fully healthy individuals, absenteeism, presenteeism and premature workforce exit. Data on absenteeism and presenteeism can be drawn from the use of the aforementioned validated tools. We commonly derive the productivity index through dividing the days worked in a year (maximum working days minus days missed because of the condition of interest) by the maximum working days in a year. The maximum working days in a year is obtained through combining information on the overall percentage of equivalent full-time workers, which is country specific and age and sex specific. For example, if the weighted average for full-time workers across the defined age range is 75%, the maximum working days in a year for that particular country would be 180 days (240 days multiplied by 75%). By definition, a PALY has an intrinsic economic value, and herein lies its utility. There are a number of ways to estimate this financial value. To date, we have ascribed a value to each PALY equivalent to the gross domestic product (GDP) per equivalent full-time worker for a specific country. This 'human capital' approach is simple to estimate given that GDP is an oft-reported economic metric, as are data on workforce participation. However, it is crude as GDP is generated in many ways other than people working. Another way to assign a financial value to a PALY is by using available salary estimates, which reflects both personal income for workers and income tax for governments. We recommend that PALYs only be reported as absolute values, and not be used in ratio calculations (for example, cost per PALY saved). This is because they have an inherent financial value, and hence their application to ratios will involve double counting of costs.In the last 2 years, our group has collaboratively published PALY estimates for a range of highly prevalent health conditions and risk factors, including diabetes mellitus [6] [7] [8] , coronary heart disease [9, 10] , hypertension [11] , [12, 13] , occupational-related hearing loss [14] , pneumococcal disease [15] , familial hypercholesterolaemia [16] , epilepsy [17] and migraine [18] . We are now developing PALY estimates for low back pain, cancer, COVID-19-related depression and acute myeloid leukaemia. As a generic measure, the PALY facilitates comparison of productivity burden across health conditions to inform practice and policy. For example, between-condition comparisons show that 1.4 and 1.0 PALYs (undiscounted) were lost per person in Australia as a result of diabetes [6] and smoking [12] , respectively, over the working lifetime while 0.3 and 1.4 PALYs (discounted) were lost per person as a result of hypertension [11] and epilepsy [17] , respectively. Aggregate PALY estimates can highlight not only the prevalence of a health condition and its work impacts, but also the potential for productivity gains with appropriate treatment. For example, hypertension was estimated to cause the loss of > 609,000 PALYs in Australia, but optimal blood pressure control would save > 340,000 PALYs or $76 billion in GDP [11] . Thus far, PALY estimates have been produced for Australia [6, 9, 11, 14, [16] [17] [18] , Bangladesh [8] , China [7] , Indonesia [10, 19] , Japan, Korea [20] , Malaysia [13] and Thailand [15] . Between-country comparisons of disease burden or risk factor burden can highlight significant disparities: using a consistent methodology for each country, we found that PALYs lost because of smoking totalled 15.6 million in Indonesia [19] , compared with 3.0 million in Malaysia [13] and 2.5 million [12] in Australia.We have now extensively tested and refined our PALY modelling, moving from initial 'static' life table models to 'dynamic' models that are capable of incorporating: (1) multiple health states; (2) movement of individuals in and out of the model over time; and (3) updates of prevalence, population and efficacy data. A dynamic model (accounting for future migration, births and deaths, and changes in the working age population) was most recently used to examine the impact of coronary heart disease and potential PALY gains if all new cases could be prevented over a 10-year period [9] . Importantly, we are also building researcher capacity in this new technique by training the next generation of health researchers, including those from low-and middle-income countries. Modelling support is available for researchers seeking to undertake PALY analyses within their field of interest.Like any measure, the PALY approach has inherent limitations. By definition, PALYs focus on working age populations (usually defined as those aged 16-65 years) and productivity estimates are only simulated over the working lifetime. As health economic evaluations usually adopt a lifetime horizon, this raises a potential equity issue, particularly if PALYs are used to inform reimbursement decisions. To date, PALY models have only incorporated paid workforce data but we acknowledge that unpaid work (caregiving, child rearing, household and community roles) is also impacted by ill health. Where robust population-level data on unpaid work are available, these will enable a more complete definition of 'productivity'.The PALY is not intended to replace the disabilityadjusted life-year or the quality-adjusted life-year. Instead, it offers a novel, but now well-tested, approach to quantifying the population-level impact of disease on productivity (arising from unemployment, days off work, reduced efficiency at work and premature death) and the broader economy. New treatments could be evaluated through estimation of the number of PALYs gained from their use. Beyond 'traditional' healthcare payers, PALYs could also be used by employers, particularly in settings where they support employee healthcare costs. For the first time, there exists an opportunity for decision making in health to be explicitly informed by the productivity burden of disease and the potential for productivity gain with effective intervention.Author contributions ZA and INA drafted the manuscript for intellectual content.

cf4d076cfff394f0e17acabd4fbcf2438d76b027,Clinical impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibition,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1 As of October 2020, more than 35,000,000 people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide with more than 1,000,000 deaths. 2 The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies enormously from asymptomatic individuals to critical illness and death. 3 Risk factors for severe disease include older age, male sex and comorbidities such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, diabetes and cancer. 4 5 Mortality rates of COVID-19 infection in the cancer population range from 7.6% to 33% 5-9 compared with 1.4%-2.3% 3 10 in an unselected population.One key question specific for the cancer population pertains to the potential impact of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) on the clinical course of COVID-19. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)-based immunotherapy releases the brakes of immune tolerance mechanisms leading to effective anti-tumor responses. 11 Adaptive immune cells involved in this process, in particular CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, are also essential to control and establish immunity against viruses, and ICI may enhance immunologic control of viral Open access infections. 12 13 It is therefore theoretically possible that ICI offers protection against the development of severe COVID-19 illness. Nevertheless, these immune cellseither through direct cytotoxicity or cytokine releasecan also contribute to inflammation and may aggravate the clinical course of COVID-19. An example of an immune-mediated consequence of SARS-CoV-2 is acute respiratory distress syndrome which is the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19. 14 15 ICI has been associated with severe disease in some 9 16 17 but not all 18 studies, and the numbers of ICItreated patients in these studies were small. Although vigilance is certainly warranted in the ICI-treated patient population, unnecessary treatment delays may compromise cancer-related outcomes and some patients may not be offered ICI therapy in areas of high COVID-19 prevalence due to concerns of infection and severe illness. With the pandemic continuing, recommendations are needed to inform ICI-related treatment decisions. In this multicentric study, we describe the clinical course, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients treated with ICI across different tumor types and across different geographic regions.We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study in 19 centers across 9 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, The Netherlands, UK and USA). Between March 5 and May 15, 2020, we included 110 adult (aged ≥18 years) patients with any type of solid malignancy who had undergone treatment with ICI and had laboratory-confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2. The test could either be nucleic acid detection based (nasopharyngeal swabs) or serological. Asymptomatic patients found positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included in this study. These patients were tested according to local policies after exposure to a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (transmission tracking and contact tracing). All patients must have received at least one cycle of ICI within 12 months prior to testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received chemotherapy within 12 weeks prior to COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded as chemotherapyinduced immunosuppression may have confounded analyses. Combinations of ICI with anti-VEGF agents were allowed. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records from each of the centers. Local Institutional Review Board approval was required for each center. All study procedures were in accordance with the precepts of Good Clinical Practice and the declaration of Helsinki.Clinical data were extracted from medical records and de-identified for analysis. Data were divided into the following categories: demographics and patient characteristics (age, sex, geographic region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status), cancer characteristics (cancer type, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, treatment setting), comorbidities (cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal disease or diabetes mellitus), ICI treatment (anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1, combination anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 or other), COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea), laboratory tests (leukocytes, lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine), management (oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, antivirals, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, anti-IL-6 agents and intravenous immunoglobulins) and clinical outcomes (hospital admission, intensive care unit admission and mortality).Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are summarized by their frequency and proportion. Primary outcomes were hospital admission (coded yes/no) and overall survival (time to event). Measures for association between demographic and clinical characteristics on one hand and hospital admission on the other hand were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. ORs and associated 95% CIs are reported. Overall survival was assessed using univariate Cox proportional hazard regression; given the low number of deaths observed, multivariate Cox was not considered. HRs and associated 95% CIs are reported. For associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and intensive care unit admission, only frequencies are reported given the low absolute number of events. The selection of symptoms and laboratory findings was based on previous reports. 19 Between March 5 and May 15, 2020, 110 patients with cancer on ICI only who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included in this study. The median follow-up since COVID-19 diagnosis was 82 days (range 1-119 days). The median age was 63 years (range 27-86) and most patients were male (65%). Seventy (64%) patients were treated in Europe (48 in Italy) and 36 (33%) in North America. Eightythree (75%) patients had advanced cancer, including 64 (58%) with melanoma, 17 (16%) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 10 (9%) with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (table 1). Most patients did not have an underlying comorbidity (55%); the most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (27%), diabetes mellitus (15%), pulmonary disease (12%) and/or renal disease (5%). Overall, for cancer, 90 (82%) patients were treated with anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, spartalizumab, atezolizumab or durvalumab) and 16 (15%) with combination anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 (nivolumab-ipilimumab, durvalumab-tremelimumab or pembrolizumab-MK1308). Twenty-five (23%) patients had chemotherapy prior to ICI. The median time between last chemotherapy and COVID-19 diagnosis was 40 weeks Median time between COVID-19 diagnosis and last ICI dose was 26 days (range 0-363). Sixty-seven (62%) patients were symptomatic at COVID-19 diagnosis. The most common COVID-19-related symptoms were fever (67%), cough (58%) and dyspnea (33%), and 10% of patients presented ECOG ≥2 at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Lymphocytopenia was the most common laboratory abnormality in 47% of the 79 patients who had laboratory tests available within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, and 15 patients (14%) were on prednisone equivalent dose of ≥10 mg at diagnosis, mostly for ICI toxicity (table 2) . Thirty-five (32%) patients were admitted to hospital and 7 (6%) to intensive care (figure 1). For the patients managed in hospital, 20 received oxygen therapy and 3 mechanical ventilation. Antibiotics and antiviral agents were given to 24 and 5 admitted patients, respectively. Only 10 patients were treated with glucocorticoids for COVID-19; anti-IL6 and intravenous immunoglobulin were given to 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively ( 17 20 21 and was due to COVID-19 in almost half of the cases. These findings have implications for clinical decision-making for patients who are receiving immunotherapy. COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, an unprecedented impact on society and healthcare services. The increased risk for severe illness and mortality in patients with cancer has raised safety concerns among patients and clinicians alike. 7 8 17 The notion that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 develop a cytokine storm syndrome, 14 possibly reflecting a high-risk inflammatory phenotype, is of particular concern in a context of ICI. 22 To better understand the impact of ICI on patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, we integrated and analyzed data from 110 ICI-treated patients with different cancer types. Almost 40% of patients had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, which is well in the range of the reported 30%-75% of individuals with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in the community. 8 23-25 Although less permissive screening programs in some countries make it challenging to ascertain the true number of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, patients with cancer are likely to be repeatedly tested. Our findings do not indicate a different symptomatic presentation at diagnosis of COVID-19 in ICI-treated patients. Considering the frequency at which patients on ICI visit healthcare facilities, this finding underscores the importance of transmission tracking and contact tracing in healthcare services to avoid spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable patients.Just under a third of the patients with COVID-19 on immunotherapy were admitted to hospital in our study, most of whom were symptomatic. This is slightly lower than hospital admission rates reported for the cancer population in general. 7 The presence of dyspnea was, as expected, a predictor for both hospital admission and mortality. ICU admission rate in our study was low at only 6%. While this is in line with the notion that 5% of individuals without comorbidities develop severe illness from COVID-19 infection, 3 it is in stark contrast with the high mortality rates in the cancer population. In our study, 18 out of 110 patients died (16%), most not attributed to COVID-19. This fatality rate is clearly higher than the case fatality rate in the community (2.3%) 3 yet within the range of what has been reported for the cancer population (7.6%-33%). 5 6 None of the patients who received adjuvant ICI died. Of the 18 patients who died, 14 were not admitted to ICU. Although underlying malignancy and constrained healthcare systems were reported as factors in decision-making, further exploration of the perceptions of a cancer diagnosis will be essential in an era where increasing numbers of patients with advanced cancer achieve long-term responses to immunotherapy.Interpreting overall mortality is inherently complicated by the divergent impact ICI may have on COVID-19related and malignancy-related outcomes. Furthermore, several factors could have influenced mortality rates in our study. First, the effect of tumor type on COVID-19 outcomes has been recognized: higher COVID-19 mortality rates have been reported for hematological 26 and thoracic malignancies. 6 Our cohort included more patients with melanoma than with NSCLC and the mortality rate of patients with melanoma was lower than that of patients with NSCLC. Second, treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 plus anti-CTLA-4 was associated with a significant higher admission but not mortality rate possibly reflecting the higher adverse events rate but better oncological outcomes associated with combination immunotherapy. Third, patients who had chemotherapy in the 12 weeks prior to COVID-19 were excluded from our study. If recent chemotherapy results in worse COVID-19-related outcomes, exclusion of these patients could contribute to a difference in observed outcomes; however, recent administration of chemotherapy has not been invariably associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. 8 9 Finally, median follow-up in our study was 82 days, which is several times longer than earlier reports. 6 7 Of particular relevance is the notion, consistent with other reports, 9 that baseline corticosteroid use (at a prednisone equivalent dose of ≥10 mg) is associated with a higher risk for admission. The RECOVERY trial, which had not yet been published when patients in our study were treated, showed that the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of dexamethasone were beneficial in patients requiring respiratory support. 22 While the use of corticosteroids may be confounding in an ICI context (immunotherapy-related adverse events), it remains important to note that dampening immune response with corticosteroids in the early stages of COVID-19 infection can be detrimental and may also compromise cancer-related outcomes. 27 In later stages, with an aberrant inflammatory response and less viral activity taking place, corticosteroids could be of benefit. This may be consistent with our finding that prednisone was associated with a higher risk for hospital admission but not with increased mortality. Lymphocytopenia, as reported by Yang et al, 19 and high CRP were predictors for higher mortality but may also impact malignancy-related outcomes. 28 It is, however, somewhat unexpected that a well-established risk factor such as cardiovascular disease was not associated with more severe COVID-19 illness. This is likely the result of a smaller population (ICI-only as opposed to unselected) and cardiovascular disease not being further specified. In our study, older age and male sex were also not associated with a higher mortality (4 out of 18 patients who died were younger than 50 years, 3 of whom were women).Approximately one fourth of the patients did not interrupt ICI despite COVID-19 infection and most of these patients were asymptomatic. This subset of patients was too small to draw any conclusions regarding adverse outcomes for the patients themselves, yet it is, from a public health perspective, imperative to isolate patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Our study has some limitations. First, there is no non-ICI control group; this would have been challenging given that treatment choices are inextricably linked to Figure 1 Venn diagram representing all patients (110), patients admitted to hospital (35), admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) (7) and patients who died (18) .
