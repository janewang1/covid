ff505394abb466c2cefef6de496317ceba8a1471,Peacebuilding in times of COVID-19: risk-adapted strategies of cooperation and development projects,"National and international cooperation and development projects (CDP) play a fundamental role in peacebuilding processes (Fischhendler and Tenenboim-Weinblatt 2019 ; Amego Korbla Penu and Wellington Essaw 2019; Lemon and Pinet 2018; Jaruma 2013) . Managing CDPs, challenging under normal circumstances, requires agility and flexibility when confronting unforeseen global emergencies, like the outbreak of coronavirus . Without rapidly adapting management approaches, CDP might be endangered. UNDP (2020) notes the impact of COVID-19 is likely to be worse in conflict-affected countries, where past and present vulnerabilities in health and governance could be amplified, thus exacerbating violence.Further, seven of the ten most-vulnerable countries to pandemics are in conflict zones (Moore et al. 2017 ), places where cross-cutting and chronic dimensions of violence, like illicit markets, unemployment, economic disparities between regions, marginalisation, displacement, exploitation, conflicts over local issues, lack of access to public services (e.g. health, infrastructures), and corruption increase risks and the duration of conflicts (Sánchez-Zamora et al. 2017; Flores and Vargas 2018 ). Yet, health, humanitarian, and cooperation strategies should be stimulated simultaneously to sustain the most vulnerable during the pandemic-like displaced populations-to both the virus itself and those measures enacted to fight it (San Lau et al. 2020) .The forthcoming COVID-19 depression could result in funding cuts to peace operations, endangering their ability to achieve benchmarks, while hampering critical peacebuilding actions like the protection of civilians, protection of social leaders, financial support to ex-combats, and the protection of key infrastructure (Garzón et al. 2020) . Reduced funding can also affect local organizations based on projects. Furthermore, the shrinking of peace related budgets limits CDP capacity to hire highly-qualified personal if not keep pre-COVID-19 personnel employed. CDP support to governments, institutions, and conflict parties is likely to be limited in the mid-to long-term (de Coning 2020; Dorussen 2020) . At the administrative level, COVID-related constraints oblige peacebuilding CDP organizations to shift to an ""essential"" frame of mind, forcing a re-examination of activities and interventions, while identifying new threats developing alongside the pandemic and evolving governmental measures. This is challenging due to the multiple and changing faces of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other aspects, coordinating activities is difficult due to poor internet access, low penetration of mobile networks, electricity cuts, and digital illiteracy in conflict-affected rural areas. In this context, additional funds are being requested to invest in online communication and information systems (Ansorg and Strasheim 2020) .In Colombia, the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening the underlying roots of conflicts, especially in rural contexts beset with unsecure land distribution, poor access to public services, and high levels of inequalities (Peace Direct 2020). In some places, physical and psychological violence is increasing, especially against social, indigenous and environmental leaders, former guerrillas and Venezuelan migrants (Sandoval et al. 2020) . Besides, public health measures, including social distancing, lockdowns, and public virtual attendance, trigger delays, slowing the implementation of the 2016 peace agreement between Colombia's government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Two immediate consequences exist: First, scarce human and financial governmental capacities show that they are failing to control and monitor isolated and remote regions endowed with natural resources. This not only facilitates the expansion of the drug trafficking business, but is also multiplying practices of violence such as forced recruitment, displacement, land grabbing, and deforestation (Garzón et al. 2020) . Second, the COVID-19 outbreak reveals emerging obstacles to the effective implementation of governmental peacebuilding strategies, such as the Programs of Development with a Territorial Focus or Programas de Desarrollo con Enfoque Territorial (PDET) or the Municipal and Departmental Development Plans (rural roads, productive and community infrastructure, schools, health facilities, etc.). The lack of funding, the low degrees of political K and policy processes at the regional and local level, methodological inconsistencies in the design of participatory approaches and the increased violence against community leaders are preventing the effective implementations of these programs and their cooperation with CDPs.Notwithstanding these developments, COVID-19 also provides opportunities to promote peace and to advance peacebuilding. Examples include the global ceasefire campaigns (United Nations Press 2020), the immediate impacts on environmental and climate change resulting from lockdowns (e.g. exceptional drops in carbon dioxide emissions) (Eufemia and Hussein 2020) , community-based initiatives (e.g. indigenous COVID-19 prevention and containment, focusing on voluntary collective isolation and contact-tracing) (Kaplan et al. 2020) , reorientation of ex-guerrilla combatants' productive projects (e.g., from textile production to mask manufacturing), and the use of ICT in transitional justice processes (UN 2020) . Although the veracity, impact, and transferability of these advances is unclear, the visible manifestation of the COVID-19 crisis in post conflict scenarios reflect increased complexities and changes in peacebuilding scenarios that also affect the planning and functioning of CDPs.By investigating the key challenges and coping strategies of implementing agencies and stakeholders to COVID-19, the main aims of this work are to find (i) how CDPs adapt to perceived risks, central government management plans, and funding agency requirements; and (ii) which impact the pandemic has on peacebuilding and corresponding CDP responses. In the following sections, we present our methodology formed by the case study areas and the semi-structured interviews, the results visualizing the main findings, followed by the discussion that addresses key insights against the current situation of both the peacebuilding endeavour and the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the whole content and it offers suggestions to improved risk-adapted strategies.Since the 2016 peace agreement, Colombia's peacebuilding process has experienced numerous and complex challenges and changes of power structures regarding land use and ownership; resulting risks include the strengthening of old and new armed groups (Graser et al. 2020) . For this reason, our methodological take includes territoriality, as we develop a visualization of conflict-affect areas. We investigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on national and international CDPs, targeting projects in some of the most conflict-affected and vulnerable areas of Colombia. Fig. 1 overlays the ""Areas Most Affected by Armed Conflict"" (ZOMAC), as listed in governmental decree n. 1650 on October 9, 2017 (Republic of Colombia 2017), with the applied 10 surveys, addressing 13 CDPs implemented across multiple regions as shown by dots (a complete list is in the Appendix), including 7 large (with a budget of over 1 million C), 3 medium (with a budget less than 1 million C and implemented at a national scale), and 3 small (with a budget less than 1 million C and implemented at a local scale) projects.A list of running CDPs was obtained through internet and institutional networks. Emails and phone calls with key actors evaluated their willingness to participate. An interview protocol was developed to guide semi-structured interviews with project managers and stakeholders of Colombian CDPs. The questionnaire comprises four main blocks: (i) context: expertise (e.g. peace-related, national, and international) gender, and age; (ii) information about the reference CDP: scale (e.g. local, regional, or national), duration, approximate funding, project role, and project team; (iii) the perceived impact of COVID-19 on project implementation: immediate perception of issue extent, proximity, immediate responses, first effects, and perception regarding governmental responses at all levels (local, regional, and national), as well as of funding agencies and direct donors; and (iv) risk-adapted strategies: evaluation of existing strategies, adoption of new strategies and assets, and the future outlook on desirable risk-adapted strategies. Survey participation was voluntary and personal data kept anonymous. To include negotiation mechanisms to overcome unexpected externalities -To establish online platforms to sell local products (e.g. contactless measures)To rely less on international expertise (e.g., reducing travels) and more on local capacities To invest more on environmental and conservation projects (e.g. biodiversity and environmental services as prevention mechanisms to future pandemics) CDP evaluation during times of COVID-19 (on a scale from 1, very negative, to 5, very positive) 3.7 4.5Source: Authors' own elaboration K While using qualitative methods to categorize each block, quantitative approaches were used for descriptive statistics to present numeric values. In total, 10 interviews were conducted, addressing the work of 13 CDPs, covering most ZOMAC. The interviews were conducted in Spanish via phone or skype, each lasting between forty-five minutes and two hours. Each interview was recorded for further data analysis.Relevant findings concerning COVID-19 impacts, CDP responses, and risk-adapted strategies are collected in blocks (iii) and (iv) of the survey (see 2.2 Methods, Step 2. Survey). Tables 1 and 2 present the key interfaces and relations. Grey boxes indicate overlapping perceptions between large, medium, and small CDPs.The analysis of CDP responses and risk-adapted strategies offers critical perspectives about peacebuilding. In discussing survey results, we highlight key challenges and coping strategies of implementing agencies and stakeholders. Using peacebuilding theories, we focus on specific world experiences (e.g., COVID-19) and its aspects (Heft 1997) . Sample composition-affect by finite time and financial capacity-is the main study limitation. Only a few medium and small CDPs were involved. Additionally, with the continuous development of the pandemic, perceptions are changing rapidly. Thus, the results may be biased. Another possible limitation relates to the degree to which our analysis tends to generalize. For example, most of our data regards local perspectives and sample size is small. Thus, results might not translate or be transferrable to a broader context. A larger sample size across more regions, a more heterogeneous set of stakeholders, and the inclusion of donors' perspectives could have strengthened this work.The perspectives and approaches of implementing agencies and stakeholders show similarities and differences. Our findings show universally substantial impacts of COVID-19 on CDPs. While project self-evaluation remains positive before and during the pandemic for large and medium CDPs, small CDPs are negatively affected. Further, the initial perceptions of large and medium CDPs included elements of surprise and scepticism, while small CDPs responded with immediate collective paranoia, especially with respect to the health emergency. Because COVID-19 stands out for its speed of spread, driven by today's global society, remote rural communities, where small CDPs are implemented, may feel more exposed due to its lack of health services and infrastructure. Historically, poor law-implementation, limited state presence, weak implementations of conflict-prevention measures (e.g. conflict early warning and response mechanisms), high corruption, and inequitable access to services and resources are conditions that make addressing COVID-19 even more challenging (Jayawickreme et al. 2017; Quinn 2016; Rossi et al. 2006) . Ultimately, globalization's negative consequences primarily affect the poor and marginalized in developing countries (Jenkins 2005) .As a result, internal adaptation plans included both the interruption, in some cases preventatively (e.g. small CDPs), and/or the transformation of CDP. Under COVID-19, most projects shifted field activities from physical to virtual. While, some cases demonstrate how CDPs in rural areas can transform and continue, supported by governmental incentives, social cohesion and new conflicts may arise from ""digital fatigue"", electricity cuts, and the lack of internet access. Although increased misinformation sharing is a problem rooted in increased internet access, mental disorders are also caused by physical distancing and social/community isolation (Burgess and Fonseca 2020; Islam et al. 2020; Monteith et al. 2020) .Informal measures are re-shaping power relations at the local level with the rise of new and old armed groups contending territorial control (e.g. access entry-exit). Paramilitary and criminal groups are expanding their influence in rural areas, further exploiting natural resources and pursuing illicit activities (e.g. drug production). With the excuse of lockdowns, the consolidation of territorial control increases the vulnerability of civil society and, in particular, those in indigenous communities (Sandoval et al. 2020) . Two aspects of trust are emerging: a renewed internal trust in rural community (e.g. solidarity) and a decreasing trust toward institutions and their measures. The latter represent external adaptation components that continue to be enacted. CDPs perceive a top down, central system that delegates functions to regional and local governments, providing funding to assist the most vulnerable communities. In most cases, actions promoted by the central government are perceived negatively, increasing bureaucracy that overlaps with perceived increases in (institutional) corruption, environmental deterioration, food insecurity, human rights violations, and violence against social and environmental leaders.While large CDPs have greater financial and human capacities to meet such challenges, relocate funds, and implement biosecurity programs, especially in rural contexts, great resilience is also shown by medium and small CDPs, which find creative ways to cope with reduced field activities. Yet, government responses actually increase the complexity of the emergency situation by adding multiple challenges that directly affect the peace, thus hindering direct and indirect protection mechanisms against violence.Because of lockdown, social alienation might be the main component undermining CDP peacebuilding efforts. Empirical studies show that COVID-19 lockdown measures are affecting mental health and collective trauma (Montoya 2020; Van Bavel et al. 2020) ; especially problematic for existing post conflict communities. Further, COVID-19 is perceived as negatively affecting Colombian peacebuilding. These challenges and changes in power relations reflect a centralized system unable to support those who are most marginalized, threating CDPs located in rural, remote areas.Most CDPs are optimistic about the continuation of activities and funds for development and cooperation. Small CDPs are less optimistic, since they face new structural approaches for project implementation. Our findings show that, in times of emergency, learning opportunities arise. First, schemes for territorial planning to foster environmental projects need reconsideration. An increasing literature argues that sustainable development is the only way to achieve long lasting peace (Holden et al. 2017; Mansell and Tremblay 2013; Rieckmann 2017) . Second, in facing the forthcoming COVID-19 depression, investments in private-public cooperation to sustain small-and medium-scale economic activities is needed, especially in rural areas. Third, strategies for preventing and controlling future pandemics are needed.Future ideas for CDP risk-adapted strategies include creating new categories of unpredictable externalities (e.g. reorganize priorities based on local needs and interests), educational and pedagogical tools, as well as specific biosecurity protocols for locals. From a local perspective, increasing investments in environmental and conservation projects (e.g. biodiversity and environmental services as prevention mechanisms to future pandemics) is perceived as a key coping strategy that encourages peacebuilding and the implementation of CDPs in times of unexpected externalities.Finally, the development of project strategies that address risks and uncertainty can be better guided by social learning processes. In this sense, social learning facilitates the integration of different kinds of knowledge (Wals 2007) , especially when collectively deciding on actions to cope with crisis situations, unpredictable externalities, or future uncertainty. As proposed by Morin (2002) , learning to confront uncertainty is essential knowledge for the future.This work highlights key challenges and coping strategies of implementing agencies and stakeholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing complexity caused by top down governmental measures, effective or not, along with the rise of new local level power relations (e.g. armed groups, illicit activities, environmental deterioration etc.) and social alienation are negatively affecting peacebuilding in Colombia. Remote rural communities (e.g. where small CDPs are implemented) are the most exposed due to the lack of infrastructure (e.g. health services, presence of the state, electricity etc.) and their historic vulnerability (in case they are economically autonomous). Further, the increasing erosion of trust between locals and institutions, along with food insecurity and expected unemployment scenarios due to the COVID-19 depression will not only increase the risk of violence and social unrest, but also the survival of CDPs. In the midst of a crisis, policies and economic efforts should target rural contexts, where peace is most at stake; supporting initiatives historically carried by CDPs such as ceasefires, the mutual assistance and intercommunity cooperation; thus preventing immediate violence and contributing to a construction of more lasting peace in the future. While investments in privatepublic cooperation and in environmental projects are perceived as key coping strategies against COVID-19, future implications for peace and peacebuilding remain unclear. Thus, further research and monitoring approaches are needed. Peace-process Regional coordinator ",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-04,11
cd80addbba48a5e9e9363cd6a3471970e84f2c59,COVID-19 and Ecosyndemic Vulnerability: Implications for El Niñ o-Sensitive Countries in Latin America,"This commentary highlights the importance of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for infectious disease vulnerability in Latin America amidst the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic. It builds on previous work in the region focused on climate, ENSO, and health within a multi-disease hazard context of place (Confalonieri et al. 2009; Ramírez et al. 2018; Ramírez 2019) , influenced by Singer's (2009) concept of ''ecosyndemic.'' Like a multi-hazard approach to disasters (UNDRR 2015) , the notion of ecosyndemic conceptualizes hazards, in this case infectious diseases, from a broader lens that examines an epidemic in relation to rather than independent of other epidemics. As Ramírez et al. (2018) describe, ecosyndemics are public health phenomena where simulataneous disease hazards overlap interconnected by environmental changes and social vulnerabilities. From this lens, the COVID-19 pandemic is a broader public health hazard that may be exarcerbated by climate variability and extreme events, namely El Niño, the warm phase of ENSO, which threatens Latin America every few years.The pandemic, which first emerged in late 2019, is a global health emergency, infecting approximately 28.6 million people, and killing 917,000 persons, as of 13 September 2020 (WHO 2020) . Like other disasters, not every country is equally vulnerable. An analysis by the World Bank concluded that ''with more people living close to the international poverty line in the developing world, low-and middle-income countries will suffer the greatest consequences [of the virus] in terms of extreme poverty'' (Mahler et al. 2020) . The United Nations assessments (UN 2020a, b) suggest that impacts of COVID-19 affect the most vulnerable countries, many already facing multiple human development challenges, including inadequate access to clean water, clean air, nutrition, sanitation, and shelter. Furthermore, populations in these countries also face increasing societal exposure and vulnerability to all hazards and subsequent adverse health outcomes, including epidemics.The Latin American region is an epicenter for COVID-19 (PAHO 2020a; UN 2020b), representing approximately one-third of all cases and deaths worldwide (WHO 2020). Figure 1 shows COVID-19 incidence rates (per 100,000 persons) across Latin America and the Caribbean, as of mid-September 2020. In Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, and Chile alone (of which Brazil shared the greatest bur-den), the total number of cases was approximately 7.3 million (WHO 2020). The proportions of people diagnosed with COVID-19 who died (case fatality ratio) have also been increasing across the region. Table 1 indicates that countries with some of the highest case fatality ratios were also countries with the highest incidence rates, including several of the Andean countries, mentioned earlier. Moreover, PAHO (2020a) estimated that one in four persons in the region would experience severe health outcomes, due to the growing prevalence of chronic underlying preconditions, such as diabetes and cancer. Of urgent concern is how COVID-19 might compound preexisting infectious disease vulnerability in the region (Burki 2020; Rodriguez-Morales et al. 2020) . Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are already burdened with multiple infectious disease hazards (Schneider et al. 2011; PAHO 2020b) , many preventable, such as dengue, malaria, and leishmaniasis. Table 2 displays the ecosyndemic potential of countries with a high number of vectorborne diseases, including several arboviruses. In 2016, some countries reported as many as nine (Ecuador) to 11 (Brazil) vector-borne diseases, as well as high rates of diarrheal and respiratory-related infections. Such an array of disease hazards not only reflects societal vulnerability-such as disproportionate exposure of communities of lower socioeconomic status, and inadequate infrastructure (McCormick and Lang 2016; Engels and Zhou 2020), but also highlights the region's climate suitability for infectious diseases (Confalonieri et al. 2009; Campbell-Lendrum et al. 2015) , which raises concerns about COVID-19 and the threat of El Niño, given its association with and impact on a number of disease hazards in the region (Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe 2013; Ramírez and Grady 2016; Caminade et al. 2017 ).The El Niño phenomenon, which stems from ocean-atmosphere interactions across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, affects regional to local weather patterns every few years (McPhaden et al. 2006) . El Niño is often associated with water, weather, and climate-related extremes and changes in seasonality (Naranjo et al. 2018) , that in turn influence local disease ecologies and population exposures (Kovats et al. 2003; McGregor and Ebi 2018; Anyamba et al. 2019) . El Niño's impact on disease transmission occurs directly via ecological changes (for example, hydrology and rising ambient and water temperatures), which may propogate a variety of pathogens, as well as spawn a variety of hydrometeorological (hydromet) hazards, including floods, temperature extremes, windstorms, and droughts. During El Niño's onset, several months of anomalous temperatures, both ambient and coastal water, may precede rainfall anomalies (dry and wet, depending on the geography), which in turn precipitate floods or droughts that impact disease hazards (for example, in the case of cholera, see Jutla et al. (2013) or Ramírez et al. (2016) ). Indirectly, El Niño-related hazards are also sources of health vulnerability (Ebi and Bowen 2015) , through physical impacts on the built environment and infrastructure (for example, damaging or overwhelming water and sanitation systems), and long-term stresses (for example, societal impacts on livelihoods, population displacement) that may follow post-El Niño years (Glantz 2001a (Glantz , 2001b Ramírez 2019) . Among countries in Latin America, some of the most affected by COVID-19 are also vulnerable to the effects of El Niño on their societies and health. For example, countries in South America such as Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil are highly sensitive to El Niño-related hydromet hazards and subsequent disasters (Caviedes 1984; Cornejo and Zavala 2017; Marengo et al. 2018) , including infectious disease epidemics (Confalonieri et al. 2009 ; Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe 2013; Sorensen et al. 2017) .Often, El Niño's impacts aggravate preexisting health burdens, and heighten social vulnerabilities (for example, compromising potable water access, sanitation, hygiene, Total 11 9 8 7 nutrition, and/or livelihoods) to hydromet and other hazards. Thus, it is a convergence and cascade of hazards and disasters that often heighten health vulnerability (Thomas et al. 2020) . One example is the case of the zika virus and 2016 earthquake in Ecuador. As Sorensen et al. (2017) describe, anomalous ambient temperatures spawned favorable environmental conditions for zika-carrying mosquitoes during an El Niño that preceded a catastrophic earthquake. Subsequently, the number of zika cases surged, although correlation is not always causation. Another example is epidemic cholera in Peru in 1991. Preceding the emergence of cholera were several disasters and social hardships in the prior year that included an earthquake (northeast Peru), a climate-induced agricultural disaster (highlands), energy crisis (northern Peru), and stringent economic restructuring policies (Fujishock) to address hyperinflation (Ramírez et al. 2013 and came without early warning to the Andean region (Ramírez and Briones 2017) . According to PAHO, several epidemics associated with arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and zika, as well as zoonotic infections like leptospirosis emerged in Peru following simultaneous flooding events (Ministry of Health Peru 2015a; PAHO 2017; Silva Chávez and Hernández Córdova 2017). Table 3 displays case counts for several infectious diseases and related groups of infections (for example, diarrheal) from 2014 to 2017 in Peru. As the table indicates, several diseases increased following the onsets of the two recent El Niño events (November 2014 and January 2017): dengue, diarrheal, and respiratory in 2015 and diarrheal, leptosporisis, pneumonia, and respiratory infection (non-pneumonia) in 2016. Of particular impact on public health was dengue and leptosporisis, diseases with three and six times higher prevalence in 2017 compared to the previous year.What is troubling from this case example is not only the burden of disease, but that the epidemics tend to cluster in place and time during and in the aftermath of El Niños and environmental changes. For example, Ramírez et al. (2018) investigated population vulnerability to seven infectious diseases (diarrheal disease (non-cholera), cholera, two types of malaria, conjunctivitis, respiratory infection (nonpneumonia), and pneumonia) in Piura of northern Peru during the 1997-1998 El Niño. Using a spatial index approach, the authors showed that patterns of ecosyndemic risk intensified over time across several districts and varied spatially as the extreme events (for example, heavy rains) progressed. Ramírez et al. (2018) also showed that ecosyndemic disease burden was correlated with urban density in low-lying areas largely affected by flooding (for example, number of people affected as a proxy for disaster impact) in Piura. In another example, Tallman et al. (2020) examined the ecosyndemic relationships between human activities like dam construction and roads with an ensemble of vector-borne and sexually-transmitted diseases in Brazil and Peru. In this study, the findings suggest that ecosyndemics varied by place, but risk overall was explained by a complex intersection of environment changes and psychosocial stressors.For El Niño-affected countries like Peru, COVID-19 presents an additional health burden to manage within a broader context of ecosyndemic vulnerability. Figure 3 shows COVID-19 rates of incidence and case fatality ratios in Peru at the department level, as of 5 September 2020. According to the map, the distribution of COVID-19 in Peru was widespread. Initially when Latin America emerged as a hotspot, the highest incidence rates and case fatality ratios were mainly located along the arid low-lying coast in the north as well as jungle regions (for example, Loreto) in the east (see Table 4 for a comparison of departments with the highest incidence rates and case fatalities for 29 May and 5 September). By 5 September, the spatial distribution of incidence shifted to the central and southern parts of Peru. During this time (May to September), however, the greatest proportion of people dying from COVID-19 remained in the central and northern coast and two jungle regions. Among the departments, Piura and Tumbes, which border Ecuador in the north, stand out as areas well known for El Niño-related health Health, Peru (2015b , 2016 , 2017 , 2018a , b, 2019a and disaster impacts (Bayer et al. 2014; Ramírez 2019; French et al. 2020) . Table 5 shows that Piura and Tumbes reported the most damage during the recent El Niño Costero event along with five other departments (Lambayeque, Ica, Ancash, Loreto, and La Libertad) where case fatality ratios for COVID-19 were also the highest. The point here is that underlying conditions in these areas create social vulnerability to multiple hazards, which persist over years, and are further complicated by concurrent hazard issues like those influenced by El Niños. While it is unknown precisely how El Niño will affect COVID-19 incidence in Peru in the future, it is foreseeable that hydromet hazards may exacerbate transmission and ecosyndemic vulnerability in certain geographic regions, although this may vary with the strength and dynamics of a particular El Niño, and especially changing social and health conditions of local communities, governance, and health system preparedness. El Niño-related hydromet hazards and seasonal changes may influence local ecologies of COVID-19 and other endemic disease hazards (for example, diarrheal diseases and dengue) directly and indirectly, as described earlier. Impacts on disease may be mediated through local temperature and rainfall extremes and subsequent hydromet hazards, which vary by geography (for example, floods in northern Peru, drought in Peruvian Amazon). Furthermore, hydromet-related disasters may compromise the public health response to COVID-19 outbreaks. For example, during the 2017 El Niño Costero event, an estimated 934 health posts were badly damaged due to flooding (French et al. 2020) . As of July 2020, only 4.0% of 150 health stations scheduled for reconstruction were rebuilt (Zapata et al. 2020 ). Thus, a cascade of hydromet-related hazards may heighten COVID-19 and ecosyndemic risks across the country.Coincidently, as COVID-19 emerged globally, so was the onset of a weak El Niño-see NOAA (2020) for the Oceanic Niño Index, which inspired this preliminary work. This commentary highlights the importance of El Niño not to suggest that climate triggered the COVID-19 pandemic, but rather to place the emergence within a broader context of climate and ecosyndemic vulnerability.In many cases, the novel COVID-19 is now one of many infectious disease hazards co-circulating in socially vulnerable countries that face socioeconomic and infrastructure challenges. For example, the percentage of people in urban areas living in slum-like conditions with several basic needs unmet was 20.9 in Latin America and the Caribbean, based on 2018 estimates (UN 2020c). Such conditions may limit the ability of populations to take prevention measures, such as adequate hygiene practice (for example, frequently washing hands with soap), social distancing, and wearing face masks (UN 2020b). According to UNICEF (2020), the region reports that 39.0% of populations have limited handwashing facilities or do not have such facilities with soap and water. In El Niño-affected countries like Peru, at least 26.0% of the healthcare facilities do not have hand hygiene facilities, while Ecuador reports 3 million people without basic handwashing facilities in homes. In Brazil, 35.0% of schools do not have hygiene facilities for handwashing (UNICEF 2020). Furthermore, many people work in informal sectors of the economy (for example, 71% in Peru), and therefore, cannot minimize their exposure like those with the ability to stay at or work from home (Enriquez et al. 2020) .Country-level health system capacities to cope with and respond to COVID-19 are also limited in the region. As Litewka and Heitman (2020) point out, health systems in Latin America are underfunded to begin with, and many countries' budgets for healthcare are only 4.0% of the gross domestic product, limiting access to quality healthcare, resources, and personnel to fight the pandemic. Taking into account the pandemic and ecosyndemic context, health systems can become overburdened. As one researcher states, ''Brazil has an excellent public health system, but it cannot cope with competing crises…and could easily end up in a situation where there is a surge of all vector-borne diseases'' (as quoted in Burki 2020).Although it was initially argued that climate (for example, seasonality) could possibly constrain the spread of COVID-19 (for example, Sajadi et al. 2020) , the emergence of Latin America, particularly South America, as an epicenter of COVID-19, suggests that equatorial regions are also at great risk, as some preliminary research shows (O'Reilly et al. 2020) , particularly in places with limited health systems (Merow and Urban 2020) . Thus, examination of COVID-19 within a broader scope of ecosyndemic vulnerability including quasi-periodic El Niño-related threats may provide new insights for prevention and disaster risk reduction strategies that address COVID-19 and the broader public health problem of multi-infectious disease vulnerability in the region.Acknowledgements A preliminary version (Ramírez and Lee 2020, preprint) of this manuscript is found at the Earth and Space Science Open Archive (ESSOAr).

Am schwersten sind davon Arbeiter:innen am Anfang der Wertschöpfungskette getroffen, häufig ohne Kündigungsschutz, vielfach informell beschäftigt.Die Verletzungen grundlegender sozialer und ökonomischer Rechte in globalen Lieferketten sind während der Pandemiekrise offensichtlich und haben weitreichende Folgen für soziale Konflikte. In diesem Beitrag nehmen wir diese Zäsur globaler Produktions-und Handelsbeziehungen zum Anlass, um globale Lieferketten aus einer Friedens-und Konfliktforschungsperspektive zu betrachten. Im Mittelpunkt der Disziplin stehen häufig gewalttätige bzw. militärische Disruptionen bzw. ihre Vermeidung. Konflikte und Konfliktregionen dienen auch als Ausgangspunkt für die Untersuchung sozio-ökonomischer Verhältnisse, die teilweise als Ursache oder re-levante Dimension des Konflikts mit berücksichtigt werden (vgl. etwa Silve 2018) . 1 Die staatliche Kapazität steht hierbei meist im Vordergrund (Silve 2018 :1511), weniger aber die transnationale Dimension wirtschaftlicher Verflechtung. Eine breitere Rezeption des Zusammenhangs zwischen globalen Lieferketten, ihrer politischen Gestaltung und gesellschaftlichen Konflikten findet bisher außerhalb der Friedensund Konfliktforschung statt (vgl. etwa Cowen 2014) .Die Lieferketten-Debatte, die vor allem im Kontext der Betriebswirtschaftslehre, der Wirtschaftssoziologie oder Geographie behandelt wird, berücksichtigt wiederum kaum weitergehende gesellschaftliche Konflikte. Wie Levy (2008, S. 951 ) betont, betrachtet die Governance-Perspektive auf Lieferketten vor allem Formen der ökonomischen Koordination, weniger Formen der politischen Auseinandersetzung als Grundlage und Folge solcher Koordinationsprozesse. Die institutionelle und diskursive Einbettung der Märkte und Produktionsnetzwerke bedarf daher weiterer Untersuchung aus einer politischen Perspektive, die für gesellschaftliche Konflikte sensibel ist. Denn diese Einbettung ist Grundpfeiler des Arbeits-und Menschenrechtsschutzes, aber durchaus stets konflikthaft. Dies zeigt sich besonders deutlich in den Möglichkeiten der Konfliktaustragung, weniger in ""von oben"" gesetzten Mindeststandards: in kollektiven Organisationsformen der Arbeiter:innen, ihrer gesetzlichen Ermöglichung und Einhegung, in der Artikulation transnationaler und lokaler NGOs und Gewerkschaften oder auch im Verlauf offener Arbeitsrechtskonflikte, wie Streiks und Fabrikbesetzungen, die nicht selten mit staatlicher Gewalt beantwortet werden.Während ""Arbeitskämpfe"" auch durchaus allgemein als Aspekt der Friedens-und Konfliktforschung gesehen werden (Kißler 2010) , so erfordert die transnationale Dimension der Arbeitsteilung und -organisation ein eigenes Konfliktkapitel, das bisher nur schemenhaft geschrieben wurde. Angesichts ihrer stets umkämpften und durch starke politisch-ökonomische Machtungleichgewichte geprägten Beziehungen ist die Bedeutung von Lieferketten für die internationale Friedens-und Konfliktforschung hoch, aber gerade aus Sicht der konsumorientierten OECD-Länder häufig nicht offensichtlich. Es ist die Pandemie, die uns deutlicher denn je zeigt, dass globale Strukturen und Praktiken der Produktion mit Formen der Gewalt und des Konflikts untrennbar zusammenhängen. Dort, wo Frieden in einem positiven Sinne verstanden wird, also umfassend soziale und institutionelle Formen innergesellschaftlicher Gewalt mitgedacht werden, dort müssen diese Gewaltformen, ihre Strukturen und Praktiken auch zum Bestandteil der Analyse werden.In unserem Beitrag erläutern wir diese Behauptung, indem wir zunächst globale Lieferketten konzeptionell als umkämpfte politische Räume fassen (Abschn. 2). Derzeitige nationale und internationale Bemühungen um extraterritorial gültige menschenrechtliche Sorgfaltspflichten in der Lieferkette identifizieren wir hierbei als aktuelles empirisches Moment der politisch-normativen Umstrittenheit von Lieferkettenbeziehungen. Es entstand damit ein neues transnationales Terrain für (stets vorhandene) Kämpfe um Arbeits-und Menschenrechte. Es ist aber fluid und Ge-genstand gesellschaftlicher Auseinandersetzungen, daher prozesshaft zu verstehen. Besetzt wird es bisher einseitig durch private und hybride Governance-Praktiken auf Basis des Managements globaler Leitunternehmen in der Lieferkette. Die Disruptionen durch die Pandemie, die den Mangel des Arbeits-und Menschenrechtsschutzes offenlegen und verschärfen, zeigen besonders deutlich die fatalen Folgen dieser Schieflage. Dies thematisieren wir in Abschn. 3 mit Blick auf national und transnational geprägte Pandemie-Konflikte in Indien und Brasilien. Beide Länder sind stark von der Pandemie betroffen und beide Regierungen antworten mit starken Einschränkungen von Arbeits-und Menschenrechten, teilweise begleitet von Gewalt gegen Protestbewegungen. Wir schließen mit einem Plädoyer für eine erweiterte Forschungsagenda zu globalen Lieferketten und Konfliktforschung.Globale Lieferketten 2 sind heute die dominante Form der Organisation von Investition, Produktion und Handel in der globalen politischen Ökonomie (ILO 2016). Etwa die Hälfte aller internationalen Handelsströme ist inzwischen auf transnationale Lieferketten zurückzuführen (World Bank 2020). Damit geht die Auseinandersetzung mit Lieferketten auch weit über die ursprünglich betriebswirtschaftliche Perspektive hinaus. Politisch wurde ihre Bedeutung bereits früh durch weltsystemtheoretische Betrachtungen internationaler Arbeitsteilung deutlich (Hopkins und Wallerstein 1994) . Heute begründen Lieferketten eine umfassende interdisziplinäre Forschungslandschaft (Gibbon et al. 2008) . Wichtig für die Betrachtung der konfliktiven Auswirkungen der Pandemie erscheint uns zunächst, Lieferketten als ein politisches und damit konfliktbehaftetes Feld zu verstehen, ein Aspekt, der in der erwähnten Lieferketten-Forschung eher wenig beleuchtet wurde. 3 Levy (2008) zeigt im Rückgriff auf die Theorie Globaler Produktionsnetzwerke, die institutionalistische Management-Theorie und neogramscianische Ansätze der Internationalen Politischen Ökonomie, dass Lieferketten sowohl materielle als auch ideologische Machtdimensionen aufweisen und durch Kämpfe um Deutungsmacht geprägt sind. Sie sind kein neutrales wirtschaftliches Terrain, sondern (re)produzieren bestehende soziale Verhältnisse und Widersprüche. Lieferketten haben letztlich die betrieblichen Konflikte der kapitalistischen Industrieproduktion auf ein transnationales Terrain verlagert. Ihre Strukturen und Praktiken sind transnational, aber durch multiple nationale Rahmenbedingungen institutionell sehr unterschiedlich eingebettet. Sie sind dabei durchweg geprägt von Arbeitskonflikten unter Bedingungen nationaler und transnationaler Ungleichheit, einschließlich der vielfältigen rassistischen, klassistischen, sexistischen, kolonialistischen und sonstigen intersektional diskriminierenden Ausschlüsse, die in kapitalistischen Gesellschaften fortbestehen (Levy 2008, S. 945) . Erst diese erklären letztlich die Profitabilität der globalen Organisation von Lieferketten, denn diese basiert zu einem wesentlichen Teil auf der betriebswirtschaftlichen Ausnutzung institutioneller Unterschiede sowie gesellschaftlicher Ungleichheiten in transnationaler Perspektive (Bair und Werner 2011; Bonacich et al. 2008; Ferus-Comelo 2006; Tsing 2009 ). Es ist kein Zufall, dass die arbeitsintensivsten und am schlechtesten bezahlten Tätigkeiten am Anfang der Lieferkette häufig von jungen Frauen mit Migrationserfahrung in Ländern mit schwachem Arbeitsschutz und mangelnden Gewerkschaftsfreiheiten ausgeübt werden.Somit befördern Lieferketten eine spezifische internationale Arbeitsteilung, die Warenproduktion in der Regel auf Regionen des Globalen Südens verlagert und höheren Profit für Leitunternehmen aufgrund struktureller Abhängigkeitsverhältnisse und Ungleichheiten ermöglicht (Graf et al. 2020). Die damit erreichten Entwicklungsfortschritte sind in produzierenden Ländern teilweise erheblich, gerade auch für Frauen und andere benachteiligte Bevölkerungsgruppen (World Bank 2020). Sie führen aber gleichzeitig zur Reproduktion ebenjener Ungleichheitsstrukturen und Diskriminierungspraktiken. Die Kosten und die Bedingungen der Arbeit, die immer konfliktbehaftet sind (Kißler 2010) , werden damit keineswegs von gleichgewichtigen Positionen aus verhandelt. Arbeiter:innen, häufig mit Migrationserfahrungen oder gar an die Erwerbsarbeit gekoppeltem Aufenthaltsstatus, müssen die vorhandenen Bedingungen häufig akzeptieren, um ein Einkommen generieren zu können (Fischer 2020) . Das Konfrontationsfeld der Lieferketten konstituiert sich dabei durch multiple Akteure: Unternehmen, Staaten, internationale und zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen, Beratungsfirmen, Gewerkschaften, Verbände und Arbeiter:innen (Levy 2008 ). Die brasilianische Bekleidungsindustrie hat zwar in den letzten Jahren auf dem globalen Markt etwas an Bedeutung verloren, allerdings ist die Textilindustrie noch immer hoch relevant, auch für den Export von Rohstoffen (ABIT 2019). Die unterschiedlichen Teile der textilen Lieferkette umfassen etwa 8 Mio. Beschäftige im Land. Frauen machten 2019 75 % der Arbeitskraft aus. Einem Bericht der Brasilianischen Assoziation der Textilindustrie (ABIT) zufolge erhalten junge Erwachsene und Wanderarbeiter:innen aus anderen Ländern Südamerikas häufig die erste Beschäftigung im Textilsektor (ABIT 2019). Internationale arbeitsrechtliche Standards werden auch in Brasilien in der Produktion häufig missachtet und die übliche Praxis der Unterauftragsvergabe erschwert maßgeblich ein zuverlässiges Monitoring der gesamten Lieferkette (Bignami 2017) .Die Pandemie verschärft diese Problemlagen, insbesondere hinsichtlich der sanitären Bedingungen und der Entlohnung. Die Arbeitslosigkeit erreichte im Juli 2020 die historische Höchstgrenze von 47 % der erwerbsfähigen Bevölkerung (IBGE 2020); im Textilsektor fielen ca. 20 % der Arbeitsplätze weg (Mariano 2020) . Die Regierung führte keine spezifischen Maßnahmen für den Textilsektor durch, allerdings wurden, wie in Indien, grundlegende Arbeitsrechte ausgesetzt. Arbeiter:innen mussten während der Fabrikschließungen Erholungsurlaub in Anspruch nehmen und die staatliche soziale Sicherung wurde per Dekret im März und April 2020 suspendiert (Fair Labor Association 2020). Auf Grundlage einer Umfrage mit Unternehmen im Textilsektor berichtet die ABIT, dass 62 % der Befragten zunächst auf Zwangsurlaub als Kostenanpassungsmaßnahme zurückgriffen, dennoch im Anschluss Entlassungen nicht mehr vermeiden konnten (ABIT 2020). Viele der Entlassenen sind Wanderarbeiter:innen und Frauen, die um eine Weiterbeschäftigung ringen, um ihren Lebensunterhalt weiter finanzieren zu können (Mantovani 2020) .Auch in Brasilien steht der zunehmende Druck auf Arbeiter:innen in einem unmittelbaren Zusammenhang mit der wirkmächtigen Vorstellung transnationaler Wettbewerbsfähigkeit in Lieferkettenstrukturen. Die brasilianische Regierung wird seit 2019 zunehmend autoritärer (Vestena 2020) . Der Schutz fundamentaler Prinzipien und Rechte, wie Transparenz und Teilhabe der Arbeiter:innen, wird weitgehend missachtet. Gewerkschaften und andere zivilgesellschaftliche Akteure reagierten nur schwach auf die Krise. Allerdings wurden ihre Konfrontationen mit der Regierung stets mit der Androhung von Gewalt beantwortet.Die Verschärfung solcher lokalen Konflikte, auch im Bereich der sozioökonomischen Verhältnisse, wiederholt sich in ähnlicher Weise in unterschiedlichen Lieferketten des Landes. Die transnationale Komponente des Arbeitsrechtskonflikts, also zivilgesellschaftliche und gewerkschaftliche Netzwerke und Multiakteurs-Organisationen, scheint in der Krise weniger sichtbar geworden zu sein. Einseitige Einschränkungen seitens der Regierung bestimmen derzeit die Entwicklung und konterkarieren jahrelange nationale und transnationale Bemühungen zum Arbeitsrechtsschutz.Die beiden Beispiele Indien und Brasilien zeigen verschiedene Auswirkungsdimensionen der Pandemie sowohl unmittelbar auf die Produktionsbedingungen entlang globaler Lieferketten als auch auf den regulatorischen Rahmen, in dem sich zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen sowie Arbeiter:innen und Gewerkschaften organisieren. In der Pandemie erfolgen in beiden Ländern einseitige Verschiebungen der Regulierung von Arbeitsrechten zulasten der Rechteinhaber:innen. In beiden Ländern vermischt sich die damit verbundene soziale Katastrophe mit einem Diskurs des Wettbewerbszwangs sowie zunehmend autoritären Strukturen, Gewalt oder zumindest Gewalttendenzen. In Indien betrifft dies vor allem Gewalt gegen Wanderarbeiter:innen, die bereits stark marginalisierten Bevölkerungsgruppen angehören, und in Brasilien beobachten wir Militarisierungstendenzen der Regierung, die unter anderem mit weiteren Einschränkungen für Arbeitnehmer:innen und Gewerkschaftsrechten einhergehen können.Globale Zweitens könnte eine Betrachtung der Konfliktdimensionen sowohl aktuelle regressiven Prozesse des Rechtsentzugs in den Blick nehmen, als auch die weit verbreitete Militarisierung und Autoritarisierung in einen Zusammenhang mit den wirtschaftlichen Abhängigkeiten von transnational organisierten Industriesektoren stellen (vgl. hierzu Cowen 2014), wie es insbesondere in unseren Beispielen Brasilien und Indien für die tiefere Analyse notwendig wäre. Die staatliche Repression, Polizei-und Militärgewalt gegen Arbeiter:innen stehen hier sowohl in einem engen Zusammenhang mit deren innergesellschaftlicher Marginalisierung auf Basis diskriminierender Zuschreibungen und Ungleichheitsverhältnisse, aber auch mit dominanten Erzählungen globaler Standortwettbewerbe und ungleicher Lieferkettenstrukturen. Beide Komponenten erfordern eine vertiefte und integrierende sozialwissenschaftliche Konfliktforschung.Förderung The research was partly carried out under a project supported by the Hans-Böckler-Foundation.Funding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.Open Access Dieser Artikel wird unter der Creative Commons Namensnennung 4.0 International Lizenz veröffentlicht, welche die Nutzung, Vervielfältigung, Bearbeitung, Verbreitung und Wiedergabe in jeglichem Medium und Format erlaubt, sofern Sie den/die ursprünglichen Autor(en) und die Quelle ordnungsgemäß nennen, einen Link zur Creative Commons Lizenz beifügen und angeben, ob Änderungen vorgenommen wurden.Die in diesem Artikel enthaltenen Bilder und sonstiges Drittmaterial unterliegen ebenfalls der genannten Creative Commons Lizenz, sofern sich aus der Abbildungslegende nichts anderes ergibt.

4ad756553884a3cb1911c507cb4b1f8d1f04b94e,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has produced far-reaching effects on health, economy, and behavior all over the world. At the beginning of October 2020, ten months following the first report of COVID-19, about 34 million people have been infected, and more than one million people have died from the disease worldwide (1) . Brazil is currently one of the epicenters of the pandemic, following the United States in the number of cases and deaths (1) .A l t h o u g h m o s t p e o p l e a r e a s y m p t o m a t i c o r oligosymptomatic when infected by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), older adults are disproportionately vulnerable to severe forms and death by COVID-19 (2) (3) (4) . As evidencebased therapeutic measures and vaccines are yet to be developed, most countries have adopted physical distancing as the primary strategy to limit the transmission of the disease (5) .Rigorous distancing can be a powerful weapon to fight the new coronavirus spread. However, community-dwelling older adults may experience more difficulties in adapting to sudden lifestyle changes, especially in the context of frailty (6, 7) . The COVID-19 quarantine has already been associated with the exacerbation of loneliness and psychological distress (8) (9) (10) , but physical health and well-being can also be affected by the current recommendations. Moreover, freedom and independence to come and go are inherently important to every person and have been recognized as vital determinants of healthy aging (11, 12) .Since mobility is viewed as an essential component of wellbeing by many older adults, strategies to measure it have been proposed, consolidating the concept of life-space mobility (13, 14) . Life-space is characterized by the movement that extends from within one's home to beyond their town or region, and it can be evaluated by instruments like the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) (15) . The LSA is a well-validated tool that measures how much a person moves in the community, maintains social relationships and roles, exploits community amenities, and participates in meaningful activities (12, 13) . LSA scores have been shown to predict multiple adverse outcomes (e.g., falls, nursing home admissions, mortality) in community-dwelling older adults (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Previous studies have demonstrated that declining life-space mobility is associated with lower quality of life (23) . However, the artificial and abrupt changes in mobility determined by the COVID-19 pandemic represent an entirely new scenario, and their impact on the health and well-being of older adults with and without frailty is still unknown (24) . Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether a sudden decrease in life-space mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the quality of life of older adults. We also explored whether frailty modified the association between life-space mobility and impact on quality of life.This study is an ongoing multicenter prospective cohort study being conducted in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Our cohort was recruited to observe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health trajectories of communitydwelling older adults. Since March 2020, when a statewide quarantine was declared in Sao Paulo, our team of researchers has been working in four geriatric outpatient clinics to follow the mental and physical health of the participants. Three of our study sites [Instituto Central (IC), Instituto do Coracao (InCor), and Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo (ICESP)] belong to the hospital complex of Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP), the largest academic medical center in Latin America. HCFMUSP is a tertiary public hospital that provides integrated care for 420,000 older patients residing in the greater Sao Paulo area. Our fourth study site was Hospital do Coracao (HCor), a private philanthropic hospital distinguished in providing patientcentered care for frail older adults in Sao Paulo.We recruited community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years and over, followed at the four geriatric outpatient clinics. We reviewed electronic databases to identify eligible candidates, using previously recorded information from comprehensive geriatric assessments. We did not invite patients whose database records were incomplete. Long-term facility residents and patients with overt dementia, immobility, or severe dependence in performing activities of daily living (ADLs) were considered ineligible (25) . We also excluded candidates who were unable to communicate in the telephone effectively (e.g., hearing loss, aphasia), who could not be reached after three contact attempts, who were hospitalized on the inclusion assessment, and who refused to consent participation.Written or audio-recorded consent was obtained from participants. Patients who scored 9 points or more in the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) were offered additional psychological support following the interviews. Our interviewers also examined signs and symptoms of COVID-19, asked about health services utilization, and reinforced the importance of social distancing and protective measures during the pandemic.In April, we completed detailed telephone interviews to collect baseline information, and the first follow-up assessment from our participants (the follow-up procedures and design of our cohort study are detailed in the Supplementary Figure 1) . A team of trained research assistants completed the telephone interviews directly with participants. Medical investigators adjudicated the quality of the collected data. Data were collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture platform (REDCap) (26) .Our interviews lasted an average of 20 minutes and included questions on whether the participants were following the news about the COVID-19 pandemic, their concerns about the situation, compliance to measures against contamination, influenza vaccine status, and living arrangements (27) . The impact of quarantine on their physical and mental health was evaluated using the following instruments:(1) International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form (28), a brief questionnaire used to evaluate the frequency and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity, including walks, housework, and leisure activities, in a typical week.(2) Life-Space Assessment (LSA) (29), a self-reported measure of life-space mobility. It estimates the distance traveled over the previous weeks in areas as small as one's bedroom, up to more distant places in the city or region. LSA also measures the frequency with which each life-space level is attained, and evaluates the independence of movement (i.e., the necessity of an assistive device or assistance from another person). LSA has been validated for telephone application and has scores ranging from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating greater mobility (15, 30) . Previous studies have defined variations of five or more points in LSA scores as significant (13) .(3) 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3) (31), a threequestion scale on «lacking companionship», «feeling left out» and «feeling isolated from others». Responses were scored as 1 (hardly ever), 2 (some of the time), or 3 (often), and a final score was generated from the sum of the items. Participants with scores of ≥6 were defined as having high levels of loneliness.(4) 4-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) (32), which contains two questions on anxiety symptoms [Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2)] and two questions on depressive symptoms [Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item (PHQ-2)]. Each question is answered according to a Likert scale based on how often the symptoms were present in the previous two weeks. The anxiety and depression subscales have scores ranging from 0 to 6, with scores ≥ 3 indicating significant symptoms in the corresponding domain.In order to assess the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on their life-space mobility and physical activity levels, we asked participants to complete the LSA and the IPAQ Short Form using two time-points: before the quarantine, defined as February 2020 (the quarantine started in March 2020 in Sao Paulo), at the baseline interview; and during the quarantine, defined as the two weeks preceding our first follow-up interview.We reviewed medical records to confirm or collect data on demographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, education, neighborhood), medical history, cognition [10-point cognitive screener (10-CS)] (33), functional status (Katz index -ADLs) (33) , and frailty. Frailty was evaluated using the FRAIL scale, a well-validated screening tool that includes five mnemonic questions on fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight. FRAIL scores range from 0 to 5, with scores ≥3 classifying older adults as frail (35, 36) .Our primary outcome was quality of life, evaluated with the following question: «How is the coronavirus pandemic affecting your quality of life?». Possible responses were «not at all», «to some extent», and «to a great extent», defining a three-level outcome with the categories «no impact», «minor impact», and «major impact», respectively (37) . We used a single measure to capture how people perceive and react to the transformations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in their health status and other nonmedical aspects of their lives (38) . Quality of life is something that is perceived by each person individually. A single global rating can reflect the different values and preferences of individuals, offering a sensible and easy-to-apply approach to measuring the quality of life, particularly in the context of life transitions or to evaluate the quality of life in specific situations (37, 39) . Besides their simplicity, single-item assessments also have the advantage of being better validated for telephone interviews (40) .We compared variables according to the three categories of quality of life impact (no impact, minor impact, major impact), using the Kruskal-Wallis test for interval variables and the exact Fisher test for categorical variables.We used ordinal logistic regression models to investigate which factors were associated with the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on the quality of life of our population. Our primary independent variable was restricted life-space mobility, defined as a decrease of ≥5 points in LSA scores between measurements (before vs. during the quarantine). We adjusted the regressions for possible confounders, including demographics, comorbidities, cognition, functional status, frailty, loneliness, anxiety, and depression. We tested a preplanned interaction between frailty status and restricted life-space mobility for the impact on the quality of life (41) . Variance inflation factors (VIF) did not detect multicollinearity in our models.Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 (Stata Corp. LP, College Station, TX, USA). All statistical tests were two-tailed, and an alpha level <0.05 was accepted to indicate statistical significance.A total of 886 individuals were pre-screened from our databases as potential candidates for participation. After eligibility assessment, 145 were excluded for circumstances that precluded telephone interviews (mostly severe hearing loss), 104 could not be reached after three contact attempts, 36 refused participation, and 17 were hospitalized when contacted. Finally, 27 were excluded for missing data. Therefore, we included 557 participants from the four study sites for complete-case data analyses (IC=316; InCor=113; HCor=95; ICESP=33). Figure 1 shows the broad distribution of our population in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, according to the zip code and study site. We observed a mean age of 80 years (range 60-100) years, 65 % were women, 64% had less than eight years of formal education, and 15% were living alone. Overall, 33% of our participants were frail and, although they were all able to walk, 45% reported gait difficulties, and 26% used assistive devices. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 .When questioned about the COVID-19 pandemic, 81% reported being somewhat or very worried, and 82% were checking the news about COVID-19 every day. Compliance with preventive measures against the disease was generally good: 95% were avoiding going out, 87% were practicing social distancing, 80% had increased hand-washing frequency, 75% had been vaccinated against influenza in 2020, and 68% had intensified their environment sanitization routines.The prevalence of depression (10%) and loneliness (13%) was compatible with what is usually observed in communitydwelling older adults. Conversely, the prevalence of anxiety was higher, affecting 19% of our sample. When asked about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their quality of life, 54% of our participants replied that the pandemic had affected them to some extent, while 23% replied not to have been affected at all, and 23% to have been affected to a great extent. As shown in Table 1 , participants who reported a major impact on quality of life were younger, more educated, and had higher levels of anxiety. We did not observe differences in the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on quality of life according to sex, living arrangement, comorbidities, cognition, physical performance, or frailty. We verified substantial changes in life-space mobility during the quarantine, in our population. The proportion of participants who reported leaving their homes at least once a week for external activities dropped from 74% before the quarantine to 19% during the quarantine. Furthermore, the proportion of individuals who left their houses every day went from 29% to 2%. Correspondingly, the mean LSA scores dropped from 42 points before the quarantine to 21 points during the quarantine (P<0.001). Most of our patients (79%) decreased their life-space mobility levels in five points or more, fulfilling the criteria for restricted life-space mobility. Physical activity markedly decreased before vs. during the quarantine as well, from 42% to 26% of older adults doing regular physical activity at least three times per week (P<0.001).We confirmed our hypothesis that the restriction of lifespace mobility would be associated with the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on the quality of life of communitydwelling older adults (Figure 2) . In an adjusted regression model, restricted life-space mobility was associated with higher levels of impact on quality of life, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.18 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.33-3.58]. Younger age, higher education, and the presence of anxiety were also independently associated with higher levels of impact on quality of life (Table 2 ).Life-space assessment scores in community-dwelling older adults, before and during the COVID-19 quarantine (n=557)Our preplanned interaction analyses revealed that frailty modified the effect of life-space restriction on the study outcome (P-value for interaction=0.03), indicating that frail older adults had a significantly higher risk of having their quality of life affected by restricted life-space mobility during the pandemic (Table 3) .Factors associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life of community-dwelling older adults (n=557)Odds Ratio (95% Confidence Interval)Restricted life-space mobility ( In this multicenter cohort study from the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, we found that four in five communitydwelling older adults experienced a clinically significant reduction in their life-space mobility as a result of the stayat-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, we verified that restrictions in life-space mobility influenced the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on older adults' quality of life, particularly among those who were frail. Understanding how this phenomenon might affect the health and well-being of older people with and without frailty is a crucial step towards the mitigation of some of the negative consequences of the physical distancing measures.Life-space mobility represented an essential aspect of environmental complexity in older adults (42) . Despite not being a direct measure of physical performance, LSA has been described as a comprehensive representation of functioning and a strong predictor of adverse outcomes in older age, including falls, cognitive decline, hospitalization, institutionalization, and death (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) . While physical performance (such as walking ability) accounts for a significant portion of its final score, LSA is strongly associated with several other factors that influence mobility, including social connections, cognitive performance, personality traits, and mental health (13, 15) . All these aspects are crucial for the well-being of older adults.In this study, we noticed a massive decrease of life-space mobility in a short period of time. The mean LSA score reduced from 42 (before the quarantine) to 21 (during the first weeks of the quarantine), a drop similar to that encountered in older adults who suffered a hip fracture (22) . As an example, a decrease from 42 to 21 points would be experienced by an older person who previously reported going out to the neighborhood 4-6 times per week and now can only visit his/her own yard or porch with the same frequency.We also found that frail older adults had higher odds of having their quality of life affected by restrictions in lifespace mobility. Previous studies have demonstrated that frail older adults have lower levels of perceived autonomy (47) . Therefore, it is possible that in a scenario where social distancing recommendations further limited their already constricted autonomy, frail individuals felt more impacted by the COVID-19 quarantine (21) . Another vital concern raised by our results was the considerable decrease in regular physical activity. Frailty, sarcopenia, and chronic diseases are just some of the many health problems that can be aggravated by physical inactivity in older people (48) . Although the long-term consequences of these abrupt lifestyle changes are still unclear, they are likely to be particularly harmful for the geriatric population (24) .Modern healthcare systems had never been required to adapt to such rigorous and widespread quarantine orders. It quickly became evident that resources such as telemedicine and homebased exercise programs would be critical for maintaining the health of vulnerable populations (49) . For instance, our telephone interviews also represent a simple, low-cost, and reproducible strategy to maintain essential aspects of follow-up during the quarantine. They can also be employed to educate patients regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, provide basic health care recommendations, and identify patients requiring additional psychological support (49) .Our work had important strengths. It was a multicenter study conducted in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Besides, we completed our interviews during the outbreak in Sao Paulo, which allowed us to investigate the realtime consequences of the unexpected scenario. Finally, we were able to adjust our analyses for several possible confounders of the association between life-space mobility and quality of life.Even so, the study had some limitations. We excluded patients with dementia, limiting the external generalizability of the results. Given that frailty is often associated with other geriatric syndromes, future studies should explore our findings in individuals with cognitive impairment or hearing loss. Also, we asked our patients about their physical activity and lifespace mobility levels before the pandemic, and their answers could have been subject to recall bias. Another possible limitation was our use of a single question to evaluate quality of life during the COVID-19 quarantine. Still, our choices are justified by existing evidence that demonstrates high levels of validity of single-item assessments to capture changes in quality of life associated with specific contexts (50, 51) . Instead of improving measurements, a multi-domain assessment could confound the dimensionality of outcome with multiple causal sources (39) .In conclusion, we observed substantial decreases in life-space mobility during the COVID-19 quarantine, and we verified that restrictions on life-space were associated with the impact of the quarantine on the quality of life of community-dwelling older adults. Providers should be aware that frail individuals were particularly vulnerable to the effects of restricted life-space mobility on quality of life and explore strategies to minimize their suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic. We plan to follow our cohort during the next months to advance our understanding of trajectories of physical and mental health in geriatric patients after the COVID-19 quarantine.",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-17,11
cab867151401c54635a35bb230357e4f6bc17ec6,Möge die Solidarität ansteckender sein als das Virus! Erfahrungen aus einer Notfallaktion May solidarity be more contagious than the virus!,"Der Alltag in der Gemeinde Morro da Cruz in Porto Alegre wurde Mitte März 2020 stark verändert, als der Bundesstaat Rio Grande do Sul Social Distancing und die Unterbrechung aller Art von Präsenzaktivitäten verordnete. Öffentliche Dienstleistungen in Gesundheit, Bildung und Sozialhilfe sowie die Aktivitäten der NGOs wurden unmittelbar eingestellt. Die meisten Einwohner*innen dieser Gemeinde, die prekäre oder informelle Jobs haben, verloren plötzlich ihren Lebensunterhalt und die öffentliche Unterstützung. Erste solidarische Notfallaktivitäten wurden wenige Tage nach der Verordnung von Social Distancing durch Nichtregierungsorganisationen wiederaufgenommen. Eine davon, die die Verteilung von Grundnahrungsmittelkörben und einer Gemeinschaftssuppe beinhaltete, ist Gegenstand dieses Textes. Die Aktion kombiniert die Aktivitäten einer lokalen NGO, die Mobilisierung von Solidarität über die Grenzen der Gemeinde hinaus und die Selbstorganisation der Gemeinde. Durch die Aktion wurde die Gemeinde Morro da Cruz aber auch mit ethisch-praktischen Fragen konfrontiert, die im Text ebenfalls besprochen werden.Die Gemeinde Morro da Cruz wurde ursprünglich 1875 als eine Siedlung außerhalb der Stadt gegründet, scheiterte aber aufgrund der geringen Marktakzeptanz. Im Laufe des 20. Jahrhunderts siedelte die Stadt arme Bevölkerungsgruppen dort an, um sie aus den edelsten Stadtvierteln zu entfernen -eine in Lateinamerika übliche Politik der Gentrifizierung. Neben den von den Stadtverwaltern vertriebenen Einwohner*innen kamen Migrant*innen aus dem Landesinneren hinzu, die sich dort niederließen. Ein großer Teil der Gemeinde befindet sich auf einem Grundstück, das offiziell ein Naturschutzgebiet sein soll. Aufgrund des mangelnden Schutzes durch die Behörden wurde dieses Gebiet jedoch nach und nach von Menschen besetzt, die dringend einen Wohnort brauchten. Die aufgrund dessen fehlenden Regelungen haben zur Folge, dass die Stadt keine Infrastruktur darin errichtet: Es gibt dort weder Straßen und Bürgersteige noch fließendes Wasser, Abwasser, Strom oder Müllabfuhr. Auf Eigeninitiative der Gemeinde und von Freiwilligen aus anderen Stadtteilen wurden einige Verbesserungen vorgenommen, z. B. Treppen, Gassen und Abwasserkanalisation installiert, die jedoch nur die größte Not etwas lindern.Der Name Morro da Cruz bezieht sich auf eines der wichtigsten Feste in der Gemeinde, das seit über einem halben Jahrhundert gefeiert wird: eine Inszenierung der Passion Christi mit einer Besetzung, die überwiegend aus lokalen Laien besteht, und jeweils von einer großen Prozession begleitet wird. Mit der Prozession stellt sich die Gemeinde der Stadt vor und gewinnt so in den lokalen Medien etwas Aufmerksamkeit. Dieses Ereignis führte in den 1960er Jahren zum Bau einer kleinen Kapelle ganz oben auf dem Berg, auf der sich ein großes Kreuz befindet, das der Gemeinde ihren Namen gab. Die Volksreligiosität prägt tief das Leben und die Kultur der Einwohner der Gemeinde. So weisen neben der jährlichen Inszenierung in der Passionszeit viele andere Aktivitäten Zeichen lokaler Religiosität auf (Scalco 2008 Es ist auch wichtig hervorzuheben, dass Frauen durchschnittlich 57 % der Teilnehmer*innen repräsentierten und dass im langfristigen Durchschnitt die Hälfte der Teilnehmer*innen bis zu vier Schuljahre formale Bildung hatte. Dies zeigt bereits, wie diese Form der Entscheidung über den städtischen Haushalt vielen Menschen, die traditionell nicht an öffentlichen Debatten teilgenommen haben, die Möglichkeit eröffnet hat, sich in die Politik ihrer Stadt einzubringen. Ein weiteres Merkmal des Partizipativen Haushalts in Porto Alegre war die Bottom-up-Dynamik: Es war notwendig, zunächst in den örtlichen Versammlungen Unterstützung für die Forderungen zu sichern und diese Unterstützung dann in den Sitzungen der Delegierten aus den verschiedenen Regionen der ganzen Stadt zu erweitern. Daher mussten die Teilnehmer*innen sich in ihren Forderungen einig sein, und gleichzeitig wurden sie für die Situation anderer Menschen oder Gemeinden sensibilisiert, die manchmal eine noch prekärere Situation hatten. Die Dynamik des Verfahrens führte dazu, dass die Teilnehmer*innen sich untereinander unterstützten und so einen Impuls zu solidarischem Handeln erhielten. Sie bewirkten nicht nur, dass ihre Rechte auf öffentliche Dienstleistungen wenigstens teilweise in der eigenen Gemeinde erfüllt wurden, sondern entwickelten auch ein größeres Bewusstsein, wie wichtig es ist, gemeinsam Andere zu unterstützen. Obwohl die Stadtverwaltung inzwischen den Bürgerhaushalt aus politischen Gründen (seine symbolische Bindung an die Arbeiterpartei, die ihn geschaffen hat) ausgesetzt hat, äußern sich die an diesem Prozess Beteiligten bis heute positiv über die Auswirkungen der Mobilisierungen, um die Gemeinde zu vereinen und um anderen gegenüber Sensibilität zu entwickeln. Einige Personen aus der Leitung der Anwohnervereinigung beklagten sich darüber, dass dieser zweite Modus nur dazu dienen würde, den Hunger zu stillen, aber nicht das politische Bewusstsein der Menschen zu schärfen und daher sie als Bürger*innen entwerten würde. So sagte ein Vorstandsmitglied: ""Die Person verlässt einfach das Haus, holt das Essen ab und kehrt ohne Anstrengung nach Hause zurück. Das ist nicht fair. Die Person muss verstehen, dass es notwendig ist, sich zu engagieren, um die Lebensmittel zu erhalten"" (Scalco und Fietz 2020) .Ähnlich wie beim Partizipativen Haushalt priorisierte das Programm Fome Zero in seinem Ursprung die Mobilisierung der Einwohner*innen. Als die Regierung sich mehr an Forderungen von internationalen Organisationen wie die Weltbank anpasste, wurden ihre Social Policies zunehmend vom Neoliberalismus mit seinem individualistischen und politisch demobilisierenden Charakter geprägt, wie beispielsweise der direkte Geldtransfer 2 . Der Unterschied zwischen diesen beiden Modi des Programms Fome Zero -einer mit der Erfordernis einer Gegenleistung in Form politischer Partizipation und der andere nur mit Registrierung in einem nationalen Register für Sozialprogramme -hat die Frage um Verdienst versus Gerechtigkeit in der Sozialpolitik auf die Tagesordnung der eigenen Gemeinde gesetzt.Die Einführung eines großen Programms für den direkten Geldtransfer an Menschen in absoluter Armut in Brasilien deutet auf die Ausbreitung neoliberalen Gedankenguts hin, das die gesellschaftliche Zugehörigkeit der Bürger*innen nicht über einen Citizenship-Status mit Rechten und Pflichten, sondern über den Markt konzipiert (Silva 2014) . Anstelle einer Politik der sozialen Inklusion, die auf dem egalitären Prinzip basiert und alle Mitglieder einer Gesellschaft umfasst, wurde in Brasilien das Programm Bolsa Família ins Leben gerufen, das nur das physische Überleben sichern soll. Es besteht aus einem direkten Geldtransfer an Familien mit einem Pro-Kopf-Einkommen von weniger als einem Viertel des Mindestlohns (ca. 15 C pro Monat!). Derzeit kommt es rund 14 Mio. Familien zugute 3 -was vom Ausmaß der extremen Armut in Brasilien zeugt. Bevorzugte Empfängerinnen der Leistung sind Frauen, da sie bei wechselnden Familienformationen in der Regel den Anker der Familienkontinuität bilden 4 .In der akademischen Diskussion unterscheiden sich die Bewertungen des Programms Bolsa Família sehr voneinander. Diejenigen, die es befürworten, betonen den Kampf gegen absoluten Hunger und Elend, seine Rolle bei der Wertschätzung von Frauen in der Familie und die Bedingung, dass die Kinder zur Schule gehen müssen und regelmäßig zur Gesundheitskontrolle gehen sollen. Leão Walquíria Rego und Alessandro Pinzani (2014) fügen dieser Liste noch eine interessante Reflexion über eine angeblich durch Geld ermöglichte Autonomie hinzu. Kritiker*innen des Programms hingegen stellen die Auferlegung von Konditionen in Frage, durch die der Staat sich in das Leben von Familien einmischt, und den sehr geringen Geldbetrag, der für eine sechsköpfige Familie bis zu umgerechnet 45 C betragen kann. Sie weisen auch darauf hin, dass es die Zielgruppe demobilisiert, sie von Bürger*innen zu Konsument*innen degradiert und in marktorientierte Strategien einfügt -und darüber hinaus die soziale Ungleichheit nicht verringert (Lavinas 2013) .In der Gemeinde Morro da Cruz profitiert eine beträchtliche Anzahl von Familien von diesem Programm. Als Kampf gegen den Hunger hat es zweifellos einen Beitrag geleistet. Aber Claudia Fonseca, Lucia Mury Scalco und Helisa Canfield de Castro (2018) zeigen auch, dass seine demobilisierende Wirkung in der Gemeinde sehr deutlich bemerkbar ist. Während der Notstandsperiode aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie, auf die wir weiter unten noch eingehen werden, hatte die Teilnahme an Bolsa-Família-Programm auch indirekte Auswirkungen. Da diese Familien bereits eine soziale Identifikationsnummer hatten, konnten sie vor den anderen Einwohnern von den Notfallmaßnahmen der Regierung profitieren, während andere Familien zuerst den langen und manchmal schwierigen Weg der Suche nach Unterlagen und der Registrierung zurücklegen mussten.Diese Gemeinde, die so weit von der Stadt entfernt ist und nur sehr prekär von Public Policies profitiert, braucht die Unterstützung sowohl der Einwohner*innen untereinander als auch die Zusammenarbeit über die Grenzen der Gemeinde hinaus, um flexibel auf dringende Bedürfnisse reagieren zu können. Als die Stadt Porto Alegre aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie Social Distancing verordnete, waren die Einwohner*innen der Gemeinde Morro da Cruz sehr betroffen. Nicht nur die ohnehin unzureichenden Public Policies wurden unterbrochen, sondern auch die wirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten der überwiegenden Mehrheit, insbesondere derjenigen, die informelle Tätigkeiten ausübten oder im häuslichen Dienst arbeiteten.Die seit 2006 in der Gemeinde aktive NGO Coletivo Autônomo Morro da Cruz 5 war eine der ersten, die reagierte und Solidaritätsaktionen organisierte, um Spenden zu sammeln. Mit diesen Ressourcen werden seitdem Grundnahrungsmittelkörbe verteilt und Gemeindesuppen zubereitet. Derzeit arbeiten 22 Freiwillige regelmäßig in der NGO. Es sind teils externe, bereits graduierte Fachkräfte, Student*innen, Techniker*innen, Autodidakt*innen, aber hauptsächlich Mitglieder der Gemeinde. Aufgrund der lange zurückreichenden lokalen Einbindung der externen Freiwilligen und der Einbeziehung von lokalen Familien konnten Solidarität, externe Unterstützung und lokales Wissen schnell mobilisiert werden.Vor der Krise bestand die Arbeit des Coletivo Autônomo Morro da Cruz hauptsächlich in der Betreuung von Schulkindern außerhalb der Unterrichtszeit. Neben Nachhilfe-Workshops wurden auch Englisch, Poesie, Rap, Capoeira, Tänze, Yoga und Kunsthandwerk angeboten. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass sich die Aktivitäten nicht nur auf Kinder begrenzten. Auch die Familien der Kinder wurden begleitet. Einige davon befanden sich in einer prekären und gefährdeten Lage und wurden durch psychologische Beratung und Familientherapie unterstützt, damit sie die Bindung zu ihren Kindern verbessern und eventuell neue Erwerbstätigkeiten finden können. Dazu kam ein Gesundheitsprojekt mit Kinderarzt und nach Möglichkeit die Öffnung der Räumlichkeiten für andere Kinder aus der Gemeinde zur freien Nutzung. Die abrupte Unterbrechung aufgrund der Krise erfolgte kurz bevor eine neue Gruppe von Kindern in prekärer Lage aufgenommen werden sollte. 5 Lucia Mury Scalco ist seit 15 Jahren in der Gemeinde aktiv und ist derzeit Vorsitzende dieser NGO.Dank der Vertrautheit der Mitglieder der NGO mit den Lebensbedingungen der Familien erkannten sie bald, dass aufgrund der umfassenden Stilllegung des öffentlichen Lebens bald eine schwere Krise eintreten würde. Angesichts der erahnten Auswirkungen wurde beschlossen, sofort zu handeln. Die Frage, die alle sich stellten, war: Was ist jetzt möglich, unter Beachtung der Vorgaben zu Social Distancing und Hygiene? In Zusammenarbeit mit Moeda do Bem, einem engagierten Sozialunternehmen aus dem Bereich Informatik 6 , entstand die Aktion: ""Möge die Solidarität ansteckender sein als das Virus!"" Sie bestand darin, über die Moeda-do-Bem-Webseite Spenden für die Nothilfe für Familien zu sammeln. Eine Facebook-Seite wurde erstellt, um alle möglichen Kontakte in einer schneeballartigen Erweiterung zu aktivieren und den Spendenaufruf so vielen Menschen wie möglich zukommen zu lassen. Der erste Aufruf erfolgte bereits am dritten Tag nach der verordneten Unterbrechung des normalen Lebens.Eine weitere Initiative derselben Partnerschaft war die Entwicklung einer kleinen App zur Registrierung der Familien und zum Versenden eines Fragebogens über WhatsApp. Damit sollte herausgefunden werden, wie umfangreich das Einkommen eingebrochen war und welche dringenden Bedürfnisse die Familien hatten. Der Fragebogen sollte von einer Person aus jeder Familie innerhalb des Hauses mit eingeschalteter Standorteinstellung beantwortet werden. Auf diese Weise konnten zwei Aspekte gleichzeitig sichergestellt werden: dass jede Familie von einer einzigen Registrierung profitiert und dass der Grundnahrungsmittelkorb korrekt geliefert werden kann. Letzteres ist sehr wichtig, da ein großer Teil des Gemeindegebiets keine Straßen mit Namen oder Häuser mit Nummern hat. Gesammelt wurden neben den Standortdaten unter anderem die Anzahl der Personen in der Wohnung, die Existenzgrundlage und der dringendste Bedarf. Nach Ausfüllung des Fragebogens wurden die Daten direkt an einen Server gesendet und analysiert. Die Antworten zeigten, dass die Unterbrechung der wirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten und der öffentlichen Dienstleistungen in Verbindung mit der Tatsache, dass diese Familien im Allgemeinen keine finanziellen Reserven haben, Lebensmittel (95 % der Antworten) und Reinigungsprodukte zum dringendsten Bedarf machten. Anhand dieser Angaben wurde der Inhalt für einen Basiskorb mit 25 Artikeln mit Lebensmitteln, Hygienematerial und in bestimmten Fällen auch Medikamenten, Windeln und einem persönlichen Hygienekit definiert, der dann verteilt wurde. Mit den gesammelten Mitteln wurden die Körbe bei lokalen Läden innerhalb der Gemeinde gekauft, um so die gesammelten Spenden in der Gemeinde selbst zu investieren. Die Lieferung an die Familien erfolgte durch Freiwillige der NGO direkt an die über die Standortdaten ermittelte Adresse. Bei der Übergabe wurde ein Foto aufgenommen, das auf der Facebook-Seite veröffentlicht wurde. Dies diente der Öffentlichkeitsarbeit ebenso wie als Mittel der sozialen Kontrolle. Bereits nach knapp zwei Monaten hatten sich 1394 Familien registriert, von denen 80 % Kinder und 26 % ältere Menschen einschlossen. Damit wurden durch diese Aktion rund 5700 Einwohner*innen begünstigt.Als später die kalte Jahreszeit begann, organisierte sich eine Gruppe von Frauen aus der Gemeinde, um in sehr kalten Nächten eine Gemeinschaftssuppe vorzubereiten und zu verteilen. Die Zutaten wurden von ihnen selbst ausgewählt, in örtlichen Geschäften gekauft und anschließend von der Coletivo Autônomo Morro da Cruz bezahlt. Überlegungen, was die Mahlzeit enthalten soll, welche Zutaten billiger sind und ähnliche Themen wurden über WhatsApp-Gruppen diskutiert. Die Vorbereitung erfolgte in den Häusern der teilnehmenden Frauen und die ärmsten Familien wurden eingeladen, Portionen abzuholen, die der Anzahl der Hausbewohner*innen entsprachen. In einem rotierenden System profitieren davon jeweils rund 120 Personen. Es entstanden während dieser Aktion auch andere Ideen, wie beispielsweise die Verteilung von Büchern, die von der Vereinigung der Schriftsteller von Rio Grande do Sul gespendet wurden. Mit den registrierten Adressen konnten darüber hinaus tägliche Informationen über die COVID-19-Situation in der Stadt und andere wichtige Informationen übermittelt werden. Damit wurde nicht nur Unterstützung zur Deckung der Grundbedürfnisse in der Krise organisiert, sondern es konnten auch Kultur und Informationen gezielt angeboten werden. Die Idee ist, weiterhin Spenden zu sammeln, um neue Projekte aufzubauen.Auf den ersten Blick war die Aktion ein großer Erfolg. Aber es wurde punktuell auch Kritik geübt. Die Verteilung der Grundnahrungsmittelkörbe war so konzipiert, dass sie unter strenger Einhaltung der Regeln des Social Distancing und der Vermeidung von Agglomerationen erfolgen konnte. Da alle registrierten Familien ein Telefon mit Zugang zum Netzwerk über WhatsApp hatten, konnten sie auch Rückmeldungen geben. Auf der Facebook-Seite, das von der Gemeinde meistgenutzte soziale Netzwerk, gab es ebenfalls die Möglichkeit, Meinungen auszudrücken. Es wurden sowohl unterstützende als auch kritische Meinungen geäußert, von denen wir einige unten transkribieren.Da die Aktion nur für die Gemeinde Morro da Cruz vorgesehen war, mussten Vorsichtsmaßnahmen getroffen werden, um zu verhindern, dass sich Familien aus anderen Gebieten registrieren. Es musste aber auch Transparenz geschaffen und so gut wie möglich verhindert werden, dass mehrere Personen aus derselben Familie sich registrieren und folglich anderen nicht geholfen werden könnte. Daher wurde in der App die Bedingung der aktiven Standortbestimmung eingefügt. Und jeder, der sich registrieren wollte, erhielt folgende Warnung: Achtung: Beantworte den Fragebogen auf Deinem Handy. Stelle sicher, dass die Standortbestimmung in den Einstellungen aktiviert ist. Die Verbindung funktioniert nur für Morro da Cruz.Im Allgemeinen war es überraschend, wie viele Personen teilnahmen und sich registrierten. In einer Gemeinde, in der ein Teil der Einwohner große Schwierigkeit mit dem Schreiben hat, könnten sich bei der Registrierung ausschließlich über das Handy ebenfalls Schwierigkeiten ergeben. Dies war der Fall bei einer Frau, die schrieb: ""Ich habe die Gelegenheit verpasst, weil ich nicht wusste, wie ich auf meinem Handy schreibe."" Da das Volumen der verfügbaren Ressourcen nicht für alle reichte und die Körbe in der Reihenfolge der Registrierung verteilt wurden, war eine schnelle Registrierung wichtig. Deshalb konnten sich einige Personen nicht rechtzeitig registrieren: ""Mein Gott, es ist sehr schnell vorbei. Sobald Sie [die Einladung] posten, sind schon alle vergeben."" In dem einen oder anderen Fall gab es einen gewissen Widerstand gegen die Registrierung, wie die folgende Bemerkung zeigt: Ja, diejenigen, die es wirklich brauchen, die bekommen nichts, ganz zu schweigen von der Demütigung, Fotos zu machen, die dann in Facebook-Gruppen landen. 7 Diese Personen wollten ihr Foto nicht in einem sozialen Netzwerk sehen und nahmen dafür in Kauf, die Hilfe nicht zu erhalten. Seitens der Organisator*innen war die Veröffentlichung der Bilder eine Möglichkeit, Transparenz zu schaffen: Jeder in der Gemeinde konnte überprüfen, was mit den Ressourcen gemacht wurde und wer in der Gemeinde den Warenkorb bekommen hat.Es gab aber auch viele zufriedene und dankbare Äußerungen von Einwohner*innen:Ich bin sehr dankbar. Ich habe den Korb angenommen, weil ich ihn wirklich brauche. Ich arbeite als Reinigungskraft [d. h. Tagesjob], kann aber wegen dieses Corona-Virus keine Arbeit bekommen. Vielen Dank, möge Gott euch jeden Tag mehr und mehr segnen. Am Anfang haben wir [die Suppe] in kleinen Portionen verteilt. Jetzt kommen die Leute mit einem Topf, mit einem großen Topf. (Freiwillige Suppenköchin) Ich bin sehr glücklich. Du hast keine Ahnung, wie glücklich ich bin! Innerhalb der Gemeinde herrscht bei einigen Menschen ein starker Sinn für Gerechtigkeit und Solidarität. Sie sind davon überzeugt, dass das Wenige, das sie haben, gleichmäßig verteilt werden sollte. Vor diesem Hintergrund gab es mehrere kritische Äußerungen. Eine Beschwerde war, dass einige Familien die Regel, dass sich jede Familie nur einmal registrieren solle, nicht respektierten. Wie bereits erwähnt, wurde diese Regel durch die Standortbestimmung des Mobiltelefons kontrolliert. Aber wo es ein Hindernis gibt, wird jemand herausfinden, wie man es überwinden kann. Also warnten andere Einwohner*innen:Ich finde diese Hilfe für die Einwohner des Morro da Cruz wirklich cool, aber ich habe ein Foto von einem Ehepaar gesehen, das jeweils einen Korb genommen hat. Richtig wäre, [pro Familie] nur einen zu bekommen, denn es gibt viele Leute in der Gemeinde, die ihn wirklich brauchen. Das ist meine Meinung.Zusätzlich gab es weitere kritische Aussagen, die zeigen, wie man in der Gemeinde die Handlungen anderer bewertet. Eine dieser Bewertungen betraf die Frage der Bedürftigkeit: Menschen, die in den Augen Anderer als weniger bedürftig ange-sehen wurden, hätten Hilfe erhalten, während andere, bedürftigere Einwohner diese nicht hätten bekommen können:Viele Menschen brauchen sie [die Hilfe] wirklich und bekommen sie nicht. Aber dann sehe ich ein Foto von Menschen, die eigene Ressourcen haben. Das ekelt mich an. Es stimmt, Leute, die es nicht wirklich brauchen, haben zugegriffen [...].Es mag übersehen worden sein, dass die Verordnung von Social Distancing dazu geführt hat, dass viele Menschen, die bis dahin wirtschaftlich etwas komfortabler gelebt hatten, ihr Einkommen und damit die Fähigkeit verloren haben, dringende Grundbedürfnisse zu befriedigen. Die kritischen Äußerungen veranlassen uns, über ein letztes Thema nachzudenken, nämlich die Frage, wer ""die Armen"" sind -ohne uns auf die traditionell erfassten, aber zu undifferenzierten, statistischen Wirtschaftsindikatoren zu stützen.Solidarische Aktionen in Zeiten großer Not finden glücklicherweise immer noch ein positives Echo in unseren Gesellschaften. Je stärker die lokale Gemeinde an der Organisation dieser Aktionen beteiligt ist, desto konkreter werden jedoch Probleme, wie beispielsweise der Unterschied zwischen ""arm sein"" und ""in Not sein"". Wer ist in einer Gemeinde wie die auf dem Morro da Cruz eines Grundnahrungsmittelkorbs oder einer anderen Nothilfe würdig? So gestellt, kann diese Frage kaum endgültig beantwortet werden. Es erscheint jedoch durchaus vernünftig, Situationen wie den aktuellen Notfall zu nutzen, um einen Schritt zurückzugehen und die Frage zu stellen, was Armut ist. Dieses Thema ist sehr sichtbar und mobilisiert aufgrund seiner Beziehung zur Ungleichheit Regierungen, Akademiker*innen und die Gesellschaft im Allgemeinen. Aus verschiedenen sozioökonomischen, geografischen, ethnischen, religiösen und sogar geschlechtsspezifischen Gründen bleibt der Zugang zu einem Teller mit Lebensmitteln, zu Bildung, Gesundheit, Elektrizität, sauberem Wasser, Transportmitteln und anderen wichtigen Dienstleistungen für Millionen von Menschen unerreichbar (Sobottka 2009a) .Unter den wichtigsten internationalen entwicklungsorientierten Organisationen (UNO, Weltbank, FAO usw.) besteht die Tendenz, die sogenannte absolute Armut anhand eines monetären Kriteriums zu messen: beispielsweise 1 oder 1,5 US-Dollar pro Tag und pro Person. Diejenigen unterhalb dieser imaginären Armutsgrenze gelten als ernsthaft von Hunger bedroht. Fast jede*r fühlt sich betroffen, wenn Fotos von unterernährten Kindern in Afrika, Arbeitnehmer*innen unter unmenschlichen Bedingungen in Asien oder alarmierende Zahlen in den vielen sogenannten technischen Berichten veröffentlicht werden. Diese Berichte stellen im Allgemeinen weder die Frage nach den Gründen für die Armut noch zeigen sie die Zusammenhänge zwischen ihr und der absurden Konzentration des Reichtums. Sie liefern Zahlen, wobei die Logik des täglichen Überlebens als Kriterium verwendet wird -als ob dieses ein ausreichendes Kriterium für ein menschenwürdiges Leben wäre.Die tiefen Meinungsverschiedenheiten treten hervor, wenn neben den wirtschaftlichen Aspekten, die sich auf das bloße Überleben beziehen, auch Fragen, die aus anderen politischen Einstellungen entstehen, mit auf die Tagesordnung kommen, um die Debatte zu erweitern und vertiefen. Dann werden mit dem Phänomen Armut zugleich der intrinsische Zusammenhang von Armut und Reichtum sowie soziale und subjektive Dimensionen priorisiert. Tatsächlich ist das Konzept der Armut ein kontroverses und immer auch politisches Thema, und die Debatte wird polemisch, sobald die Analyse konkret wird und sich auf objektiv identifizierbare soziale Situationen bezieht. Was ist zum Beispiel Armut oder wer sind die Armen in Brasilien? 8 Woher kommt ihre Armut und wohin ist der von ihnen produzierte Reichtum verschleppt worden? Welche Beziehung besteht zwischen der zunehmenden Anzahl an Millionär*innen, der Ausbeutung durch sogenannte Investor*innen des internationalen Kapitalmarktes und den rasant wachsenden Armutsvierteln? Wer kann konsumieren und wie viel müssen sie konsumieren? Eine weitere sehr wichtige Frage: Was denken die Armen selbst über ihre Situation?Die brasilianischen Sozialwissenschaften haben eine bedeutende Tradition in der Forschung zum Thema Armut (Camargo et al. 1976; Sobottka 2009b; Sarti 2009 ). In diesen Ansätzen werden Thesen infrage gestellt, die Knappheit, Bedürftigkeit und Überlebenslogik als zentrale Kategorien benutzen, um das Handeln dieses Teils der brasilianischen Bevölkerung zu erklären. Stattdessen ziehen sie es vor, Armut als eine spezifische analytische Dimension aufzufassen (ohne sie isoliert zu betrachten), in der Holismus, Ehre und familiäre Solidarität oft weitaus wichtiger sind als materielle Ressourcen.Wir haben viele Jahre lang die Peripherie erforscht und festgestellt, dass die Realität dieser Gemeinden sehr pluralistisch ist und dass es unbedingt erforderlich ist, den wirtschaftlichen Determinismus zu überwinden und eine breitere Perspektive einzunehmen, die nicht nur durch wirtschaftliche Ressourcen und Kaufkraft oder Einkommen definiert wird, sondern auch symbolische und soziale Dimensionen wie Ethos, traditionelle Bindungen und Lebensstil berücksichtigt. Die Knappheit an materiellen Ressourcen ist kein homogenes Ganzes: Es gibt subjektives Empfinden, gruppeninterne Maßstäbe und Solidarität, die dazu beitragen, den Mangel an Geld und Armut überhaupt zu relativieren und zu überwinden. Viele Menschen, die wir kennen, betrachten sich nicht als arm, aber sie führen zweifellos einen schlichten Lebensstil und bekennen sich als dem zugehörig, was sie als ""Peripherie"" bezeichnen. In diesem Sinne können wir sagen, dass Armut sowohl ein relatives als auch ein relationales Konzept ist. Es gibt verschiedene Kriterien, die für Armut angewandt werden können, sei es Einkommen, Wohnungssituation, Beschäftigung, Macht, Familie, Kinder, Gesundheit, Freund*innen. Armutsforschung ist oft der methodischen Gefahr ausgesetzt, unter die Kategorie ""arm"" alle Mitglieder der unteren sozialen Schichten zuzuordnen. Gemessen an was oder verglichen mit wem wären sie arm? Eine kontextunabhängige bzw. -übergreifende Bemessung von Armut zeugt eher von einem subkomplexen Ansatz als von einer unbefriedigenden Lebenssituation.In der Krise, die durch die COVID-19-Pandemie in Brasilien verursacht wurde, haben Millionen Brasilianer*innen plötzlich ihr Einkommen verloren. Auch wer zuvor mit einer gewissen Würde überlebte, befand sich plötzlich im Elend. Wie wir in der Gemeinde oft hören konnten: ""Ich arbeite tagsüber, um abends zu essen."" Diese sehr arbeitsamen Menschen erhöhten plötzlich die bereits große Zahl derjenigen in der Gemeinde Morro da Cruz, die in Not geraten sind. Auch sie brauchten in der neuen Lage Grundnahrungsmittelkörbe. Dies löste, wie oben gesehen, eine große Kontroverse über die Bemessung von Bedürftigkeit aus. Tatsache ist, dass diese Menschen am Rande der Armut von einem Tag auf den anderen ihr Einkommen auf null abgesenkt sahen. Einige hatten ein älteres Auto, mit dem sie kleine Transporte erledigten, andere hatten einen winzigen ""Tante-Emma-Laden"". Sie gehören zu den am stärksten Betroffenen, da die Regierung sie, wenn überhaupt, nur langsam als Betroffene anerkannte und registrierte. Erst nach einigen Monaten konnten sie eine Nothilfe in Höhe von 600 Real (ca. 106 C) bekommen.Daher ist intensive Feldarbeit vor Ort eine Aufgabe, die die Forscher*innen nicht vernachlässigen dürfen. Situationen ändern sich blitzschnell, und man muss vor Ort sein, zuhören, verstehen, sich austauschen. Theoretische Analysen, die nur auf wirtschaftlichen Daten beruhen, sind reduktionistisch. Sie verstärken eher die Vorurteile gegenüber den Volksklassen. Im Volksmund und in der Repräsentation in den Medien werden die Peripherien vor allem als Regionen angesehen, in denen Menschen mit niedrigem Einkommen wohnen, die in engem Zusammenhang mit Drogenhandel und Kriminalität stehen. Wie zwei Seiten einer Münze sind Favela und die Armen immer noch Ausdrücke, die verwendet werden, um die Bevölkerung dieser Regionen darzustellen. Diese Stereotypen entsprechen nicht der Realität von Menschen in Gemeinden wie der von Morro da Cruz und sie verstärken darüber hinaus noch Diskriminierung und soziale Ausgrenzung.Die aktuelle Notsituation hat gezeigt, wie wichtig es ist, die Werte und Lebenseinstellungen der Menschen in der Peripherie zu verstehen. Sie zeigte aber auch die Notwendigkeit, zu lernen, ihre Bedürfnisse und Rechte zu verstehen. Wir sind der Ansicht, dass es neben der Solidarität in Notfällen jetzt dringend notwendig ist, eine Agenda mit Forderungen nach den Rechten aufzustellen, die dieser Bevölkerung als Bürger*innen zustehen und als Public Policies bereitgestellt werden müssen: In den Peripherien benötigen die Menschen aufbereitetes Trinkwasser, Strom, Gesundheitsversorgung, Zahnärzte, Transportmittel, Schulen, Kindertagesstätten, angenehme Räume für Freizeit und Erholung, Einkommen, Arbeitsmöglichkeiten. Es sind Forderungen, die dringend als öffentliche Dienstleistungen bereitgestellt werden müssen, damit zukünftige Notfälle sich weniger dramatisch und bedrohlich auswirken. Notwendig ist auch, dass andere Mitbürger*innen lernen, dass sie auch diesen Menschen Respekt und Anerkennung schulden. Nach Ende der aktuellen Notsituation hat die Gemeinde Morro da Cruz noch eine lange Agenda vor sich, um ihren legitimen Anspruch auf Solidarität und egalitäre Inklusion in der Stadt Porto Alegre zu erlangen. Und diejenigen, die nicht die gleichen Entbehrungen erleiden, stehen vor der ethischen Herausforderung, eigenes solidarisches Engagement nach ihren Möglichkeiten mit einzubringen.",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-27,11
2135e46ead80f7d51091c4d08c66db4d10da0fc3,"Amazonian destruction, Bolsonaro and COVID-19: Neoliberalism unchained","represent the most egregious of many egregious cases on the ground zero of neoliberalism unchained. With the rise of Bolsonaro, we can see that the previous conjuncture characterised by the hegemony of PT and Lula was the exception to Brazil's long embrace of the caudillo going back to the 1930s. Even then, a look at the mechanism of Lula's rule raises questions as to precisely what changed under Lula when it came to the state and the rule of big capital.Covid-19, rainforest fires, neo-liberal authoritarianism, accumulation by dispossession, creative destruction, LulaThe Amazon fires of 2019 accompanied the greatest single-year loss of Brazilian forest in a decade (The Guardian 2019). With the world in the grip of a pandemic, however, forest loss in 2020 has dwarfed the devastation of the previous year. In April 2020 alone, 529 sq km of forest was destroyed -an increase of 171% on April 2019 (TerraBrasil 2020). The facilitation of environmental crimes and aggression towards indigenous, agrarian reform and African-descendent communities has been a particular hallmark of the Bolsonaro administration in the Amazon region with distinct social implications. 1 As cases of COVID-19 grow by the day in remote areas of the Amazon, a recent study indicates that indigenous lands that aren't formally demarcated are more vulnerable to intrusion and hence disease, with illegal loggers emerging as a key vector of COVID-19 transmission in a region with Brazil's lowest number of intensive care units. Of the 10,300 cases of COVID-19 confirmed among indigenous people living in the country by July, there have been an estimated 408 deaths, with 347 in the Amazon region (Globo 2020) .The weakening of environmental protection in the Amazon has been systematic. Bolsonaro has challenged the Federal Justice order for the government to establish bases for environmental inspectors to restrict illegal logging and mining in hotspots of felling and burning (Ministério Público Federal 2020). These are areas in the Amazon where 60% of all deforestation occurs (Figure 1 ). With attention turned to the health crisis, the Minister of the Environment, Ricardo Salles, sacked the director of the federal environmental inspection agency, IBAMA, who had overseen a successful anti-mining operation on indigenous land in the interior of Pará and the Brazilian government reduced the budget for the environmental inspection agency IBAMA by 25% (Amazonia 2020). Many of the recent setbacks in Brazil's environmental policy could be explained by a video that was released by court order on 22 May. The video shows a meeting between Bolsonaro and his ministers from a month before, in which environment minister Salles suggests the government take advantage of press attention being focused on the pandemic to relax regulations in the Amazon (The Guardian 2020).The Brazilian Amazon may be on the eve of a catastrophe. COVID-19 could decimate indigenous communities, while the government response paves the way for profiteers to further degrade their lands and the forest. Bolsonaro's legacy may be one of the highest national death tolls during the pandemic, and a point of no return for destruction of the Amazon Brazil: back to the future, forward to the past More than a chilling depiction for the rapacious, 'creative destruction' of late capitalism in the era of neoliberalism, the burning of the Brazilian rainforest is part of the story of accumulation by dispossession (Harvey 2001 ) characterised by violent assaults on human and ecological resources worldwide. If COVID-19 also is now becoming a metaphor for the poisonous spread of neoliberal globalisation, plunder and land grabs in Brazilian rainforest could be seen to represent perhaps the most egregious of many egregious cases on the ground zero of neoliberalism unchained.Today, in the 21st century, when writing about the social and political peculiarities of Bolsanaro's authoritarian regime it would be easy to see its exclusionary and repressive signature as exceptional rather than a return, taking conjuncture, strategy and personnel into account, to the caudillo of Brazil since the 1930s (Quartim 1971) . Indeed, with the rise of Bolsonaro and the social classes and political forces that propelled him to office, it is the previous conjuncture characterised by the hegemony of PT (Workers' Party) and Lula, which can be seen to have been exceptional. Or perhaps not. Even then, a look at the mechanism of Lula's rule raises questions as to precisely what changed under Lula in respect to state structure, political processes and the rule of big capital. While of course not in any sense comparable to the political project of incorporation-subordination introduced under Vargas' Estado Novo (between 1937and 1941 social welfare legislation to contain class conflict including the 8-hour day, paid holidays and a minimum wage (Quartim 1971: 28) ), nevertheless, PT's rise to government never challenged the rule of capital and indeed deepened subservience to agribusiness (Oliveira 2009 ): the working class may have been in power but were never in control, the fate of social democratic governments everywhere today (Frankel 1997; Streeck 2017) . The path from dictatorship to the liberal democratic ascendance of working-class political forces in 2003 is, therefore, crucial in any exploration of the current deepening of social subordination always central to the process of accumulation by dispossession.The military regime that took control following the CIA-backed overthrow of the leftist President Goulart oversaw the so-called Brazilian 'economic miracle' between 1964 and 1973 with the gross domestic product (GDP) growing annually by 11% between 1964 and 1973. Imports were crucial being dependent on oil but also international credit. Military rule ensured savage wage control and labour movement repression. In the period immediately following the 1973 oil crisis, Brazil's petroleum-based imports increased significantly while the state continued to subsidise the involvement of international companies in massive infrastructure projects such as the TransAmazonia highway (Ianni 1979) . In 1974, Brazil borrowed more money than it had in the previous 150 years. Following massive interest rate hikes in 1979 after the second oil crisis and in 1982, the country experienced the greatest debt default in post-war history. Enter the IMF (International Monetary Fund)! Unsurprisingly, as social programmes were further trashed, the poorest 20% of the population saw their share of income drop from 3.9% in 1960 to 2.8% in the early 1980s, driving protests around social, labour and land reform from which would emerge CUT, PT and MST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra -Landless Peoples' Movement). Despite the power and ingenuity of these movements, the new democratic opening in 1985, which preceded the formulation of a new constitution in 1988, failed to guarantee economic rights.IMF and World Bank-driven structural adjustment programmes saw deregulation of state owned enterprises, the lifting of import tariffs and the end of credit support for the rural poor. As migration to the cities gathered pace by 2001 the favelas became home to 15 million unemployed people; the country saw a massive increase in work precarity and the neoliberal model was discredited to such an extent that space opened up for political change.Brazil's Workers' Party was central to articulating the mobilisation of a broad range of social and labour movements throughout the 1980s and early 2000s, but it would become apparent that this class base of workers and the dispossessed was not in itself sufficient to change the class character of the state. By the time of its successful election to power in 2002, PT's centre of gravity had already shifted demonstrably from its anticapitalist origins (Antunes 2019), while the party did not have parliamentary majorities sufficient to bring any change without deal-making. Furthermore, the loyalty of social movement leaderships and the co-option of CUT trade unionists into power left the union base poorly organised. The more radical trade unionists were already turning their backs on Lula. Perhaps this was not surprising since as Antunes (2019) has argued, PT had 'converted itself into a party 'for all', 'able to take power' without challenging the status quo' (p. 3). This is in no sense to diminish the important social and economic character of the gains under PT, including the real minimum wage enhancements, the construction of and broader access to public universities, and the oft-cited 2004 Programa bolsa famolia 2 (PBF); rather it is to argue that it is impossible to make sense of the relative ease with which Bolsonaro's ersatz dictatorship rose to power without identifying the relatively fragile impact of state transformation under Lula. 3 Many hoped that the Workers' Party 2003 electoral victory would be the first nail in the coffin of neoliberalism, a kick in the backside of the neoliberal consensus that had been dominant since the 1980s. What PT did, however, was to introduce a modest degree of dirigisme into industry together with meek social and public policy reforms.While aiming to reduce massive social inequalities, the perception was that this could be achieved via a push towards primary commodity production and exports. Specifically, an increasing reliance on China's purchase of foodstuffs, agricultural produce more generally, and inevitably metals/ores (see inter alia, Garvey et al. 2019; Wilkinson and Wesz Jr. 2013 ) and incentivising domestic consumption (e.g. white goods and cars). Foreign direct investment (FDI) in minerals, agriculture and farm animals saw a huge rise: US$2.4 billion in 2000 to US$13.1 billion by 2007, while the conditional cash payments of the Bolsa Familia programme (PBF) increased household purchasing power. It was the social and political motivations and mobilisations which gave the PBF its significance rather than its class-shifting character, which was limited, and dependant on the commodities boom, the end of which heralded a new assault on the working class. Making sense of the import of cash transfer payments under the PBF is important since it illustrates both the context and time of this provision. It was a product of class conciliation, the modus operandi for soi-disant gains leveraged by social democratic parties in the current neoliberal era: enticements-cum-inducements sold as win-win outcomes even though, in the case of the PBF, the ability to deliver for labour was inextricably tied to the fortunes, literally, of finance and multinational capital. The privatisations required by capital in exchange for support for PTs limited social programmes were very significant. Not long after the Workers' Party's demise, Petras' (2016) assessment was bleak: ""If we examine Brazilian merger and acquisitions activity and investment bank revenues, one sees a close correlation with the rise and fall of the PT regime. In other words, when the bankers, speculators and monopolists flourished under the PT policies, they supported the government of Lula and Dilma"". Moreover, ""With the recession fully underway, the business and banking elite demanded large-scale, longterm cuts in public expenditures, slashing budgets for the poor, education, health, housing and pensions, severe wage reduction and a sharp limit on consumer credit. At the same time they pushed through the privatization of the multi-billion dollar petroleum industry [Petrobras] and related state industries [. . .] and whatever else among Brazil's public jewels could compensate for their drop in investment bank revenues and management fees for M&As"". (Petras 2016) Thus, the limited character of social and political change under PT played no small part in the means and manner of Bolsonaro's triumph. While we write 'limited' they were nevertheless important, but one problem was that they were insufficiently deep and extensive to weather the storm of neoliberal attack. Large sections of the working class who had benefitted directly from PT saw some of their gains being whittled away; recession led to unpopular austerity measures by Dilma; rising costs and unemployment. It is fair to say a large portion of the working class, disillusioned with the spending on mega projects such as the Olympics and World Cup, joined protests that (abetted by the conservative mainstream and social media campaigns) eventually turned on the government and PT, especially with the so-called operation 'carwash' corruption scandal. The Right was able to present PT as criminal, corrupt and this played into the hands of Bolosnaro's populism. The latter successfully constructed an electoral bloc around a reactionary politics that included the capture of 'anti-corruption' sentiment, moral virtue (e.g. anti LGBT attacks) and 'social order' that tied up a huge percentage of the evangelical vote, which has huge influence across society, including the poor, urban peripheries and favelas.Critical aspects of Petras' argument accepted, nevertheless, the depth of the assault upon the working class, including labour and migrant workers, would not have been so extensive, rapacious, and destructive of human and physical resources had the gains made by subordinate social forces after 2003 not been perceived to have been so significant in material terms. That is to say that the nature of capital's offensive under Bolsonoro's regime highlights the fact that the limited gains made, in historical terms, were highly threatening to capital. Nor would the material aggression towards the environment, the killings of social movement opponents of capital's new cycle of accumulation by dispossession, been so insistent had the limited cultural-ideological gains, and wider social promise of a socially progressive government not been so threatening to the neoliberals. The PSDB (Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a centrist formation) would not tolerate a further 4 years had PT's Dilma won the election. That would have left the Right out of power for well over a decade. Members of other parties who would have voted with PT in exchange for favours turned to PSDB and this led to Dilma's impeachment. Let's just call it a coup. The solution hit upon, favoured by some though not necessarily all neoliberals was Bolsonaro, the latest in a long line of caudillos, whose legacies provide worrying signs for the future.Yet, the Bolsonaro project is fraught with insecurities. Like his mentor in the north, 4 his displays of narcissistic insecurity and contempt for opposition of any kind both obscures his broader agenda while masking the terror of his modus operandi. His project represents an attempt, so far with some success, especially as regards environmental theft and destruction, to push back labour by the neoliberal state unchained. It may not be so surprising that the dominant social classes in a country characterised by the longue durée of class incorporation-subordination, typically ruled by neofascist and military dictatorship for most of the 20th century, should have returned to the form of political class rule with which they were more comfortable following the onset of the 2008 crisis. Indeed, it is worth noting that under Bolsonaro, there are more military ministers today than during the period of the dictatorship , while the powerful rural caucus of land and business owners has increased its number of parliamentary seats.Bolsonaro has all but buried the class conciliation project of the preceding Workers' Party and the agency of class is made to disappear by a manipulative media-legal-political-ecclesiastical system. With a nostalgia towards the military counterrevolution, which 'straightened' society, capital's 'endemic, cumulative, chronic and permanent' structural crisis (Mészáros 2011: 11-12) is being masked by moral preoccupations whereby migrants, women, reds and gay people are blamed for the supposed social deterioration. Those who have not subscribed to the market-liberal/social-autocratic reality of daily exclusion and micro-aggression against social and political minorities have faced sustained denigration.Bolsonaro's callous disregard for COVID-19 infections that have escalated in Brazil, and his support for logging and mining projects that continue as key industries in the Amazon, personify the relentless drive for accumulation that trumps human and ecological reproduction.The manner of the defeat of the Workers' Party and the extent to which its industrial base was hollowed out through co-option, and demoralised by austerity and corruption scandals has left organised labour fragmented and disoriented. The inability of CUT to organise effective general strikes during the impeachment of Dilma and the jailing of Lula was palpable. In the absence of coordinated struggle in the cities, the most visible resistance to this contemporary phase of authoritative capitalism is laid bare in the assassination of land activists in the Amazonian region defending territories coveted by illegal loggers and multinationals alike. Recent online strikes by platform workers and the escalating street protests against Bolsonaro illustrate the fermenting of an opposition to the Bolsonaro regime. These are yet to be forged into coherent alliances or strategies, yet serve as a reminder that neither elitist authoritarianism nor creative forms of resistance across urban and rural abodes are an exception in Brazil's history.

c613c184f9ca21f34ad0d383864c59c15a2ba945,A dataset to assess mobility changes in Chile following local quarantines,"As of November 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat that resulted in around 52 million infected people and more than one million deaths globally [17] . In South America, Chile is among the most severely affected countries, with more than 500 thousand infected people and a death toll that surpassed the 15,000 mark as of November 22nd, 2020. Similarly to other severely affected countries [35, 31, 25, 11, 26, 32, 47] , Chile implemented Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) such as regional lockdown, stay-at-home orders, and travel restrictions, in an attempt to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemics through reducing individual mobility and promoting social distancing. In contrast with countries such as China, Italy, and the USA, which implemented NPIs at the national or regional level [8, 12, 35, 26, 47] , Chile's NPIs were implemented at a very localized level, i.e., cities or urban zones (aka comunas) [28, 20] . Thus, two comunas in the same region may be regulated by different NPIs: whereas one is in lockdown, adjacent ones might have no travel restrictions. Given the peculiarity of NPIs' spatial scale in Chile, tracking mobility changes is crucial to assess local quarantines' efficacy and measure the effect of mobility reductions on predicting the virus spread [10] .Mobile phone records provide an unprecedented opportunity in tracking human movements [7, 5] , allowing for estimating presences and population density [24, 16, 40] , mobility patterns [27, 37, 46, 1, 5] , flows [30, 4, 9] , and socioeconomic status [41, 18, 23, 45, 38] . When used correctly and adequately aggregated to preserve privacy [14, 15, 42, 43, 22] , mobile phone data represent a crucial tool for supporting public health actions across the phases of the COVID-19 pandemic [39, 10] . Motivated by the potential of mobile phone data in capturing the geographical spread of epidemics [21, 48, 50, 6] , researchers and governments have started to collaborate with mobile network operators to estimate the effectiveness of control measures in several countries [33, 34, 12, 44, 35, 36, 2, 13, 28, 3] .To assess the impact of the NPIs imposed by Chilean authorities in response to the epidemics, we analyse a mobile phone dataset provided by Telefónica Chile, which comprises 31 billion eXtended Detail Records (XDRs) and 5.4 million users distributed all over the country covering the period February 26th, 2020 to September 20th, 2020. An XDR is created every time a user explicitly requests an HTTP address or their device automatically downloads content from the Internet (e.g., emails, text messages), thus describing individual movements in great detail [40] . From the XDRs, we derive three epidemiologically relevant metrics: the Index of Internal Mobility (IM int ), which quantifies the amount of mobility within each comuna of the country; the Index of External Mobility (IM ext ), quantifying the mobility between comunas; and the Index of Mobility (IM), which considers any movement, both within and between comunas. We hence analyse how these metrics change as the COVID-19 epidemics spread out in Chile, highlighting a considerable heterogeneity of response to local quarantines across the country.The datasets we make available will grow as time goes by and, to the best of our knowledge, are the only ones describing mobility changes and dates of local quarantines in Chile. They can be used not only for fighting against the COVID-19 epidemics but will also benefit other research and applications such as emergency response [29, 52] and crowd flow prediction [54, 51, 53] . The datasets described here are currently used at all levels of the Chilean government.Mobile phone operators collect several different streams of mobile phones interaction with the cellular network for billing and operational purposes. Among them are the eXtended Detail Records (XDRs), a mixture of human-and devicetriggered, either by explicitly requesting an HTTP address or automatically downloading content from the Internet (e.g., emails). Formally, an XDR is a tuple (u, t, A, k), in which there is only one antenna A involved, u is the caller's identifier, t is a timestamp of when the record is created, and k is the amount of downloaded information (Figure 1a) . From the XDRs of the individuals, we define two types of trips. Every time a user moves from an antenna to another antenna within the same comuna, they generate an intra-comuna trip. Every time the user moves from an antenna to an antenna in a different comuna, they generate an inter-comuna trip ( Figure 1b ). For each day and comuna, we construct three indicators of mobility based on the intra-and inter-comuna trips:1. IM int (Index of Internal Mobility), the number of intra-comuna trips for that day;2. IM ext (Index of External Mobility), the number of inter-comuna trips for that day;3. IM = IM int + IM ext (Index of Mobility).All the three indices ranges in [0, ∞), where a value of 0 indicates no mobility at all. We normalize the three indices with respect to the number of users that reside in the comuna, estimated as the total number of unique mobile devices whose home antenna falls in that comuna. Each device's home antenna is computed as the antenna in which it has the highest number of XDRs during nighttime (between 7pm and 7am, inclusive) [40, 49] . The number of estimated resident users in the comunas is strongly correlated (R 2 = 0.96, slope=4.37, intercept=298.30) with the official population of the comunas as per the official 2017 Chilean Census.The raw datasets were provided by Telefónica/Movistar Chile, a mobile phone company which possesses between 29-32% of the Chilean mobile phone market. From the raw datasets we construct the three mobility indices described above. The datasets are released under the CC BY 4.0 License and are publicly available at [19] . Table 1 shows the structure of the dataset describing the mobility indices. Each record refers to a comuna in Chile and describes:• the official name of the region (region, type:string);• the identifier of the region as per the official 2017 Chilean Census (rid, type:string);• the official name of the comuna (comuna, type:string);• the identifier of the comuna as per the official 2017 Chilean Census (cid, type:string) 1 ;• the area of the comuna in km 2 (area, type:float);• the values of IM, IM int and IM ext for that day (type:float);• the day the IM, IM int and IM ext values refer to (date, type:date). Table 2 shows the structure of the quarantines dataset. Each record refers to a quarantine regulation and describes:• the identifier of the quarantine regulation (qid, type:integer);• the official name of the comuna (comuna, type:string);• the status of the quarantine, that can be either active or not active (status, type:string);• the coverage of the quarantine, that can be either partial, rural, or complete (coverage, type:string);• the date the quarantine started (start, type:date);• the date the quarantine ended, which is "" -"" if it is still active (end, type:date);• the identifier of the comuna as per the official 2017 Chilean Census (cid, type:string);• the area of the quarantine in m 2 (area, type:float);• the perimeter of the quarantine (perimeter, type:float). In our analysis, we consider two periods: the pre-quarantine period, from March 9th to March 15th, 2020, and the quarantine period, from June 22nd to June 28th, 2020. Although we have two weeks before March 9th, the transition from February to March marks the start of the Fall school semester in Chile. In 2020, March 6th was the start of the semester, so we assume that the ""business as usual"" period would be best represented by the week of March 9th until March 15th. March 16th marked the start of NPIs in Chile, with the closure of schools, universities and large public gatherings. After that, on March 26th, there was a partial lockdown of seven comunas in the Metropolitan Region. By June 22-28, more than half of the population of the country was under quarantine, and mobility was at 40% reduction.During the pre-quarantine period, comunas with high mobility indices and comunas with low mobility indices coexist. Geographically, high-mobility comunas are concentrated near urban areas such as the capital Santiago and, in general, in the center of the country (Figures 6a, 7a, 8a, and 9a) . The northern and southern parts of Chile have fewer high-mobility comunas. The comunas with the highest mobility registered during the pre-quarantine period are located in the regions of Metropolitana de Santiago, Arica y Parinacota, Valparaíso, Ñuble, and Magallanes ( Table 3) .The top-ten comunas with the highest mobility indices change during the quarantine period, except for Rinconada in the region of Valparaíso (Table 4) , mirroring the different degree of reduction in human mobility in the Chilean regions ( Figure 3 ). All regions show a reduction in all three mobility indices during the quarantine period, albeit with different intensities (Figure 2) . At the comuna level, high-mobility comunas are rare and clustered near the large urban areas located in central Chile (Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9) .These results are supported by the distributions of the mobility indices of the two periods (Figure 4 ). There is a clear shift towards the left of the distribution of the IM index ( Figure 4a ): (i) the average IM during the quarantine period (5.16 ± 2.74) is 27.6% lower than the average IM during the pre-quarantine period (7.13 ± 4.15); (ii) the distribution of IM during the quarantine period is more skewed to the left, showing a decrease of the mobility in Chile during the selected days. Regarding IM int and IM ext , we observe no net shift of the curve, but rather a flattening, suggesting that intra-and inter-comuna trips decreased during the quarantine (Figures 4b and 4c ). Table 4 : The ten comunas with the highest average value of the IM index computed over the period from June 22nd and June 28th, 2020.We further analyze the reduction of the mobility defining IM red as the relative reduction of the IM index in the quarantine period with respect to the pre-quarantine period. The distribution of IM red shows that a large number of comunas have a reduced mobility, following Chilean government interventions, by an average of 25.37% ± 43.2 (Figure 4d) . However, comunas that were not in quarantine during the quarantine period do not reduce their mobility significantly (Figure 5a) .The percentage of population that live in comunas where the authorities applied NPIs increases with time ( Figure 5a ) reaches its peak (≈ 57%) in late July 2020. With the increase of the number of people under quarantine, IM red initially increases, but it slightly decreases over time even if both the number of individuals and the number of comunas under quarantine increase. This phenomenon suggests that mobility restrictions are more effective in the shortmedium term and become less effective as time goes by, and it can be observed both at regional (Figure 2 ) and comuna level (Figures 5a and 5b ).The code used for analysis are available at [19] . The data is also available from the general repository of the Ministry of Science of Chile at https://github. com/MinCiencia/Datos-COVID19/tree/master/output/producto33.

ffdd3540303ae1608d46a81886f6fb1b272bea4b,"Journal Pre-proof Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Brazil: a multicenter, prospective cohort study -Original Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Brazil: a multicenter, prospective cohort study ϯ,1 Running title: MIS-C in Brazilian PICUs","In April 2020, a few months after the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, some reports called attention to the increase in hospitalizations of children and adolescents with clinical features similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease (KD) . [1, 2] This condition, initially called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19, was later named multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Several studies have described this new syndrome, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have released a case definition. [8, 9] Currently, it is already known that MIS-C and KD are different clinical entities, [10, 11] and that MIS-C may present with different phenotypes. [11, 12] To date, few studies have been published on COVID-19 or MIS-C in Latin America. A multicenter study from Chile, Colombia, and other countries reported 17 children with COVID-19, but no case of MIS-C; [13] another multicenter study in Brazil reported 79 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which ten were classified as MIS-C; [14] and the other two were case series from southeastern Brazil (66 cases, six of MIS-C), [15] and from northern Brazil (11 cases of MIS-C). [16] The present study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as outcomes of a broader cohort of children with MIS-C in Brazil, the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in South America.This was an observational, multicenter study, partly retrospective, partly prospective, conducted in 17 PICUs from five states in Brazil: 11 in the Southeast, five in the Northeast, and one in the North; 12 private, four public, and one mixed; all associated with the Brazilian Research Network in Pediatric Intensive Care (BRnet-PIC). From March 25 to August 23, 2020, pediatric patients (age range: 1 month -19 years) were consecutively included if they met the CDC case definition[8] for MIS-C: 1) fever > 38.0°C for ≥ 24 hours (objective or subjective); 2) laboratory evidence of inflammation, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: high values of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen, procalcitonin, d-dimer, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), or interleukin 6 (IL-6); elevated neutrophils, reduced lymphocytes, and low albumin; 3) no alternative plausible diagnosis; 4) current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or positive serological tests (IgM, IgG or IgA), or exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case within the four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of all institutions.The families agreed to participate by signing an informed consent form.Demographic, clinical, epidemiological, radiological, laboratory, and outcome data were prospectively collected, using standardized case report forms (REDCap;Vanderbilt University -TN, United States). Laboratory tests were ordered at the discretion of the health team in each pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and according to local availability. Tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection were performed by RT-PCR using oro/nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal aspirates and/or serology. The serological tests to detect the presence of specific COVID-19 antibodies in the blood/serum of the patients were of two types: 1) rapid immunodiagnostic tests (commercially available immunochromatographic lateral flow immunoassays) for detection of IgM and/or IgG;2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for detection of IgM, IgG, and IgA, according to the local availability of these diagnostic tests.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Data processing and statistical analysis Continuous variables were described as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) and categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were categorized in the following groups: Kawasaki-like disease, incomplete KD, acute cardiac dysfunction, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. The analyses were performed using the software R (v. 3.6.1, R Foundation -Vienna, Austria).Fifty-six patients were included. The median age was 6.2 years; 70% were boys; 57%were of mixed-race or Black; about 20% had comorbidities, of which almost half were chronic neurological diseases; and of the patients who reported contact with a suspected case (approximately half), almost 100% were household contacts. SARS-CoV-2 infection could be confirmed in 55% of patients, since RT-PCR and serology immunoassays were not available in all PICU: 14 out of 30 tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom five also presented serology (two positive); 19 out of 22 tested positive by serology, of whom 18 also underwent RT-PCR (16 negative; Table 1 ). All cases described as confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in this study had either a positive RT-PCR or a positive serology result.The main multisystem inflammatory phenotype at presentation was Kawasakilike disease (46%) and incomplete KD (29%), followed by acute cardiac dysfunction (18%), toxic shock syndrome (5%), and macrophage activation syndrome (2%). The median duration of symptoms before hospitalization was five days, and the median duration of fever was six days. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 71% of patients, mainly abdominal pain (54%), diarrhea (54%), and vomiting (38%). Skin rash (68%), prostration (54%), and headache or irritability (48%) were also very common.Shock symptoms were present in 59% of patients, mainly tachycardia (43%), hypotension (30%), and prolonged capillary refill (29%). Respiratory symptoms occurred in 46% of patients, but severe symptoms, such as low SpO2 (18%) and dyspnea (16%) were not very frequent. All patients had elevated inflammatory markers, and over 75% had elevated cardiac dysfunction markers. More than half (53%) also had laboratory signs of coagulopathy (Table 2) .Altered chest radiographs were found in 25 of 48 patients (52%), mainly bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrate (23%), while ground glass opacities were observed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in 11 of 35 patients (31%) who underwent chest computerized tomography. The echocardiogram was altered in 34 patients (61%), mainly showing mild pericardial effusion (50%), although 27% of the patients had left ventricular dysfunction and also 27% had signs of coronary dilatation (Table 2) .Of the 56 patients included, 18 had C-reactive protein (CRP) below 10.0 mg/dL, two patients had borderline results between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/dL and only three had CRP below 1.0 mg/dL. From these five patients with CRP below 3.0 mg/dL, three of them had altered ESR (> 20 mm) and the two remaining had altered fibrinogen (> 300 mg/dL). Thus, all patients had altered inflammatory markers, in accordance with the CDC criteria.Cardiac dysfunction markers were increased in more than 75% of the patients tested. Troponin I was higher than 0.1 ng/mL in 53% of patients; Pro-B type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) was elevated in more than 75% of patients, and above 1,000 pg/mL in 42% of those; and 38% had creatinine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) values higher than 25 U/L. D-dimer was high (> 500 ng/mL) in 80% of 41 patients tested; fibrinogen and activated prothrombin time (aPTT) were also elevated in more than half of the patients. Blood count was performed in all patients: anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in more than 30% of the patients, but thrombocytosis in only 14%. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was high (> 295 U/L) in 78% of 50 patients; the results of liver function tests were slightly abnormal in some patients, but hypoalbuminemia (< 3 g/dL) was present in 62%. Renal function was normal in all patients (Table 3) .A total of 89% of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and more than 50% received corticosteroids and enoxaparin (prophylactic or therapeutic).Acetylsalicylic acid (AAS) was administered in 45%, antibiotics in 59%, but oseltamivir and antifungal therapy were used in less than 10% of patients. Of the 20 patients (36%) who needed respiratory support, only 11% required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), of whom only two patients had a more severe course, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but no with pulmonary arterial hypertension.The median duration of IMV was five days and the highest median positive end J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 8.5. No special ventilatory strategies, such as intermittent prone position or alveolar recruitment maneuver, were necessary. There was only one death in this cohort (1.8%; Table 4 ).Most patients (75%) had the complete KD or incomplete Kawasaki phenotype, of which boys (76%) were most frequent. In the group with acute cardiac dysfunction, the median age was higher than in the other groups and non-whites represented 88% of patients.Comorbidities were not frequent in any phenotype. More than 70% of patients of all groups were treated with IGIV. The median PICU length of stay was six days, except for the only macrophagic activation syndrome patient (22 days; Table S1 -This is the first Brazilian multicenter study that described a cohort of patients with MIS-C only. The clinical features of the present patients are very similar to those previously reported in literature: most patients did not meet the complete criteria for KD; the median age was higher than that described for patients with COVID-19 only, but slightly lower than that described for MIS-C, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 10 ] and greater than that observed in classic KD. [17] In this study, males were much more frequent than females (2:1), and this predominance was even higher in the Kawasaki-like phenotype (3:1). This high proportion of males was also observed in other multicenter studies of MIS-C in the United Kingdom and the United States, [5, 6] and in critically ill children with COVID-19 alone. [14] Biological differences (genetic and epigenetic) between males and females may affect the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as has already been described in KD. [18, 19] Most of the present patients were non-white, similar to what has been described in Europe and America, although this may reflect the general ethnical distribution of Brazil. [5, 6, 11] As to the frequency of comorbidities, the present results were also similar to other studies of MIS-C, [5, 6] but the predominance of chronic neurological diseases has not been previously reported. Almost half of the present patients had a history of a contact with someone with COVID-19 and 55% had SARS-CoV-2 infection either detected by RT-PCR, serological test or both, corroborating a causal association with the new coronavirus. Fourteen patients tested J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, which generally reflects an acute phase of the infection, although the virus or its fragments may be detected for longer periods in some patients and could be responsible for these results, outside the classical period of positivity of the acute phase of COVID-19. However, it is still unclear how long after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection it takes for the first signs and symptoms of MIS-C to appear, or even whether this condition may still occur during the acute phase of COVID-19. The high frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms, the low prevalence of severe respiratory failure, and the lower degree of mucosal involvement have already been described, which characterizes MIS-C as a distinct entity, unrelated to classic KD. [5, 6] As expected in proinflammatory states and as part of the criteria for defining MIS-C, all children in the present cohort had increased inflammatory markers, such as CRP, ESR, and ferritin, which is also reported in other MIS-C cohorts in England, United States, France, Switzerland, and Italy. [3] [4] [5] 7, 10] The proinflammatory effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in adults with severe COVID-19, with whom MIS-C shares some characteristics, such as dysregulated innate immune response and cytokine storm. [6, 10, [20] [21] [22] In this study, IL-6 was measured in only three patients, due to its low availability and high cost. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been studied for many years as a sepsis biomarker, and its concentrations appear to correlate positively with sepsis severity. [23] IL-6 appears to play an important role in severe adult patients with COVID-19, in whom the compassionate use of tocilizumab for pharmacologic inhibition of IL-6 has been described. [24] The levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and aPTT were also elevated in most patients, reflecting a state of coagulopathy associated with hyperinflammation, which has been described in severe COVID-19 and MIS-C. [10, 20, 24, 25] Lymphopenia and thrombocytopeniawhich have been described as distinct hematological features of MIS-C and are not present in classic KDwas observed in 30% to 45% of patients in the present cohort. Anemia and hypoalbuminemia were also common in our patients, but these findings are characteristics of KD. [2] Although MIS-C is already recognized as a distinct clinical entity, the overlap of many features of other multisystem inflammatory syndrome phenotypes is frequently reported. A striking difference between MIS-C and severe COVID-19 in adults is the absence of renal impairment,[10] this is described in other cohorts of MIS-C and we also found normal renal function in our patients. Cardiac dysfunction markers were altered in most of our J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patients. Normal troponin levels of < 0.1 ng/mL have been described in healthy children under 1year of age. [26] Pro-BNP cut-off points of 502 ng/L, 456 ng/L, 445 ng/L, and.355 ng/L have been suggested for detecting cardiac failure in children aged 1-3 years, 4-7 years, and 8-14 years, respectively. [27] In the present cohort, troponin levels were highly increased in at least half of the patients who were tested, while pro-BNP was highly increased in more than three quarters of the tested patients.Echocardiographic findings similar to those of KD were also common in this cohort.These findings are compatible with myocardial dysfunction and inflammation consistently described in MIS-C reports. [3] [4] [5] [6] Its mechanism is not fully understood, but it may be related to microvascular damage, stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. [28] Although there is no current evidence for the best management of MIS-C, guidelines from different organizations recommend treatment based on the clinical phenotype. [6, 29] In the present cohort, the clinical syndromes at admission were mostly complete or incomplete KD, followed by acute cardiac dysfunction, and in a lesser extent toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome. Accordingly, IGIV was used in the vast majority of patients, and corticosteroids and AAS in approximately half. The role of AAS in the treatment of KD is well established and has been used in all patients with a phenotype similar to complete KD. Although there is no evidence of the benefit of corticosteroid for pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and/or MIS-C, the use of corticosteroid in MIS-C patients has been described in many studies in an attempt to reduce the hyperinflammatory response. [5, 6, 10] In addition, the recent multicenter CoDEX trial showed that, in severe adult patients with COVID-19, the use of dexamethasone increased the ventilator-free-days in the first 28 days by two-thirds. [30] Enoxaparin was also used in more than half of the present patients, since D-dimer was highly elevated in most of them. Actually, coagulopathy and thrombosis are important features in severe COVID-19 in adults. [28] Children with MIS-C are at risk for thrombotic complications of multiple causes, including hypercoagulable state, possible endothelial injury, immobilization stasis, ventricular dysfunction, and coronary artery aneurysm. For these reasons, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation treatment is recommended, based on coagulation tests and clinical presentation. [28] Although no information on associated bacterial or fungal infection and/or codetection of other viruses is available, the described use of antibiotics, antifungal therapy and oseltamivir in this study can be justified by these possibilities. Empirical J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with MIS-C is recommended, as symptoms overlap with severe bacterial sepsis. [28] The protocol of the Brazilian Ministry of Heath for severe respiratory acute syndrome recommends the use of oseltamivir until an influenza infection can be excluded.Although children diagnosed with MIS-C often require intensive care treatment, studies have shown good outcomes and a low mortality rate. [5, 10] This study found similar outcomes, with only one death, but with a longer length of PICU stay than that reported in other cohorts. [3, 7, 10, 11] The comparison of demographic and clinical features among the different phenotypes showed that they were relatively equivalent.The present study has some limitations. Brazil is a country with great racial miscegenation, which may limit the generalization of the present results, especially considering that individual genetic variations has been reported to affect the severity and phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, although this is a multicenter study, the number of patients is small, making comparison among phenotypes difficult.However, the present number is similar to other cohorts of MIS-C patients previously described. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 10] Additionally, only 55% of the patients had confirmed laboratorial SARS-CoV-2 infection and not all patients had inflammatory and cardiac dysfunction markers checked. Also, information about the history of previous symptoms that suggest another previous viral disease or when it has occurred was not available.Nevertheless, this article provides relevant information on the clinical features and outcomes of the novel described MIS-C in hospitalized children and adolescents in Brazil, which the authors believe to be an important contribution to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and its short-term consequences. It is important to reinforce the need for long-term multidisciplinary follow-up, since it is still not known whether these patients will have chronic cardiac impairment or other sequelae.This study was supported by grants from the following Brazilian research promotion agencies: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico -CNPq b Some patients presented more than one comorbidity. c Non-progressive encephalopathy (n = 3), autism (n = 2). d Some patients presented positive RT-PCR and serology.

(1) The global advance of COVID-19 was vertiginous; by January it had spread to Thailand and Spain; in February it was in Italy and Egypt and in March, it reached Latin America, where one of the first countries affected was Ecuador (29 February 2020). (2) Due to antecedents of high contagion, lethality in European countries, and vulnerability of the Ecuadorian health system, local authorities initiated follow up of contacts, detection, and control of cases. On 17 March, the Ecuadorian government took restrictive measures and declared the state of emergency, confinement of the citizenship, and border closings to contain the advance of the virus (3) and the Ministry of Health selected hospitals for referral of patients with COVID-19.Structural changes were established immediately in health services and reforms were made in the staff's workload, principally due to reasons of logistics and staffing (schedules from 8 to 12 hours daily changed to 24-hour shifts). The vast expansion of COVID-19 in a few days in Guayaquil did not permit timely supply of personal protection equipment, or diagnostic tests, which had very slow processing due to insufficient capacity of daily testing. (4) By late March, the installed capacity of hospitals and clinics in the city was exceeded and even the capacity of funeral services collapsed. By 15 May 2020, 30,502 confirmed cases were reported and 2,338 deaths. (5) At the time, Ecuador had the highest rate of cases in South America, 13.15 per 100-thousand inhabitants, which exceeded the global average of 9.63 and pointed to growing lethality. (6) The institutional response for nurses upon this complex crisis was based only on their personal protection and biosecurity measures. There was no regard to the unprecedented consequences to the mental health of the health staff. Pandemics not only cause disease and death, they also cause prolonged grief, fear, despair, hopelessness, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress that lead to significant social, occupational, and interpersonal dysfunction. (7) The COVID-19 pandemic represented a great threat to the lives and health of the staff. In Ecuador, according to data from professional colleges, there were 700 physicians infected, 80 dead; 147 nurses infected and 8 dead, which caused a significant impact on their emotional responses and on their mental health. (5, 7) Lazarus and Folkman (8) defined stress ""as the interrelations between the person and the context, produced when the person evaluates that which happens as something exceeding the resources they have available and endangers their personal wellbeing"". Additionally, these authors proposed a new concept, ""coping with stress"", according to which each person has a particular way of coping that can be determined by the health and physical energy, existential beliefs, motivations, capacity for problem solving, control of the environment and the very person, and social support.Some studies exist on stress, coping and mental health of nurses at risk of COVID-19, one of them in Anhui, China evidenced that nurses showed anxiety, fear, anger, and sadness. (9) In Huazhong, it was found that 35 members of the front-line nursing staff (85.37%), with patients in severe phase of pneumonia due to COVID-19, experienced somatizations, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety and fear. (10) An Iranian study identified that nurses in the first line of care to COVID-19 patients had a higher job-stress level than those working in other services. (11) Studies have also identified stress reducing factors and adaptation strategies in the health staff in the pandemic: availability of personal protection equipment, rigorous protocols to control infections, recognition of their efforts by the hospital administration and government, and decrease of new cases reported, which provide them psychological benefit. (12) The nursing staff in the front-line of care faces large and varied demands due to contact with very ill patients with a contagious virus and of poorly known trajectory; the vulnerability not only in them, but also the possibility of bringing the virus into their homes; observing the deaths of patients alone; and varied information projected in communication and social media, that do not encourage them at all. (12, 13) Therein the importance of establishing in nurses a baseline of factors related to mental health to implement actions that improve the Nursing exercise against new outbreaks.This study had a cross-sectional, descriptive approach. It was conducted in ""Hospital General Guasmo Sur"" with a capacity of 474 beds, which was designed as the first hospital in the city of Guayaquil to care for patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March to May 2020. The universe of nursing professionals working in the hospital was of 267 of which 40 were excluded due to having criteria of vulnerability for the disease, resulting in a population of 227, distributed in the services of Emergency (79), ICU (35), Hospitalization, and others (113). Given the pandemic circumstances, a non-probability convenience sampling was carried out, recruiting the professionals who voluntarily accepted to participate in the study. Of the 227 nurses who worked during the pandemic, 155 answered the questionnaire, but only 127 fully completed it, with these being the ones finally analyzed. It is important to consider that all the research subjects lived the same experience, given that they exclusively cared for patients with COVID-19 of slight, moderate, and severe symptomatology, guaranteeing non-variability of the result due to the participants.Data collection was performed by applying an online questionnaire on the Survey Monkey ® platform. Given that at the time of executing the survey there was mobility restriction and social distancing, an invitation was delivered to the professional nursing staff via e-mail to participate in the research. The invitation explained the objective and characteristics of the study, guaranteeing anonymity and confidentiality and included a link with the questionnaire form. The informed consent was taken as implicit if the participants connected to the web site and completed the questionnaire. Instructions were attached for the on-line survey, which indicated how the questions were distributed, the meaning of each item and its corresponding scale.The instrument used for this study was a questionnaire derived and adapted from the ""MERS-CoV staff questionnaire"" by Khalid et al., (13) selected because its variables have much affinity with those of the impact of COVID-19 on the health staff during the pandemic in Guayaquil. After obtaining authorization from the author, it was translated into Spanish by one of the authors of this article for greater reliability in the connotations and affirmations. Additionally, the content was analyzed with six local experts (four nurses and two psychologists who work with Nursing), who individually evaluated the questionnaire and then participated in two group meetings on the Zoom platform, to detect ambiguities and remove that which was not in context or which was not pertinent for the objective of this research, resulting in 52 items among reactions and behaviors.The questionnaire had four sections with the following response options: (i) emotions of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic with 12 items and its scale: 0 = not at all; 1 = somewhat; 2 = moderate; 3 = very much); (ii) stress-causing factors with 16 items and its scale: 0 = no stress; 1 = light stress; 2 = moderate stress; 3 = too much stress; (iii) factors that help to diminish the stress of nurses with 11 items and its scale: 0 = not effective; 1 = slightly effective; 2 = moderately effective; 3 = very effective; and (iv) coping strategies the staff could have used with 13 items and their scale: 0 = never used; 1 = sometimes used; 2 = frequently used; 3 = always used. The study processed 127 complete questionnaires, which were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Kuder Richardson-Formula 20 and Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficients were also obtained. The SPSS statistical program version 25 was used. The questionnaire was subjected to a pilot test with a group of 10 nursing professionals with practice similar to the study subjects, modifications were not needed.In this study, it was interesting that the sample was mostly comprised of young nurses, seven in every ten were under 35 years of age, and 58% had a time of professional exercise of three years and less; 85.8% were women,74% had no graduate formation, 71% practiced a religion, and 89% lived with the family ( Table 1) .The feelings manifested most by the nursing staff during the pandemic were the professional duty of the nurses, 91% (score = 2.33); fear of caring for patients, 91%, (score = 1.80); and the appreciation they would give to institutional recognition, 89%, (score = 2.30). In lower proportion, they felt dissatisfaction for having to work extended hours, 34%, (score = 0.54) or tried to diminish their contact with patients. Very few wanted to call in sick, 7%, (score = 0.11) or felt the urge to quit their job ( Table 2 ).Among the factors that cause stress, we may highlight due to its frequency and intensity, the possibility of transmission to relatives, 99%, (score = 2.27), as well as factors related to the workplace, such as getting infected by handling patients, 94%, (score = 1.90); and lack of personal protection equipment, 91%, (score = 2.02). An external factor, lack of treatment and vaccines available for this virus, 91%, (score = 2.01), proved stressful. Results above 88% were obtained in various factors: accessing news through television or social media about COVID-19; observing anxious and frightened colleagues, and having possible symptoms of the disease (Table 3 ).Among the factors that aided in diminishing stress, it was found that all the nurses benefit when all the colleagues in the unit where they work show a positive attitude, 100%, (score = 2.56), there is teamwork within the area, 100%, (score = 2.76), knowing that COVID-19 cases improve, 100%, (score = 2.69), and no one is sick among their family and circle of friends, 100%, (score = 2.74). A lower percentage (84%) reported that it helps not having an extended schedule at work (more hours in the work shift) ( The coping strategies adopted by all the nurses during the pandemic were, in the first place, those related with the safety of their practice: following strictly personal protection measures, 100%, (score = 2.92); maintaining separate clothing for the street and for work, 100%, (score = 2.81); and acquiring greater knowledge about the disease, 100%, (score = 2.63). Together with these strategies, there was another prevention measure disseminated globally, like avoiding going to public places, 100%, (score = 2.69). High percentages were obtained in the communication strategies with their relatives and friends; positive thoughts and attitudes, as well as caring for their nutrition, frequency of engaging in physical exercise and recreation activities. The lowest percentage and intensity value were obtained in the expression of their feelings, 61%, (score = 0.94) ( Table 5 ).Score key: 0 = Not effective; 1 = Slightly effective; 2 = Moderately effective; 3 = Very effective Score key: 0 = Never used; 1 = Sometimes used; 2 = Frequently used; 3 = Always used reported for the Cronbach's alpha in the section of Stress-causing factors as high consistency and of Emotions of nurses during the pandemic as moderate, while in the other sections the internal consistency was interpreted as low (Table 6 ).The COVID-19 pandemic placed health professionals throughout the world in a situation without precedent. The impact in Guayaquil, city where the pandemic began in Ecuador, was devastating. (2) Current scientific literature reports that work under pressure, administration and optimization of scarce resources in services, fear of death, and placing one's basic needs aside due to overload of responsibilities, additionally, could affect the physical state and mental health of nurses. (9, 10, (12) (13) (14) Perhaps the more robust health systems have the power to better mitigate impacts, versus weaker health systems, as could be the case in Ecuador. (3) To better explain it, the Ecuadorian National Health System has a more curative than preventive orientation. Regarding the need for better detection, follow up, and control of cases in the first level of care, the conditions did not exist for this to take place in the city of Guayaquil and patients had to attend hospital institutions of greater complexity. As a result, greater saturation was observed of users, work overload, and contagion of health workers.This study, by being the first to explore the feelings, stress factors, and coping strategies upon COVID-19 used by Ecuadorian nurses, can be a contribution to develop care programs for the staff and have better strategic planning in future outbreaks. The professionals in this study turned out to be, mostly, young recently graduated and with poor work experience who, like many nurses globally, felt that caring for patients with COVID-19 represented a professional duty, (12) (13) (14) in spite of their fear of infection, and the extenuating fatigue represented by working with these patients. Fear in 91% of them was higher compared to that young nurses from Taiwan (43%) felt during the possible pandemic of an unknown virus (avian flu), already, warning of the risk of progression from this fear to panic, and then to phobia. (15) A high proportion of the sample (89%) considered institutional recognition important (promotions, job stability, mentions of their performance) and economic compensation for their work. These data are similar to those found among 534 health professionals who were in the front line in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak, (12) and in another study in China. (16) The factors that caused the greatest stress to the nurses surveyed were the possibility of being infected with COVID-19 and infecting their relatives and friends (99%); likewise, this occurred among nurses in Taiwan with higher intensity (2.35). (17) A critical factor, lack of sufficient personal protection equipment (91%), further complicated by long work shifts that in the ""Hospital del Guasmo"" were of 24 hours, caused exhaustion and subordination of basic needs, with high physical and psychological demands, and scant resources. (17) (18) (19) This situation was, also manifested in Chinese (16) and European hospitals (20) during the peak of the pandemic. Negative news of the advance of COVID-19, as well as the nervousness and anguish of their coworkers, were very important in this group, unlike the study by Khalid on the MERS epidemic outbreak, probably due to its lesser social impact. (13) The perception of greater risk due to the lack of a vaccine and treatment caused stress in 91% of the respondents.Four of the factors that helped to reduce stress during the peak of the pandemic were similar in various studies, positive attitude from coworkers and team work; (18, 20) observing the clinical improvement of hospitalized patients; and having their relatives and friends free from COVID-19. (12, 18) Diminished work shift, as well as receiving compensation or free food were of lesser interest.It is noted in this study that the staff has high solidarity and good disposition to provide their professional services despite the overwhelming situation they encountered.The coping strategies most used by Ecuadorian nurses included: following strict personal protection measures at work and at home; social distancing (avoiding going out to the streets and public places); and acquiring actively greater knowledge about COVID-19 and its management; similar to those of other professionals in epidemics. (12, 17, 18) Speaking with relatives and friends relieved stress, as well as renovating thoughts and motivating themselves positively served them as support. (18, 19) A large group of nurses did not reduce their schedules to protect themselves (34%) nor expressed their emotions openly by crying and yelling (39%), possibly due to the big moral demands of the crisis. (14) The profound ethical and vocational commitment nursing has, is definitely one of the characteristics these professionals have, and the obligation of offering their knowledge and skills during this threatening moment, was fair and pertinent. It was the moment to demonstrate who is who.According to the results of this research, it is concluded that the impact on the mental health of nurses could be severe. It must be remembered that they not only experience the stress caused by their work on the front line, but that they are also parents, spouses, sons and daughters, and citizens who are experiencing fear and vulnerability regarding this unprecedented situation for the current world. Fortunately, the social and family components influenced favorably the ways of coping of these professionals during the pandemic; besides the positive work environment, resulting in support for their emotional state. Institutional recognition, more than economic compensation, would have greater importance in their perceptions.Nurses need government and those in charge of formulating public policy, nursing leaders, as well as professional groups to participate actively in their support, both during and after the pandemic . (14, 16, (19) (20) (21) The Union of Nurses from Guayas is monitoring the outfitting of sufficient quality biosecurity supplies for nursing professionals, as well as ensuring possible compensation to the families of nurses who have lost their lives during the pandemic.This study had limitations with the sample coming from a single hospital and due to the self-selection. Another factor could be the memory bias in the responses upon the fact that the survey took place in late May, after almost two months in which Guayaquil suffered the peak of the pandemic, and ""fear"" of the virus could have been lost. More studies are recommended from these results, in another group of professionals or in cities of Ecuador that are still in the pandemic cycle.",Ecuador,abstract,2020-11-11,11
31c26db7e3f9aae67fb89ccac99f340ba822f234,Health as a Human Right: A Fake News in a Post-human World? The Need for a Conceptual Framework,"The title of an article where a question mark follows a provocative statement could easily sound as a rhetoric artefact rather than the formulation of a real research hypothesis. To provide a clearer answer to this doubt, and a full justification of the legitimacy and relevance of the question mark, let's start with a few preliminary considerations and explanatory notes, which we deem necessary as a general conceptual and methodological framework. Here they come, in this logical sequence:• The two domains associated and confronted in the question posed in the title-public health and human rights-have been the long-term professional field of the authors. Both of them have been engaged mainly in intense research activity related to field projects and thematic areas where they have directly crossed, and experienced, the often conflicting tension and interaction between the point of view of 'health' as a fundamen-tal human and peoples right, and that of 'health' as an increasingly dominant component of market rules. Since the Seventies, model health areas have included drug policies such as the WHO essential drugs, innovative population clinical trials, critical epidemiological use of large databases, normative regulations of accessibility to health technologies (Tognoni et al. 2019) . A parallel line and a different type of research that both authors have conducted has focussed on the causes and consequences of massive violations of peoples' rights. 1 Their cumulative experience, derived from the insides of these most diverse scenarios, has provided them with a solid confirmation of what has emerged with a growing consensus also in the most prestigious 'scientific' literature, in the last 10 years: structural inequality is the direct product and the expected outcome of the mainstream models of development, which trigger a highly visible impact on the rights to health and life, and prove to be a systemic source of in-human levels of inequity (Evans 2020 ). • The title of the important book from Indian academic Baxi (2007) which has inspired the question mark of our contribution has proved to be neither a pessimistic forecast nor a philosophical theoretical generalization of trends on the eve of this century's first financial crisis. Health, the most sensitive indicator of the right to human dignity, has become the arena of a most impressive cultural transformation. It is the terrain that best documents the level of inequalities-iniquities generated by assuring the privilege of priority attributed to goods over humans in economic profit oriented legislations. This terrain is also an inevitable object of observation and analyses, where humans and their lives are normal, expected, quantifiable 'victims', and not inviolable subjects (for a very careful documentation of the broader evolution in this direction of juridical and institutional international scenarios (Dentico 2014 ). • An independent and enriching integration of Baxi's view (with an impressive documentation from real life sociological contexts, populations, outcomes) is provided in Saskia Sassen's book which gives a most effective definition of the whys and hows of the post-human qualification. The globalization project hinges on rigid logistic and economic supply chains for whatever may be considered a market good-anything that generates profits in the selling and buying universes, including humans. The expulsion of whatever claims to be, or may be assumed to be, a 'subject' endowed with inviolable life and dignity rights (as opposed to a marketable object), is a mandatory and automatic reaction of the algorithms guiding the decisions (Sassen 2014 ). • The last viewpoint that concludes this introductory framework is the most unexpected, hence the most significant one: for its peculiar origin, its world vision, and indeed its language. We refer to Pope Francis's two last encyclical documents, 2 widely recognized as the expression of a truly 'universal' conversion, not confined by religious walls or political frontiers. The Pope's letters envisage humankind's re-positioning in its one and common home, that being creational nature. His approach marks an innovative recuperation of the principles of fundamental rights, which cannot be but oriented to the full inclusion of all humans (migrants, marginalized, etc.) as subjects entitled to the same dignity of life and wellbeing-which accessible health is a concrete indicator of.Our attempt here is to try and provide a synoptic view with some interpretative lights on the events and/or documents that have given substance to a long history. In Table 1 we intend to portray the chronology and the core themes that allow a comprehensive understanding of the challenges that we need to face in today's political, economic, conceptual scenarios while looking for an answer to the questions about the state of the right to health raised in the title of our article. The narrative of the long list's contents aims to underline the continuity and the articulation of a process where the role of the same actors (international agencies, national Governments, representatives of civil society and people's movements), and their reciprocal hierarchy of power, have mutually evolved to shape the time we are living. As the first UN operational agency created even before the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the WHO was regarded as the immediately available, concrete and easy-to-grasp instrument to advance the political agenda of the new era, after the plight of two world wars: the human right to life and dignity could be seen and promoted as truly universal, if accessibility to the right to health could be secured. The vision then was pinning down the world to translating a declared universal principle-the right to health-into effective policies and visible practices in the context of the different countries, whose national Constitutions were meant to convert the UDHR principles into a daily experience. This horizon did not last long. Less than 30 years after the UDHR, the perspective of the linear development of a democratically organized society had substantially changed already. The UDPR turned out to be promoted as an independent charter to reflect and clearly denounce the dramatic limitations of the existing international law. It did not take long for the international community of States to progressively become the expression and the vehicle of 'strategic'-economic, military, political-interests, a scenario in which the multinational corporations had been playing an increasing role while denying any loyalty or accountability to the UDHR principles, and their implications. The World Health Organization (WHO) soon became well aware of the mounting threats to its authority and field of competences, under the guise of a rapidly growing health market deprived of any control. The agency did not stay idle, in the face of what was coming. A very restricted list of 'essential drugs', based on the consensus of the scientific community, was formulated and proposed for approval to the WHO Member States. The idea was to equip governments with a tangible as well as symbolic tool to resist the pressure stemming from the neoliberal development models that mainly the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) had started to impose.The first half of the 1990s coincides with a major cultural and institutional translation, in the arena of health, of the shifts that had occurred to the original UDHR paradigm. The newly born World Trade Organization (WTO) declares its exclusive competence on health goods, technologies and structures. In a nutshell, the trade agenda asserts itself as the new overarching normative regime. In alliance with the WHO, the WB draws a new map of health priorities where investments should concentrate. The map does not set its priorities on the assessment of real unmet needs. It is designed on the tricky notion of the global 'economic burden' of the individual diseases (GBD), now the main-if not exclusive-term of reference of health market costs and provisions, accessibility trends, international procedures. Contrary to many expectations, the newly established International Criminal Court (ICC) declares its juridical incompetence and lack of mandate on the 'new' crimes against individual and peoples' rights committed in compliance with the new economic and trade laws.In the narrative of the acronyms for the new millennium, health appears as one of the main goals to be pursued. Yet, the health goal is placed in a generic framework of socioeconomic variables and featured with the profile of an insurance scheme for which somebody should pay. Isn't this what the acclaimed Universal Health Coverage (UHC) approach ultimately aims for? The ambivalence, the limits, and the remarkable failures of these top-down global goals are too well known across the research reports or the administrative reviews of concerned agencies and disciplines, to require any further comment. Conversely, the silence of the scientific and institutional literature on the WHO-sponsored report on the Social Determinants of Health (SDH), is indeed very meaningful. The SDH report was supposed to remind the world, renew the memory, relaunch the era of the 'Health For All' (HFA) culture and its mobilizing manifesto, the Alma Ata Declaration. This reticence is a confirmation of how deeply the normative and epistemic changes have been interiorized. No space is left for a terminology reminiscent of the 'human' in the global reporting or goal setting, anymore. The semantic oblivion had been knowingly experimented through the GBD methodology, whose main focus is the geo-mapping of health economic burdens. The iteration of strictly descriptive and repetitive data on the growing notavoidable levels of inequalities-inequities has paved the way to the planned disappearance even from the dictionaries of health rights disciplines (Abassi 2020) .The often announced but substantially unexpected COVID-19 pandemia has produced a more than foreseeable confirmation: the statistics of mortality made available for all the affected countries reproduce similar gradients of excesses of contagion and deaths which overlap and add to the underlying conditions of inequalities. A structural and pandemic characteristic featuring high income countries (HICs) just as well (Swenor 2019) .It is not the purpose of this article to either summarize or comment the rapidly changing data related to COVID-19. The main issue is rather the degree of credibility the multiple actors in the pandemic landscape-the UN agencies, the European Commission, religious leaders, academia, NGOs representing civil society, the concerned corporate actors, the science community-have vehicle through their institutional positions. The uniquely symbolic power of what has happened, its extension and consequences, cannot leave reality as it is. Radical changes in development modelling must be prepared, different hierarchies of values need to be adopted. Unfortunately, as often if the case, power balance evolution does not seem oriented to seriously engage with the challenge of radical modifications. The field of health appears to be a case in point, for its specific perfect reproduction of 'wishful thinking' strategies. A tentative check list of challenges and priorities made visible by COVID-19 would be useful.The first and most impressive 'discovery' triggered by COVID-19 is the structural fragility of a system of marketdriven supply chains-of goods, knowledge, information, data. In the first two decades of the twenty-first century these supply-chains appeared to be the solid and untouchable protagonists of the global development models. Until the arrival of a biological agent, doomed to be under global knowledge's tight control, has successfully revealed the inherent ignorance and deep fragmentation defining the various branches of the most advanced disciplines of basic sciences: public health, epidemiology, health technologies.Possibly, the unpreparedness to ignorance, in a global culture increasingly confident on the power of technology and the linearly conceived algorithmic decision-making, has produced a decisive worsening of the pandemic impact. A world proud of its digital capacity of 'linking' and 'sharing' has discovered its communication failure when it comes to real risks and potential solutions, as well as its cultural carelessness, its political and scientific lack of foresight when it comes to sharing data on unmet needs and possible solutions. Globalization's top-down approach has proved highly ineffective, 'lost in translation', when devising the needed strategies for collaborative involvement of human beings. Classical health security measures (certainly needed) have been the only remedy put in place with great variability, and unmeasurable/incomparable results in different countries and health systems. Which has entailed a recognized negative impact on the democratic and health rights of ordinary citizens, not to mention the enhanced precariousness of migrants, refugees, uninsured, homeless, simply 'poor' or marginalized people, across the world. The acclaimed capacity of handling and relying on big data to monitor, anticipate, measure the yield of the (often more than controversial) interventions has produced an international situation of confusion and uncertainty in the epidemiological understanding, and evaluation, of the pandemic evolution. Scientists and health authorities have simply failed to agree on reliable and applicable criteria for comparing their data. The retraction of scientific reports from major specialized journals, the breach of fundamental rules and practices of independent results' evaluation, even in regulatory agencies, the virtual lack of any formal coordination of public health efforts months after the inception of the 'emergency' are known elements of the daily chronicle we have familiarized with, and abundantly so.In this scenario, the only recognized exception concerns health professionals. Confronted with the human face of the pandemic, close to the solitude of human bodies unable to breathe, medical doctors, nurses, health personnel have assured an impressive quality of presence and intensity and care across the spectrum of the different given settings. They have done so mooring their unexpected and extraordinary experience to the safe bay of the old robust-albeit tragically neglected-value of medicine as a science and practice that is grounded on a rigorous combination of professionalism, solidarity, ethics. It is reasonable to say that this 'care for humans'-often institutionally unplanned, hardly politically supported, at risk now of being forgotten in terms of participation to the overall planning for the future-has been the only positive, authentic, understandable, credible form of communication to the public opinion. The other significant consensus is that health systems had suffered greatly during the pandemic crisis due to the sharp reductions of investments in human resources and community strategies, imposed by 'economic sustainability' criteria.The scenario we have tried to summarize, therefore, bear witness to the fact that the global challenge introduced by the COVID-19 is only very partially a health problem. The ongoing economic, political, juridical 'wars' currently surrounding the narratives about the development, distribution and accessibility of the COVID-19 vaccines are, yet again, a most worrying confirmation of the real question for our societies today: namely, what model of civilization will be chosen after COVID-19 (Bloom et al. 2020; Nowak et al. 2020 ). Humans-their lives and their values of democracy, solidarity, and hope for a better future-have played their role as victims, rather than as subjects. The viral pandemic has disclosed the structural pandemic impact of the social and economic viruses that have infected the global chains of knowledge production, denied the possibility of delivering the common goods, seconded the vested priorities of private powerful minorities over the vast majorities of peoples.The most recent reports from the GBD groups have 'discovered' that the global data which consistently document the extent and the severity of the impact of the inequalities worldwide should evolve from a strategy of neutral description into one approach of looking into the avoidability of such inequalities-iniquities. It seems an obvious cultural and methodological change, but it could represent quite a revolutionary step forward from the tragically impressive analytical model illustrated by Burstein et al. in a top scientific journal (2019). A substantial proportion of the 123 million neonatal, infant, paediatric deaths occurred in the twenty-first century could be considered avoidable with simple, mainly non-sanitary measures, the study says. Nothing else. Ultimately, there in an urgent need for re-establishing human lives and deaths as the measure of needs and outcomes, against the persistently dominant focus on disease burdens.Repeating the usual soliloquy of 'international' literature, an abundant production of medical articles has flooded physicians and public health professionals working in the Global South with the intent of explaining them what is happening in their countries, what their needs are, what lessons they should learn from the COVID-19 pandemic. While the flow of information is meant to be educational, the appropriate term we can use is, possibly, indoctrination (Daniels 2020; Hogan et al. 2020; Walker et al. 2020) . With COVID-19, a new wave of top-down, complex and unverifiable mathematical models keep coming from the center of the world foreseeing when the peripheries will run out of respirators, how many people will die in the next semester, how the pandemic will impact tuberculosis and HIV infected people (Walker et al. 2020) , and how all this knowledge should inform a model of healthcare organization (Walker et al. 2020) . All data must be noted and lessons learnt.This dynamic was not brought in by COVID. For decades, centrally produced guidelines have indicated how to invest mostly borrowed money for the 'proper' administration of health resources. To verify the sparkle of the truth hidden in the lies, a small, basic technical frame of reference could be useful to discuss concepts related to solidarity, rights and autonomies of real populations. For decades now (World Bank 1993; Murray and Lopez 1996; Cooper et al. 1998; Jamison et al. 2006; Mathers and Loncar 2006) , GBD reports have informed us that in Argentina things are going reasonably well. The increase in life expectancy, the decrease in infant mortality and the overall improvement in access to healthcare (HAQ Index) indicate that things have improved significantly. The Institute of Health Metrics (its logo explicitly states: 'measuring what matters') incorporates comparisons with other countries to provide a reference aimed at defining the magnitude of trends and problems. This approach makes Argentina indistinguishable from Bosnia and Herzegovina when it comes to deaths from cirrhosis, although it would profile it better than China in terms of self-inflicted injuries and significantly worse than the Mauritius Islands of East Africa in neonatal conditions. This is a description of what is published.Beyond the international metrics and their grotesque comparisons, these estimates lead to an important conceptual distortion. When analyzing Argentina's factual data, we see that the average improvement occurs at the expenses of a fraction of the population. Inequity increases and access to services worsens among those who need it most (Macchia et al. forthcoming). Women, for example. Their health situation is dramatic. Available data from the last 2 years show that in 2016-2017 Argentinian women have the same standardized death rate as in 1990-1991. Premature mortality increases significantly among the poorest segments of society, and does so with particularly harsh trends among women over 60 (Macchia et al. forthcoming ). Yet, these populations disappear completely from the health metrics analysis. Their eclipse is not accidental. The categorization of a wide, polychromatic and heterogeneous universe into smaller, measurable, homogeneous fractions recording an average improvement, manages to reduce the world to estimates showing some improvement but leaving out immense population groups (Sassen 2014) . The resulting disappearance of humans portions shrinks the world to a selected group of inhabitants, those who coincide with as many given categories or clusters.The COVID is a chapter written with the same letters. The grotesque comparisons and 'rankings' among countries circulated by the media on a daily basis, arithmetically counting the number of sick and dead, only represent the further trivialization of a culture that does not pretend to learn or listen but to talk. In a world where many could know so much, the number of people who know something seriously is alarmingly low. Again, a few technical data to reflect on this.In Buenos Aires, a city of 3.1 million people, the cumulative incidence rate (IC95%) of COVID-19 was 1890 COVID-19 was (1832 COVID-19 was -1948 per 100,000 people, as of August 2020. In the slums it was 5916 (5542-6289) corresponding to 13,829 people, while in the city areas not inhabited by proximity to the slums it was 1559 (1505-1612) corresponding to 44,314 people. Despite their younger age, slum dwellers have a significantly higher mortality rate. Even disaggregating by age, sex and risk factors, the mortality rate of slum population doubles that of people living outside the slums (Macchia et al. submitted) . Ultimately, COVID-19, like coronary disease, tuberculosis, malnutrition, obesity and cancer (Marmot 2005 ) is socially conditioned.Additionally, the possibility of confining cases and close contacts in overcrowded housing is close to zero. In Buenos Aires more than 60% of COVID-related cases among slums dwellers had to be confined to alternative care sites (hotels). 3 What's the point of describing COVID in Argentina merely counting the number of cases, without telling people's stories, without understanding the different human groups, their identities and challenges? It seems that global world standards do not need this information. After all, slum dwellers are not part of the global picture, just like the over one billion world inhabitants who live undocumented (Byass et al. 2013) , and who spend their lives in daily statistical and political anonymity.Health has ceased to be a public matter since years. It was regarded as such for a brief period of political history, a time that cannot return it seems, at least not in the short term. But it is not only the administration of health care that has been transferred into private hands. Public health research and its priorities setting is in private hands, too.Philanthrocapitalism, particularly through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, finances the research agenda and modulates collective health's decisions at the level of the multilateral community. Members of 'philanthropic' foundations have close ties to pharmaceutical companies, so they sail from private interest to public policymaking with no restraints. Philanthropic foundations' staff sits on corporate entities' boards and public health organizations alike, as if this were a normal circumstance (Birn 2014) . In COVID's case, the relationship between the director of the 'Warp Speed' programme and his relationship with one of the candidates to produce the vaccine is one point in case. example. 4 The relationship between health, collective rights and market interests has become increasingly blurred. Some Latin American countries hailed the vaccine production in their own territories, announcing it as the exercise of state responsibility for the benefit of collective health. But this narrative is nowhere close to reality, at least in Argentina. The production of the AstraZeneca and the Oxford University vaccine was entrusted by the consortium to an Argentine businessman who owns a group of transnational companies. The business group quickly clarified that this is an 'agreement between private parties' and that the Argentinian state has nothing to do with it. In fact, the Argentinian State does have a role. It has secured the advanced purchase of tens of millions of doses without even negotiating the price of the product. It takes the risk of vaccinating early, in the absence of long-term safety monitoring results. But there's more. In the past, the government has financed the vaccine production plants. The state is indeed playing a role with a variety of interventions, including that of a consumer. 5 The race to win the market competition encouraged by ignorant politicians with no scruples is doomed to produce even greater damage (Krause et al. 2020) . Obtaining a poorly effective vaccine (as it will most likely be the case for the first generation of products) will generate a gold standard that other follow-on trials will adopt as their benchmark.In 1935, Martin Heidegger envisaged what did not exist then, but we must consider today: 'When the farthest corner of the globe has been conquered technologically and can be exploited economically; when any incident you like, in any place you like, at any time you like, becomes accessible as fast as you like; when you can simultaneously 'experience' an assassination attempt against a king in France and a symphony concert in Tokyo; when time is nothing but speed, instantaneity, and simultaneity, and time as history have vanished from all Being of all peoples; when a boxer counts as the great man of a people; when the tallies of millions at mass meetings are a triumph; then, yes then, there still looms like a specter over all this uproar the question: what for?-where to?-and what then?'The substantial convergence between the initial question of our title and the questions that Heidegger formulates in the quote we have chosen could be seen as the most coherent and certainly worrying conclusion.The historical parenthesis when the universality of human rights was politically adopted not as an utopia, but as an innovative (first in history!), concrete, long-term programme of a post-war (never again!) world order is radically threatened, if nor formally declared obsolete. The ongoing COVID-19 event is the symbolic-even more importantly than the real-expression of a time when unmet needs and questions come forcefully to the fore as protagonists, higher and above the accepted challenge. Health was the first ideal and realistic proposition of that historical parenthesis (Table 1) : the life with dignity of human beings (no one left behind!) was assumed to be the mandatory, reasonable, long term outcome. But the amazing successes of life sciences in the last decades have moved in parallel with the progressive transformation of the economy from a valuebased, competent science that guided the use of resources as a key component to support human development, into an autonomous uncontrolled power. The legitimate and binding indicators of human and peoples' rights were marginalized, to the advantage of development models and economic strategies, whereby market goods acquired the status of free and untouchable subjects of legal contractual laws.On the other hand, most juridical sciences and institutions, satisfied with the formal solidity of their principles, conventions and constitutions based on universality paradigms, became confined to a role of arbiters and controllers of the new global order 's compliance. In this scenario, the universality of human and peoples' rights was progressively transformed into a dependent variable of economic sustainability and of the impunity needed by the new political and 5 On 18 October 2020, the minister of Health has assured that in March 2021 a massive vaccination campaign will be carried out in Argentina with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, the production of which is planned in Argentina available at https ://www.lanac ion.com.ar/polit ica/coron aviru s-argen tina-gines -gonza lez-garci a-en-marzo -nid24 83167 . economic powers, active at the national and international level.The 2020 pandemic, triggered by one of the oldest companions-enemies of human life and history, could become a determinant of a cultural, social, mental lockdown; a test of the limits of resistance of societies, more than a powerful stimulus of resilience. As representatives and disenchanted actors of disciplines where uncertainties and failures compel to imagine, promote, experiment answers 'to care for the right of life'-this indeed has been the only recognized 'light' of engagement in the dark tunnel of the pandemicwe have the duty to give our last question an horizon. Something that does not exist but has a very important role, as Eduardo Galeano showed in his imagined upside-down world. The role of the horizon is simply to oblige us to move on and go ahead. Let's at least be the custodians, let's at least preserve the memory of the utopia of the first acronyms in Table 1 . The universal right to life in dignity is assumed in a bottom-up mobilization by the subjects of history, the 'discarded', the expelled majorities, as a priority area of high cultural and social conflicts, to become the political terrain of struggle and confrontation with the economic and institutional powerful minorities, in the quest for a new, human, parenthesis. It is our horizon. Not an answer.",Argentina,abstract,2020-11-10,11
6e55b54f20453642719792953cc45dd3935f7420,Intra-host evolution during SARS-CoV-2 persistent infection,"The disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) was first reported in December of 2019 and has rapidly spread worldwide, in a pandemic that already surpasses 51,805,339 cases and 1,279,184 deaths. In Brazil, the Coronavirus Resource Center reported more than 5,7 million cases and 162,842 deaths between March and November (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), and active transmission is still observed all over the country.Observational studies conducted since the beginning of the pandemic have been crucial to providing a detailed description of the main demographic and clinical characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in different populations (Grasselli et al. 2020; Richardson et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020) . Most of these studies were hospital-based and, consequently, the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection among mild cases has been less documented. However, a description of mild cases can be considered crucial to determine transmission patterns and better define the minimum time of in-home isolation and other preventive policies.The medium time between symptoms onset and the first negative RT-PCR test has been described as 15 to 17 days in nasopharyngeal swabs, although longer periods are often observed, varying according to the clinical specimen under analysis (Pavon et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020) . Also, cases of reinfection by phylogenetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 viruses were recently reported (Prado-Vivar et al. 2020; . These data raise the question of whether the virus may establish persistent infection or if patients presenting prolonged viremia in the nasopharynx have been re-infected before recovering from the initial infection.In brief, persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized mainly by prolonged PCR positivity. However, studies available to date did not include viral sequencing or a detailed analysis of viral infectiousness or intra-host evolution, which would be expected in such cases.Indeed, we still don't know the clinical outcome associated with persistent infection. Here, we investigated a series of 33 patients from the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte (Brazil), who remained RT-PCR positive for at least 16 days after the first positive test. Samples were obtained from each patient at two time points. Phylogenetic, populational, and computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences confirmed persistent infections and showed increasing diversity associated with persistence, presenting immune escape related mutations and editing signatures of APOBEC induced interferon enzyme.Twenty-one females and 12 males with mean ages of 39 ± 11 and 38 ± 9 years, respectively, were enrolled in this study. Most participants were health professionals (N = 19) or other workers (N = 7) from hospitals and clinics from the city of Rio de Janeiro. A single patient was recruited from the State of Minas Gerais (Table S1 ). Patients from Rio de Janeiro were selected from a larger cohort of 4,917 individuals, with an estimated prevalence of 30% of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We defined viral persistency in our cohort as patients that remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples for at least 14 days since the onset of the symptoms. We sequenced samples collected at two time points for each patient (T1 and T2). T1 was the first RT-PCR positive sample after the onset of symptoms, and T2 the last sample with a Ct < 35, which is required for sequencing. The mean interval between the two samples was 18±7 days (range 5 -39). The longest interval between T1 and the onset of the symptoms was 22 days (Table S1; Fig. 1A ).Reference-based viral genome assembly achieved, on average, 97% genome coverage with a read depth greater than 2,000x in most of the regions sequenced (Table S2) . Similar results were found using a de novo assembly approach. To analyze the phylogenetic position of the 66 consensus genomes generated in this study, we put together a dataset including 135 SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian genomes from Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais states obtained from samples collected between March and June of 2020. The maximum likelihood tree estimated for these 201 genomes is shown in Fig. 2 . The analyzed sequences were classified by Pangolin software into seven distinct lineages recovered in well-supported clades. The majority of our genomes (58 out of 66) were classified as belonging to lineage B.1.1.33. Only two were classified as B.1.1.28, four as B.2.2, and two as B.1. For all patients, T1 and T2 genomes were always classified as belonging to the same lineage (Fig. 2) .We also found evidence of a transmission cluster for patients 14, 34, and 40, who are health professionals at the same hospital (Fig. 2) . All genomes (T1 and T2) from those patients share two substitutions, U175C and G2086U (ORF1ab). Patient 14 presented symptoms first followed by 34 and 40, with a T1 sampling interval of 5 and 13 days, respectively. Indeed, T1 consensus sequences from these three patients, as well as T2 sequences from patients 14 and 34 were identical. Patient 40's T2 sample harbored only one substitution (U22119C) when compared to the other five consensus sequences previously described. Since the probability of having this shared variation as a result of recurrent mutations is too small, our results strongly suggest that they are the result of transmission between patients, indicating different events of infection with the same circulating virus in the hospital environment.Genetic screening across the 66 genomes revealed 327 intra-host single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) in 304 positions spread throughout 9 ORFs of the SARS-CoV-2 genome ( Table S3) .Non-synonymous changes comprehend 221 out of 312 coding region variations (Fig. 3A) .Orf1ab harbored the majority of the iSNVs detected in our analysis (N = 203) followed by the S protein (46), N (31), orf3a (12), M (5), orf7a (5), orf8 (5), orf6 (3), E (2), and non-coding regions (15). Nevertheless, when normalized by gene length, orfs 3a, 7a, 8, and 6 showed the highest proportion of variation.Fig. S1A) between T1 (mean = 2.22) and T2 (mean = 3.14) samples. Such differences are mainly due to the enrichment of missense variants at orf1ab (Fisher's exact test, 2 × 2 contingency table,Overall, we observed only one substitution per site across all variants called in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, we detected 21 two-state polymorphic sites, and less often, three alternative bases were identified per site ( Table S3 ). Most of these sites mapped to orf1ab (12), S (4), orf3a(2), N (2), and one in the 5' UTR. The co-occurrence of genetic variants was mostly found intrahost; however, nine sites were over-represented in more than 80% of samples. These positions correspond to mutational signatures of the most prevalent circulating lineage, namely B.1.1.33.By comparing the mean number of iSNVs between the first (mean = 14.8) and second (mean = 16.4) time points during the course of infection, we observed a significantly higher number of iSNVs at the T2 sampling (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.005; Fig. S1A ). Of note, we observed an elevated number of iSNV at T2 of patient 31 (n = 53), which exceeded more than 3 fold the expected mean. On average, each patient shared 10 variants between both time points, approximately three variants were only found in T1 and seven gained in T2. Overall, the T2 sample exhibited more exclusive variants than T1. A total of 81 variant sites were found only in T1, whereas 218 were acquired later in T2 (Table S4 ).To rule out NGS data sequencing and processing steps as a spurious source of variation, we tested the correlation between our findings and quality control metrics. The difference between iSNV numbers across both times was found to be unrelated to genomic coverage (Spearman's correlation ρ =-0.042, P = 0.7382). However, the number of iSNVs was positively correlated with the sampling interval from symptoms onset (Spearman's correlation ρ = 0.41, P = 0.0006) andAltogether, this suggests that increasing variation at T2 could be explained by mutation accumulation during a more extended period of infection and persistence.We then estimated the magnitude of difference between T1 and T2 samples by comparing the rates of iSNVs per kilobase (kb) and per protein product along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Both approaches revealed an elevated accumulation of variants (LogFC > 2) overtime at seven main genomic windows, predominantly enriched at the 3' UTR (Table S5) . Interestingly, these regions are responsible for encoding Helicase, nsp15, nsp16, Spike subunit S2, nsp2-nsp3, M, and ns8 proteins, respectively. Alterations in Helicase protein mainly affected the ATP binding domain that donates the energy necessary to solve RNA secondary structures required during virus replication (Fig. 3B ).To explore the impact of spike variations on the host immune response or escape mutants, we intersected the iSNVs detected in S with known and predicted T cell epitopes. We found 11iSNVs intersecting ten known S-reactive CD4+ T cell peptides in eight different patients ( Fig. 4 ; Table S6 ). Nine out of the 11 variants had a non-synonymous effect being mostly found in T2 samples, while only patient 37 harbored a variant in the T1 sample. Patients 16 and 25 had two and three variants mapping at least one reactive epitope, respectively. In addition, crossreferencing comparison with predicted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells revealed seven iSNVs overlapping six different T CD4+ epitopes ( Fig. 4 ; Table S6 ). Alterations in T CD8+ predicted epitopes were reported in 28 peptides in 62 samples ( Table S6 ). The overwhelming majority of patients harbored the D614G substitution mapped in the YQDVNCTEV epitope. This peptide was also predicted as a putative HLA class I candidate binding peptide, together with 31 other regions with a high probability for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, 28 HLA class II candidate peptides had at least one variation across 27 patients (Table S6) .We built a classification model using relevant features that had been previously highlighted in our analysis and might distinguish long-term infection samples. ADA Boost classification demonstrated that T1 and T2 genomes could be distinguished with 79,84% accuracy. The ROC curve with AUC of 0.9, 84% sensitivity, and 87% specificity (Fig. S4 ) demonstrated a slight difference between the classified groups. This difference could be understood by analyzing the feature importance of the classification model (Fig. S4) . The most important features in T1 and T2 are related to viral load, missense variants, total variants and G>A signature. The F1 score metric reached 86% which indicates a balanced relation between precision and recall. The 84% sensitivity suggests a slight difference in the classification of T1 and T2. Since the difference is minor when sensitivity is compared with specificity, we considered the model's performance acceptable for classification. The variance structure accurately shows the most important feature of the classification model.To gain insights into viral population structure and dynamics during persistent infection, we performed a per-sample haplotype reconstruction using high and low-frequency variants. A total of 182 viral quasispecies were reconstructed with an average of 3 entities per sample. Pangolin algorithm classified all haplotypes as having the same lineage as the consensus lineages of their patients. Phylogenetic inference of the reconstructed haplotypes was mostly in agreement with the consensus tree (Fig. 5) . Pangolin lineages were also recovered in well-supported clades.Similarly, the separation of these minority haplotypes from the monophyletic clade formed by other haplotypes from the same patient is not well supported by bootstrap values. This should be interpreted as a lack of difference between haplotypes rather than as a sign of distinction between them. Indeed, we inferred an identical haplotype as the most frequent for 13 patients. Namely, patients 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 22, 31, 35, 39, 41, 43, 44 The same pattern was observed among patients 14, 34 and 40 that included the hospital staff cluster. The most frequent haplotype is the same in all T1 samples, as well as in T2 samples from patients 14 and 34, corroborating the transmission hypothesis that we have proposed from the consensus sequence analysis. Interestingly, a low frequency iSNV (C622A) is present in T2 sample from patient 14, and in T1 from patients 34 and 40. This suggests that Patient 14, who was the first of the three to develop symptoms, contaminated patients 34 and 40, and that the transmitted virus included some low frequency iSNVs, along with the most frequent ones.Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a great challenge to the development of effective public health policies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the low availability of PCR tests, there is a prevalent use of symptom-based criteria for interruption of primary care management and self-isolation, usually two weeks since the onset of symptoms. Prevalence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms affect between 10-30% of patients worldwide and may last 3-12 weeks (Greenhalgh et al. 2020; Ladds et al.) . The high prevalence of persistent cases indicates that this is not a rare phenomenon and needs to be explored to better control epidemic spread.Nevertheless, the reason why some people have persistent infection and how the virus survives for so long are still not fully understood. Indeed, persistent infection has been described for many other respiratory viruses, including influenza (Wang et al. 2018) , MERS (Arabi et al. 2018) , and RSV (Gomez 2012) . In this study, we successfully identified patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections by performing a longitudinal study of viral intra-host genomic evolution using a high-throughput sequencing approach in 33 patients infected for over two weeks. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 may establish persistent infection in the nasopharynx, even in seroconverted patients, indicating that the safest way to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 is through PCR testing to ensure viral clearance.Returning to work without testing can be particularly dangerous among healthcare workers due to their high exposure and contact with the susceptible population. In the analyzed cohort, mainly composed of healthcare workers, long-term infections represent 30% of cases. This extremely high frequency of persistent infections may be a caveat of our cohort. Populational studies including asymptomatic individuals in a randomized analysis could lower this proportion. Of note, we have amplified and sequenced the full-length genome of viruses in T2 samples from these patients. The full-length genomes sequenced had all SARS-CoV-2 ORFs intact and consequently, are possibly able to infect cells and transmit to other persons.In fact, the transmission cluster formed by health care workers of the same hospital highlights the preservation of the infectious ability of the virus in T2 samples. Moreover, there is a 13 days interval from the first patient's symptom onset to that of the last patient, demonstrating the maintenance of the virus's ability to establish successful prolonged infection events even after large intervals of time. The finding of transmission of intra-host variants between patients of the cluster, meaning that infection doses were large enough to contain low-frequency iSNVs, is essential to understand the nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and needs further investigation.Previous studies also reported the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within hospital workers providing evidence for maintaining the prolonged infectious state (Rivett et al. 2020; Sikkema et al. 2020; Suárez-García et al. 2020) .Genomic variations are the main source of molecular evolution and adaptability in many RNA viruses. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 intra-host genetic diversity is a possible cause of persistent infection. Quasispecies diversity provides the virus a greater chance to evolve and adapt during infection (Eigen 1993; Coffin 1995; Domingo et al. 1996) . Intra-host diversity is implicated with pathogenicity and infection outcomes for many other viruses (Vignuzzi et al. 2006; McWilliam Leitch and McLauchlan 2013; Ni et al. 2016) . According to the IEDB database, some of the mutated antigen sequences identified in our analysis may have differences in binding affinity for epitopes to MHC-I and MHC-II, once most of iSNVs in Spike protein mapped to T cell predicted epitopes. Therefore, these variations could be associated with a mechanism of escaping the host's immune response and should be further investigated for the development of antiviral therapy and vaccines.In conclusion, our study sheds light on the routes for intra-host genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during persistent infection. We observed that most intra-host variations in SARS-CoV-2 present individual specificity and were not longitudinally transmitted, indicating that they probably were not adaptative. The RNA-editing enzyme activities of the innate immune system of the human host can be associated with the temporal accumulation of iSNVs along the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and this generated quasispecies diversity may be correlated with the outcome of persistent infection. Whether the upregulation in the mutation rate of Spike and Helicase is an adaptive feature still needs further investigation. Our findings have potentially exploitable implications for public health decisions during the management of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as therapeutic uses that should be investigated.Thirty-three individuals with persistent infection by SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in the study.Only samples with a Ct < 35 were sequenced. Clinical and demographic data were self-reported by the patients. The present study was approved by the National Commission of Ethics in Research (protocol numbers 30161620.0.0000.5257 and 30127020.0.0000.0068). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.Microtitre plates (Immulon 2 HB) were coated with a trimeric spike proteins at 4 μ g per ml in 100 mM sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4ºC. Excess protein was removed by washing five times with PBS + 0,05% Tween-20 (PBST, Sigma) andunbound sites blocked with 5% BSA in PBST. Samples were added at a 1/50 dilution in PBST + 2% BSA, followed by incubation at 37ºC/1 hour. Plates were washed five times with PBST then incubated for one hour at room temperature with polyclonal anti-human IgG antibody conjugated to HRP (Promega). Plates were again washed five times with PBST followed by addition of the chromogenic substrate TMB (Sigma) for 10 minutes and reaction stopped with 1N sulphuric acid. Absorbance was read at 450nm with an ELISA microplate reader (Biochrom Asys). A positive control specimen (from a known COVID-19 patient) in simplicate and a negative control (pre-epidemic plasma sample) in triplicate were added to every assay plate for validation and cut-off determination. Results were expressed as reaction of sample optical density value divided by the assay cutoff.Raw read sequences in FASTQ format were first pre-processed using FastQC (v0.11.4) (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) for quality control analysis. Next, we used trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al. 2014) for filtering low-quality reads, keeping those with an average quality ≥ 25. Optical duplicates in 5' primer regions were removed using were annotated using snpEff v4.5 (Cingolani et al. 2012 ).We searched the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org) in mid-August for all complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 collected between March and June in three Brazilian states: Rio de Janeiro (RJ), São Paulo (SP) and Minas Gerais (MG). State choice included RJ and MG due to our sampling localities and SP due to its geographic proximity and since it has a significant role in the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. We gathered 135 genome sequences to compose our phylogenetic dataset (GISAID accession numbers are available in Table S7 ) and used the MAFFT algorithm to build the multiple sequence alignment from the resulting dataset (Katoh and Standley 2013) . We estimated maximum likelihood phylogeny with this alignment of 201 genomes using a general time-reversible nucleotide substitution model (Tavaré 1986 ) with a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+I), selected by Modelfinder (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017) in IQTree v.1.6.12 (Nguyen et al. 2015) . Ancestral sequence reconstruction was implemented using empirical Bayesian method in IQTree v.1.6.12. Branch support values were assessed by 1000 replicates of ultrafast bootstrap approximation (Hoang et al. 2018 ). We assessed virus lineages for the whole dataset using Pangolin (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io) V 2.0.7 software (Rambaut et al. 2020 ) and checked our sequences for recombination using the full exploratory recombination method in RDP4 (Martin et al. 2015) and by the Phi-test approach (Bruen et al. 2006) in SplitsTree (Huson and Bryant 2006) . No statistically significant evidence for recombination was found. We used Gblocks to select the most conserved regions of our multiple sequence alignment with default parameters (Castresana 2000) . A unique block was selected with 29476 sites, representing 98% of the original alignment (flank positions: 215 -29690).We conducted viral haplotype reconstruction from BAM and variant files that had been previously filtered for each sample. A penalized regression approach was applied using RegressHaplo based on a graph algorithm in R (Leviyang et al. 2017 ). Within-sample incidenceand abundance-based diversity indices were quantified using QSUtils in R (Gregori et al. 2014) .An alignment including only coding regions was prepared for selection analysis. All haplotypes containing stop codons were excluded.Using the caret R package (Kuhn 2008) , we built a machine learning model based on the ADA Boost algorithm (Hastie et al. 2009 ) optimized for tuning of parameters to evaluate classification of patient time points T1 and T2. To compose the feature matrix, we selected the following variables: viral load; missense and total variants; nucleotide substitution signatures; nonsynonymous/synonymous ratio; non-coding and synonymous variants. The dataset was separated into two sets: 80% for training and 20% for testing. To evaluate model error, we applied 10,000 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation. Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and model performance metrics were calculated using the R package MLeval. Feature importance selection was applied using the caret function varImp for assigning scores and ranking features that indicate their relative importance when making a prediction. This approach has the advantage of using a model-based approach, which can incorporate the correlation structure between the predictors into the importance calculation (Huynh-Thu et al. 2012) .",Brazil,first author,2020-11-16,11
9c24bd90b1c28addc5f6a50ad4562926b8cb8e82,Specific immune-regulatory transcriptional signatures reveal sex and age 2 differences in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 3 4,"More than ten months after the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease 76 2019 in Wuhan, China 1-3 , approximately 43 million confirmed cases of 77 COVID-19 and more than 1,1 million deaths have been reported worldwide 4 . The 78clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to severe pulmonary 79 disease, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 5,6 . Enhanced 80 expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 entry 81 receptor 7 , and dysregulation of the immune response likely contribute to more severe 82 disease in older patients with comorbidities. Even as there is an increased 83 understanding of what increases the risk of severe disease, the increased 84 male/female mortality ratio remains poorly understood, especially considering the 85 lack of gender differences in disease incidence 6, 8 . A recent study reported no gender 86 differences in the levels of anti-S1-IgM and -IgG antibody titers nor the number of 87 naïve-or memory B cells. Compared to males, peripheral blood mononuclear cells 88 (PBMCs) from females exhibited higher levels of terminally differentiated T cells 89 expressing activation molecules (CD38 and HLA-DR-positive) and negative 90 regulators (PD-1 and TIM-3) 9 . Moreover, male patients displayed higher plasma 91 levels of pro-inflammatory innate immune cytokine/chemokines (CXCL8 and IL-18) 10 . 92These findings indicate a better capacity for immune modulation in females 93 compared to males. 94The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by hyperactivated T 95 cells (both CD4 + and CD8 + ) 6,11 and macrophages 12 . These hyperactivated immune 96 cells likely contribute to the massive serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, also 97 referred to as ""cytokine storm"" 13 . In parallel, tissue damage has been associated 98 with hyperactivation of neutrophil-induced oxidative stress and high neutrophil 99 counts 14 , degranulation, and release of extracellular traps (NETs). These processes 100 are associated with increased levels of acute-phase reactants (e.g., C-reactive 101 coherent results compared to the swab dataset analyses. CEMITool analysis 176 revealed ten co-expression modules enriched in whole leukocytes of COVID-19 177 patients compared to the control group. Among them, module M6 was enriched by 178 interferon signaling genes, while module M7 was composed of genes associated with 179 neutrophil degranulation in the COVID-19 group (Fig. 2a-c) . The data, therefore, 180 points toward a systemic (not restricted to upper airways) immunopathological 181 association between interferon signaling and neutrophil-mediated immunity in 182 patients with COVID-19. Supplementary Tables S9 and S10 describe the DEGs 183 associated with CMSP and NMI in the GSE157103 dataset. 184Interferon Induced Protein With Tetratricopeptide Repeats (IFIT)1, IFIT2, IFIT3; 205 chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)9, CXCL10, CXCL11; 2′, 5′-oligoadenylate 206 synthetase (OAS)1, OAS2, and OAS3; tripartite motif (TRIM)5 and TRIM22. The 207 same phenomenon was observed in terms of transcripts of endogenous activators of 208 the immune system, such as the CD40 ligand and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 209 and CD86). Thus, our data suggest a higher transcriptional modulation of the immune 210 response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in female and young patients compared to males 211 and elderly. 212We next analyzed the CMSP and NMI genes in two different datasets 229 (GSE157103 and GSE156063). The circos plot showed that patients with a high viral 230 load shared a higher number of CMSP genes with younger and female patients (Fig.  231   4e) . Interestingly, female, young, and low-load patients shared more common NMI 232 genes in swab and total leukocytes than male and elderly patients (Fig. 4f) Fig. 3 , dataset GSE156063), increasing the validity of these 240 findings. Further, the upregulation of CMSP and NMI genes was present in both the 241 datasets described above, which are of bulk RNAseq, and in a single-cell RNAseq 242 study (Extended Data Fig. 4) . 243Considering the increased male/female mortality ratio (Extended Data Fig. 5) , 246 we sought to further characterize the transcriptomic features of COVID-19. We 247 searched for sex differences between DEGs identified in female vs. male patients 248with COVID-19 as well as female vs. healthy male controls throughout the different 249Interferome analysis of these two sets of DEGs. This analysis revealed an 295 interconnected network of IFN-regulated genes modulated either by IFN type I, II, 296 and III ( Fig. 6b and Supplementary Tables 13 and 14) . 297In conclusion, our integrative approach indicates that the gene expression 362 profile associated with CMSP and NMI has a distinct pattern according to sex and Ct < 19), defined the viral load. We applied the statistical cut-offs of log2 fold-change 385 > 1 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 to determine DEGs between the categories. For 386 subsequent analysis, we followed the limma-voom pipeline to identify DEGs between 387 female and male. 388We used these DEGs to identify different ontology terms. Biological processes [Gene 390Ontology (GO)] were analyzed using EnrichR (available at 391 http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) 21,63 , and the enriched immunological terms 392we performed the analysis of gene co-expression modules with the R-package 397CEMiTool using default parameters 23 . We plotted the set of genes associated with 398 CMSP (GO:0019221) and NMI (GO:0002446) in bubble-based heat maps with 399 hierarchical clustering using web tool Morpheus 400(https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/) 64 with Euclidian distance metric. 401GraphPad Prisma v.8 (GraphPad Software) was used to generate the violin plots. 402The UniProtKB database (available at http://www.uniprot.org/) was used to access 403 the functional information. We used clusterProfiler 65 to obtain dot plots and Cnetplots 404 of enriched terms associated with CMSP and NMI-associated genes. Shared CMSP 405and NMI genes among all groups were displayed using Circos Plot (http://circos.ca/). 406The identification of interferome genes was performed with Interferome V2.01 407 (http://www.interferome.org/interferome/home.jspx). 408Network of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and neutrophil-mediated immunity 410 was constricted using DEGs, and highlighting the genes differentially expressed in 411 female samples.

Notably, the effects of this pandemic have greatly impacted the social, economic, health, education, environmental and tourism sectors of society (AWWA, 2020; Fine, Reichle & Lord, 2020; CCSA, 2020; Wuyts, et al. 2020 ). In the last few months, one of the areas where the environmental impacts of COVID-19 are most pronounced is in waste management (Klemeš, et al. 2020; Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020) . This is a major environmental concern because of the surge in the demand for and the use of plastic products, protective gears, personal protective equipment (PPE), disposable life support equipment and general plastic supplies like syringes (Klemeš, et al. 2020; Kampf, et al. 2020; Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020) , all used in the prevention and treatment of the virus. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, pollution of the terrestrial and marine environment as a result of increasing waste generation and poor waste management was already a growing issue globally (Yousif & Scott, 2007; Cecilia, 2012; Marshall & Farahbakhsh, 2013; Mukama, et al. 2016; Boucher & Billard, 2019; Rajmohan, et al. 2019) . With the emergence of the pandemic, these concerns are now extended (Clark, 2020; Dente & Hashimoto, 2020; Nghiem, et al. 2020; Ro, 2020) .To mitigate the spread of the COVID-19, countries around the world adopted and enforced many unprecedented measures (closure of schools, social and physical distancing, restrictions of a local and international movement, workplace closures). Despite these adopted methods, the advanced countries had to maintain priority in delivering essential services which play a vital role in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Such indispensable essential services include waste collection and management (AWWA, 2020; Lodder, & de Roda Husman, 2020; Mallapaty, 2020; Nghiem, et al. 2020; CDC, 2020; WHO 2020c) . Within developed countries, green, and sustainable waste management is a common practice (Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020) , and as a result, the established management structure contributes to the capacity to reduce the threats of spreading of the virus through the increasing waste generated at the household level.However, the poor and inadequate waste management strategies within developing and least developed countries contribute to a higher threat of community spread of COVID-19 (Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020) . Examples of such poor or inadequate waste management practices are: open and poorly managed landfills where both human and animal scavengers can roam freely and interact with possible contaminated waste, reuse of potentially contaminated bottles, packages, and materials (Butot, et al. 2007; World Bank, 2019; Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020) .Given the morphology and structure of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the viral name for , the virus has a three-hour lifespan in the air as part of aerosols, a four (4) hour lifespan on copper surfaces, a twenty-four (24) hour lifespan on cardboards; a two to three (2-3) day lifespan on stainless steel materials, three (3) day lifespan on plastics and sewage, and a three to four (3-4) day lifespan on solid faeces (van Doremalen, et al. 2020; Ye, et. al.2016; Chin, et al. 2020; Nghiem, et al. 2020) .Hence, the structure and lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 on some mediums or surfaces that are found in waste are of tremendous concern in the increasing spread of COVID-19 (Qu, et al. 2020) .Proper waste collection from households, quarantine facilities, hospitals, and structural management is, therefore, critical in the efforts to curb the spread of the disease through environmental media.There are currently a significant number of documented and published impacts of COVID-19 on Nigeria (Akintunde, Chen & Di., 2020; Edomah & Ndulue, 2020; Okuonghae & Omame, 2020; Ohia, Bakarey & Ahmad, 2020; Mogaji, 2020; Maclean, 2020; ) , while there are only a few references for Guyana in some of the published research works of the Caribbean and South America regions (Oyedotun & Moonsammy, 2020; WHO, 2020b) . However, in all the publications for the two countries researched and as at the time of the writing of this paper, there is neither a published work on the impacts of COVID-19 on waste management for the two countries nor a published work on the perception of residents in the two countries relating to waste management. Considering these observations and coupled with the impact of COVID-19, this paper fills the gap in documenting the understanding of how COVID-19 is impacting waste handling and management in the developing countries.This paper aims to 1) investigate the perceptions of residents living in Guyana and Nigeria on waste management systems and practices in place amidst and 2) identify and contribute to potential research gaps that can help in the policies strategized at addressing or mitigating the challenges of the pandemic. In this study, we examined the potential of the existing waste management practices in spreading or encouraging the spread of the SARS-CoV-2. We recognise that developing countries, especially Nigeria and Guyana sampled for this survey, have socio-economic and environmental difficulties that precede the COVID-19 pandemic. It is, therefore, hoped that this paper presents the needed information that can guide the policymakers across the sampled and similar countries in the planning on how to address the challenges that preceded but which are now exacerbated by the pandemic and thereby, chart a new course of action for individual countries and environments.Materials and MethodsThe primary sources for the data used in this study were generated through random questions prepared and presented in Google Forms and administered through social media to households of Guyana in South America and Nigeria in Africa ( Figure 1 ). The questionnaires were completed by a total of 489 households between 29th May and 7th June 2020. A three(3) step approach was used in data collection:1) The creation of data collection form using Google Form (Mansor, 2012; Wiemken, et al. 2018 lists were also made available in addition to radio button provision for the selection of some variables and parameters.2) The administration of the created form was published, and the links provided to individual households to help to respond the survey. We utilised several options for this task including sending the link through WhatsApp, Facebook, emails and professional networks.Due to the government-enforced lockdown restrictions and the social distancing regulations, a convenience sampling technique was used in this study. The campaign for this survey lasted for ten days.3) The transfer of the collected data from Google Form to a spreadsheet for synthesis and qualitative analysis of the responses. Responses to the survey were automatically saved and stored in Google Forms. Google Forms allow direct linking of input with Google spreadsheets through the ""responses"" tab on the form (Mansor, 2012; Wiemken, et al. 2018 ).The spreadsheets containing the data were downloaded and analysed using Microsoft Excel.For the findings presented in this paper, descriptive and exploratory analyses were performed. The first COVID-19 confirmed case in Nigeria was reported on 27th February 2020 with the arrival of an Italian citizen to Lagos who tested positive for the virus (NCDC, 2020; MacLean, et al., 2020; Ayinde, et al. 2020) . Whereas, the first confirmed case for Guyana was reported on 13th March 2020 (WHO, 2020a; Oyedotun & Moonsammy, 2020) . From the dates of these confirmations to 7th August 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths that resulted from COVID-19 has increased significantly across the two countries. As of 7th August 2020, the total cumulative confirmed cases for Nigeria stood at 45,244 and the total number of mortalities from the virus was 930; while, confirmed positive cases for Guyana were 509 and cumulative deaths from the virus were 22, respectively. For these two developing countries sampled in South America/Caribbean (Guyana) and Africa (Nigeria), confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to rise as its spread could be attributed to both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (Rutayisire, et al. 2020) .At the inception of this pandemic in developing countries, there was a paucity of data for its projection and impacts (Ayinde, et al. 2020) . However, over the months, many statistical One of such measures adopted in Nigeria and Guyana is the use of face masks which is compulsory in public places with a fine charged on offenders (Rover, 2020; Africa Check, 2020) . Because of this mandate and enforcement in these two countries, hundreds of thousands of PPE are manufactured and used daily (refer to Table 1 for the estimate). There is a possibility that the high volume of PPE disposed daily can be contaminated and a greater possibility of the contaminated PPE ending up as waste poses serious environmental and health risks (Kampf, et al. 2020; Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020) . (2020) 3. Presented in Table 3 is the summary of the household's perception of their waste generation when compared with the waste generated before and at this time of COVID-19pandemic and the resultant lockdown that followed. In Nigeria, about two-thirds (60.8%) of households averred that there were increases in the quantity of their waste when the COVID-19 pandemic began, while over one-third (39.2%) believed that their waste did not increase as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, in Guyana, two-thirds (63.4%) of respondents also affirmed that there was an increase in the waste generated as a result of the pandemic. However, about one-third (36.6%) did not observe any dramatic changes in the number of wastes generated during this period. The aforementioned attest that waste size was also impacted during COVID-19. This result further implies that through mobility restrictions and selfquarantine (Rover, 2020; Africa Check, 2020) , more residents staying at home have caused an increase in the quantity of solid waste generated at the household level. Although, the net change in solid waste might be accounted for by the expected fall in wastes at workplaces and/or as a result of the decrease in industrial activities. Thus, an increase in solid waste at household levels in these two countries might necessarily not imply an increase in solid waste at the municipal level or any regional or national scale.Of those that indicated an increase in the household waste generation during this period, 57.8% of households in Nigeria averred that there was a double increase in the household waste quantity during the period, while 42.2% claimed that their waste increased by approximately a quarter. Similarly, in Guyana, about half, 50.7% of the households affirmed that their waste increased more than twice during the COVID-19 while more than two-fifths (48.6%) stated that their waste increased by less than a quarter of the usual amounts during the pandemic and at the time of the survey (Table 3) . It thus, posits that there has been a significant increase in household solid waste generated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. was not noticeable in their waste in recent times. The foregoing observation therefore, suggests that there is a significant increase in PPE in recent times in the two countries as similar to other places in the world (Kampf, et al. 2020; Nghiem, et al. 2020; Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the municipal solid waste collection has been very critical, lacking public services in many cities especially in slum areas of many developing countries (Mukama, et al. 2016; WHO, 2020c) . However, since the advent of COVID-19, there appears to have been a short-term impact on the treatment or attention given to municipal waste management in the developing countries (Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020) . Based on the responses from the households sampled for this survey, 41.8% of the households in Nigeria where there was municipal waste collection arrangement previously, observed some short-term changes in the schedules of the waste collection (Table 5 ). However, in Guyana, the majority (75.9%) of households at the time of the survey affirmed the notable changes in their schedules of waste collection. In area where there is no arranged municipal waste collection, different household waste disposal systems were adopted at the household level. In Nigeria, 65.9% considered taking their wastes to nearby dumpsites while about one-quarter (24.9%) adopted the burning or dumping in rivers, etc. (Figure 2) . Similarly, in Guyana, more than two-thirds (69.4%) prefer to dispose their waste at nearby dump sites despite the impacts of the pandemic on man and the environment. About one-fifth (20%) burn their waste, 3.7% adopt a long storage system by storing waste in the garbage until waste collectors come, and similarly, about 3.7% adopt other forms of unauthorized disposal methods. This observation implies that without an efficient centralized method, households are likely to be increasingly exposed to COVID-19 infection because of the methods of waste disposal and management practices. The surge in these types of household wastes from the COVID-19 pandemic is a threat indeed that could overwhelm the existing waste management systems in a similar note as the healthcare facilitators. (Klemeš, et al. 2020) . give thoughts about the concern and about (8.8%) revealed that they were unconcerned. The foregoing analysis therefore, suggests that residents were fairly concerned with solid waste contamination of the virus during this pandemic. The results indicate a fair level of awareness regarding the waste management issue and COVID-19 spread amongst citizens of the two countries.Presented in Table 6 is the level of agreement on the special waste collection strategy for PPE by respondents in the two countries. In Nigeria, more than nine-tenths (92.3%) of respondents agreed that there should be a special waste collection at the household level while about 7.7% disagreed. Similarly, in Guyana, more than nine-tenths (90.7%) of respondents agreed that a special waste strategy should be adopted at the household level, while about onetenth (9.3%) disagreed on the special waste collection system. The conclusion that can be drawn from the foregoing analysis is that respondents in the two countries largely agree on a special waste collection strategy for PPE. The overwhelming consensus amongst the participants again demonstrates a public perception and the understanding of the dynamics of the waste management issue in curbing the virus. This bodes well for waste management policy strategies requiring public involvement. Once a week 37.7 37.5Once a month 1.5 3.2The analysis in Table 6 shows that in Nigeria, a majority (88.3%) of respondents agreed on the separation of waste into different bags or bins, while about 11.7% of respondents disagreed on the separation strategy of sorting wastes into different bags/ bins. In Guyana, about nine-tenths (92.6%) agreed on the separation of waste into different kinds of bags/bins, while about 7.4% disagreed on sorting of waste into different bins. The public willingness to comply with potential waste management measures at the household level is noteworthy.The analysis in Table 7 (Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020) . To further ascertain if the existing landfills/waste dumps in these two countries serve as food banks for animals, the types of animals observed by the respondents were documented.The study revealed that in Nigeria, about two-thirds of animals noticed on landfills include a combination of dogs, goats, cows, pigs, and hens while dogs singlehandedly accounted for slightly one-tenth (13.9%), rodents accounted for 11.5%, and pigs accounted for 8.7%.However, in Guyana, more than nine-tenths (91.7%) of animals such as dogs, goats, cows, pigs, and hens were evident. As observed, the record for pigs is about 2.9% which is on the low end of the spectrum as with the other animals.Furthermore, Table 8 shows the responses to the perception of households on the possibility of exposure of livestock to the COVID-19 and also the likely transmission of the virus from animals to humans at the neighbourhood level. In Nigeria, more than a half (56%) of the respondents averred that this is possible and slightly over two-fifth (44%) of respondents were on the contrary. However, in Guyana, about 45.8% of respondents affirmed the possibilities of exposure of livestock to the virus and subsequent animal to human transmission, while more than half (54.6%) were on the contrary. The result reveals a contrasting opinion of residents in the two countries reviewed. However, it can be noted that the research about the novel coronavirus is still ongoing, hence residents might not be knowledgeable enough to ascertain the possibility of the virus as being transmissible from animals to humans, and this might account for their responses above. This mater on the possible transmission of COVID-19 by animals, however, are well discussed in the international media and this remains a matter of concerns globally (Dolan, 2020; Hollingsworth, 2020; Hong Kong Press Release, 2020; Krever & Picheta, 2020; Leroy, Grouilh, & Brugère-Picoux, 2020; Maestro & Spary, 2020) The results of respondents' suggestions on management of livestock exposure to COVID-19 at landfills and transmission of the animal to man was presented in Table 8 . InNigeria, a majority (89.6%) of the surveyed respondents suggested legislation on waste disposal and animal control, about 4.1% opined that animals should be kept away from landfills by owners, about 2.1% respondents suggested the use of special garbage systems for affected cases or relocation of waste to minimize impacts, and perimeter fencing respectively. Also, in Guyana, the majority (88.2%) of respondents suggested regulations about waste disposal and animal control legislation. About 5.8% suggested perimeter fencing, 2% suggested the use of special garbage systems for suspected or affected cases, relocation of waste to minimize impacts, and keeping away of animals from landfills by owners respectively. This result implies that residents in the two countries largely suggest legislation on waste disposal and animal control. In Table 8 , respondents noted that there is the need to pay attention to the obvious possibility that COVID-19 can be transmitted from livestock exposure at landfills to man. In Nigeria, about two-thirds (61.7%) of surveyed respondents averred that there is a need to pay attention to the transmission of COVID-19 from animals to humans, while about one third (38.3%) do not agree with this. Likewise, in Guyana, more than two-thirds (69.5%) also see the need to pay attention to the transmission of COVID-19 from animals to man through livestock exposure at landfills, while about one-third (30.5%) do not agree to the need to focus attention on the transmission of the virus from animal exposure at landfills/dumps and subsequent transmission to man. Although this debate on the animals to human transmission is documented (Dolan, 2020; Hollingsworth, 2020; Hong Kong Press Release, 2020; Krever & Picheta, 2020; Leroy, Grouilh, & Brugère-Picoux, 2020; Maestro & Spary, 2020) , the kind of relationship between human being and their pets should be of interest to how this matter should be considered, especially if the pets are allowed to roam in the communities unhindered.The wider publicity that the possibility of animals being infected with COVID-19 may also provoke violent reactions to pets, especially cats and dogs (e.g., Leroy, Grouilh, & Brugère-Picoux, 2020) , hence the need to pay attention to this issue.Detailed in Table 8 are the results of respondents' opinions on who takes the responsibility for securing landfills/dumpsites from contamination with the pandemic. InNigeria, about two-fifths (43.2%) of respondents opined that government agencies should take responsibility, about one-fifth (18.8%) suggested collaborative efforts, 15.5% of respondents suggested community, more than one-tenth (13.1%) opted for municipal authority, 8.5%suggested household and relatively few (0.9%) opted for public-private-partnership (PPP). InGuyana, more than two-fifths (43.8%) respondents suggested neighbourhood and local democratic council, about two-fifths (38.2%) suggested government at the national, regional and local levels, about one-tenth (9.4%) opined for collaborative efforts, and relatively insignificant responses for environmental agencies and public health ministries, community and household respectively. From the results obtained in Nigeria, residents largely suggested that government agencies (mainly at the state level) should take responsibility for securing landfills/dumps from contamination of COVID-19, while in Guyana, it is the neighbourhood/local democratic councils that were the main suggestion. These two contrasting opinions reveal the present realities on the management of municipal wastes in the two countries.The previous analysis considered the management of landfills/dumps and the transmission of the virus from infected livestock feeding at dumps. Residents opined that government agencies at the state (Nigeria) and local levels (Guyana) should be responsible for securing landfills from such contamination. In this section, a broader view of solid waste management during the pandemic was ascertained through opinions from sampled respondents.Detailed in Table 9 are the summarized results of the type of waste easily contaminated with COVID-19. In Nigeria, more than nine-tenths (94.8%) of respondents listed cans, glass, bottles, plastics, fabrics, bags, and newspapers are easily contaminated materials, while relatively few (4.1%) emphasized all types of wastes and biodegradable material. Similarly, inGuyana, more than nine-tenths also affirmed that drink cans, glass bottles, plastics, fabrics, bags, and newspapers are some likely contaminants, and slightly about 2.4% mentioned all types of waste. This observation is not surprising as it is well known that coronavirus has active life spans varying between three hours to seven days on these types of materials (van Doremalen, et al. 2020; Ye, et. al.2016; Chin, et al. 2020; Nghiem, et al. 2020) . The respondents' ability to identify the materials in Table 9 can be attributed to the volumes of information on COVID-19 spread circulating through the media and public information services globally. For countries significantly affected by COVID-19, home isolation and temporary quarantine facilities are the most adopted practices by countries to contain those infected and as such, allow hospital rooms /wards be prioritised to patients with severe cases. (Nghiem, et al. 2020) . Documented in Table 10 were respondents' level of awareness of household waste/quarantine facilities suspected with the virus. In Nigeria, only about 15% of respondents were aware of household waste/quarantine facilities for those suspected with the virus, while a majority (85%) were not aware of such. Likewise, in Guyana, only slightly above one-tenth (12.5%) of sampled respondents were aware of household waste/ quarantine facilities suspected with the virus, while a majority (87.5%) of respondents were not aware of household waste/quarantine facilities suspected with the virus. The understanding that can be drawn from the survey is that most residents were not aware of household waste/quarantine facilities of those infected with COVID-19. This lack of awareness may be as a result of guilt, shame or reproach almost associated with any contaminable diseases (Abraham, et al. 2020; Ansari, Grier, & Byers, 2020; Manson, 2020; Conway III, Woodard, Zubrod, & Chan, 2020; Costello, et al. 2020) The analysis in Table 11 also shows respondents' opinions on the need to review waste management policies in the two countries. In Nigeria, more than nine-tenths (90.5%) of sampled respondents agreed on the need to review the country's waste management policies and plans, while about one-tenth (9.5%) of respondents did not agree to this. It is important to note that waste management policies in Nigeria are formulated at the federal and state levels, but implementation is done at the local levels. Most state governments in Nigeria create a statewide agency in managing waste. However, due to the capital-intensive nature and technical requirement needed for effective waste management, most local government areas in Nigeria could not carry any implementation agenda and often depend on efforts initiated by their respective state government. In Guyana, more than nine-tenths (96.8%) respondents agreed that there is a need to review waste management policies in Guyana, while, relatively about 3.2% of respondents did not agree on the need to review waste management policies in the country. Waste management in Guyana is often coordinated at the neighbourhood/local levels.It can be averred that residents in the two countries would prefer a review of their waste management policies in the light of the present pandemic challenge. The inter-relations of the pandemic with waste management calls for a need to critically examine its nexus to waste management so as to curtail the spread of the virus through effective strategies when devised.Waste remains a serious environmental and human health problems in developing countries (Um, et al. 2018; World Bank, 2019; Margallo, et al. 2019 ). The COVID-19 pandemic has created the urgency for the needed attention that this sector deserves in the developing countries. This sector (waste management sector) has evolved from being a careless disposition of litters to the more integrated, sophisticated, advanced and technologically imperative systems in human history (Margallo, et al., 2019) ; Therefore, the developing countries of Nigeria and Guyana, should establish or revise their waste management policies/acts, strengthen the enforcement of the municipal waste ordinances and generally improve the sector to a proper 21st century sector that can withstand the environmental and health challenges posed by the continuous generation of wastes induced by the COVID-19 or other future pandemics.The present realities of the novel COVID-19 pandemic have created an urgency to understand the inter-relations between municipal waste management and the pandemic. Waste managers and residents are thus faced with a greater responsibility of curtailing the spread of the virus and risks of exposure to the virus. The perceptions of residents in two developing countries, Nigeria and Guyana respectively, were sought to create an inclusive approach to policy formulation. The findings of this study demonstrate that the people of Nigeria andGuyana are perceptive about the waste management issues in spreading the virus. Most respondents outlined the need for intervention, their willingness to comply with the necessary policy measures, and the recognition of the need for an improved waste management system.Circumventing the waste management issue and COVID-19 spread requires a participatory effort between the communities, central government, municipalities, and private sector agencies (Kulkarni & Anantharama, 2020) . The waste management system in Nigeria and Guyana is plagued with questionable practices that are of concern to the communities and households. Unregulated dumping activities, unmonitored community landfills, and roaming livestock in dumps are all potential festering grounds for viral spread in these countries. Our modest study demonstrated the community's insight into some of these waste management challenges and strongly affirms the vulnerability of COVID-19 spreading through improper waste disposal and handling. Further exacerbating our affirmation, the households surveyed indicated an increase in their waste disposal. Thus, as cases increase, so will the contamination of wastes. Further work is needed to explore the environmental epidemiology behind the COVID-19 waste management issue.The insights provided by this paper into the community perception of waste management and COVID-19 from these two developing countries' perspectives can contribute to the development of a broader pandemic management plan by including the relatively overlooked issue of waste being a factor.",Guyana,abstract,2020-11-23,11
00a46273b4ba1435d6bdae3e8a3bfb20011f1ef7,Thermodynamic evaluation of the impact of DNA mismatches in PCR-type SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a flurry of activity regarding the detection of SARS-CoV-2, in particular a substantial amount of new RT-PCR primers were developed for this specific purpose [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . A number of factors can influence the reliability of the PCR detection, such as sample contamination [20] , cross-reactivity with other viruses [14] , contamination of reagents [21] , non-specific annealing [22] and poor amplification efficiency [23] . A crucial primer design factor is its hybridization melting temperature [24] that is related to the annealing of oligonucleotides. A set of primers with close melting temperatures and in the ideal range for primer extension usually ensures good PCR performance [25] .A factor that may interfere with the hybridization temperatures are the presence of mismatches, that is non-Watson-Crick base pairs, between the primer and the DNA target. This affects the stability of the duplex, usually leading to a decrease in the hybridization temperature [26, 27] . As a result, the presence of mismatches may influence the performance of primers restraining the amplification of DNA target. New mismatches arise due to mutations in primer regions of the target DNA, and may lead to false-negative results [20, [28] [29] [30] . This is of special concern for the case of RNA viruses that have a high mutation rates [19, 30] . Mutations that occur in the SARS-CoV-2 genome [31, 32] imply that the presence of mismatches between primer/probe and the template eventually become inevitable. On the other hand, it is known that mismatch presence may affect only the first few cycles of PCR [33, 34] and with proper design may even be advantageous [35] . Therefore, as a rule of thumb, the occurrence of single mismatches are admitted in the hope that they may not affect the detection of the target and its amplification [36] . Unfortunately, the thermodynamic instability caused by the presence of mismatches is rarely quantified in primer design for a number of reasons. One of which is that the prediction of hybridization temperatures involving mismatches carries large uncertainties. Unlike Watson-Crick complementary base pairs, AT and CG, the hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions of mismatches are strongly dependent on the adjacent base pairs. Temperature predictions rely on experimental melting temperature data which typically do not cover the full combinatorial spectrum of mismatches and were carried out under high sodium buffer conditions [37, 38] . However, this has now changed. A recent development from our group has reworked the parametrization for a comprehensive set of 4032 sequences containing up to three consecutive mismatches [39] . This now enables the analysis in unprecedented detail of the effect of mismatches in primer/probe hybridization.Here, we analyse how and if mismatches do influence the melting temperatures of primer/probes hybridised to SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We collected 19 PCR primer/probe sets (297 primers and 43 probes) which cover seven different gene regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome (N, E, S, M, ORF1ab, RdRp and nsp2 genes) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . These primer/probes were aligned to 21665 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and 323 genomes of other coronaviruses. Melting temperatures are calculated with a mesoscopic model using the newly developed parameters for up to three consecutive mismatches [39] . Using the mesoscopic model for the calculation of mismatches has an important advantage over nearest-neighbour models [37] as it naturally accounts for end effects, that is, mismatches located near the primer end may have different hybridization temperatures than those that are centred which reflects experimental observations on PCR efficiencies [34] .We collected N G = 21665 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 at NCBI [40], in 8 October 2020, and ensured that all were at least 25000 bp in size. The accession codes of these genomes are shown in supplementary table S1. To verify cross-reactivity we also performed the same analysis for N h.c. = 323 human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS), including SARS-CoV-1, and their accession codes are shown in supplementary table S2 and S3.A total of 19 different primer/probe sets for RT-PCR were obtained from Refs. [1-19], their full details are shown in supplementary table S4. Note that several publications include primers from earlier reports. In particular, CDC primers [2] are included in several publications. Therefore, for each set we only considered those that were not repeated from other publications. Note that some primers and probes were designed for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [4, 14] .Each primer or probe sequence is aligned against a given genome using a Smith-Waterman algorithm [41] , where matching base pairs AT and CG where given score 2, mismatches score -1, and no gaps were considered. Alignments were carried out in two strand configurations, first for the genome sequences as obtained from the database and taking the primer/probe sequence as complementary strand These alignments are carried out regardless if the primer was identified as forward or reverse. In all cases the nominal directions of the primers were identified correctly.A primer/probe that was completely aligned to a target genome, without mismatches, was termed as strictly matched. If there were up to three contiguous mismatches in the alignment it was called as partially matched. The limit of three contiguous mismatches relates to the available melting temperature parameters. Alignments with four or more contiguous mismatches were considered as not aligned.As an example of partial alignment, we show the RdRp SARSr-R1 primer (bottom strand) in the MT457390 genomewhere the mismatched site is underlined.Hybridization temperatures T m are calculated fromwhere τ is a statistical index calculated from the classical partition function of a model Hamiltonian, and a 0 and a 1 are regression coefficients obtained from a set of 4096 experimental melting temperatures of which 4032 are from sequences containing up to three consecutive mismatched base pairs [39] . The buffer conditions for these parameters are 50 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, and total strand concentration 1.0 µM. For a complete description of the melting temperature calculation and experimental conditions see Ref. [39, 42] . The index τ was calculated for each primer/probe, using the parameters reported in Ref. [39] , after aligning against a reference genome. The calculation of τ also yields the average displacement profile which shows the expected base-pair opening along the oligonucletide duplex, for details see Eq.(5) from Ref. 39 .We calculated the hybridization temperatures from Eq. (1) for each primer/probe assuming a complete Watson-Crick complementarity which we called the reference temperature T ref. , which are shown in supplementary table S5.All 19 primers/probes were aligned against N G genomes and we kept only those alignments with up to three consecutive mismatches. The coverage for a strictly non-mismatched alignment C strict was calculated aswhere N G the total number of genomes which are at least 25000 bp in size, N n.a. number of genomes for which no alignment was found, and N MM the number of genomes for which a partial alignment with up to three consecutive mismatches was found.Next, for each of the N MM partial alignments we calculated the hybridization temperatures T MM from Eq. (1) taking into account the mismatches, and the difference to the reference tem-T MM is usually, but not always, lower than T ref. [39] . We will consider the partially mismatched coverage C part. aswhere N low is the number of primers/probes satisfyingHere, we will use ∆T lim. = 5 • C, that is we will consider that mismatched primers/probes with T MM no more than 5 • C below the reference temperature T ref. are still acceptable.After aligning all primer/probe sets to all genomes we calculated their hybridization temperatures taking into account up to three consecutive mismatches, as detailed in the methods section. Table 1 summarises all sets analysed, their range of reference hybridization temperatures, strict and partial coverage for SARS-CoV-2 and for non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The detailed results for each primer are shown in supplementary table S5 for SARS-CoV-2. If the PCR primers can in principle bind to non-SARS-CoV-2 targets then this set may not specific [22] . Considering this, we analysed the 19 primer/probe sets in relation to genomes of other coronaviruses (non-SARS) as well as SARS-CoV-1 to verify if there was some cross-reactivity. The detailed results are shown in supplementary tables S6 for SARS-COV-1, and S7 for non-SARS viruses.The typical design rules for PCR primers and probes recommend that the range of hybridization temperatures in a given set should be narrow, of the order of 10 • C [25, 43] . Several authors even suggest that the range for primer pair should be no more than 5 • C [22, 44] or even less than 1 • C [45] . However, it is evident, from table 1, that very few sets have temperature ranges below 10 • C, while some even exceed 20 • C. For example, the Luminex set, which includes the primer/probe set of China CDC, shows differences in the primer temperatures up to 21.6 • C. However, when mismatches are considered the hybridization temperatures may go far below the design range. In Fig. 1 we show an example of a displacement profile where a single AC mismatch completely disturbs the surrounding AT base pairs and the hybridization temperature drops to T MM = 48.5 • C, down from a reference temperature of T ref. = 61.1 • . However, a presence of one or more mismatches does not necessarily imply in a reduction of hybridization temperature. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 89 RIGHT primer when aligned to MT259228.1 has two consecutive mismatches towards the 5 end, see supplementary figure S1. Even though these mismatches induce a small end fraying, it has a calculated temperature of T MM = 68.7 • C which is even somewhat higher than its reference temperature T ref. = 68.3 • C. This stability is caused by an increased stacking interaction between the GA and AA mismatches [39] .In terms of SARS-CoV-2 strict coverage, most sets have C strict typically beyond 90%, which is expected as the primer design is guided by existing genomes. However, a number of specific probes, such as RdRp SARSr-P1-1 from Corman et al. [4] go from 0 to 99.4% only if mismatches are taken into account. Indeed, as pointed out by Pillonel et al. [46] several of the probes from Corman et al. [4] do not fully match the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes (1623 at the time [46] ). However, it was also observed that the mismatches had little effect on their efficiencies [13, 28] which is consistent with our calculations. The reason for the presence of mismatches in this case, as explained in Corman and Drosten [28] , was the incomplete genomic information available at the time when this set was designed. It is worth noticing that while accounting for mismatches increases the coverage of this particular primer/probe set, it also increases the coverage for SARS-CoV-1 and even non-SARS as shown in Tab. 1.We observed that in some cases the presence of few mismatches substantially decrease the hybridization temperature, leading to a complete absence of coverage. For example, four primers from Vogels et al. [18] do not align with any genome at all, not even when considering the mismatches as their hybridization temperatures T MM are too low in comparison to reference temperature T ref. . In contrast, for several cases when mismatches are taken into account the coverage becomes almost complete. A special example is probe 2019-nCoV N1-P from CDC set that had 223 further mismatch alignments increasing the strict coverage of 98.4% to partial coverage of 99.4% . Similar findings were observed for SARS-CoV-2 6 LEFT [12] and NIID WH-1 F501 of WHO [1].The cross-reactivity, that is, the coverage of SARS-Cov-1 and non-SARS, appear in most primer/probe sets when mismatches are taken into account. Of the 19 primer/probe sets, we found only 5 sets that do not present cross-reactivity at all, see Tab. 1. We evaluated the impact of mismatches in the hybridization of primers and probes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other genomes. We have shown that the effect of mismatches on the probe/primer hybridization is not straightforward and can only be fully evaluated with a detailed calculation with up-todate model parameters. In particular, our calculations showed that a substantial amount of the existing primers/probes may cross-react to SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes, which further highlights the need for taking mismatch hybridization into account.This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Fundação de Amparoà Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (Fapemig) and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (Capes, Brazil, Finance Code 001).None.

9abf1e60ae2bf2385b5f8fca1168205970caf49a,Is the Frequency of Candidemia Increasing in COVID-19 Patients Receiving Corticosteroids?,"Recent trials have demonstrated the benefit of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] , which is likely to result in a marked increase in steroids prescriptions in clinical practice. Steroids are known to increase the risks for a variety of infections, but data on serious fungal diseases in critically ill patients receiving corticosteroids for COVID-19 remains scarce. In the Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial, Adaptive Platform trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP), despite the benefits observed with hydrocortisone treatment, the authors demonstrated a higher number of serious adverse events in both hydrocortisone groups [2] , even though only one patient had documented fungemia in the trial.The relationship between corticosteroid treatment and fungal infections is well established. Corticosteroids may promote fungal growth in vitro [5] . Moreover, use of corticosteroids have been associated with increased risk for most serious fungal diseases including candidemia, invasive aspergillosis, fusariosis, and mucormycosis [6] . He we present provocative results of a series of candidemia cases following COVID-19, in which the use of steroids was suggested as the main risk factor for fungal infection.This was a case series of candidemia following COVID-19 in two tertiary care hospitals located in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on a positive real time PCR test in a patient with appropriate signs and symptoms, according to the criteria established by the Brazilian National as well as the Regional Sanitary Surveillance agencies [7, 8] . Candidemia was defined as the presence of one or more Candida species in blood cultures, in patients with temporally clinical manifestations. Patients were included only once in the study. Yeasts were identified at the species level either by Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) or Vitek-2 System (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France).Data were retrospectively collected in the year 2020 between March 16 (date of the first COVID-19 admission in the participant hospitals) and August 31. Data were obtained from infection control records, as well as patients' electronic charts. The Chi-square test with Yates correction was used to compare proportions-WINPEPI v. 11.65 (Abramson, JH) [9] , and p values of < 5% were considered statistically significant.Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the frequency of candidemia was observed in two of the hospitals in which authors (CVWR, and RC) were based. During the period of study, incidence of candidemia was 1.43 (hospital 1) and 1.15 (hospital 2) in patients who did not have COVID-19, both per 1000 patients-day. These frequencies were unaltered in comparison to previous year. In contrast, the incidence of candidemia in patients with COVID-19 were 11.83 (hospital 1) and 10.23 (hospital 2) per 1000 patients-day, during the same period (p = 0.001 in comparison to the prevalence of candidemia in non-COVID-19 patients). In patients with COVID-19, all cases of candidemia occurred after the use of high-doses of corticosteroids for severe disease. Table 1 summarizes the main clinical findings for these 11 patients. These were mostly male (n = 7; 63.6%), with a median age of 59 years-old (interquartile range, IQR, 49-70 years-old), and a median Charlson score of 4 (IQR, 1-4). Four patients had diabetes, and one was HIV-positive. Ten patients (90.9%) had central venous catheters in place. These were all non-surgical patients with limited antibiotic exposure, and additional risk factors for candidemia were virtually absent. Candidemia occurred in intensive care for 8/11 patients (72.7%), and after a median length of admission to the intensive care unit of 8.7 days. Overall mortality of candidemia following steroid use in COVID-19 was 72.7% (8/11), while 3/11 patients (22.3%) were discharged from the hospital. Overall mortality in COVID-19 patients who did not develop candidemia was 17.7% (hospital 1) and 22.0% (hospital 2). In this small case series, we observed a 10-fold increase in the frequency of candidemia in two medical centers in Brazil, in COVID-19 patients taking high doses of steroids. The in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients in the study was similar to the published findings of others [10] , and even lower than other studies conducted in the same region in Brazil [11] . He observed an impressively high mortality in these patients. It should be noted, however, that our study is limited-mostly by its small sample size, in addition to its retrospective design and its short duration of observation. Current data suggest low frequency of both bacterial and fungal infections in COVID-19 cases presenting early at the hospital [12] . However, the use of steroids may dramatically change such scenarios. Fungal infections are known to occur after COVID-19, with most studies so far focusing on invasive aspergillosis [13] . In our perspective, the real frequencies and organisms associated with COVID-19 superinfections must be further evaluated and might be increased by immunosuppressive treatments.In conclusion, steroids are a lifesaving treatment option in COVID-19 pneumonia, but the right dose and timing of such interventions remain to be determined. High corticosteroid doses might be associated with severe superinfections. Physicians should be aware of the potential increase in the frequency of candidemia in patients with COVID-19 treated with corticosteroids.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, C.V.W.R., A.C.P.; investigation, C.V.W.R., R.C.; writing-original draft preparation, C.V.W.R., A.C.P.; writing-reviewing and editing C.V.W.R., R.C., A.C.P.

In Colombia, viral circulation has the typical pattern of tropical countries as it occurs throughout the year but increases in the rainy seasons (April-June and September-December) demanding preparedness for a ""viral season"" at least twice a year. Influenza is the most commonly identified virus (2) but others also circulate regularly.In December, 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was reported in Wuhan, China, which rapidly spread across this and other countries (3) (4) (5) including American countries. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted effectively among humans and exhibits high potential for a pandemic (6) . At the beginning of April, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported confirmed cases in the majority of American countries: the United States, Canada, Brazil, México, and Ecuador (7) suggesting ongoing circulation in the region. Colombia has been no exception and the pandemic peak will coincide with that of respiratory virus infections during the first rainy season of the year.Bogotá, the largest city in the country, with over 7.4 million inhabitants, has the largest healthcare infrastructure. Healthcare personnel plays an important role in the prevention of acute respiratory infections in hospital settings (8) , so it is essential that they have adequate knowledge about these infections and they should exert leadership in the strategies aimed at reducing the risk of hospitalized patients acquiring respiratory infections.The present study aimed to determine the level of knowledge about respiratory virus infections and the attitudes and perceptions of healthcare worker leaders in infections control committees of hospitals in Bogotá and to establish a baseline to define educational priorities for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.We conducted a cross-sectional study among leaders of infection control committees of hospitals in Bogotá, Colombia. Bogotá is the largest city in the country, with over 7.4 million inhabitants (without the surrounding small towns), and accounts for the largest number of healthcare institutions (69 second or third level hospitals).We administered a questionnaire on February 14 th , 2020, during the monthly meeting sponsored by the city's local health authority among those in charge of the infection control committees. No sample was taken from the assistants and the questionnaire was offered to all the participants. The respondents are responsible for guiding the decisions of the infection control committees in each second or third level hospital, establishing policies and practices related to infection control and aiding, together with public health authorities, in the implementation of surveillance, prevention, and control strategies of respiratory tract infections in the institutions during the ""rainy season"" in the city.A self-administered survey with 28 questions in Spanish was applied. The questionnaire comprised four main sections on: (A) demographic characteristics, (B) knowledge, (C) attitudes, and (D) practices of healthcare worker leaders of infection control committees regarding prevention of respiratory virus infections.To measure knowledge, we asked ""yes or no"" and ""true or false"" questions. For questions on attitudes and practices, participants' agreement with a given statement was measured on a 5-point Likert scale (""strongly agree"" , ""agree"" , ""uncertain"" , ""disagree"" , and ""strongly disagree"" or ""never"" , ""sometimes"" , ""often"" , ""most of the time"" , and ""always"").The knowledge section included questions about viral transmission, prevention of viral infection through hand hygiene, gloves, patient identification, use of masks, and seasonal circulation of viruses in the country.The attitudes section included the point of view of the respondent about sick leave policies, respiratory patient identification and education, and isolation practices.The practices section included habits or uses of isolation and protection, hand hygiene, and patient education.The data obtained were stored in a database using Microsoft Office Excel, version 2019, and analyzed with Stata™, version 16. The results were reported in absolute values, proportions, and measures of central tendency (medians and interquartile ranges). Comparisons were done with the Wilcoxon test between continuous variables and with the chi-square test for proportions.The questionnaire was designed to be individual and anonymous and participation was voluntary so informed consent was not specifically obtained. The data were kept confidential and the results did not individually identify the respondents.We surveyed 70 healthcare worker leaders from infection control committees in city hospitals. The majority (84.3%) of the respondents were women. Occupations included nursing assistant, nurse, doctor, and others. A total of 81.4% of the respondents worked directly with the infection committee of their institution. Table 1 shows their demographic data. Figure 1 shows the results obtained for the knowledge questions. Interestingly, we found that 58.0% (95% CI: 45.9-65.2) of the respondents considered that high-efficiency respirators and surgical masks are not equally effective for respiratory viral infection prevention.Regarding the question about the season of respiratory virus circulation in Bogotá, most respondents (64.1%, 95% CI: 51.4-71.0) knew that the circulation of these viruses occurs throughout the year; however, there is an important percentage that had incorrect knowledge about this issue.Eighty percent of respondents answered more than five questions correctly. The median number of correct answers was 6 for nurses, 5.5 for physicians, and 4.5 for nurse assistants (p=0.016 for the comparison between nurses and the assistants). Health care workers in III level hospitals had higher scores of correct answers (6 for the third level vs 5 for the second level hospitals, p=0.036). No effect on the scores was seen regarding the number of years of work. Figure 2 shows the results regarding the attitudes of the respondents. Most of the questions on attitudes were answered with a high degree of agreement. It is interesting to note that 57.5% of the respondents (95% CI: 39.2 -81.0) had a low degree of agreement about the leave of absence policy in institutions when they have respiratory symptoms.Most respondents reported that most of the time or always they perform hand hygiene before entering or exiting a patient's room with 86.4% (95% CI: 75.6-92.8) agreement in both cases. There were no differences in the degree of agreement between different occupations or complexity levels in the hospitals. Figure 3 shows the results regarding the practices of the respondents. Most of them reported that they sometimes perform the practices shown in figure 3 . However, most respondents (71.2%, 95% CI: 50.1-95.7) stated that they never or only sometimes remain at home when they have respiratory symptoms. There were no differences in the practices between occupations or levels of complexity. Our results show that the leaders of infection control committees in Bogotá´s hospitals have adequate knowledge about the prevention of seasonal respiratory viruses which evidences that they may be adequately prepared to face the dissemination of these viruses during the rainy season and that there is a baseline preparation for the SARS-COV2 pandemic. This fact is important since leaders are required to have an important level of knowledge and to be capable of systematically transmitting that knowledge to their coworkers and peers to ensure they have adequate knowledge and skills to prevent viral respiratory infection at hospitals (9).Despite finding an adequate level of knowledge and skills, there are also some deficiencies in terms of basic prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, which is widely known as a very effective prevention measure for respiratory infections (10) (11) (12) . It seems to be an important but endless task in infection control and prevention. Other misconceptions, such as the efficacy of respirators (N95) versus the traditional mask for respiratory infection prevention should be clarified among the personnel surveyed since it is known that there is no significant difference between the use of one or the other, even in the prevention of the influenza virus (13) . Current CDC guidelines recommend the use of medical respirators only for healthcare personnel that needs protection from both airborne and fluid hazards (14). In a pandemic, the risk of a capacity crisis might put in danger health care workers due to a shortage of key personal protection elements, so the correct use of some of them is fundamental to prevent such shortage.Responses about sick leave for healthcare workers show that there is a lack of regulation regarding policies to stay at home when they have respiratory symptoms. Although it has been shown that sick leave policies among healthcare workers are important in reducing the transmission of infections in the hospital, many hospitals in the United States do not have such policies to ensure restriction on direct patient care by sick hospital staff (15) .In the case of Colombia, the lack of these policies respond to several situations: no clear guidelines on the matter by the country's official entities, as well as economic reasons among the healthcare personnel since payment might be stopped or diminished because of local social security regulations (16) . This sick leave policy and a clear understanding of the role of healthcare workers in virus transmission are important to limit the number of infections in the hospitals both in healthcare workers and in patients.Our study has limitations. First, the survey was not validated before its application. Second, it was applied only to infection committee leaders as an indirect measure of the entire population of healthcare personnel in the hospitals of Bogotá to evaluate whether the city was prepared for an eventual SARS CoV-2 pandemic.Despite these limitations, we consider that our findings can stimulate the design of interventions to strengthen knowledge, modify attitudes, and optimize practices regarding the prevention of acute respiratory infections and to promote the implementation of policies such as sick leave as a potential intervention to prevent the spread of acute respiratory infections in hospitals.",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-15,11
5bff641052f4e741ebc9ec991581d1d3349bc4cc,Natural versus Recombinant Viral Antigens in SARS-CoV-2 Serology: Challenges in Optimizing Laboratory Diagnosis of COVID-19,"A novel and highly transmissible human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as being responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome: Coronavirus disease 2019 . The disease was declared by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, and several molecular and serological tools have been developed to identify ongoing viral infections and to evaluate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (1) (2) (3) (4) 6, 7) . The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection involves collecting the correct specimens from patients at the right time. Molecular tests have been used to detect acute cases of infection, while serological tests have been used to identify individuals who have developed immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (2, 3) .SARS-CoV-2 detection using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered the 'gold standard' for COVID-19 diagnosis (2, 3) . RT-qPCR is used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients with respiratory illness, as well as for screening the contacts (3) . SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in upper respiratory samples 1-2 days prior to the onset of symptoms, and can persist for 7 to 12 days in moderate cases, and up to 2 weeks in severe cases (8) . However, this technique requires certified laboratories, expensive equipment, and trained technicians, and can yield false-negative results (9, 10) . Even though the analytical sensitivity of this technique is generally known to be very high, detection is dependent on several crucial factors such as sampling timing related to disease onset, sample quality, transport, and storage conditions (3, 11) . RT-qPCR may not detect the virus in the very early or the very late stages of infection when the viral load is very low (12) .Serological tests for the detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples remain a good choice and alternative for diagnosing COVID-19. These tests offer a number of advantages over RT-qPCR. They are less expensive than molecular tests, require shorter analytical time and processing, and can offer much greater throughput than automated molecular tests (3, 5, 6) . In addition, human antibodies are known to be more stable than viral RNA. Consequently, serological samples are less prone to deterioration than RT-qPCR samples during sample collection, preparation, transport, storage, and testing. Furthermore, serological samples exhibit fewer variations than nasopharyngeal specimens because antibodies are usually homogeneously dispersed in the blood (3) . Serological tests can also provide additional details as they can be used to identify individuals who have developed virus-specific antibodies, thereby providing better information regarding disease prevalence in a population. In the near future, serological tests could also be used to evaluate vaccine efficacy (6, 13) .Antibody dynamics for COVID-19 was found to be similar to that of acute viral infections in which IgG levels increase at the time IgM levels start to decrease (7, 14) . It is estimated that SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies can be detected in a blood sample 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms and IgG antibodies can be detected 8 days after the onset of symptoms (3, 15) . Serological assays designed to detect IgM/IgG antibodies are important for diagnosing COVID-19, and can help in developing a better understanding the burden imposed by asymptomatic infections (1) .Although high-throughput testing has been proposed to reduce the burden imposed by COVID-19, meta-analyses on the accuracy of commercially available immunological tests for SARS-CoV-2 reveal that the performance of these tests remains uncertain. According to Caini et al. (4) , randomeffects models yield a summary sensitivity of 82% for IgM and 85% for IgG and total antibodies. For specificity, the pooled estimate was 98% for IgM and 99% for IgG and total antibodies. Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Bastos et al. (5) revealed the sensitivities of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for measuring IgG or IgM levels, lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs) to be 84.3% (95% CI: 75.6% to 90.9%), 66.0% (95% CI: 49.3% to 79.3%), and 97.8% (95% CI: 46.2% to 100%), respectively. Investigations regarding the accuracy of commercially available tests for COVID-19 in Brazil revealed unclear data. Castro et al. (2) analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of 16 commercial assays registered by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA). The sensitivity of the tests-registered by the Brazilian health regulatory agency-for IgM antibodies was 82% (95% CI: 76% to 87%), and the specificity was 97% (95% CI: 96% to 98%). For tests developed to detect IgG antibodies, the sensitivity was 97% (95% CI: 90% to 99%) and specificity was 98% (95% CI: 97% to 99%). Although the specificity of the tests was generally high (X 98%), it may not suffice to guarantee satisfactory performance in areas with a very low number of infected individuals, particularly if there is a large proportion of asymptomatic individuals (4) .Differences between the accuracy of the tests can be attributed to several factors, including the nature of the viral antigen(s) used for antibody detection and the type of antibodies identified. Unfortunately, the majority of diagnostic companies do not report the nature of the antigens utilized in their assays, and it is therefore difficult to compare results. The most common viral proteins used as antigens in the available serological assays are recombinant proteins including nucleocapsid protein (N), transmembrane spike protein (S), or protein S subunits (6, 16) . The detection of antibodies directed against spike protein or its subunits is more likely to reflect neutralizing antibody effects, and would better demonstrate the immunity status, on the other hand, assays employing the N protein generally show better sensitivity (4) . To the best of our knowledge, kits containning the whole viral antigen (WVA) of SARS-CoV-2 are not commercially available. In the past, most serological tests for viral diseases such as measles (17) and rubella (18) , have been performed using natural viral proteins from the infected cell cultures. Although the production of these antigens is laborious because of the need for cell culture and adequate biosafety conditions, the use of WVAs instead of recombinant proteins in serological tests, could result in a better diagnostic accuracy for viral infections (19) . In the present study, we proposed to standardize an in-house ELISA based on comparison of the results of SARS-CoV-2 WVA and SARS-CoV-2 rNP ELISAs to assess whether the association of these different antigens could reduce variability in estimates and enhance the performance of ELISAs for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in stratified groups of asymptomatic patients, and in individuals with mild or moderate symptoms. We utilized a 35 kDa fragment of rNP that lacked a highly conserved motif (residues 1-121) found in all coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (20) , to minimize the occurrence of falsepositives owing to the presence of antibodies against other coronaviruses. The use of WVA may be useful for future validation of candidate recombinant proteins in COVID-19 tests.This study was performed using 111 serum samples, of which 50 were obtained from the biorepository collection of the Laboratory of Protozoology of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Sao Paulo (IMT/USP) (São Paulo, Brazil). The other 61 samples were obtained from volunteers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 using molecular testing (RT-qPCR) and/or based on the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs. The biorepository collection samples were used as controls as they were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. All procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital das Clínicas, School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP) (São Paulo, Brazil) (protocol number: 31685020.4.0000.0068).The SARS-CoV-2 strain (SARS-CoV-2/SP02/human/ 2020/BRA) used in ELISA in the present study was isolated and provided by Professor Edison Luiz Durigon of the Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (ICB/ USP) (São Paulo, Brazil). This strain was isolated from the first two identified cases of COVID-19 in Brazil (21) . The virus was cultured in Vero E6 cells and maintained at 37 o C in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Vitrocell Embriolife, Campinas, SP, Brazil) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Vitrocell Embriolife, Campinas, SP, Brazil), as described by Araujo et al. (21) . When the cells exhibited 90% cytopathic effects (CPE), 1% formaldehyde and 1% hydrogen peroxide were added to the culture medium for viral inactivation. After 12 h, the media and cell layers were harvested for viral antigen production.After viral inactivation, the media and cell layers were harvested and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 Â g at 4 o C for 15 min, and the supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer pH 7.5 (0.05 M Tris/ HCl, 0.075 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Sodium Desoxycholate (DOC), and 0.5% Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS)) and incubated at 65 o C for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 Â g at 20 o C for 15 min, and the supernatant containing WVA was stored at -80 o C until use.A 122-419 bp fragment of the gene that codes for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (PubMed Accession No. QIG 56001) with two histidine tags, one at the N-and another at the C-terminal, was synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, New Jersey, USA) and cloned into the plasmid pET28a (Merck Millipore Inc) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). rNP was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, strain BL21 (DE3), and refolding was performed at pH 9 and 2.4 kbar for 90 min, as described by Chura-Chambi et al. (22) .SARS-CoV-2 antigens were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 4-20% gradient gels. Briefly, 10 mL of WVA (0.1 mg/mL) and 10 mL of rNP (0.1 mg/mL) were diluted (v/v) in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad s , California, USA) and heated at 95 o C for 5 min. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature (22 o C-24 o C) for approximately 45 min at a constant voltage (120 V) using PowerPac™ HC High-Current Power Supply (Bio-Rad, Singapore) followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Goettingen, Germany) using Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad, Singapore). The membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk prepared in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and these membranes containing the antigens were incubated with serum samples diluted 1:100 for 18 h at 4 o C. After washing with PBST, bound antibodies in the serum samples were detected by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-human-IgG for 1 h at room temperature (22 o C-24 o C), followed by washing and incubation with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) until visualization of protein bands. The reaction was stopped with distilled water.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected using an in-house ELISA. Briefly, a 96-well microplate (Corning s , New York, USA) was coated with WVA obtained from cell culture and rNP (0.1 mg/mL) diluted in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5). These antigens were assayed in separate wells (100 mL/well), and the microplates were maintained overnight at 4 o C in a humid chamber. The microplates were washed with PBST and blocked with 250 mL of 5% fat-free milk (Molico s , Nestlé, Araçatuba, Brazil) diluted in PBST for 1 h at 37 o C. After washing, 100 mL of serum samples diluted 1:100 in PBST containing 5% fat-free milk (PBST-milk) were incubated with viral antigens for 1 h at 37 o C. The microplates were again washed and 100 mL of anti-human IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) diluted 1:20,000 in PBST-milk was added per well and the plates were maintained for 1 h at 37 o C. After washing, 100 mL of 2, 2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) -ABTS substrate solution) was added per well. The microplates were incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature (22 o C-24 o C). The reaction was stopped with 0.1 M citric acid (100 mL/well). The optical density (OD) at 414 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Labsystems Multiskan MS s , Midland, Canada). ELISA results were expressed in arbitrary units (AU) calculated by the ratio between the average absorbance of samples and the reaction cut-off.The cut-off threshold was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. ROC and serological analyses (sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and likelihood ratio) were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Frequencies were compared using bicaudal Chi-squared assays. Values when the probability of equality was less than 5% (po0.05) were considered significant.Viral antigens used in ELISA were characterized by western blotting with a serum sample from a patient with moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Figure 1 shows the protein band pattern of WVA and rNP recognized by the hyperimmune serum. In case of WVA, several bands with specific reactivity for the spike protein (B260 kDa) and nucleocapsid protein (45 kDa) were identified. rNP was detected as a specific band of 35 kDa, and this molecular weight corresponded to the expected molecular weight of our NP fragment.The summarized results of ELISAs using WVA and rNP are presented in Figure 2 . The figure includes the data obtained for control samples collected before (n=50) and during (n=61) the pandemic, stratified based on the symptoms, i.e., asymptomatic (n=8), mild symptoms (n=3), and moderate symptoms (n=10). Data distribution revealed that rNP ELISA was better at identifying the infected individuals; it yielded 10 falsenegative and 4 false-positive results. WVA ELISA yielded 25 false-negative and 3 false-positive results. Although WVA ELISA exhibited lower sensitivity, it was able to identify one sample from the infected group which was not detected by rNP ELISA. WVA ELISA also correctly identified one sample from the control group that was incorrectly detected as an antibody by rNP. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios for each antigen are presented in Table 1 . We also demonstrated that the values obtained upon correlating the results of both tests resulted in better performance of our in-house ELISA.The analyzed data revealed that the detection of IgG antibodies in control, asymptomatic, and moderate symptom groups was similar in case of both antigens. The rNP ELISA was able to identify a larger number of patients with mild symptoms, reacting with 76% of those sera (po0.001), which were otherwise negative with WVA ELISA (Table 2) .Conventional serological assays (ELISAs) for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be an alternative-or complement-to real-time RT-qPCR in the diagnosis of COVID-19. The nature of the antigen is an important factor determining the performance of the serological tests, and our choice of the N protein instead of the spike protein can be justified by its generally high sensitivity. However, the latter is usually more likely to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies, and would better reflect immune status. In order to solve this issue, we evaluated whole viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2 cultured in Vero cells. This antigenic suspension presented the main SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including N and S, and allowed the detection of neutralizing antibodies and those against other viral proteins.Correlating the results of rNP and WVA ELISAs improved the performance, and the specificity of our test was similar to that of commercially available tests in Brazil (2) . In this study, rNP ELISA identified 4 samples from the control group as an antibody. A disadvantage of the whole nucleocapsid protein ELISA is that it can produce false-positive results as this protein is the most conserved viral protein among human betacoronaviruses (3, 23) . Nucleocapsid residues 1-121 were removed to minimize non-specific antibody reactions involving non-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens. However, it is possible that the 122-419 amino acid rNP and WVA antigens used in our ELISA could react with antibodies against other types of coronaviruses (HKU1, 229E, OC43, NL63) that are known to cause respiratory diseases (3, 7, 24) . As rNP was 490% pure, it was not purified, and there is a possibility that the antibodies reacted with E. coli proteins.Our data demonstrated that rNP ELISA showed greater sensitivity than WVA ELISA with respect to detecting infected individuals, mainly those in the mild symptoms group. Although less sensitive, WVA ELISA was able to identify one false-negative and four false-positive cases which were incorrectly detected using rNP ELISA. These data demonstrated the importance of using natural viral antigens to assess the performance of tests based on the use of recombinant proteins as antigens. The difference in sensitivity of our ELISAs may be attributed to the nature of the antigen used in each test. Although the natural viral antigen comprised different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including nucleocapsid and spike proteins, the amount of these proteins in antigenic suspensions was proportionally lower than the recombinant protein used in our ELISA.With respect to the sensitivity of the ELISA, correlating the results of rNP and WVA ELISAs resulted in a better diagnostic performance even though 9 samples were false-negatives. These data were similar to those reported by meta-analysis studies (5) . The sensitivity of ELISAs for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies depends largely on the time of testing or on the day of illness. Antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus may not be detectable in the early stages of infection. Although IgM antibodies may be generated rapidly owing to the presence of viral genetic material in the respiratory tract, the timing of immunoglobulin production (from 4 days after the onset of symptoms, to 10-14 days) limits its applicability in acute phase diagnosis (3, 6, 25, 26, 27) . A study comparing the performance of serological tests with respect to the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed the sensitivity for IgM and IgG detection to be 91.7% and 79.2%, respectively, in samples collected 7 days after PCR confirmation. The sensitivity of the assays for IgM and IgG detection increased to 100% in samples assayed 9 and 12 days after initial PCR confirmation (7) . These data demonstrated that the use of serological methods for COVID-19 diagnosis requires the correct and appropriate interpretations of the results, and an understanding of the strengths and limitations of such tests, mainly with respect to the time of infection. These considerations are extremely important, and can help in the interpretation of our data, and reveal that the sensitivity of our ELISA could have been higher if we had used samples collected at a later period of infection, as most of them were collected 15 days after PCR confirmation.It is important to highlight that recent studies demonstrate that individuals with mild symptoms of COVID-19 do not produce antibodies (3, 28, 29) . It has been proposed that the innate immune system (cell-mediated immunity) wipes out the virus before the adaptive immune system produces antibodies (3, 29) . A number of studies have presented information regarding the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which involves antibody production and T lymphocyte activation. Most of this information was restricted to hospitalized patients, because they were infected but symptomatic (28) . Over the course of the disease in hospitalized patients who recovered, antibody production was shown to increase after the first week of onset of symptoms (28, 30) , while T cell levels increased after 14 days of hospitalization (28) . Interestingly, some people who presented positivity in the molecular test did not have detectable levels of protective antibodies (28) . Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies were low or not present in hospitalized patients (28, 30) . A few studies have already shown that T cells might be key in solving this issue (28, 30) . Although SARS-CoV-2 can induce lymphopenia and cause a delay in T cell pathway activation during the first days of infection, after two weeks of symptoms, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell phenotypes start to emerge in the peripheral blood, providing protective immunity (28) . Further data on description of antibody profiles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of antibodies, their correlations with protective immunity, and duration of protection need to be explored. For all of these issues, serological tests may serve as a useful tool to improve COVID-19 diagnosis, and the WVA produced during viral infections of mammalian cells might be used for the validation of candidate recombinant proteins in COVID-19 tests.Our data demonstrated that the use of ELISA using rNP for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is promising in individuals with mild or moderate symptoms of infection. However, the comparison of these assays with natural viral antigens is crucial for adequate development and must be performed before commercialization. Both ELISAs proposed in this study should be used with caution and in regions of low COVID-19 prevalence, since they can give false-negative results.We are very grateful to all of the volunteers who donated blood samples for our study.

67726a4c80437d75430ff14d4500d14a360f6b6e,Predicting the number of total COVID-19 cases and deaths in Brazil by the Gompertz model,"The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 a pandemic on March 11, pointing to the over 118,000 cases in over 110 countries and territories around the world at that time [18] . The COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil began on February 26, 2020, when a man from Sao Paulo who returned from Italy tested positive for the virus. The first case of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro was confirmed on March 5, 2020. Nowadays, Brazil is considered the epidemic center of Latin America, occupying the second place in the total number of cases and, more recently, in the total number of deaths. Currently (July 9, 2020), Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the states with the highest number of deaths by the new coronavirus in Brazil, according to data from the Brazilian Health Ministry.In the past few months, a considerable number of studies related to the evolution of COVID-19 in the world have been submitted and published. In the following, we describe some of these works.Ahmadi et al. [1] developed mathematical models to predict the number of COVID-19 cases in Iran from April 3, 2020, to May 13, 2020. The unknown parameters in these models were estimated by running the fminsearch, a MATLAB function, which is a least-squares algorithm. Torrealba et al. [22] analyzed the modeling and prediction of COVID-19 in Mexico, from an initial approximation, and using the Gauss-Newton algorithm, the authors estimated parameters in the Gompertz and Logistic models. Articles [12, 15, 16] estimated the number of total COVID-19 cases and deaths in world using the Gompertz model. In [11] , they analyzed the number of deaths by COVID-19 with social distancing in Brazil, Sao Paulo. Using the SEIR model, the authors recommend temporary lockdowns, however, great the economic and social costs. In [2] , the authors studied the impact on the evolution of cases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, considering a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model with containment.In this work, we model the near-future trajectory of the cumulative number of infections and deaths by COVID-19 for Brazil and two Brazilian states, given the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths from February 26, 2020 to July 2, 2020. Data were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health until July 2 (https://covid.saude.gov.br), and we considered the cumulative reports from the date on which the first case was notified in Brazil and in each analyzed state. We also estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which represents the average number of secondary infections generated by each infected person. To estimate the unknown parameters, we use the Gompertz model and propose a gradient type iterative method (Minimal error method).The Gompertz model is one of the particular cases of the Richards model, as well as Brody, negative exponential, logistic and von Bertalanffy models, see [20, 21] .The growth functions can be grouped in three main categories: those without inflection point (Brody and negative models), those with sigmoidal shape and a fixed inflection point (Gompertz, logistic, and von Bertalanffy models), and those with a flexible inflection point (Richards model). The logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy models exhibit inflection points at about 50, 37, and 30% of the upper asymptote, respectively, which means that the Gompertz and von Bertalanffy processes are asymmetric, whereas the logistic is a symmetric process, see [19] .The Gompertz and the logistic models are the most frequently used sigmoid functions, and the literature on these models is extensive [3, 21] . In general, the cumulative number of deaths and cases by COVID-19 presents an asymmetrical sigmoidal growth curve. Therefore, using an inappropriate growth curve can have a substantial impact on forecasting [3] . The Gompertz model [5] was proposed by Benjamin Gompertz in 1825. Since then, this exponential model has been used to describe growth in plants, animals, bacteria, and cancer cells [22] . The Gompertz differential equation has the following form,where t represents time; N (t) is the cumulative population size at time t; r the intrinsic growth rate of model; K is the maximum value of model (N ) when t goes to infinity; t 0 represents the initial time; and N 1 is the initial population or condition. The analytic solution from (1) iswhere lim t→∞ N (t) = K . The turning point is the time at which the rate of accumulation changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa and can be easily located by finding the inflection point of the epidemic curve, that is, the moment at which the trajectory begins to decline. Clearly, this quantity is of epidemiological importance, indicating either the beginning (i.e., the moment of acceleration after deceleration) or end (i.e., the moment of deceleration after acceleration) of a phase [6] . From Eq. (2), it is trivial to show that the inflection point is given byAt the inflection point, the number of infected or killed is given by N (t i. p ) = K /e.In this paper, we consider the discrete function, from Eq. (2) and for t 0 = 1,where i represents time in days and N i is the cumulative number of infected cases (or deaths) at day i.In this paper, we consider that equality (3) is the inflection point of Eq. (4).model. The MEM is a variant of the conjugate gradient method [4, 10, 17] , and this approach was used to estimate unknown parameters in a computational neuroscience models [24, 25] . Also, [14] solves the Cauchy problem in linear elasticity with MEM.Knowing the cumulative number of infections or deaths from COVID-19 (M), we want to determine x assuming that Eq. (4) holds.The transpose of a vector y is denoted by y T . Let the nonlinear operator F :. . .where f 1 , f 2 , · · · , f m : R 2 → R are multivariable functions with real value and M solves (4).To obtain an approximation for x, given M and x 1 , we used the minimal error iterationwhere. It is possible to show that, under certain conditions (we assume that is the case), x k converges to a solution of F(x) = M; see [9, Theorem 3.21] .From Eq. (5), we obtain an approximation x k for x, but the adjoint F (x k ) is not known. In this paper, we obtain the unknown operator (see Appendix) together with the following iterationwhereThe regression coefficient (R 2 ) is used to evaluate the fitting ability of various methods and can be obtained by the following equation,wherē N = m i=1 N i m is the average of the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (or deaths). Remark 1 From differential Eq. (1) and since M is known, we consider the following initial approximation for x.The numerical scheme for our method poposed is in Algorithm 1.The basic reproduction number R 0 is the most important parameter to analyze any epidemic model for any disease. In a practical sense, R 0 is period. An epidemic occurs only if a single individual can spread its illness to more than one individual (R 0 > 1). If R 0 < 1, on average an infectious individual infects less than one person and the contagion is expected to stop spreading. Our result can be used to compute the basic reproduction numbersee [6] [7] [8] 13] , where r denotes the intrinsic growth rate in the Gompertz model and T is the generation time of In this section, we will provide the results obtained for the whole country (Brazil) and for the Brazilian states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Table 1 describes the estimated values for the Gompertz model and also presents the regression coefficient, the inflection point, and the basic reproduction number. The estimated daily values for the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths, from July 3 to 9, are illustrated in Table 2 . Figures 1, 2, 3 illustrate the relationship between observed values and those predicted In this article, we propose an iterative method to estimate the unknown parameters in the Gompertz model. The results of the modeling show a good fit between the estimated and the observed data. We obtained an estimate of 99.9% (R 2 ) for the cumulative number of infected and killed in Brazil. For Sao Paulo, we obtained an approximation of 99.7% and 99.4% for the cumulative number of infected and deaths, respec- (7); Compute M k+1 from Eq. (4), replacing x by x k+1 ;k+1 , x = x k+1 and count = 0; end k ← k + 1; count = count + 1; end Algorithm 1: Iteration to estimate R 2 , K and r . The source code is available at [23] .tively. For Rio de Janeiro, the estimate was 99.8% for the cumulative number of infected and deaths.The basic reproduction number R 0 ( or the average number of infections caused by one typically infectious individual ) depends on the growth rate (r ), which was estimated in this work, and the duration of infectiousness (T ). Considering T = 14, the basic reproduction number was 1.3, 1.3, and 1.4 for Brazil, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. Applying our proposed methodology for China, we obtained R 0 = 3.2, given the number of infected cases accumulated from February 2 to July 2, based on data collected from the world health organization. We did the same for Italy and obtained R 0 = 1.8. Many works obtained these values for China and Italy. Therefore, our estimates for the basic reproduction number are acceptable.The inflection point of the curve provides vital information about changing trends in the epidemic and may possibly indicate changes in intervention and control. In this paper, the inflection points for the cumulative number of infected cases were July 9, July 4, and June 21 for Brazil, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, respectively.Regarding the methodology used, there are several methods for estimating or determining parameters in a mathematical model. We can divide these methods into two groups, iterative and non-iterative methods. In this paper, we used a gradient type iterative method. This method can recover unknown parameters with a non-uniform distribution (non-constant functions) given noisy data. On the other hand, like all iterative methods, it depends on an initial estimate. If this initial approximation is far from the solution, the iteration will diverge. Although it is difficult to determine an initial estimate for some problems, in this work we found an appropriate initial guess, see Remark 1.by definition of Euclidean inner product on R 2 , we haveSince θ ∈ R 2 is arbitrary, we gather that the following iteration holds:",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-03,11
facaa5f36289bf6a30b880ac4a80e53092f27ad4,"The Surco canal, an ancient irrigation canal in Lima, Peru, and a citizens' campaign for its protection","Like much of the pre-Hispanic past of Lima, a city that for centuries has focused primarily on its European legacy, the history of its canals has been largely omitted from official narratives. This was an issue often debated within the domain of archaeologists, architects and other specialists for decades, but outside academia few people knew about the canals and their role in the city. This lack of awareness resulted in the of people Lima considering this man-made infrastructure to be rivers. When the author started researching the subject, it became clear that their meaning went beyond the cultural and the archaeological: it was about a resource that was scarce in a city where it never rains. The symbolic meaning of the canals was high, as contemporary Lima seemed to ignore sustainable water use and had become a city with one of the highest levels of water wastage in the world.The Peruvian capital Lima is a city of about eleven million people, or a third of the country's total population, built on cliffs overlooking the ocean. Because of a phenomenon called the Humboldt Current, this section of tropical South America that would have been otherwise lush, rainy and warm, is in fact a desert territory (albeit with high humidity levels), like much of the Peruvian coast. The Humboldt Current runs counterclockwise in the Pacific Ocean, reaching the north of Chile where it turns north and runs along much of the Peruvian coast, before turning westwards again. This situation not only means that the coastal ocean is cold and rich in plankton, but also impedes the formation of rain and thus transforms the coast into a desert, which results, according to official data, into an annual average rainfall in Lima of 7 mm, which puts the city in the category of a 'hyper arid' desert (INEI 2017) .The Lima territory is crossed by three rivers that originate in the Andean glaciers, most of them at an altitude over 5000 m a.s.l. and the biggest of the three is the Rimac, which supplies water to Lima. Compared to the Nile, which runs through another desert-like city, Cairo, with a mean annual discharge of 2830 m 3 /s, the Rimac's discharge is on average 25.8 m 3 /s. (Comisión de Regantes Surco-Huatica 2016). An additional factor that has an impact on the sustainability of Lima in the future is that over 50% of the Andean glaciers have melted in the last 50 years. Together with an intense, unplanned process of urbanization, this has made Lima one of the most waterstressed cities on the planet-a place vulnerable to climate change. More pertinently, the crisis of Covid-19 during 2020 has served to underline the observation that over one million people in the city have no access to running water.In order to raise awareness, a campaign was launched in 2016 under the title 'Canals of Lima: 2000 years watering life' (Canales de Lima: 2000 años regando vida). Out of the original four main canals that existed in the lower valley of the Rimac River in Lima at the time of the arrival of the Europeans in the sixteenth century, the campaign focused on one of them: the Surco canal, the largest of them. Together with another canal in the area (the Huatica), water is supplied to an area of 1150 hectares, irrigating 711 parks in 17 (out of 43) districts of Lima where over three million people live. This represents 85% of all green areas in those parts of the city. The Surco canal along 29.5 km from its source in the Rimac River to the Pacific Ocean, and the Huatica, 15 km (Lizarzaburu 2018) . Given the growing risks that affect them in city where planning is largely unregulated, the campaign stressed their importance for the future of Lima.It is intriguing that the canals survived in a city that has grown ten-fold in the last 50 years, destroying layers of its history. Perhaps more to the point, it seemed quite surprising that in such a pressurized urban context, these canals were still working for the city 2000 years after they were constructed. In the words of Peruvian architect Juan Gunther, a specialist in pre-Hispanic Lima, this ancient irrigation system was one of the most important works of hydraulic engineering in ancient Peru (Gunther 2012) .According to experts, among them archaeologist Sofia Chacaltana, there is a distinction to be made between the technology that allows for the digging of a single canal (which usually covers a very limited area of land), and the development of an irrigation system, consisting of a network of canals covering a larger territory, like the one that was established in Lima some 2000 years ago (Chacaltana 2016). The canals referred to in this article, like all the other ones that existed in the lower Rimac Valley, were formed by redirecting small sections of the Rimac River.Metropolitan Lima starts at an altitude of 850 m a.s.l. (district of Chosica), as it is part of the Andean foothills which descend towards the Pacific Ocean-approximately 50 km away. Research carried out by the Riva Agüero Institute in Lima established that the section where the two canals referred to in this paper start irrigating the lower valley, begins at an altitude of 174 m (corresponding largely to where the historic city center stands today) and continues down to the ocean following a progressive gradient (Cogorno 2015) . This slope towards the sea was perhaps the most important natural tool that allowed ancient groups to develop irrigation systems.Originally, when they were used for agriculture, the main canals were six meters wide and 1.5 m deep, having an additional margin of another six meters on either side. Italian architect Adine Gavazzi, who has studied the Lima area, underlines that when the Europeans arrived in the sixteenth century, they did not understand the spatial layout of the territory, particularly, in the sense that it was a man-made landscape and not a natural one. For them, ""the region went unnoticed in its territorial organization of cultivated fields, irrigation systems and roads"" (Gavazzi 2014) .This process of transformation of the territory from a desert into productive valleys, through the digging of canals which took over two millennia, also happened in many other parts of the Peruvian coast. ""This particularity differentiates us from the Egyptian, Indian and Chinese cultures, where development occurred along a single river, and it resembles the Sumerian and Mexican where development occurred thanks to the dominance of more than one river"" (Gunther 2012) .American archaeologist Tom Dillehay and others have identified what is probably the oldest canal in Peru, located in the area of Nanchoc, in the Zaña Valley, in the region of Cajamarca (Northern Andes). It has been radiocarbon dated to 3400 BC (Dillehay et al. 2005 ). In the case of Lima, a study by the National Water Authority (ANA) suggested that the first canal may date to 2000 BC, being associated with the ancient temple of ""Las Salinas"", in the district of El Agustino, next to the Rimac River (Casareto and Perez 2016) .During the period known as the Early Intermediate (200 BC-800 AD), the civilizations in this part of Peru created urban development that was different to earlier times. They showed a greater degree of agricultural management, thanks to large irrigation systems on both banks of the Rimac River (Canziani 2009). According to Narváez (2013) , an archaeologist who is one of the main experts on Lima's canals, ""The complexity of the societies that existed during Pre-colonial times in this valley is expressed in the existence of monumental architecture, with huge pyramids, (…) forming complex and large settlements, in the existence of irrigation systems that covered several kilometers augmenting the available agricultural fields in the valley, and by the existence of a hierarchical system in the settlement pattern and in the exercise of power."" Santiago Agurto, a Peruvian architect who worked on this period, believed that the construction of the early canal system ""… allowed the people of the Lima culture to make their urban development independent from the river bank and be able to build ceremonial and administrative settlements in the heart of the valley, in wide and flat areas suitable to allow great urban development"" (Agurto 1984) . At least five different pre-Hispanic cultures have in turn settled in what is today the city of Lima, leaving behind a legacy of over 500 archaeological sites. Each of those cultures improved and/ or expanded on what previously existed. The last ones to occupy these lands, before the Spanish, were the Incas, from c.1450 to c.1530.Pre-Hispanic cultures were not only able to build extensively in the valley, but also to devote themselves to agriculture-so much so, that until the arrival of the Spanish, valley-based communities had managed to create a network of 250 km of canals, irrigating 30,000 hectares of land which had previously been desert (Gunther 2012) . It was the extent of the irrigation system that caught the attention of the Spanish chroniclers in the sixteenth century, making reference to them as works that had been continually maintained over the ages in order to ensure water distribution throughout the valley (Flores Zúñiga 2009). ""They took advantage of the water of the rivers, irrigating all the lands where it reached, and this work of their ditches was one of the greatest and most admirable they had, because they were well done and with so much order, that it is amazing to consider how, lacking our tools, they could dig and build them…"" (Cobo 1882) .Agriculture continued to flourish with the new crops introduced by the Europeans, like olives, apples and sugar cane. Several records mention that until the mid-twentieth century, there were some 800 'haciendas', estates and farms in Lima, all of them benefitting from the existing pre-Hispanic irrigation system. Peruvian historian Jorge Lossio, noted that even in the 1950s, Lima was still a self-sustaining city (Lossio 2003 ) (Map 1). The canals were used well into the mid-twentieth century, when the city entered into an accelerated and disorderly process of urban growth, which anthropologist José Matos Mar famously described as the ""popular overflow"" (Matos 1984) . The canals were needed to water fewer and fewer areas, and partly for this reason many were narrowed down from the previous six meters to a width of one and a half meters. By the 1970s, most if not all of the former plantations had disappeared under the new city.A new role was found for the surviving canals, as they were used for the irrigation of parks, gardens and green areas. At the same time, however, the vulnerability of these canals became more evident. Some of them, in other parts of the city, were destroyed or disappeared under the cement. Along the route of the Surco canal, there are still risk factors that remain a concern, such as unregulated urban growth, the invasion of private and/or public land, the dumping of waste, the illegal use of the water course, and route diversion without authorization, and these were some of the reasons why the campaign was launched (Lizarzaburu 2018).It is thought that during pre-Hispanic times, control over the water distribution provided political leverage allowing different groups to live in relative peace. Historian María Rostowrowski noted that from the tenth to fifteenth centuries ""[…] the lower valleys of Rimac and Lurin were integrated into a lordship named Ichma that encompassed smaller lordships, each divided into halves with land around the main irrigation canals […]"" (Rostowrowski 1978) . During the Spanish colonial period, the institution of Water Judges was created in order to deal with the multiple legal disputes that arose when the new owners of the land settled and did not understand the workings or the philosophy behind the traditional management of these waterways. Dominguez (1988) mentions that the treatise devised by Cerdán y Pontero in 1793 was in force in Peru until 1911, when a new ""Water Code"" was announced, creating the Water and Agriculture Directorate. A few years later, the Irrigation Commissions were set up, which today are part of the National Water Authority, ANA, a branch of the Ministry of Agriculture. Currently, the Rimac River Basin Users Board covers a much bigger area than the one described in this article. It includes 17 Irrigation Commissions, in charge of the irrigation of 4700 hectares, mostly agricultural land outside metropolitan Lima. The Surco-Huatica commission is one of these 17 organizations. According to the information provided by the Surco-Huatica Irrigation Commission, the current system consists of a main (or central) canal, also called the mother-canal, with other Map 1 Lower Rimac River Valley and its network of canals, as it was at the beginning of the XX century. Image: Joaquín Narvaez canals originating from the main one (primary, secondary and tertiary canals, as well as ditches, depending on their width and length) (Lizarzaburu 2018) .From the total area within the Users Board, 1150 hectares are irrigated by the Surco and Huatica canals, under the management of the Irrigation Commission (Map 2). This is the equivalent of 3.1 square meters of green areas per citizen, or one third of the Map 2 Current route of the Surco and Huatica canals. Source Irrigation Commission 9 square meters recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a healthy minimum. The Irrigation Commission is responsible for the central or mother-canal, while the minor canals are under the authority of each municipality. Among its members are local authorities (16 municipal districts), 10 public institutions (including the city's main two cemeteries), 7 private institutions (including three universities and four clubs-the main golf club in Lima being one of them), as well as a small number of urban farmers (Table 1) . Together, the 69 users each pay a rate of 0.10 Peruvian cents per cubic meter of water (US$ 0.028 approx.).Recently, tensions have arisen due to changes introduced by the Ministry of Agriculture. Until 2018, the Irrigation Commissions were the sole operators of the canal infrastructure. Now, with the new Operators Regulation, Irrigation Boards have become the operators and the Irrigation Commissions have become the administrators. This means that the operator is in charge of the collection of tariffs and the maintenance of the infrastructure, which was previously the responsibility of the Commissions. In addition, if the Commission wants to undertake work on the canal, it must request authorization from the Board. To date, these changes have not been implemented and the system continues to operate under the old model. Aside from the risk factors affecting them, when research began on the canals, some striking facts immediately came to light related to water availability and water consumption in Lima:• Even though Peru ranks number 8 in potential water availability in the world, with 1.89% of the total (FAO 2013), 98% of those resources go directly into the Atlantic basin. • The majority of the population, 66%, live close to the Pacific basin, where water availability is calculated at 2.2% (ANA (Statista) .If people are using so much water in a place where there is so little, it seems evident that there is a lack of awareness of the current situation. Even though the campaign considered in this text was not directly aimed at raising awareness of domestic water wastage, it is nevertheless related, since the water the canals use originates from the same source as the drinking water that feeds the needs of the city of Lima. This is dealt with in the last section.The campaign was officially approved during an Extraordinary General Assembly of the Irrigation Commission, on February 29, 2016. The broader scenario was to secure recognition of segments of the Surco Canal as National Cultural Heritage, to be granted by the Ministry of Culture. In addition to the main objective others were identified including raising awareness of the scarcity of water as a natural resource, informing citizens of the environmental importance of the canals, and letting people know that the existing infrastructure-instead of rivers-were a man-made network of pre-Hispanic origin. All these goals needed to be framed in a context of cultural, historical and environmental value.In order to get academic and professional support, an Advisory Council was also created, which included architects, experts on the pre-Hispanic period, archaeologists, and other professionals keen on offering their support. (Here onwards, where actions included the author, members of the Commission and the Advisory Council, they are referred to as 'the Group'). With the Surco being a working canal, it would have been impossible to ask for the declaration of National Heritage for the whole length of it. Instead, one of the archaeologists in the Advisory Council, Joaquín Narváez, undertook an additional study and wrote a report identifying four sections of it, that would have remained unchanged since pre-colonial times, and these were put forward as possible segments for declaration. As part of this process with the Ministry of Culture, a supporting documentation was required that documented and explained why the Group thought this declaration was necessary. Much of the information in this essay comes from that original document and later from a book published on the subject (see Useful Links).For Castells (2009) , people understand and communicate better through metaphors, because this allows messages to engage with the reader more effectively. This approach was employed when writing articles on the canals for the Lima Milenaria blog. Like almost everything pre-Hispanic in Lima, the canals had survived at the margins of official narratives, so it was important to put them in a context of practical benefit for the citizens as well as to attempt to generate links between the present day readers and the ancient people of Lima who were, after all, the ones who had given them this great inheritance. This emphasis was also conveyed to other media when they wrote on the subject.In total, 20 stories were written in the blog; nearly 100 stories related to the canals and the campaign were published in the national and international media, as well as local TV and radio. The social media campaign reached over two million people. Over 25 public meetings were held in citizens' associations, municipal auditoriums and cultural centers, explaining the origin of the canals and the objectives of the campaign. As the campaign expanded, wellrespected artists and influencers offered their support, some of them in the form of video clips. In order to bring the campaign to a close, a large public event was held in one of the parks where a section of the open canal remains. The activities incorporated an ancestral ritual celebrating the pre-Hispanic infrastructure, a walk along the route of the Huatica canal, a bicycle ride along the route of the Surco canal, and heritage workshops for children, all organized by different groups of citizens who were also supporting the campaign.The application was submitted to the ministry in September 2016 and the process took longer than expected. This was mainly due to the fact that until then, the officials had never had to consider declaring a pre-Hispanic canal as National Cultural Heritage. The examples for doing so were in general limited to monumental architecture and monumental engineering works, as there was no precedent for something as seemingly modest (yet so crucial for the city) as these canals. However, the two years it took to complete the process allowed for a number of follow-up meetings, where members of the Group engaged in working meetings with experts at the ministry. The Ministry of Culture also carried out its own research into the canals. In March 2019, Vice-Ministerial Resolution No. 041-2019-VMPCIC-MC was officially published, in which one of the four segments suggested by the Group was declared to be part of Peru's National Cultural Heritage (El Peruano 2019). According to informal communications with the author in 2019, the process for the declaration of the other segments has been completed, pending of clearance of legal property rules.It has not been possible to measure the precise level of awareness raised by the campaign during those two years, but there were several positive signs that gave an idea that some impact had been achieved. One of them, at an academic level, was an event titled Limapolis 2017. In March 2017, an international workshop was organized by the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, PUCP, to study the Surco canal. It was an event dedicated to urban issues that focused on the possibilities of urban regeneration, environmental improvement, enhancement of heritage, and promotion of social inclusion from the route of the Surco Canal through the city. In total, 16 architects, both from Peru and abroad, spent one week developing initial strategies for the integration of the 30 km of this canal into the city as a public space (Benavides 2018) .Later, as a consequence of the health emergency generated by the Coronavirus in 2020, the Peruvian government launched a series of economic reactivation measures, especially investment in infrastructure. In this context, the Ministry of Agriculture has promised aid of up to 150 million Peruvian soles (over US$ 40 million), and in May 2020 approved an initial list of works for 91 million Peruvian soles (over US$25 million), which includes 4126 maintenance projects for irrigation canals in 22 departments in the country. The current president of the Surco-Huatica Irrigation Commission, Mr. Mario Ichiki, informed the author via e-mail that the Surco and Huatica canals will be one of the beneficiaries of this fund, with a different but also very significant new approach to its management.This will be based on replacing the use of river water as its main source and moving towards the use of treated wastewater, thus improving the efficiency of the irrigation system in a growing scenario of water scarcity. According to existing data, only 0.09% of public parks and gardens are irrigated with residual treated water. On the other hand, La Chira and Taboada treatment plants discharge 550 million m 3 of processed water into the sea.Additionally, the Commission is working with the Ministry of the Environment to produce a Master Plan for the recuperation of the Surco and Huatica canals. The draft document sent to the author includes, for the first time in ministerial documents, subjects like the preservation of the cultural heritage associated with the canals and the generation of identity and links between citizens and their cultural heritage.Meanwhile, in another communication with the author via e-mail, the Director of the Office for the Historic Center of Lima, PROLIMA, Mr. Luis Martín Bogdanovich, mentioned, as a way of evaluating the campaign, that it had been decisive in the creation of a narrative based on the value of a heritage previously invisible for decades. The progress made has served to incorporate the protection and recuperation of the extant canals within the Historic Center in the Master Plan, recently approved by Ordinance 2194-2019 MML.Mr Bogdanovich added that ""to date, PROLIMA has been working on the preliminary plans for two public spaces where we could show the canals: the Monserrate Square, associated with the Maranga canal; and the Carrion Square, associated with the Matute canal, a primary canal diverted from the Huatica. Likewise, from the recently created archaeology division at PROLIMA, an archaeological research project has been completed to explore the remains of the canals that passed through the Historic Center, which will also be submitted to the Ministry of Culture."" So it is possible to say that there is hope for the ancient canals of Lima.",Peru,abstract,2020-11-17,11

En un lapso corto se logró tipificar el agente causal: un virus de la familia Coronaviridae, cuyo origen es probablemente zoonótico y cuyo hospedero inicial es el murciélago (2) . Pronto se le concede el nombre de SARS-CoV-2, para diferenciarlo de los otros dos virus de la familia Coronaviridae, también causantes de pandemias en este siglo, el SARS-CoV-1 y el MERS (3, 4) .A pesar de tener una tasa de letalidad del 2,3% (5) , comparativamente menor que la del SARS-CoV-1 (9,5%) y que la del MERS (34,4%) (6) , el SARS-CoV-2 logró expandirse de manera rápida por fuera de China, debido a su alta tasa de contagio, la cual se explica por una mayor carga viral en el tracto respiratorio, superior en comparación con la del SARS-CoV-1 (7) . También influyen su capacidad de mantenerse como aerosol en el aire por más de tres horas, sobrevivir por 72 horas en muchas superficies y tener un período de incubación relativamente corto, menor a dos semanas (8) .Los reportes iniciales señalaron que la mayoría de los pacientes manifestaban síntomas como fiebre, rinorrea, tos sin expectoración, astenia y adinamia (9) . Una pequeña proporción de pacientes necesitó hospitalización por cuadro de neumonía severa. El grupo del doctor Wu reportó una cohorte de 70.000 pacientes (3) con infección por SARS-CoV-2. Estos investigadores demostraron que el 14% de los pacientes presentan un cuadro de neumonía severa (disnea, taquipnea, desaturación y disminución en la fracción PAFI); el 5% de estos casos son considerados críticos y requieren manejo en unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI), con una tasa de mortalidad del 2,3% en población general y hasta del 14% en mayores de 80 años. Estos resultados fueron comprobados con estudios posteriores de grupos europeos (10) . Entre los factores de riesgo más importantes para presentar un curso tórpido de la infección se encuentran ser hombre, padecer diabetes, hipertensión arterial y sufrir enfermedades pulmonares y cardiovasculares crónicas (11, 12) . Cabe destacar que la población pediátrica Page 4 of 25 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f menor de 10 años presenta síntomas leves de la enfermedad, con una tasa de complicaciones o letalidad mucho menor a la de la población adulta (13) .Información procedente de Asia, Europa y Estados Unidos evidencia que la infección por SARS-CoV-2 presenta una gran gama de manifestaciones dermatológicas, al comienzo consideradas inespecíficas; sin embargo, con el aumento en los reportes, se ha podido encontrar un aparente patrón de presentación, que incluso puede estar relacionado con el pronóstico de esta infección. El presente artículo presenta una revisión de la literatura de las variadas manifestaciones cutáneas hasta ahora reportadas en pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2. Posteriormente, se mencionan los diversos mecanismos fisiopatológicos e hipótesis actuales que pueden explicar las manifestaciones en piel.Existen 39 especies de coronavirus, de las cuales siete afectan al ser humano (14) . Salvo el SARS-CoV-1, el SARS-CoV-2 y el MERS, estos virus (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 y HCoV-HKU1) causan cuadros respiratorios leves, como resfriado común.Probablemente muchos de estos virus, al igual que otros virus respiratorios, se asocien a exantemas virales, que no se identifican al no realizarse pruebas diagnósticas específicas.El primer reporte en la literatura en el cual se manifiesta algún hallazgo cutáneo en pacientes con COVID-19, fue la cohorte analizada por el doctor Wei-jie Guan et al., publicado en febrero del 2020 (15) . En esta cohorte de 1099 pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2, dos pacientes presentaron lesiones en la piel; los autores no especificaron qué tipo de exantema ni las características clínicas ni temporales de estas lesiones, por lo que este hallazgo pasó parcialmente desapercibido. Luego, desde Tailandia, se reportó un paciente (16) con curso clínico inicial de ""rash morbiliforme y múltiples petequias"", sumado a trombocitopenia, con diagnóstico inicial de infección por virus del dengue y manejo ambulatorio; no obstante, el paciente consultó nuevamente por síntomas respiratorios, con el diagnóstico confirmado de SARS-CoV-2 por RT-PCR (reacción en cadena de la polimerasa transcriptasa reversa). Esta publicación incitó a médicos con pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2 bajo su cuidado a indagar sobre las manifestaciones dermatológicas en ellos (17, 18) .La primera gran descripción de pacientes con manifestaciones cutáneas se reportó en Italia (19) ; 88 casos de pacientes con COVID-19, de los cuales 18 tuvieron cualquier tipo de clínica en la piel (20,4%), 8 de ellos durante su hospitalización y 10 luego del egreso; 14 pacientes manifestaron un ""exantema eritematoso""; 3 pacientes, lesiones clínicas de urticaria generalizada y un paciente, hallazgos de erupción variceliforme. La gran mayoría de pacientes presentó las lesiones en el tronco, una importante proporción de ellas asintomáticas, y curso benigno autorresolutivo, sin relación con la severidad del cuadro.Por desgracia no se tomaron fotografías de ninguna de las lesiones, por políticas sanitarias del hospital al momento del estudio.Con el pasar de los días, se describieron nuevos casos de pacientes con infección confirmada y con una amplia gama de manifestaciones: placas eritema-amarillentas pruriginosas en talones (Figura 1 A) (20) ; eritema morbiliforme que respeta zonas acrales (21) ; exantema morbiliforme maculopapular generalizado de progresión céfalo-caudal (22) ; lesiones urticariformes (23, 24) ; exantemas que por su distribución recuerdan reacciones medicamentosas flexurales e intertriginosas (25) ; e incluso pacientes con lesiones de livedo reticularis en extremidades inferiores (Figura 1 B) (26) . Al igual que en los casos anteriores, no se realizaron biopsias, debido al seguimiento de protocolos sanitarios y por la evolución benigna y autorresolutiva.Durante el mes de abril, la revista Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology comunicó una serie de 22 pacientes (27) con diagnóstico de infección por SARS-CoV-2, quienes desarrollaron, aproximadamente tres días después del inicio de los síntomas sistémicos, un exantema variceliforme, de curso benigno con un lapso de ocho días desde el inicio hasta la resolución de los hallazgos cutáneos, sin cicatrices residuales. Con respecto a las características asociadas a los sujetos, la mayoría de los pacientes era de sexo masculino (72,7%); edad media de 60 años; las lesiones variceliformes tenían predominio de vesículas, diseminadas en el 72,7% de los casos y difusas en el 27,3%; con compromiso J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f constante en el tronco. En los resultados no se reportó compromiso facial o mucoso (Figura 2 A y B). El síntoma más común fue prurito leve en casi la mitad de los pacientes. Se realizó biopsia de piel en siete pacientes, con hallazgos histopatológicos compatibles con una infección aguda viral (Figura 2 C y D). Los autores de este reporte de casos proponen este tipo de exantema como una manifestación específica de infección por SARS-CoV-2, lo cual puede servir al personal médico como un indicio para sospecha ante un paciente con síntomas leves de la infección.Ulteriormente, se divulgó el caso de un hombre en la cuarta década de la vida, con prueba molecular positiva para SARS-CoV-2, con cuadro clínico consistente en picos febriles y aparición concomitante de placas fijas eritematoedematosas no pruriginosas anulares, circinadas y policíclicas en cuello, tórax, abdomen y miembros superiores, de manera simétrica (Figura 3 A, B y C); estas lesiones resolvieron después de siete días. Se realizó biopsia de piel con hallazgos compatibles con exantema viral (Figura 3 D) (28) .El grupo de origen chino liderado por el doctor Zhang (29) publicó una evaluación retrospectiva de siete pacientes ingresados a la UCI de un hospital en Wuhan por neumonía crítica por SARS-CoV-2. Estos pacientes presentaron múltiples fenómenos isquémicos acrales, como acrocianosis, púrpura retiforme y gangrena (Figura 4). Se realizó la evaluación de paraclínicos al momento del ingreso hospitalario, cuando presentaron estos fenómenos cutáneos y luego del uso de terapia anticoagulante; se evidenciaron alteraciones en el dímero D, en el fibrinógeno y en los productos de este último, en relación con los eventos secuenciales descritos y con tasa de mortalidad del 71,42%. Desde ese momento se plantea la hipótesis de un estado hipercoagulable per se en los pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2.Paralelamente en Europa, Oriente Medio y Estados Unidos, se estudiaron múltiples casos de pacientes con lesiones similares a perniosis, en personas jóvenes en contacto estrecho con pacientes con COVID-19 o con síntomas altamente sugestivos, sin la necesaria confirmación de infección por SARS-CoV-2. Los cuadros mencionados presentaban multitud de síntomas, entre los más importantes dolor y ardor cutáneo, con un curso autorresolutivo benigno y sin complicaciones por neumonía asociada a SARS-CoV-2 (30) (31) (32) .El grupo del doctor Kolivras et al. (33) , reportó el caso de un adulto joven con placas violáceas de comienzo abrupto, dolorosas en dedos y regiones laterales de los pies (Figura 5 A y B), con síntomas prodrómicos respiratorios altos, tres días antes de las lesiones. Se realizó una biopsia de la lesión con hallazgos compatibles con lupus pernio (Figura 5 C y D). El resultado de hisopado nasofaríngeo al ingreso fue positivo para SARS-CoV-2.Debido al gran impacto de la pandemia en el continente europeo, múltiples grupos reportan estudios con el objetivo de caracterizar las lesiones acrales similares a perniosis en contexto de COVID-19 (34) . En Italia, Recalcati (31) y Tosti (35) encontraron que estas lesiones son más comunes en población joven (78,5% ocurren en niños), con compromiso de los pies en un 71% de los casos, sin síntomas sistémicos, autorresolutivas con laboratorios normales.En Francia (36) , se estudiaron 277 pacientes en un lapso de tres semanas; 142 pacientes (80%) presentaron lesiones acrales, de estos, 106 (75%) con máculas y pápulas eritematovioláceas, edematosas dolorosas compatibles con lesiones de lupus pernio. El grupo liderado por el doctor Fernández-Nieto (37) caracterizó una cohorte de 132 pacientes no hospitalizados con lesiones acro-isquémicas durante cinco semanas. Señalaron una edad media de 19,9 años; 40,9% de los casos ocurrieron en contacto cercano con pacientes infectados por SARS-CoV-2, 14,4% con COVID positivo. Más del 90% de las lesiones ocurría en los dedos; el 81,8%, en los pies. Como en los casos previamente mencionados, la aparición de estas lesiones se acompañó de un curso benigno de la enfermedad.El grupo de la doctora Cynthia Magro et al. (38) , evaluó a pacientes con COVID-19 y manifestaciones cutáneas relacionadas con un estado procoagulante o microangiopático. A tres pacientes que desarrollaron púrpura retiforme o livedo racemoso en el transcurso de su enfermedad respiratoria (Figura 6 A) se les relacionó con niveles elevados de dímero D, por lo tanto, se les realizó biopsias de piel encontrando vasculopatía trombogénica pauciinflamatoria con depósitos de complemento C5b-9 y C4d (Figura 6 B y C). Así parte la hipótesis una relación entre los mecanismos dependientes de vías de complemento alterna y dependiente de lectina y fenómenos trombóticos en pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2, con la subsecuente explicación del porqué existen fenómenos procoagulantes en otros órganos (39) .El British Journal of Dermatology entregó a la comunidad científica los resultados del estudio (40) de 375 pacientes españoles con infección confirmada por SARS-CoV-2, o con sospecha de contagio con síntomas compatibles, y con manifestaciones cutáneas adicionales sin explicación clara sobre su causalidad. Los pacientes fueron evaluados en un lapso de dos semanas y se consideraron las características clínicas encontradas, la temporalidad con respecto a los síntomas, las particularidades demográficas de los pacientes y su relación con el curso y pronóstico de la infección. A partir de estas evaluaciones, el grupo liderado por el doctor Galván Casas propone una clasificación de las manifestaciones cutáneas de COVID-19 organizada en cinco patrones clínicos: 1) ""pseudochilblain"" en un 19% de los pacientes; 2) ""vesicular"" en un 9%; 3) ""urticariforme"" en un 19%; 4) ""maculopapular"" en un 47% y 5) ""vasculo-necrótico"" en un 6% del total de los pacientes. Se encontró que este último patrón, que engloba las lesiones livedoides y necróticas, aparece en pacientes ancianos (edad media de 63 años) con un curso severo de la infección (mortalidad del 10%), mientras que las lesiones eritematoedematosas con vesículas o pústulas en zonas acrales, ""pseudo-chilblain"", aparecen en su gran mayoría luego del inicio de los síntomas respiratorios, en un 59% de los casos, en pacientes jóvenes (edad media de 21,8 años), con un curso benigno de la infección por SARS-CoV-2, con una tasa de mortalidad del 0%, tasa igual a las reportadas en las variantes ""vesicular"" y ""urticariforme"", mientras que la tasa de sobrevida de los pacientes con lesiones ""maculopapulares"" fue del 98%. Los datos del estudio son concordantes con los publicados por otros autores, en especial con respecto al curso benigno de las lesiones ""pseudochilblain"" (30) (31) (32) (33) .Los pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2 complicada con pronóstico desfavorable presentan leucocitosis, neutrofilia, linfopenia, trombocitopenia, aumento en niveles de lactato deshidrogenasa, de procalcitonina, así como alteración en los valores de dímero D y de productos de degradación del fibrinógeno (41) , que, en algunos casos, configuran hallazgos compatibles con un síndrome de coagulación intravascular diseminada (CID) (42) .Por otro lado, los doctores Lippi y Favaloro (43) hallaron una asociación directamente proporcional de los niveles de dímero D con respecto a la gravedad de la neumonía y de los síndromes de distress respiratorio agudo secundarios a infección por SARS-CoV-2; datos congruentes con otros reportes (9) , en los que se evidencia una relación del dímero D elevado y la mortalidad con respecto a COVID-19.En los seres humanos, la ferritina tiene una función protectora durante la infección, puesto que disminuye la cantidad de hierro disponible para diversos patógenos (44) , lo cual explica su incremento en estados de inflamación (45) . Los niveles de ferritina se encuentran elevados de gran manera en los pacientes con neumonía severa por SARS-CoV-2, y se correlacionan con desenlaces negativos con respecto a morbilidad y mortalidad (46) .Como se ha mencionado, los cambios en las variables bioquímicas son diversos; sin embargo, todos llevan a un mismo punto: características similares al de un síndrome de activación macrofágica (SAM) (47) . Aquí radica la importancia de las células de la línea blanca, en especial de los linfocitos T y los macrófagos en la respuesta inmune hipercitoquinética y trombótica asociada a COVID-19.Los estudios iniciales para la tipificación del nuevo coronavirus identificaron al receptor de superficie celular de la enzima convertidora de angiotensina tipo 2 (ACE2, por sus siglas en inglés) como el receptor clave en la patogénesis de la infección (2) . El virus lo utiliza para entrar a las células de los seres humanos, sin afinidad alguna hacia otros receptores que utilizan distintas familias de coronavirus, como el receptor de la dipeptidil peptidasa 4 (DPP4) (48) .El receptor ACE2 se encuentra en la superficie de células epiteliales pulmonares, en los enterocitos del intestino delgado, en las células endoteliales de venas y arterias y en las células del músculo liso arterial de múltiples órganos, entre ellos la piel (49) . La replicación del virus dentro de las células causa daño celular directo con liberación de alarminas proinflamatorias (efecto viral directo); sumado a esto, las partículas virales pueden crear respuestas inmunes innatas, que incluyen la activación de macrófagos alveolares y de la cascada del complemento a través de la vía de la lectina (38, 50) .La activación del complemento y las diversas respuestas inmunes permiten el reclutamiento de leucocitos, con una proliferación exagerada de linfocitos y con liberación masiva de citoquinas proinflamatorias (IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8), de interferón gamma y de factor de necrosis tumoral (TNF) alfa, entre otros. El interferón gamma en grandes cantidades activa los macrófagos y libera ferritina (45) ; la IL-6 produce fiebre en los individuos (51) y hemofagocitosis que conduce a pancitopenia (47, 52) . Al mismo tiempo, los macrófagos liberan el factor activador del plasminógeno, por lo que puede ser uno de los múltiples mecanismos que explicarían los episodios trombóticos y la elevación del dímero D (53) , junto con otros hallazgos como el papel de la presencia de anticuerpos antifosfolípidos en pacientes con COVID-19 severo sin comorbilidades (54) . Los grupos dirigidos por la doctora Bowles (55) en Reino Unido y por el doctor Connel en Estados Unidos (56) ratifican los hallazgos de anticuerpos antifosfolípidos, en especial del anticoagulante lúpico, en pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2. Esto puede explicar los fenómenos acrales isquémicos -a excepción de las lesiones tipo perniosis-, necrosis e incluso los hallazgos de livedo reticularis y racemoso en algunos pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2, con respuestas trombóticas multisistémicas concomitantes.Otra hipótesis que explica los cambios sistémicos y cutáneos es la llamada sepsis viral en COVID-19 (57) , la cual se plantea a partir de los múltiples hallazgos de daño multiorgánico en las autopsias de pacientes que mueren por síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda por SARS-CoV-2 (58) . Al parecer, la gran cantidad de citoquinas liberadas, en especial el TNF alfa, inducen la muerte de las células infectadas por vías dependientes de apoptosis, sumado a la aparente capacidad del SARS-CoV-2 de infectar a los linfocitos T, lo que genera la linfopenia en estos pacientes.Hay evidencia suficiente que soporta el daño directo por SARS-CoV-2 sobre la célula endotelial, con posterior inflamación endotelial difusa, la cual ocasiona apoptosis del J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f endotelio vascular (59) , creando el interrogante sobre si la infección por SARS-CoV-2 es realmente una enfermedad netamente endotelial (60) . A favor de esta teoría se encuentran la mortalidad descrita en pacientes con antecedentes de diabetes mellitus o enfermedad cardiovascular crónica infectados por este nuevo coronavirus y los hallazgos isquémicos, en especial, acrales en la piel.Se ha observado que los pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2 que presentan lesiones compatibles con perniosis (30) (31) (32) presentan un curso benigno de la infección, a diferencia de los pacientes con fenómenos isquémicos acrales severos, como gangrena (29) o púrpura retiforme (38) ; también se reporta que los pacientes con este curso más benigno pertenecen a la población más joven. La explicación puede estar en el interferón tipo I.En su publicación, el doctor Kolivras et al. (33) hacen énfasis en la gran respuesta de interferón tipo I en los pacientes con COVID-19, como en muchas infecciones virales agudas (61) . El interferón tipo I se encuentra elevado en el lupus eritematoso, así como en las interferonopatías, como el síndrome de Aicardi-Goutières, en el cual se presentan fenómenos microangiopáticos distales (62) . Se propone que es la respuesta temprana del interferón tipo I la causante de estas lesiones acrales, respuesta que al mismo tiempo presenta un curso clínico benigno, por la función antiviral de esta citoquina. Por otro lado, puesto que una respuesta prematura del interferón tipo I es capaz de suprimir la liberación no controlada de citoquinas proinflamatorias diversas, disminuyendo la posibilidad de una ""tormenta de citoquinas"", los pacientes ancianos, o con comorbilidades que alteren la función de su sistema inmunológico, son capaces de generar solo una respuesta de interferón tardía, con la subsecuente liberación de citoquinas y la expresión de un síndrome de activación macrofágica, liberación de ferritina y de dímero D, con lesiones isquémicas acrales verdaderas y un pronóstico mucho peor.La pandemia actual por COVID-19 ha significado un reto de enormes proporciones para los profesionales de la salud, con la tarea de reconocer toda la gama de manifestaciones J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f clínicas que presentan los pacientes infectados. Esta enfermedad es multisistémica y la piel no es ajena a sus manifestaciones, con la gran ventaja de que reconocerlas permitiría una sospecha temprana del diagnóstico en unos casos y, en otros, una aproximación evolutiva a la enfermedad que incluso podría orientarnos sobre qué tipo de respuesta inmune o complicaciones está presentando cada paciente.Se propone, con base en las hipótesis fisiopatológicas que explican las diversas expresiones clínicas de la COVID-19, clasificar estas expresiones en dos grupos: 1) las que se basan principalmente en un efecto citopático viral directo sobre las células del organismo -como los queratinocitos, que son comunes a muchas infecciones virales conocidas (exantema morbiliforme, urticariforme, semejante a ciertas reacciones medicamentosas, variceliforme)-y 2) las secundarias a la hiperexpresión no controlada de citoquinas en el organismo por alteración de células específicas de la línea blanca, como los linfocitos T y los macrófagos. Así, este último grupo se subdividiría en dos: a) las que se caracterizan por un fenómeno similar al síndrome de activación macrofágica (isquemia acral, gangrena, púrpura retiforme, livedo racemoso), con un pronóstico ominoso con relación a morbilidad y mortalidad de los pacientes, y b) las manifestaciones cutáneas relacionadas con un pronóstico benigno autorresolutivo en pacientes jóvenes, por activación de una respuesta temprana al interferón tipo I (lesiones similares a perniosis) (Figura 7). Esta hipótesis es una de las primeras en la literatura científica que logra explicar la relación entre las más importantes manifestaciones cutáneas y su fisiopatología, con su subsecuente clasificación y valor pronóstico.Se estima de vital importancia que todos los médicos, enfermeros, terapeutas respiratorios, personal de salud en preparación, e incluso la población en general, conozcan la relación entre la infección por SARS-CoV-2 y la piel, con sus variadas manifestaciones, para propender hacia una búsqueda activa, un estudio minucioso y la generación de nuevos conocimientos científicos que ayuden a caracterizar la fisiopatogenia de esta enfermedad y lograr así un acercamiento al desarrollo de terapias eficaces y protocolos en salud que permitan mitigar las complicaciones de esta infección. Los autores declaran no tener ningún conflicto de intereses AGRADECIMIENTOS A todos los profesionales de la salud que han sido parte de la primera línea de atención de pacientes con COVID-19; su aporte a la historia de la medicina es invaluable.

238c7ce2d952859b6ddca55128f14c15ec7916fd,Information in Spanish on the Internet about the Prevention of COVID-19,"In December 2019, an outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , which is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in the city of Wuhan (Hubei province, China). On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [1] . Subsequently, on 11 March 2020, the WHO recognized it as a global pandemic [2] .According to the WHO situation reports, on 13 July 2020, the virus had infected 1,638,378 people in Spanish-speaking countries, causing 99,904 deaths; Peru, Chile, Mexico, and Spain had the highest number of infected people, with more than 250,000 cases in each country, while Mexico and Spain had the highest number of deaths, with 34,730 and 28,403, respectively [3] .We performed a repeated cross-sectional observational study on the Internet. On 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, from a Spanish IP address, two Google searches were performed with the terms ""Prevencion COVID-19"" and ""Prevencion Coronavirus"". Like in other studies, the first 30 weblinks in Spanish were selected for each search, excluding advertisements [26] [27] [28] . While using Google, the author was not logged in as a Google user. The search history and cookies were not cleared before the new second search.The information corresponding to the following variables was extracted from each weblink: type of authorship (official public health organization, official non-public-health organization, scientific society, digital mass media, library, private health care system, etc.), country of origin, and basic protective measures to avoid COVID-19, according to the WHO, effective at the time of the searches, including (a) regularly and thoroughly cleaning one's hands; (b) maintaining a distance of at least 1 m (3 feet) between oneself and others; (c) not touching the eyes, nose, and mouth; (d) covering one's nose and mouth with a bent elbow or tissue if one is sneezing or coughing (then disposing of the used tissue immediately); (e) staying at home if one feels unwell; and (f) if one develops a fever/cough or has difficulty breathing, seeking medical advice promptly (calling in advance) [29] . The information was obtained by making up to four clicks on the different sub-links of each link, as has been done in other studies [25, 30] .A Chi-squared test was conducted to study the association between the date of the search (1 March 2020, or 13 July 2020) and the frequency with which the basic prevention measures were found. The associations of the variables of type of authorship and country of origin with the detection of basic prevention measures were also analyzed using a Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for each search date. For this purpose, the variable of type of authorship was categorized as follows: official public health organization, digital mass media, etc. The countries of origin of the weblinks were categorized according to the type of transmission existing in each country at the time of the data collection and were as follows: (a) no transmission: countries where no cases were reported; (b) imported cases only: countries where all cases were acquired outside the reporting location; (c) local transmission: countries where the source of infection was within the reporting location; (d) clusters of cases: experiencing cases clustered in time, by geographic location, and/or by common exposures; and (e) community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an assessment of factors, including, but not limited to, large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission chains, large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance, and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country [3, 31] .The strength of the association was quantified with the Odds Ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) obtained from univariate logistic regression analysis. In all hypothesis tests, differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using Epi Info TM (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) and SPSS v25 (IBM Corp, Chicago, IL, USA). As in other studies, the information available on the Internet was assessed, and no human participants or animals were included. For this reason, ethical approval was not required [6] .In total, 120 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in Spain (70.0% (84/120)) by official public health organizations and digital mass media (60.0%) ( Table 1) . Globally, throughout the study, the WHO's preventive measures mentioned most often were ""wash your hands frequently"" (91.7%) and ""cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze"" (82.5%). A recommendation less frequently made was to ""stay at home if you feel unwell"" (45.8%) ( Table 2 ). According to the search date, on 13 July 2020, a significant increase was observed in the number of weblinks produced from Spain (Table 1) . Likewise, a significant increase in the number of weblinks produced by official public health organizations was detected, as well as a significant decrease in the number of weblinks from digital mass media (Table 1) .Over time, the number of weblinks that provided information on some measures to prevent COVID-19 (""avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth"", and ""stay at home if you feel unwell"") increased significantly (from 56.7 to 80.0% (p = 0.006) and from 28.3 to 63.3% (p = 0.000), respectively) ( Table 2) . Table 3 , showing the results for 1 March 2020, and Table 4 , showing the results for 13 July 2020, show the frequency of the occurrence of recommendations relating to the prevention of COVID-19 provided by the WHO by the type of author and country of origin. They show how the associations between these variables have changed over time. Thus, the weblinks of official public health organizations, compared to those of digital mass media, have always more frequently provided advice to ""seek medical advice if you develop a fever/cough or have difficulty breathing"". Furthermore, in July, the weblinks of such organizations more frequently provided advice to ""cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze"" (OR = 11.5) and ""maintain a distance of at least 1 m (3 feet) between yourself and others"" (OR = 10.5). According to the country of origin of the weblink, in March, finding the recommendation to ""maintain a distance of at least 1 m between yourself and others"" was associated with weblinks made in countries with local transmission/imported cases (OR = 8.14), while in July, the recommendation to ""seek medical advice if you develop a fever/cough or have difficulty breathing"" was associated with weblinks made in countries with community transmission (OR = 8.85).In 16 weblinks found in July (15 of them produced in Spain), it was indicated that a safe distance to be maintained from other people is at least 1.5 or 2 m. Different or ambiguous information regarding the basic prevention measures recommended by the WHO was detected. Thus, a July weblink recommended that people ""keep a distance of at least two meters only from people who suffer respiratory infection symptoms""; another July weblink recommended that people ""maintain a distance of two meters from other people only if they have a cough or fever"". In March, a weblink specified that ""those with acute respiratory infections should maintain their distance from other people"". In addition, a weblink recommended the use of a necktie be temporarily abandoned as a measure to prevent COVID-19.In the July search, on the first page of results, and located before the first weblink, it was observed how Google had inserted a message of general interest about the prevention measures that were the object of our study, although they only indicated the need to maintain a safe distance from people who cough or sneeze. However, this information was linked to a WHO link, which specified maintaining at least 1 m (3 feet) distance from other people.This study is the first to evaluate the evolution of the spread of the basic prevention measures of COVID-19 recommended by the WHO available in Spanish on the Internet. ""Frequent hand washing"" was the main preventive measure found in the weblinks of both moments of the study (93.3-90.0%). In addition, the availability of information on the Internet about two of the basic protective measures (""avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth"", and ""stay at home if you feel unwell"") increased significantly over time, with increases of up to 35 percentage points.However, as of July 2020, information on three of the six basic prevention measures (""maintain a distance of at least 1 m"", ""if you develop fever/cough or have difficulty breathing, seek medical advice"", and ""stay at home if you feel unwell"") was available in less than 67% of the weblinks. This shows that it is still difficult to find such information online, and it represents a worrying finding, since it is very difficult to control the spread of a virus if people have little information about how it can be prevented. Moreover, these results are consistent with what other authors have said regarding the difficulty of finding WHO-promoted measures to prevent other pandemics on the Internet [26] . Thus, Covolo et al., when analyzing the information online about the influenza pandemic vaccine, observed how only 53.9% (41/76) and 80.3% (61/76) of the weblinks provided information on contraindications and indications relating to the vaccine according to the WHO guidelines, respectively [26] .Over time, a change in the main authorship of weblinks was observed, from digital mass media (45.0% of weblinks in March) to official public health organizations (41.7% of weblinks in July). These results could show how official public health organizations were slow to create content or how in March users were subject to SEO strategies that prioritized the mass media and their location strategies in the main search results. In any case, this evolution represents a positive finding, given the reliability of the information provided by official public health institutions [26, 30] . In fact, in July 2020, the weblinks of such official public health organizations provided information on three of the basic prevention measures for COVID-19 with a significantly greater frequency than those produced by digital mass media. For this reason, Spanish-speaking users should be encouraged to consult weblinks produced by official public health organizations when looking for information on the Internet on how to prevent COVID-19. The implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of such measures could be the subject of future research. Additionally, digital mass media must take responsibility for providing correct and complete information and improving the knowledge of citizens [32] .On the other hand, in March 2020, weblinks originating in countries with cases (due to local transmission or imported cases) provided information on ""maintaining a distance of at least 1 m between yourself and others"" more often than weblinks originating in countries without cases of COVID-19. This could show the effects of the late dissemination of information on basic prevention measures. This would represent a lesson to be learned regarding the management of future public health emergencies of international concern. Regardless of whether there are cases in a country or not, information on how to prevent a disease should be disseminated as quickly as possible, because timely information is a key element of any prevention policy [33] , and because the knowledge regarding infectious diseases is associated with the level of adherence to control measures, which may limit the transmission of those diseases [34] .The July recommendation to ""seek medical advice if you develop a fever/cough or have difficulty breathing"" was found most frequently in weblinks of countries with community transmission (compared with weblinks of countries with clusters of cases). This may indicate how when the epidemiological situation improves, the spread of prevention measures decreases.The finding that the July search on 15 weblinks originating in Spain indicated that the safe distance to be maintained from other people was at least 1.5 or 2 m was considered to be in line with the WHO recommendations, given that these distances are consistent with the minimum distance of 1 m recommended by the WHO. The explanation for these findings is that a distance of at least 1.5 m is the one recommended by the Spanish Ministry of Health [35, 36] .Different or ambiguous information regarding the basic prevention measures of the WHO was detected in 3.33% of the weblinks (4/120). This represents a lower percentage than that described by Baltazar et al. (13.9%) , who compared the information provided online on COVID-19 with the medical literature available on PubMed [22] . However, the validity of this comparison is limited by the fact that Baltazar et al. analyzed the information available online mainly in English, and because the focus of the analysis of the information in this study was not only on measures to prevent the disease [22] . In any case, our findings may be relevant to the implementation of educational campaigns, as they may allow for the correction of misinformation about COVID-19 in Spanish.Ambiguous information was also found in the message inserted by Google about COVID-19 (in particular, regarding keeping a safe distance only from people who cough or sneeze). This would show the need for Google to maintain consistency between the information it provides in that message and the prevention measures recommended by the WHO.To improve health communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, several considerations have been made; among them, fighting against false information is fundamental [37] . False content has the potential to harm the public. In March 2020, in Iran, 700 people died after ingesting alcohol to treat COVID-19 as a result of misinformation circulating online [38] . For this reason, health communicators are called to revise their strategies to respond to inaccuracies, while also picking up on early signals of rumors and prevent them from spreading further. For example, the WHO has launched an initiative called 'Mythbusters', where the WHO directly addresses misconceptions and fake information about the prevention of COVID-19 [39] .Our study has several limitations, among which are those typical of infodemiological studies, in which dynamic information, such as that available on the Internet, is evaluated. However, these types of studies are necessary, because, among other things, they provide valuable insights into the health-related behaviors of populations and allow the distribution and determinants of information on the Internet or in a population to be elucidated [20] . Another limitation, in common with other authors who have analyzed the information available on the Internet about other diseases [27, 28, [40] [41] [42] , derives from the fact that searches were carried out only on Google [27, 28, [40] [41] [42] ; however, this search engine is the most popular, covering nearly 90% of the total online searches [43] . The high number of links from Spain obtained in the second search could be due to the fact that the IP address had been identified by not having previously deleted the search history and cookies; regardless, this does not invalidate the concerns described here but rather contextualizes them better.In addition, like other studies [26, 44] , the search terms were chosen by the authors with the assumption that an Internet Spanish-speaking user would probably use one of them to perform simple searches regarding COVID-19 prevention measures. Moreover, as was the case for other authors, the search was performed from a single country's IP address [26, 44] ; this could have influenced finding weblinks mainly from the country of origin of that IP (Spain). For this reason, future research would be necessary to determine whether results similar to those of this study are obtained when the Google search is performed from IPs of other Spanish-speaking countries.The availability of information in Spanish on the Internet on basic COVID-19 prevention measures recommended by WHO has improved over time, although there is still room for improvement. In order for Spanish-speaking users to obtain high-quality information more frequently when searching for information on these preventive measures on the Internet, they should be encouraged to view the websites of official public health organizations. In this way, these websites can also improve their accessibility and positioning, since search engines determine the positioning of the weblinks produced by a search according to the frequency with which they are accessed. For future public health emergencies of international concern, information on how to prevent these diseases should be produced and spread online as quickly as possible by official public health organizations, which could help to better control the spread of the disease.

19c7a4a7eb011df40249f4c46e47451fdb55d4dd,,"2020 (1) . Si bien en el lenguaje cotidiano se usó más la palabra cuarentena, es más adecuado usar la palabra confinamiento, dado que se encerraron personas sanas (cuarentena) y personas diagnosticadas con SARS-CoV-2 (aislamiento) (2) . El confinamiento sirve para evitar la transmisión de una enfermedad infecciosa y permite ganar tiempo para mejorar la respuesta ante una epidemia; esto último implica mejoras en la vigilancia en salud pública, en la capacidad de hacer pruebas y en el número de camas hospitalarias y unidades de cuidados intensivos para el caso de la pandemia de COVID-19.En Colombia, el primer caso de SARS-CoV-2 se notificaron en Bogotá el 6 de marzo de 2020 (3) y a partir de ahí se reportaron casos en diversos lugares del país, configurándose, así, una pandemia con manifestaciones heterogéneas en las regiones. En unos lugares, después del diagnóstico del primer caso se presentó rápidamente la transmisión comunitaria, y en otros, brotes dispersos, lo que implicaba momentos diferentes de inicio del incremento de casos que fueron modificándose según las actividades propias de cada lugar y su relación con otras regiones. En general, se puede decir que hay dos hitos fundamentales para entender la pandemia en cada departamento: por un lado, está el día del primer caso diagnosticado, que es variable, y, en segundo lugar, el día de levantamiento del confinamiento nacional, es decir, el 1° de junio de 2020. Por ello, después de seis meses de pandemia hay lugares donde ya pasó el primer ""pico"", otros que están en ese ""pico"" y otros que van subiendo la pendiente hacia el ""pico"" (4) (5) (6) . Las directrices nacionales han seguido más estrechamente el comportamiento de las regiones donde más población afectada y que corresponden a la situación general del país.En un estudio previo se presentaron los resultados de la evaluación del desempeño del sistema de vigilancia en salud pública nacional durante los primeros 50 días de pandemia, pues en ese momento los datos no eran suficientes para hacer análisis regionales. El análisis se basó en el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford, que ha demostrado ser útil para este tipo de evaluaciones durante las epidemias (7-10) (Idrovo AJ, Manrique-Hernández EF, Fernández-Niño JA. COVID-19 data quality in Brazil: Between applied science and politics. En prensa). Se observó que en la mayoría de los días la calidad de los datos fue buena (11) . La acumulación de datos que ha tenido lugar en el proceso de vigilancia en salud pública durante el avance de la pandemia ha permitido la desagregación de los análisis a nivel regional.En este estudio se presentan los resultados de una evaluación comparativa del desempeño de los departamentos y la ciudad de Bogotá, con el fin de determinar los casos más exitosos, que pueden servir de modelo a los demás.Se hizo una evaluación comparativa (conocida como benchmarking) (12) del desempeño de los 32 departamentos colombianos y del distrito de Bogotá, D.C. Los datos analizados corresponden a los que el sistema oficial de vigilancia en salud pública de Colombia genera como datos abiertos, y que se encuentran disponibles en https://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/Paginas/ Coronavirus.aspx. Si bien la información pública tiene varias variables, las usadas en este análisis incluyeron los datos de los casos acumulados entre el 6 de marzo y el 1° de septiembre de 2020 (180 días) sometidos a un proceso de evaluación basado en la ley de Benford, y los datos de letalidad. La lógica subyacente a la evaluación planteada es que para tener datos de calidad se deben hacer bien todos los procesos involucrados en las labores de notificación y de búsqueda activa por los equipos de respuesta inmediata, así como el procesamiento de muestras en el laboratorio y la generación de los reportes situacionales que se divulgan a nivel nacional.En la figura 1 se resume el algoritmo usado para la evaluación. El primer paso consistió en evaluar si se cumplía la ley de Benford para los primeros dígitos de los datos acumulados para todo el periodo analizado. Si esta se cumple, se puede inferir que se trata de entidades territoriales con un buen desempeño de la calidad del dato de la vigilancia en salud pública. En este grupo se estableció luego un orden según la letalidad (razón de fallecidos por casos diagnosticados como positivos), clasificando como mejor la entidad con menor fatalidad.Cuando no se cumple la ley de Benford para el primer dígito durante todo el periodo, es posible que la contención de la epidemia se haya logrado, por lo que los casos nuevos podrían incrementarse a un ritmo mucho menor. Por ello se decidió explorar el cumplimiento de la distribución del segundo dígito de los casos acumulados hasta el 31 de mayo, último día antes de la primera apertura económica o levantamiento del confinamiento; además, se exploró el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford del primer dígito entre el 1° de junio y el 1° de septiembre.De esta manera, si se cumple la distribución en ambos casos, es posible concluir que ha habido un buen desempeño de la calidad del dato de la vigilancia en salud pública y también es posible definir un posicionamiento basado en la fatalidad.Esta ley matemática, también conocida como ""ley de Newcomb-Benford"" o ""ley de los números anómalos"" (13), plantea que, en un conjunto de números, los que ocupan las primeras posiciones siguen una distribución conocida. La distribución esperada, según la ley de Benford, arroja un 30,103 % para el uno, 17,609 % para el dos, 12,494 % para el tres, 9,691 % para el cuatro, 7,918 % para el cinco, 6,695 % para el seis, 5,799 % para el siete, 5,115 % para el ocho y 4,576 % para el nueve. Los datos empíricos han demostrado que la frecuencia en que ocurren muchas situaciones de la naturaleza es una función inversa de su tamaño, por lo que los objetos más pequeños ocurren mucho más frecuentemente que los grandes (14, 15) .Algoritmo propuesto para evaluar el desempeño de la vigilancia en salud pública de los territorios colombianos durante los primeros seis meses de la pandemia Antes del 31 de mayo Desde el 1° de junio Algo similar se ha observado para los demás dígitos, siendo más útil para fines prácticos el segundo, que permite una mayor variabilidad de los datos (16) . La distribución esperada en este caso indica un 11,968 % para el cero, seguido de 11,389 %, 10,882 %, 10,433 %, 10,031 %, 9,668 %, 9,337 %, 9,035 % y 8,757 %, para los dígitos de uno a nueve sucesivamente. En estudios previos, el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford para el segundo dígito ha servido como indicador de la calidad de los datos en las endemias (8), lo cual podría extrapolarse a las condiciones de una epidemia en condiciones de contención.Para evaluar el nivel de cumplimiento de la distribución descrita por la ley de Benford en los datos observados (casos diarios acumulados), se realizaron, en orden, los siguientes análisis: primeros dígitos de casos acumulados en todo el periodo de observación mediante la prueba de razón del logaritmo de la verosimilitud (17) . Dado que la contención real puede generar un estancamiento o un aumento muy bajo en la aparición de casos, se hizo un análisis con datos hasta el 31 de mayo usando la prueba de razón del logaritmo de la verosimilitud para los segundos dígitos. Por último, es posible que a partir de la apertura económica se iniciara un crecimiento acorde con la ley de Benford, lo que se evaluó con la prueba de ji al cuadrado (18) para analizar cada uno de los primeros dígitos de los datos posteriores al 1° de junio de manera independiente. Para ello se utilizó la macro digdis desarrollada por Ben Jann (ETH, Zurich) en el programa estadístico Stata 14™ (Stata Corporation, USA).El desempeño nacional de la calidad del dato de la vigilancia, incluidos todos los casos acumulados hasta el día 180 de la pandemia, fue adecuado (p=0,44, prueba de razón del logaritmo de la verosimilitud) y siguió la tendencia que ya se había observado (11) . La heterogeneidad de los entes territoriales se puede apreciar en el cuadro 1, en el cual se resume el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford enfocada en el primer dígito. Para hacer comparables los entes territoriales, se comenzaron a contar los días para el análisis de todos ellos a partir de aquel en que se diagnosticó el primer caso en cada territorio. Allí se puede apreciar que los entes territoriales han enfrentado la pandemia en diferentes periodos: algunos desde marzo y otros un par de meses después. Dieciséis de los entes territoriales cumplieron con la ley de Benford al inicio, lo cual sugiere un desempeño inicial adecuado en la calidad del dato, y Bogotá y el Valle del Cauca han mantenido un adecuado desempeño durante todo el periodo analizado.Dado que el 1° de junio de 2020 se decretó una flexibilización del confinamiento que buscaba reactivar la economía y ello implicaba una mayor probabilidad de transmisión del SARS-CoV-2, se analizaron los datos antes y después de esa fecha. Los resultados resumidos en el cuadro 2 sugieren que Antioquia, Nariño y Tolima tuvieron una buena contención, dado que la calidad del dato de segundos dígitos cumplieron con la distribución de Benford, y una adecuada vigilancia en salud pública después de la apertura económica iniciada el 1° de junio. Los departamentos de Cauca, Cesar, La Guajira y Norte de Santander lograron una buena calidad en los datos después de la apertura económica, pese a que antes no cumplían la ley de Benford; esto sugiere que se mejoró la vigilancia, lo cual suele ser el resultado de la preparación durante la contención. Bolívar, Cundinamarca y Sucre tuvieron una buena vigilancia en salud pública durante la contención, pero después de la apertura económica la calidad bajó, lo que sugiere que la capacidad instalada fue superada por la pandemia.

Es notorio que los departamentos con mayor letalidad son Córdoba, Norte de Santander, Magdalena, Putumayo y Atlántico, en tanto que los de menor letalidad son Vaupés, Guaviare, San Andrés y Providencia, Vichada y Risaralda. Al incorporar estos datos a los tres grupos generados con base en el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford, se obtuvo la clasificación del desempeño de la calidad del dato de la vigilancia en salud pública de los entes territoriales colombianos (cuadro 4).El presente estudio de la calidad del dato de la vigilancia en salud pública presenta los resultados hasta el 1° de septiembre del desempeño de la vigilancia en salud pública de COVID-19 en los departamentos colombianos. Lo primero que resalta es que el desempeño ha sido variado, con casos muy destacables y otros que no. El proceso de agregación ponderado por el número de casos reportados en cada ente territorial, encabezado por Bogotá y el Valle del Cauca, que suman entre los dos cerca del 38 % de los casos del total nacional, favoreció que el resultado global del desempeño nacional sea bueno. Con este efecto de la agregación de datos se puede entender que la vigilancia, como muchos temas de salud pública, conceptualmente tiene múltiples niveles que están interconectados.Análisis como el que aquí se presenta han tenido gran acogida durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Es así como varios estudios han usado la ley de Benford para detectar posibles fraudes en los datos de la pandemia (19, 20) , establecer las características comunes de los países que no cumplen la ley de Benford (21) e, incluso, usar la distribución de Benford como criterio para definir si hay ""aplanamiento"" o no de la curva epidémica (22) . En todos estos casos, los autores refieren que la objetividad del método es su mayor fortaleza.En conclusión, los hallazgos de este estudio sugieren que Antioquia, Tolima, Bogotá, Nariño y Valle del Cauca tuvieron los mejores desempeños en cuanto a la calidad de los datos en los sistemas de vigilancia en salud pública. En futuros estudios se podrá completar la evaluación revisando otros indicadores sanitarios y sociales que muestren la complejidad del manejo de la pandemia. Dado que este estudio evaluó uno de los atributos de la vigilancia en salud pública, debe complementarse con la evaluación de los otros: la sensibilidad, el valor predictivo positivo, la flexibilidad, la aceptabilidad y la simplicidad, entre otros, pero en especial, del principio de utilidad (23) . Estos hallazgos podrán contrastarse con aquellos alcanzados mediante otros indicadores, entre ellos, el número necesario de personas que deben diagnosticarse (número de pruebas por caso positivo), cuyo número mínimo aceptable es 20; el rastreo de los contactos evaluado mediante la proporción de casos relacionados con un caso previo que se detecte, y el aislamiento efectivo de los casos y contactos a partir de dicho rastreo (24) .Los autores agradecen a Edgar Fabián Manrique-Hernández por su apoyo en la recolección de datos.",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-15,11
432b48ff2a9eac584d5185a4bae6b9e2d8d29e90,Journal Pre-proofs Review Neutrophils and COVID-19: The road so far Neutrophils and COVID-19: The road so far,"The COVID-19 infection starts by exposure to microdroplets present in the exhalations of infected individuals. Then, the SARS-CoV-2 spreads to the bronchioles and alveolar spaces [25] , entrancing into the host cells (e.g., endothelial, epithelial, and smooth muscle cells) by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, a metallopeptidase present on the cell surface [26] [27] [28] [29] . In the lung, SARS-CoV-2 infects the alveolar cells (type I and II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages) and then starts intracellular replication in pulmonary tissues. Type I and III interferons (IFN) production is an early defense mechanism in the alveolar cells [25] . However, recent researchers have found deficient expression of these cytokines, besides the upregulated expression of chemokines and interleukins [30, 31] . In normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells culture, the cytokine profile includes the IFNs deficiency and elevated expression of CCL20, CXC-type chemokines, IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [31] . The type I and III IFN absence shows that, although SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN antiviral effect, the virus can inhibit its induction [31] [32] [33] [34] . This ability may come from, at least, one mechanism of blocking the activation of the IFN signaling pathway at an early step following the nuclear transport of interferon regulatory factors (IRF) [35] . Furthermore, the recruitment of leukocytes, a hallmark of inflammation, is strongly related to the chemokine profile. For example, CCL2 and CCL8 recruit monocytes/macrophages, CXCL16 is a chemoattractant of NK cells, CXCL8 is the principal neutrophil chemoattractant, and CXCL9 and CXCL10 chemoattract T cells. Thus, the chemokine profile may be a driver of the signature pathology of SARS-CoV-2 [36] .The immune features between moderate and severe disease are modified after ten days of infection when severely ill patients remain with high proinflammatory cytokines [37] . Furthermore, deregulated inflammatory response to an infection may result in the cytokine storm syndrome, which is associated with severe COVID-19 [38, 39] . This syndrome is characterized by high levels of interleukins, TNF-α, G-CSF, MCP-1, and MIP-1α, which are higher in intensive care unit patients than non-intensive care unit patients [37, 40, 41] . Additionally, the inflammasome NLRP3, a multiprotein complex crucial to the host defense, is highly activated in COVID-19 patients. Inflammasome-induced cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 also contribute to cytokine storm, and sustained NLRP3 inflammasome activation is directly associated with the disease's severity [42] [43] [44] . The cytokines milieu recruits immune cells and activate T helper type 1 (Th1) response, which is related to the activation of a specific immune response. Moreover, Th1 cells stimulate IL-6 production by inflammatory monocytes in severe COVID-19 and contribute to the cytokine storm [45] . However, Th2 cytokines are also presented in COVID-19 serum patients and may impair the Th1inflammatory response [40] . Thereby, chemokines/cytokines milieu comprises a possible therapeutic target for COVID-19 [46] . Peripheral blood immune cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients present low T cell number and frequency in both CD4 + and CD8 + populations, which are more activated. On the order hand, monocytes are increased, but they present a reduction in HLA-DR expression compared with the control group (non-infected) [37] . Additionally, in severe COVID-19, patients present a reduced number of B cells and natural killer (NK) cells associated with severe T cell depletion, and a high neutrophil population [37, 40, [47] [48] [49] . This neutrophilia occurs after seven days symptoms onset [50] .Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cells in human blood. They account for approximately 50 -70% of all leukocytes. Besides serving as first responders to many infections, neutrophils have critical homeostatic functions being also implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases [51] . These polymorphonuclear cells play a protective role during bacterial or fungal infections; however, their role in viral infections is not fully understood [52, 53] . Although the evidence is limited, it has been suggested that neutrophils enhance antiviral defenses by interaction with other immune cell populations, virus internalization and killing mechanism, cytokines release, degranulation, oxidative burst, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [53, 54] . Neutrophils are present in many lung diseases associated with ARDS, as reported in infections by influenza virus and SARS-CoV-1 [55] . A bioinformatic study presented data indicating that neutrophil activation and degranulation are highly activated processes in the SARS infection [56] . Recently, the recruitment of this polymorphonuclear (PMN) was observed in the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutrophilia has been described as an indicator of severe respiratory symptoms and a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 [57] [58] [59] . Several studies have reported that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a clinical inflammation biomarker, is increased and predicts severe illness in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection [59] [60] [61] [62] . Higher D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels follow NLR's increase in these patients [63, 64] . Also, increased NLR has been considered an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients [41, 65, 66] , related to some comorbidities (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular disease) [67] . A study observed that COVID-19 diabetes patients with higher NLR had heavier severity and more extended hospital stay [68] . This fact supports the idea that pre-existing chronic inflammation contributes to COVID-19 severity [65, 69] . In addition to the NLR, neutrophil to CD4 + lymphocyte ratio (NCD4LR) has been associated with the negative conversion time (NCT) of SARS-CoV-2. A study found that high NCD4LR indicates worse immune function and prolonged virus clearance [70] . Another biomarker involving this PMN, the neutrophil count to albumin ratio (NAR), has been described as a new predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients [71] . Therefore, the NCD4LR and NAR values also could be used as clinical markers for COVID-19 progression in addition to the NLR [41] .Besides, the increase of neutrophils is not reported only in the bloodstream but also in the lungs [72] . PMN infiltration in pulmonary capillaries with extravasation to alveolar space and neutrophilic mucositis was observed in lung autopsies obtained from patients who died from COVID-19, indicating inflammation in the entire lower respiratory tract [73, 74] . Moreover, immature phenotype and/or dysfunctional mature neutrophils have been described in severe COVID-19 patients [75, 76] . These studies indicate that the increased infiltration of immature and/or dysfunctional neutrophil contributes to the imbalance of the lungs' immune response in severe cases. Respiratory epithelium infection by SARS-CoV-2 leads to cell secretion of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and DAMPs, as previously described [31, 77] . Transcriptional analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients reported high levels of CXCL-2 and CXCL-8, chemokines that facilitate the PMN recruitment to the site of infection [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] . Although the neutrophils could present a protective role, extensive and prolonged activation of these leukocytes can lead to detrimental effects in the lungs and result in pneumonia and/or ARDS [83, 84] . Wang and colleagues [50] also demonstrated that neutrophilia coincides with lung injury in severe COVID-19 patients. It has been described that neutrophils play a pivotal role in the development of ARDS caused by influenza infection [55] . In COVID-19, neutrophils accumulation generates toxic molecules that might contribute to ARDS's physiopathology [85] . Respiratory burst from activated neutrophils induces ROS release, such as superoxide radicals and H 2 O 2 , leading to oxidative stress that contributes to the cytokine storm and blood clots formation in SARS-CoV-2 infection [86, 87] . Moreover, decreased expression of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) in the lung tissue of old patients with COVID-19 was also reported [88] . Therefore, excessive oxidative stress induced by PMN infiltration is related to the alveolar damage, thrombosis, and severity in COVID-19 [87] . In addition to ROS formation, neutrophil elastase has been implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis [89] [90] [91] . This proteolytic enzyme, which is stored in azurophil granules, is secreted to degrade antigens. Nevertheless, an imbalance of the elastase and other proteinases induces damage in the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in tissue injury and edema formation [92] . Furthermore, persistently activated neutrophils contribute to maintaining the inflammatory state in the lungs by cytokine release, as observed in MERS and SARS-CoV-1 infections [93] . Similar findings were described in SARS-CoV-2 infection by Parackova and colleagues [76] that reported the neutrophils as drivers of hyperinflammation by enhanced degranulation of primary granules and pro-inflammatory cytokines release. Taken together, these molecules secreted by PMN can cause severe damage in alveolar tissue, independently of the virus cytopathic effect. Additionally, Meizlish and colleagues [94] identified neutrophil activators (IL-8 and G-CSF) and effectors (resistin, lipocalin-2, and hepatocyte growth factor) as early biomarkers of severe COVID-19 patients. The authors also demonstrated a positive association between high levels in immature granulocytes and neutrophil counts with increased mortality [94] . These data highlight the neutrophil role in the severity of COVID-19 disease. Viral infection can also induce the release of neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) by neutrophils [95] . The NETs mechanism was first described by Brinkmann and colleagues in 2004 [96] . These traps consist of chromatin fibers associated with enzymes such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and myeloperoxidase [97, 98] . NETs are known to immobilize and degrade bacteria, fungi, viruses, being a critical effector mechanism to contain infections [99] . However, NETs can act as a double-edged sword of immunity [98] , having a pro-or anti-inflammatory effect [100, 101] . Schauer and colleagues [102] reported that an aggregate of NETs can degrade cytokines and chemokines, reducing inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect has also been demonstrated in the ocular microenvironment [103] . On the other hand, NETs can promote tissue damage, having already been shown that NETs and platelets' interaction can cause endothelial damage in infections by Escherichia coli [104] . NETs can also participate in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, where elevated levels of NETs have been seen in serum and synovial fluid, respectively, in patients with these diseases [105, 106] . Studies have been reported an elevated level of NETs in patients with COVID-19 [107] [108] [109] , and an increased plasma NETs is correlated with increased COVID-19 severity [109] , besides contributing to lung injury and microvascular thrombosis [107] . The vascular occlusion caused by NETs is not only reported in lung tissue [110] but also in kidney and liver [111] , which suggests that NETs thrombotic effects may be related to systemic and harmful effects of COVID-19. This relationship between NETs and thrombosis may also be related to complement system activation. Indeed, C3 [112] and C5 [113] inhibition dampen NET release in COVID-19 patients., Since coagulation disorders are a worse prognosis to COVID-19 [114] [115] [116] , and both NETs and complement proteins are associated with these thrombotic events [113] , therapies that focus on this triple complement-NETs-coagulation axis may be a therapeutic opportunity. At the transcriptional level, Wang and collaborators [50] demonstrated activation of several NETs-associated in COVID-19 patients. They hypothesized that some of them could be related to negative regulation of NK and T cell, dampening antiviral response [50] . In severe COVID-19, Veras and colleagues [109] demonstrated that neutrophils, both circulating and lunginfiltrating, release high levels of NETs. The authors also present data that demonstrate a NETs release directly induced by SARS-CoV-2 [117] . This SARS-CoV-2-induced NETs release is PAD-4-dependent [109] . PAD4 is critical to NET formation because it promotes a process of hypercitrulination of histones, resulting in chromatin decondensation [118] . The SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils can also induce apoptosis in lung epithelial (A549 cells), reinforcing neutrophil role in COVID-19 immunopathology and other coronavirus infections [109] .The literature related to neutrophil and COVID-19 so far demonstrated a crucial role of these polymorphonuclear cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Fig. 1) . Despite the immune system modulation needs being tightly controlled to avoid immunosuppression, the different neutrophil mechanisms (e.g., neutrophils enzymes and cytokines, NETs) are potential targets to treat COVID-19, mainly the severe cases. (4) immunothrombosis. These many steps may be a therapeutic target. Several other cells and mediators are involved in COVID-19 immunopathology, but they are suppressed in this figure to highlight the neutrophil role.

23f85db92d56e32f184ef1a815c23bf321180f6b,Point-of-care lung ultrasound imaging in pediatric COVID-19,"Since its initial identification in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected millions of people and has led to thousands of deaths worldwide as of July 2020 [1]. Although reports from adults suggest that this disease can have a more severe course in as many as 18.5% of infected people, in children it seems to be milder with an estimated incidence of severe cases of 4-6% and a lower case-fatality ratio reported [1] [2] [3] . Previous studies regarding the clinical aspects of COVID-19 in children described symptoms that followed a similar pattern as in adults [3] , but recent reports have identified an emerging novel spectrum of the disease in children, which includes a multisystem inflammatory condition with overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome [4] . Up to now, the absolute number of those cases with prominent cardiovascular compromise is still low and respiratory symptoms remains the main reason for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admissions for COVID-19 [5] .Efforts have been made to create guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 in children [6, 7] . Of particular concern is which imaging modality is most suitable to assess the extension of lung involvement. Historically, chest radiograph has been the imaging modality of choice for most lower respiratory illnesses in children, but data from adult studies have shown that for COVID-19 it is of limited value and is not recommended as the first choice for imaging modalities [8] . Often, only the severe cases show abnormalities on chest radiographs [6] . In earlier stages of the infection, it frequently fails to show the typical features of COVID-19 that are found with chest computed tomography (CT) [9, 10] .Chest CT is undoubtedly the best imaging modality to accurately assess lung involvement in most respiratory illnesses including COVID-19, but the cost and possible harmful effects that radiation can have on a growing child's body must not be ignored, as even low-dose ionizing radiations may increase cancer risk in exposed children [11] .Lung ultrasound (US) is an ionizing radiation-free imaging modality that promptly provides bedside diagnosis of many pulmonary conditions in the emergency department. It has been reported to be highly accurate and reliable in diagnosing pneumonia, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax [12] [13] [14] . In patients who are mechanically ventilated, lung US enables clinicians to monitor lung aeration and its variations. It has been found that different US patterns correspond to different degrees of aeration loss, which led to the creation of a score that was subsequently validated to quantify lung aeration as a whole or in a given area of interest [15] . Compared to chest CT as the gold standard, the aforementioned lung US score has been useful in monitoring aeration in the settings of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia [16, 17] .Given the already widely acknowledged usefulness of lung US to detect several lung pathologies in acutely ill patients and its ability to estimate lung aeration, we decided to incorporate this imaging modality into our Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) observation unit as part of the routine evaluation of children admitted with confirmed COVID-19. In this study, we describe the lung US findings in these patients with COVID-19 and correlate it with clinical severity.This study included 0-16-year-old patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to two academic hospitals in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, between April 19 and June 18, 2020. The participating hospitals included one secondary care center and one tertiary care center, both from the University of Sao Paulo. The latter participating hospital has become a reference for the management of moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 in the state of Sao Paulo.A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive result on the RT-PCR assay of a specimen collected from a nasopharyngeal swab or a positive IgG and IgM antibodies specific for SARS-Cov-2, titled using the viral nucleoprotein as the antigen in an ELISA test in-house.Point-of-care lung US is part of the routine evaluation carried out for children with respiratory illnesses in the PED of these institutions and is present on the evaluation flowchart of COVID-19 children as an option for an imaging assessment. When a patient had confirmed COVID-19, lung US was performed regardless of the symptoms reported. Patients with chronic lung disease or lung metastasis who had undergone a lung US were not included in this study. Patients with other chronic diseases or cancer without lung metastasis were not excluded.We collected data on age, sex, clinical symptoms, and signs at presentation, coexisting or chronic conditions, laboratory and radiologic results, and the support needed during hospital admission. Patients were classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical according to a clinical definition suggested by Qiu et al. [18] Laboratory and other imaging tests that were also performed, including chest radiograph and chest CT were requested based on each institution's guidelines and at the discretion of the treating physician.Point-of-care lung ultrasound. It was performed by one of the five trained Pediatric Emergency (PEM) Physicians with more than 100 lung scans performed, using B-mode imaging, basic preset, adjusting depth, and 2D-gain according to each patient biotype. A high-frequency linear transducer (15 MHz) was used and the technique was similar to that described by Copetti and Catarossi [19] in which all intercostal spaces of the upper and lower parts of the anterior, lateral, and posterior regions of the left and right chest are examined, making a total of 12 regions. To describe the findings and to calculate the lung US aeration score, the worst US finding was considered in each examined region. To evaluate interobserver reproducibility, images of 25 patients enrolled were reviewed and scored by a different PEM of the team, who was blinded to the clinical information.Four validated US patterns were defined and a score given for each: [16, 17] (1) normal aeration: presence of lung sliding and artifactual horizontal A-lines (0 points);(2) loss of lung aeration resulting from the scattered foci of bronchopneumonia or interstitial syndrome: presence of multiple well-defined vertical B-lines extending from the pleural line or a small subpleural consolidation (1 point); (3) loss of lung aeration resulting from alveolarinterstitial edema that corresponds to the CT imaging entity of the ground-glass: multiple confluent vertical B-lines extending from the pleural line or a small subpleural consolidation (2 points); (4) lung consolidation characterizing extensive bronchopneumonia: presence of a tissue structure containing hyperechoic punctiform images representative of air bronchograms (3 points). A global lung US aeration score ranging from 0 to 36 was obtained by summing the individual scores of all the regions.All medical investigation procedures described were conducted as part of the standard clinical care. This research was part of a longitudinal study approved by the local ethics board.The baseline patient characteristics were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies for qualitative variables and as median, minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H-test was applied to compare the lung US scores in relation to severity classification. In addition, we performed a post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni multiple comparison procedure. Interobserver agreements in lung aeration score determined for each region of interest were assessed using the kappa coefficient test. The significance level was fixed at 5% for all the tests. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R software version 3.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).From April 19 to June 18, 2020, 34 admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19 had a lung US performed and were included in the study. During this period, a total of 51 pediatric patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were admitted. Lung US was performed depending on the availability of a skilled PEM physician in the PED observation unit or PICU. Of these 34 patients that were scanned, 33 had a positive RT-PCR assay and one had positive serology in a context of clinical suspicion. A summary of the clinical features is detailed in Table 1 . The mean duration of symptoms in days before lung US was performed was 3.74 ± 1.76 and median 3 (range 1-8). The most common symptom was fever, followed by cough and shortness of breath. Five patients had critical disease (15%) and required respiratory and hemodynamic support. Three were classified as severe (9%), eight (23%) as moderate, and the remaining presented with mild disease (53%) but were admitted due to underlying chronic conditions or their young age.The critical/severe group was composed of eight children, all of them with prominent respiratory disease. Seven out of these eight patients had echocardiography performed by a cardiologist or a focused cardiac exam performed by an intensive care physician. Systolic dysfunction was initially found in only two patients who also had consolidations on lung US and CT. The remaining five had a normal biventricular systolic function at the time of lung US, but three of them later developed shock probably due to worsening disease and elevated pressures on mechanical ventilation. Three critical patients have died. One due to cardiac failure and two due to ARDS.Baseline medical conditions were common in our population and were present in 18 patients (53%); eight of them with cancer (8/18-44%), the remaining patients had chronic liver, kidney or neurologic/genetic disease. D-Dimer, a severity marker, was collected in 20/34 (59%) patients with a median of 2250.5 (190-54,153); 17 of them (17/20-85%) had elevated values, although symptoms were mild in seven out of these 17 (41%).Lung US abnormalities were found in 18 (53%) patients and these findings are described in Table 2 . Of the 18 patients with lung US abnormalities, eight had severe/ critical disease (44%), five had moderate disease (28%) and five (28%) had mild disease. All the patients with lung US abnormalities but who had a mild disease were previously healthy infants under 6 months of age (mean 1.24 ± 0.89), with fever and mild respiratory symptoms.Three of them were also tested for other 17 viruses, with negative results. Their median lung US aeration score was 12 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) .Seventeen (17/18-94%) patients had confluent vertical B-lines on at least one posterior region; this pattern was found bilaterally in the posterior lung fields in 9/18 (50%) patients. Six out of 18 (33%) patients also had lung consolidations > 0.5 cm. Each patient's lung US aeration scores are depicted in Table 2 . Mean lung US scores for severe/critical, moderate and mild cases were 16.75 ± 8.16, 5.25 ± 5.55 and 2.78 ± 5.36, respectively. When multiple comparisons were made, only mild versus severe/critical met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). Interobserver agreement was good, as attested by kappa coefficient of 0.71 (p < 0.001).Chest radiograph was obtained in 25/34 patients (73%); only six with severe/critical disease and one with moderate disease showed pulmonary opacities; the remaining 18 were declared to be normal by the treating physician. Eight patients with lung abnormalities on lung US had a normal chest radiograph, but no patients with normal lung US had abnormalities on the chest radiograph.Chest CT was performed in 12 patients (12/34-35%). Ten had abnormalities and two were normal. The most common feature was bilateral ground-glass opacities. After being carefully reviewed by two experienced radiologists, both findings and topography of the abnormalities on lung US were found to be similar to those of CT. More details on the CT findings and the corresponding lung US findings are described in Table 2 . The time that elapsed from lung US and chest CT was less than 24 h for eight patients and more than 24 h for four patients; one of these four patients was unstable and could not be transported to the radiology suite earlier. Figures 1, 2 and 3 and Additional file 1: Figure S1 ) show images from four cases in which lung US had provided information on lung injury due to COVID-19.Since the first reports on COVID-19 pneumonia, emphasis has been given to the role and impact of thoracic imaging for accurate assessment of lung compromise and timely detection of complications. Chest CT has gained an important role in this setting, because chest radiograph is of limited value for COVID-19 diagnosis, with a reported sensitivity of only 69% [95% CI 56-80%] [20] . Lung US has an already established accuracy and reliability in diagnosing many lung pathologies, but up to now, only few studies have been published on its applicability in COVID-19. For pneumonia and ARDS, it is an excellent method of diagnosis and monitoring and has been found to detect lesions not seen on the chest radiograph, especially those localized in the retro-cardiac or juxtadiaphragmatic region [21] [22] [23] . Preliminary lung US studies on adult patients with COVID-19 identified numerous B-lines and subpleural pulmonary consolidations in an asymmetric multilobar distribution, involving mainly the lower lobes. What seems to be characteristic of COVID-19 in a positive epidemiological context is the bilateral patchy distribution of multiform clusters alternating with spared areas. Those findings were highly consistent with the findings on CT [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . The first few case reports and case series published in children with COVID-19 showed lung US findings similar to what was described in adults [30] [31] [32] .Our findings are in accordance with previous small pediatric reports and adult studies and we also found an apparently good consistency between lung US and CT in terms of findings and topography. Confluent B-lines were later seen as consolidations on a chest CT performed the following day only in two specific zones. We cannot say whether it was a misdiagnosis or an early sonographic identification of organizing pneumonia. This could be clarified only by a study aiming to compare lung US and CT when both are performed simultaneously. Even though some comparisons were made between CT and lung US, this study was not designed to pair up these imaging modalities due to ethical concerns about unnecessarily exposing children to ionizing radiation.As far as we know, our study was the first in pediatric COVID-19 population to analyze lung US aeration scores. Most of our patients that classified as moderate and severe/critical, had major abnormalities on lung US, and consequently higher lung US aeration scores. Due to the small sample size, we do not have statistical power to confirm the lung US aeration score as a disease severity predictor, but this preliminary result is an important finding that suggests that this score might be an additional tool to help clinicians in risk stratification and resource allocation. Two patients with moderate disease and normal US had an obstructive airway disease reversed with corticosteroids and bronchodilators.Despite the apparent good association with disease severity, five of our children had significant lung US abnormalities, elevated scores, but few or no respiratory symptoms. All of them were under 6 months of age and four also had elevated D-dimers, which is believed to be a severity marker of disease in adult patients [33] . One of them, a 2 week-old newborn with fever, also had a chest CT that confirmed lung involvement. The reason why these young infants with confirmed lung involvement on imaging and elevated D-dimer have such a mild disease is yet to be clarified as many other clinical aspects of COVID-19 in children. There are several reasons why we believe lung US may be a promising tool in COVID-19, especially in the pediatric population. First, although other viruses such as the respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus cause pneumonia lesions that are mostly distributed along the bronchial tree, studies addressing CT findings in children with COVID-19 showed that the periphery of the lung in the subpleural region is the most commonly affected area [34, 35] . Of 43 patients with CT abnormalities due to COVID-19 reported by Ma et al. [3] , 95% had a predominance of lesions in the subpleural area and in the lower lung lobes (65%), especially in the posterior segment (78%). Given that the subpleural area seems to be the target for COVID-19, lung US may assume a key role in the early detection of these lung involvements as it easily identifies infections extending to the visceral pleura [16] . Second, chest CT should be followed by complex decontamination procedures and requires transporting sometimes critically ill patients to the radiology suite, while lung US can be performed at the bedside and given its smaller size, would be easier to decontaminate [35] . Of note, two of our critically ill patients were too unstable to leave the PICU and initial lung imaging assessments were made by lung US. Third, while US is radiation-free, CT scan exposes pediatric patients to harmful ionizing radiation during a time at which they are believed to be most at risk of harm [11] .Limitations of this imaging modality still exist, including an inability to visualize centrally located consolidation, inability to differentiate consolidation from atelectasis, and possibly some degree of overdiagnosis, as US can detect even small consolidations of unlikely significance [36] [37] [38] . Moreover, the aforementioned assumption from adult studies that lung US in COVID-19 may have characteristic features has not yet been extrapolated to children, as they more frequently have lower respiratory tract disease caused by a variety of viruses that may have a similar pattern. Further studies are needed to better understand this.Our study also has some limitations. It is a descriptive study with a small number of patients included; however, given the scarcity of available data on lung US findings in COVID-19 pediatric patients, the information provided by our study is relevant and may provide a better understanding of this topic. Sonographers were not blinded to clinical information, because lung US assessment is performed on a regular basis as an extension of the physical examination in our institution. Also, even though the lung US score applied in our patients have been used in many lung pathologies, it is not specific to COVID-19 lung disease as the one proposed by Soldati et al. [39] . Lastly, we could not reliably compare lung US with the gold standard chest CT, since not all patients had both exams or had them performed at the same time. Despite these limitations, as far as we know our study on pointof-care lung US findings in children with COVID-19 is the first to include a more extensive number of pediatric patients. We believe our report adds important information regarding the utility of lung US in pediatric population with COVID-19.Point-of-care lung US is a reliable tool that is capable of accurately diagnosing and monitoring many pulmonary conditions. Our study shows that it might also have a key role in children affected by COVID-19, providing early and reliable identification of pulmonary involvement. It performs better than chest radiograph and seems to have a good correlation with chest CT, although further studies are needed to confirm this. Integrated with clinical evaluation, lung US allows a better and rapid characterization of the disease, without ionizing radiation exposure.",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-30,11

In contexts of biological disasters, fear, uncertainty, and stigmatisation are common and can act as barriers to appropriate medical and mental health interventions (Xiang et al. 2020a) . Doubtful or even false information about the factors related to the transmission of the virus, the incubation period, its geographical reach, the number of infected, and the actual mortality rate led to insecurity and fear in the population (Ornell et al. 2020 ). In addition, the fear of COVID-19 was considered a predictor of positive behaviour change (for example, social distance, better hand hygiene) and was related to decreased physical and environmental well-being (Harper et al. 2020) .Ethologists define fear as an emotional response triggered by specific ""real"", ""external"", ""known"", or ""objective"" stimuli, which give rise to defensive or escape behaviours, whereas anxiety can be understood as a response to a widespread threat, to an unknown threat, or to an internal conflict; thus, it presents the basic aspect of uncertainty (Steimer 2002; Strongman 1996) . Therefore, anxiety can be characterised as a state of helplessness due to the perception of the inability to predict, control, or obtain desired results in certain personally important situations or contexts-it concerns a feeling of uncontrollability focused mainly on possible future threats or dangers or other potentially negative events to come, in contrast to fear, which occurs when danger is present or imminent, when people are directly threatened by a dangerous event, representing an alarm that mobilises them physically and cognitively for quick actions and, sometimes, superhuman efforts (Barlow 2000) . Fear is a fundamental defence mechanism for survival and involves several biological processes to prepare for a response to potentially threatening events. (Ornell et al. 2020) .One psychological aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is fear, and it is important to access it, so prevention and education programs can be developed according to socio-demographic groups . Based on this, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale was developed by Ahorsu et al. (2020) in order to complement clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treatment of COVID-19 cases. This instrument can help researchers to assess the level of fear among populations during the COVID-19 pandemic . The sample consisted of 717 Iranian participants, with a mean age equivalent to 31.25 years (SD = 12.68), with more than half declaring themselves to be male (n = 416; 58%) (Ahorsu et al. 2020) . The final scale consisted of seven items with factorial loads ranging from 0.66 to 0.74, and the communalities were from 0.38 to 0.55, with an average explained variance of 51% and Cronbach's alpha (α) of 0.82 (Ahorsu et al. 2020) . Bitan et al. (2020) evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of FCV-19S, applying it to 649 participants, of which 84.5% (n = 540) declared themselves to be female, 30.5% (n = 195) were 30 years old or less, 33.2% (n = 212) were between 31 and 40 years old, and 36.3% (n = 231) were 41 years old or more. The authors performed an exploratory factor analysis using varimax rotation, resulting in a unidimensional instrument, whose factor loads varied from 0.57 to 0.82, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.86, explaining 53.71% of the total variance (Bitan et al. 2020) . Reznik et al. (2020) performed an adaptation of the scale, using the translation and backtranslation method, and applied it to 850 participants from two Eastern European countries: Russia (n = 574; 67.5%) and Belarus (n = 276; 32.5%), with 73.2% (n = 622) declaring themselves to be female, with an average age of 34.8 years (SD = 13). The instrument had a satisfactory measure of internal consistency (α = 0.809) and, after analysis of main components and varimax rotation, the factorial loads of the items varied from 0.569 to 0.841, resulting in two factors: physiological responses to COVID-19 (items 3, 6, and 7) and emotional responses to COVID-19 (items 1, 2, 4, and 5), responsible for about 51% and 47%, respectively, of the variance of the total data (Reznik et al. 2020) ,In Italy, the instrument was adapted and applied by Soraci et al. (2020) in 249 Italian participants, 92% (n = 229) of whom declared themselves to be female, with an average age of 34.5 years (SD = 12.21). This version also showed satisfactory internal consistency (α = 0.871), with factorial loads of items ranging from 0.688 to 0.897, resulting in a unidimensional scale (Soraci et al. 2020) . In Turkey, Satici et al. (2020) adapted and applied the scale to a sample of 1304 participants, 70.3% (n = 917) of whom declared themselves to be female, with an average age of 29.47 (SD = 10.54). The factorial loads of this Turkish version were significant, ranging from 0.484 to 0.723, resulting in a unidimensional scale with satisfactory Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.847), confirming the instrument's internal consistency (Satici et al. 2020) . In Bangladesh, Sakib et al. (2020) adapted the scale and applied it to 8550 participants, of which 56% (n = 4790) declared themselves to be male, with an average age of 26.53 years (SD = 9.09), resulting in a unidimensional scale, with factor loads that ranged from 0.72 to 0.80, and satisfactory internal consistency (α = 0.871) (Sakib et al. 2020) . The Arabic version of FCV-19S was applied to 639 participants from Saudi Arabia, with 57.9% (n = 370) identifying themselves as male, with an average age of 34.75 years (SD = 11.80), whose results corroborated the previous ones, presenting satisfactory internal consistency (α = 0.88) and factorial loads that varied from 0.62 to 0.84 (Alyami et al. 2020) . The Greek version of FCV-19S was applied to 2970 Greek participants, of which 72.5% (n = 2153) declared themselves to be female, with 52% of the total sample belonging to the age group of 18 to 30 years, corroborating the previous results (α = 0.87) and satisfactory factor loads in the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (from 0.45 to 0.92) (Tsipropoulou et al. 2020) .However, there is still no study adapting and validating the Fear of COVID-19 Scale for Brazil. Therefore, in order to fill this gap and complement previous results, this study had two main objectives: (1) to adapt and validate this instrument for the Portuguese language, in the Brazilian context, ascertaining the psychometric properties for this population, and (2) to analyse the factorial structure of the instrument. Comrey (1988) suggests that a sample size of 200 participants is reasonably good for common factor analytical work with 40 or fewer variables. Clarke and Watson (1995) and Guadagnoli and Velicer (1988) recommend a sample size of at least 300 participants. Based on this, a total of 354 Brazilian participants who volunteered by the snowball sampling method were included in this study, with 59.9% from the state of São Paulo, 4.8% from Paraná, 4.2% from Santa Catarina, 2.3% from Rio Grande do Sul, and 28.8% from Brazilian locations not informed. The sample consisted of people of both sexes (54% declared themselves to be female, n = 191; 46% declared to be male, n = 163), with an average age of 34.96 years (SD = 7.388), which ranged from 22 to 67 years; 46% (n = 163) had a postgraduate degree, and 45.5% (n = 161) had a university-level degree; 63% (n = 223) were married or in a stable relationship; 33.9% were in analyst positions; 31.9% were salespeople, consultants, or traders; 19.8% were in leadership positions; the current average length of service was 5.59 years (SD = 5.686), ranging from 0 (less than a year) to 30 years, with 20.6% working less than a year in that workplace, 13.6% working 2 years, and 9.6% working 1 year-58.8% totalled people who had less than 6 years of service in their current job.In this study, the socio-demographic questionnaire and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were administered.Socio-demographic Questionnaire This is developed by the authors in order to ascertain socio-demographic data, such as sex, age, educational level, location, position in the company, and length of service in the current job, for example.Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) This is developed by Ahorsu et al. (2020) and applied to 717 Iranian participants (α = 0.82); this is a unidimensional instrument composed of 7 statements about symptoms of fear in relation to COVID-19, which must be evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 5, in which 1 is ""strongly disagree"", 2 is ""disagree"", 3 is ""neither agree nor disagree"", 4 is ""agree"", and 5 is ""strongly agree""; the total score is calculated by adding the score for each item, ranging from 7 to 35, and the higher the score, the greater the fear of COVID-19 (Ahorsu et al. 2020) .This study was approved by the National Research Ethics Commission of Brazil (CAAE 31003620.0.0000.5407) and occurred according to guidelines on the cross-cultural adaptation process proposed by Herdman et al. (1998) and by Beaton et al. (2000) : translation of the items from the source language (English) into the target language (Portuguese) by a pair of independent bilinguals (T1 and T2); synthesis of translations; back-translation from the target language (Portuguese) to the source language (English), made by four independent bilinguals (BT1, BT2, BT3, and BT4); semantic validation by two independent experts and a final consensus; and data collection through the experimental application of the scale and the sociodemographic questionnaire in volunteers, after reading and accepting the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). The instruments were computerised through the Google Forms platform, and the application was made individually online. The link to answer it was sent to companies that forwarded it to employees. Approximately 600 workers received the link, as informed by the companies, and 354 responses were returned, so the adherence rate was close to 59%. Therefore, the sample was defined by snowball sampling. The participant's confidentiality and anonymity was guaranteed.The adequacy of the data to the assumptions of the factor analysis was calculated using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's sphericity tests. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed in order to verify the instrument's structure after cultural adaptation, as well as the calculation of Cronbach's alpha (precision indexes) to ascertain its internal consistency. The maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the parameters in the EFA, after verification and ratification of the normality of the data distribution. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed in order to confirm the structure of the instrument. The model fit was examined using fit indices, such as the goodness of fit index (GFI), chi-squared test (χ 2 ), degrees of freedom (df), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), confirmatory fit index (CFI), normed fit index (NFI), and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI). A good model should have the following characteristics: GFI and CFI > 0.90, NFI and TLI > 0.95, and RMSEA < 0.08 (Hair et al. 2013 ). All analyses were conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics and IBM SPSS Amos programs.The Brazilian version of the FCV-19S was translated as ""Escala de Medo da COVID-19"". The averages of responses and standard deviations for each of the seven items that made up the scale, after application to the 354 participants, are described in Table 1 . The average sum of all items was 15.76 (SD = 6.216; 95% CI = 15.11-16.41; skewness = 0.814; kurtosis = 0.226). Distributions with skewness and kurtosis between the ± 2 range were considered normal (Winter et al. 2020) .EFA were performed using the maximum likelihood extraction method. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) sampling adequacy test resulted in 0.881, and Bartlett's sphericity test was significant (χ 2 = 1260.333, df = 21, p < 0.001). All diagonal values of the anti-imaging test were greater than 0.50, and the commonality of the items ranged from 0.421 to 0.667 (Table 1 ). The Brazilian FCV-19S appeared to have a unidimensional structure. The unifactorial instrument showed a total explained variance of 53.66%, with factorial loads ranging from 0.649 to 0.817 (Table 1 ) and a significant adjustment quality test (χ 2 = 122.946, df = 14, p < 0.001). Since it is a measure whose structure was composed of a single factor (unidimensional), the solution cannot be rotated. Cronbach's alpha (precision index) was 0.883, confirming the instrument's internal consistency.CFA was performed to confirm the structure of the Brazilian FCV-19S. Two unidimensional models with the seven items were tested. In model 1, there were no correlated error variances, resulting in acceptable indices, with the exception of RMSEA, which presented a value above 0.08 (GFI = 0.900; CFI 0.912; NFI = 0.902; TLI = 0.868; RMSEA = 0.149 [90% CI: 0.126; 0.174]). The modification indices suggested the presence of notable error covariance within the cluster of item 1 (""I am most afraid of coronavirus-19""), item 2 (""It makes me uncomfortable to think about coronavirus-19""), and item 5 (""When watching news and stories about coronavirus-19 on social media, I become nervous or anxious"") and item 1 and item 4 (""I am afraid of losing my life because of coronavirus-19"") ( Fig. 1) . These four items (1, 2, 4, and 5) correspond to emotional responses to COVID-19, according to the results of Reznik et al. (2020) . So, in model 2 (Fig. 1) , when the error variances of these items were correlated, RMSEA decreased substantially, resulting in good indices (GFI = 0.982; CFI 0.990; NFI = 0.983; TLI = 0.979; RMSEA = 0.059 [90% CI: 0.025; 0.092]), with high factor loads (range 0.57 to 0.86), confirming the psychometric performance of the scale and the instrument's structure.The current study presented the adaptation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and its validation for the Brazilian context (Appendix). The version was translated as ""Escala de Medo da COVID-19"" and maintained the robustness of the psychometric properties, with good scores in the EFA, in the calculation of Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.88), satisfactory indexes of adjustments of the model in the CFA, and good factorial loads of the items (range 0.57 to 0.86).In effect, the present study achieved the two main objectives: (1) adaptation and validation of the Brazilian version of the scale and (2) confirmation of the instrument structure, corroborating and complementing previous studies (Ahorsu et al. 2020; Alyami et al. 2020; Bitan et al. 2020; Reznik et al. 2020; Sakib et al. 2020; Satici et al. 2020; Soraci et al. 2020; Tsipropoulou et al. 2020; Winter et al. 2020) . We conclude, therefore, that this instrument is considered appropriate for application in the current context, which may contribute substantially to help with diagnoses and treatments aimed at the mental health of the Brazilian This study has theoretical and practical implications. With regard to theoretical contributions, the instrument was adapted and validated for the Brazilian context, which can be applied in research on the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Appendix). Also, it has practical clinical implications; thus, mental health professionals can use this instrument to complement diagnoses and develop more effective conducts for the prevention and treatment of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic context of COVID-19.Finally, a practical social implication needs to be considered and analysed carefully. Outbreaks of infectious diseases can cause fear of contracting them and, therefore, contaminate other people, as has happened in the past, during the SARS and MERS epidemics, for example. Some of the effects of fear of an infectious disease are discrimination, isolation, and stigmatisation. As the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, a wave of fear and worry in the society has arisen, and several communities seem to develop a new by-product of discrimination, that is, mutual discrimination within the Asian/Chinese societies (Lin 2020), for example. Therefore, this study points out that, in addition to the preventive/protective guidelines and methods released by public health authorities, it is essential that companies, institutions, public entities, governments, health professionals, and the general population promote actions aimed at combating discrimination and stigmatisation of people confirmed with the disease or with suspicion or of specific groups in which there was a large concentration of cases. For this reason, it is important to develop programs that can combat the misinformation, stigma, and fear of COVID-19 (Lin 2020) . Moreover, people with exacerbated fear may develop distorted perceptions about the real risks of the disease, overburdening health services or causing stocking behaviours, creating a lack of certain products for those in need. These social consequences that the fear of COVID-19 can cause should not be ignored and neglected, and this instrument can help to measure it.This study outlines the Brazilian translation and validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale . Our findings support, corroborate, and complement previous studies of psychometric properties, validity, and reliability of this scale in samples from other countries. We concluded that Brazilian FCV-19S (Appendix) is a psychometrically appropriate scale to assess the fear of COVID-19 in the general Brazilian population, applicable in Portuguese speakers.The limitations of this study include the restricted scope of participants; the sample was selfselected, with a modest size, and was not necessarily representative of the general population of Brazil; no formal diagnosis of mood disorders was undertaken; it was assessed using a selfreported measure, which has the risk of source bias, and social desirability factors might have influenced participant responses to the questionnaire; snowball sampling weakens the generalisation of the findings; so it is recommended that further research be performed using this scale, in order to complement the results found, expanding the sample to people from other regions of the country, on bigger and more representative samples of Brazilian participants.Conflict of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Ethical Approval All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the research team's organisational ethics board and with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.Informed Consent Informed consent was obtained from all participants.Escala de Medo da COVID-19Por favor, leia cuidadosamente cada uma das afirmações abaixo e selecione o número (1, 2, 3, 4, ou 5) que melhor representa o quanto você concorda ou discorda com a afirmativa, indicando como você se sentiu durante a última semana, incluindo hoje, em decorrência da pandemia do novo coronavírus (COVID-19), conforme escala a seguir:",Brazil,first author,2020-11-23,11
4b51a0015083f4e45062d39b523acbbec4e0f065,Physical activity for cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic: a call to action,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed radical changes in our daily activities. In order to slow infection rates, social isolation measures have been strongly recommended for the World Health Organization (WHO), especially for groups at risk of severe illness such as older individuals and those with underlying health conditions [1] . Global estimates suggest that 1.7 billion individuals (22% of the global population) are at risk of severe COVID-19 [2] , which includes 43 million prevalent cancer cases (diagnosed with cancer in the past 5 years) [3] . In addition, obesity, which is highly prevalent in western countries, has been linked with increased risk of COVID-19-related complications and several types of cancer (e.g., breast, colorectal and endometrial) [4] .Patients with cancer have higher risk of being admitted to intensive care unit requiring invasive ventilators or dying from COVID-19 than patients without cancer due to their systemic immunosuppressive state induced by the disease and its pharmacological treatments [5] . In addition, patients with cancer tend to be older and have other comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease) related to poorer prognosis for COVID-19, which reinforce the importance of self-isolation measures for these patients. At the same time, however, social isolation policies have reduced follow-up visits for regular pharmacological cancer treatment, as well as adhering to non-pharmacological recommendations such as physical activity.In [6] , as well as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) [7] have provided guidance for and summarized the evidence on the role of physical activity for cancer patients. In summary, strong scientific evidence supports the safety and efficacy of physical activity to address several health benefits for cancer survivors, including reduced anxiety, fewer depressive symptoms, less fatigue, better quality of life, and improved physical function [7] . Of note, many of the health benefits, especially those related to mental health, are even more relevant in the context of social isolations. The comprehensive literature review of the ACSM Multidisciplinary Roundtable on Exercise and Cancer also suggested that physical activity, particularly postdiagnosis, is associated with improved survival from breast, colon, and prostate cancers [7] . These results are consistent with a recent meta-analysis on physical activity and mortality in cancer survivors including 134 epidemiological studies [8] . High vs. low physical activity prediagnosis (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.79-0.86) and postdiagnosis (hazard ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.75) were associated with improved survival outcome for all-cancer combined [8] . While it is likely that reverse causation contributes to some of the association (i.e., those with better health and prognosis are more able to exercise), preliminary results from randomized trials showing the effect of exercise on survival suggest that bias is unlikely to entirely account for the protective association [9, 10] . Reductions in cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality were also observed for prediagnosis and postdiagnosis physical activity in breast and colorectal cancer survivors [8] .Physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors are essentially the same as for the general adult population. Most of the oncology organizations recommend cancer survivors to engage in regular 150 min per week of aerobic, moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. Of note, scientific evidence is not clear about the best type or domain of physical activity for people with cancer [8] ; thus, guidelines suggest to include physical activity as part of everyday life [6] . Herein, physical activity is defined as any movement produced by skeletal muscle that results in more energy expenditure than resting or sedentary activities [6] . Examples of types of physical activity include recreational (e.g., exercise, running, sports, dancing and other forms of physical training), transport (walking and cycling) and household activities. Muscle-strengthening activities, such as weight lifting or resistance training, have also been recommended twice a week for additional health benefits. Replacing sedentary activities by light physical activities have also been recommended, although there are limited epidemiological evidence linking sedentary time to health outcomes in cancer survivors.Physical inactivity (not meeting the physical activity guidelines) and prolonged sitting time are highly prevalent among cancer patients, partially due to persistent symptoms such as fatigue, which may contribute to these behaviors in addition to self-isolation measures. Furthermore, cardiovascular disease among cancer patients is also a concern, and clinicians have historically recommended patients to rest and avoid physical activity. Data from USA and UK cancer patients suggested that only approximately a third to 45% of the patients accumulated at least 150 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week [7] . In Brazil, only 45% of people with cancer meet physical activity guidelines [11] .The COVID-19 pandemic and its social distancing and isolation policies have created a ""sedentaryogenic"" environment where meeting physical activity guidelines becomes especially challenging for people with cancer. In addition, cancer patients are less likely to attend follow-up visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, which further reduces the opportunities to discuss the importance of physical activity during and after treatment. Yet, we recommend that oncology clinicians and health practitioners should provide evidence-based counseling about the benefits of physical activity for the health of their cancer patients.The Exercise is Medicine (EIM) initiative have suggested a three-step approach to help patients keep moving throughout their treatment [12] . First step, health professionals should assess physical activity as a vital sign at regular intervals, which could be provided through regular texts or phone calls. Second, clinicians should advise cancer patients to increase physical activity and reduce prolonged sedentary time to help them reach the physical activity guidelines and its associated health benefits. Third, clinicians may refer patients to appropriate oriented-exercise programs based on clinical information, patients' preferences and physical activity levels. This third step might be especially challenging in the context of social isolation, as most of the physical activity programs, gyms and health-care professionals are not recommended to be frequented during the pandemic. Alternatively, health professionals may refer/recommend to physically inactive patients to progressively replace sitting activities to active breaks of walking at home. For physically active cancer patients, maintaining exercise can be encouraged, but may need to be adapted to the home setting. Extensive material to promote physical activity for cancer patients is available to download in the EIM webpage [12] .Cancer patients are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and therefore should follow the recommendations of selfisolation. During this period, physical inactivity and prolonged sedentary time should be avoided, if possible. Strong epidemiological evidence supports the safety and efficacy of physical activity to address important health outcomes for cancer patients [7] . During COVID-19 pandemic, people with cancer are less likely to attend follow-up visits, which might reduce the opportunities for evidence-based counseling. Yet arguably more important than ever, oncologists and health practitioners have an important role on the promotion of an active lifestyle for these patients during the pandemic and thereafter.",Brazil,first author,2020-11-16,11
caca20653a48e9cc3d7d683fa49ea65ae9794623,"Children hospitalized for COVID-19 during first winter of the pandemic in Buenos Aires, Argentina","Despite the COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, the information available to date shows that the disease is less severe in the pediatric population [1, 2] .Also, there are reports that seem to show that the development of the pandemic may be influenced by the characteristics of each country, their health systems and how they faced the pandemic [3, 4] .In addition to the characteristics of their own population and health system, Argentina faced the pandemic in a particular way, including the longest lockdown [5] and mandatory hospitalization of affected infants, regardless of its severity [6] . These characteristics could give a distinctive feature to children hospitalized for this disease.Analysis: Categorical variables are described by proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and continuous variables with mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, according to distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). IBM SSPS Statistics 20.0 was used.The study was approved by the Institution Ethics Committee.In the studied period, 578 children and adolescents were hospitalized for COVID-19. The number of hospitalizations per week ranged between 2 and 42. (Figure 1 )The median age was 4.2 (IIC: 0.7-11.2) years and 54.5% were male. Sixty-seven percent (67.3%) had their residence within the jurisdiction of the hospital (City of Buenos Aires) and, of them, 23.1% lived in a poor neighborhood.Eighty-three percent (83%) had a history of close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case.The time of symptoms onset before admission was 1 day (IIC: 1-3). Thirty-five percent (35.3%) had a previous or concomitant diagnosis of other disease, asthma being the most frequent (n = 49) ( Table 1) .Disease severity was assessed and 30.8% were considered asymptomatic, 60.4% mild, 7.4% moderate, and 1.4% severe. From the six severe cases, only one required assisted ventilation, and two presented with SARS-CoV-2-related multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Other six MIS-C cases were admitted to the hospital but SARS-CoV-2 testing was negative.Regarding the lab tests, we found that 9% showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte differential count <20%) and 23.8% elevated C-reactive protein values (C-reactive protein > 10 mg/dl) (being 100% among severe cases and 10% among asymptomatics)( Table 3 ).The length of stay had a median of 6 days (IIC: 2.2-9).At the time of this report, only one patient with COVID 19 died, due to causes other than the disease, since he was in end-of-life care. All patients were discharged without complications (with phone follow-up), except those whose comorbidity prevented it.Our study strengthens the idea that COVID 19 in pediatrics is, in general, mild. It also supports some characteristics of the disease in Argentina that a previous report has suggested [9] .Although it is possible that the age structure (Argentina has twice the number of children under 15 years of age than Italy) and the social behaviour of the different populations influence the differences observed [10] [11], the way in which local health authorities dealt with the pandemic have generated some particular features in our patients. We found more pediatric cases than other countries and a higher proportion of asymptomatic and mild among those hospitalized.We found a high proportion of asymptomatic patients (30.8%), higher than that reported by Götzinger in Europe in 582 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (16%) [19] , probably related to the above mentioned test and trace and institutional isolation policies adopted by the health authorities.We only found 5.6% moderate and 1.2% severe cases. Dong et al. in China reported 5.9% severe and critical cases [8] and Tagarro in Spain reports that 9.7% of the cases in his series were severe [20] . Although a report from the United States showed that 32% of hospitalized pediatric patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the PICU, the limited average length of stay (2 days) and the limited proportion of subjects who required assisted ventilation (5.8%) suggests that the admission criteria in this series were broader [21] .Regarding the cases of MIS-C (COVID-19 associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) that we report, they presented 4 to 6 weeks after reaching a significant number of cases in our city, a moment described as usual for the development of this complication [22] .Finally, we have that 83% of our patients had close contact with infected people, supporting the idea that children are usually infected from adults [23] .In this study we report 578 cases of children and adolescents hospitalized for COVID-19 in Argentina.

58816f013715681a33e19ccaaf069170ea231f55,Recommendations for the response against COVID-19 in migratory contexts under a closed border: The case of Colombia,"Since 2016, the number of people arriving in Colombia from Venezuela as part of mixed migration flows has increased sharply. The exodus of Venezuelans was the result of a combination of political, economic, and social circumstances that resulted in millions of them leaving the country for neighboring nations in precarious conditions and with few economic resources. This population movement, which began in 2015, is still going on: while in 2017 the Venezuelan population entering Colombia reached 796,234 people, in 2019 almost one and a half million (1, 488, 373) Venezuelans crossed the border into Colombia. Colombia currently hosts the largest number of Venezuelans living abroad: 1,771,237, of which 1,017,152 are irregular migrants (1).Colombia and Venezuela share a long border of 2,219 km, as well as a similar cultural background; historically, this relationship has been close as reflected in the motto ""fraternal countries"" that is written on the bridges spanning the border.The trade between the two countries is also very important. Some areas of the border are heavily populated and local people have traditionally moved back and forth between countries as part of their daily activities. Individuals and families move constantly in a pendular manner outnumbering those who cross the boundary to migrate or to seek asylum. The Wayuú indigenous group constantly moves in what is for them a transnational territory.In the past years, cities in the Colombian side have become an important resource for Venezuelans who benefit from the chance to buy food and other goods that are difficult to find in their country contributing in turn to enhance Essay doi: https://doi.org/10.7705/biomedica.5512 the economic activity of the zone. According to the Consejo Nacional de Política Económica y Social (CONPES) (2), most people from Venezuela cross into Colombia to buy food (47%) and many do so to visit family members (12%) or as farmworkers (5%). As one side of the border depends economically and socially on the other, people who live close to it have kept on crossing despite the restrictions implemented at different times in the past.Acknowledging the importance of addressing the public health issues associated with the massive arrival of members of mixed migration flows -i.e., population movements that combine refugees, asylum seekers, and economic migrants, and may also include unaccompanied minors, environmental migrants, smuggled persons, victims of trafficking, and stranded migrants, among others-, Colombia's Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social issued the ""Plan de respuesta sectorial al fenómeno migratorio"" (""Response plan of the health sector to address the migration phenomenon""). The Plan defined actions addressed to Colombian returnees from Venezuela, Venezuelans with both regular and irregular migration status, transborder commuters, and indigenous communities whose ways of life encompass both sides of the Colombia-Venezuela border (3) . The Plan and subsequent regulations granted regular migrants access to healthcare on par with the Colombian population. Irregular migrants have a more limited access, but a strong policy of regularization starting in 2017 and kept since then facilitated healthcare access for those that were able to obtain a special permanence permit. All these strategies were political decisions based on the right to health and intended to protect the members of mixed migration flows.Despite this positive response by the Colombian health system to the arrival of Venezuelan migrants, faced with the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic Colombia decided to close the border with Venezuela on March 16, 2020. This decision might have inadvertently promoted a negative view of migrants and increased their health risks. Nationality should never be equated to illness and people coming from Venezuela, a country where only a few cases of the virus had been identified at the time of the border closure, were less likely to be carriers of COVID-19 than those arriving from Europe or some parts of the United States when the decision was made.The attempt of sealing an international border has not been proved to be efficacious for transmission containment. Previous modelling of different strategies for outbreak mitigation shows that selectively targeting points of entry that are closer to the source of the outbreak might be effective while other strategies are less so (4). As Venezuela is currently not at the center of the COVID-19 outbreak, closing the border with that country is likely to have limited containment effects. Studies of influenza have shown that travel restrictions can delay, but not prevent, the expansion of the epidemic and containment needs to be based on a range of public health actions (4) .Given the scale of international traveling and everyday cross-border movement of people, it is very unlikely that a country will be able to remain completely isolated. Furthermore, these measures only make sense when a geographic area is completely free of the presence of the pathogen agent, which is probably not the case in a country such as Colombia with a permanent inflow of international travelers. Additionally, the border between Colombia and Venezuela is a notoriously porous one. Every day, people move across it through more or less hidden footpaths and the decision to close the official border crossings will encourage people to use those paths, which might require moving across jungle or through rivers increasing the risks of traveling.Besides avoiding transmission, another reason for border closing might be to protect the local health services from potential overflow due to an increase in the number of people coming into the country. So far, however, there is no evidence of such an increase. A related reason could be the fear of the selective arrival of those who are already ill and cannot find healthcare in the deprived Venezuelan health system. In this regard, it is important to remember that while the increase in the number of Venezuelans in Colombia in the past few years has certainly tasked the healthcare system, according to an analysis by the World Bank the economic consequences could be offset in the medium and long term by the increase in productivity thanks to immigration (5) . As for the second issue, there is no proof that the Venezuelan migration is mainly motivated by healthcare and even if this were the case in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be the time for the international communitynot just for Colombia-to respond in accordance to the principle that a global public health concern requires a global response.Additionally, in the last month, there has been an unexpected phenomenon of a flow of Venezuelan migrants returning to Venezuela whose number is not exactly known. These migrants returned forced by the economic difficulties derived from the obligatory social isolation and the subsequent loss of their employment. Venezuela's capacity to receive and protect them is also unknown.What recommendations could then be proposed when a country with limited resources such as Colombia must respond to the needs of vulnerable populations like Venezuelan mixed migrant flows? We would like to advance four arguments:First, the public health response should be centered on the two aims proposed by the World Health Organization of reducing human-to-human transmission and identifying, isolating, and caring for patients early.Second, to achieve these aims in a mobile migrant population, allowing for their movement to take place in a ""safe and orderly"" context will make detection and control easier than when migrants are pushed towards irregular border crossings and forced to hide (6) .Third, as social distancing measures seem to be the best option for reducing transmission, it is imperative to provide migrants with the means to do so. If people are forced to wait at border areas without adequate protections, it will be impossible for them to self-quarantine when needed. On the other hand, providing adequate shelter and access to healthcare will make it easier to identify and treat cases and their contacts promptly. The ethical principle of ""ought implies can"" (i.e., that a person is not responsible for not adhering to law when she is not able to do so) means that for migrants to be able to self-quarantine or even hand-wash as recommended by the health authorities, they need to be provided with the means for it.Fourth, restrictive measures in public health are only acceptable under the ""harm principle"" , according to which individual freedom should only be limited when the common good is at stake. While every country has the right to define its migration policies and make decisions on who can enter through its borders, changing these decisions for public health reasons should only be done when the resulting strategy has been proven to be effective. Border closure, besides being a restrictive measure, runs the risk of encouraging racism and prejudice for which there should be zero tolerance.In this sense, in the last month, the Colombian Government has been working in the inclusion of migrant population in the framework of the response against COVID-19 through a policy action plan that includes:1. responsible and humanitarian political management of the border including the creation of humanitarian corridors for special populations such as students, indigenous people, pregnant women, and people with chronic diseases; 2. guarantee of access to healthcare services according to migratory status; 3. readjustment of international cooperation actions to respond to the current pandemic in migrant populations including cash money transfers, water, sanitation, and hygiene, care givers and care facilities adapted for isolation measures, food delivery, and hostels adaptation for homeless and walkers; 4. psychosocial attention for the most vulnerable population such as children and teenagers; 5. resources focalization in high impact municipalities such as Villa del Rosario (Norte de Santander), Maicao (La Guajira), and Soacha (Cundinamarca), and 6. information management and coordination for policy makers (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social. Balance general. Colombia incluye a los migrantes en su respuesta frente al COVID-19, pero necesita más apoyo internacional. Bogotá; 2020).This action plan follows some of the recommendations suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).Additionally, this plan complements the previously published ""guidelines for the prevention, detection, and case management of COVID-19 for migrant population in Colombia"" assigned to local and department governments, socio-healthcare teams, public social service centers, as well as healthcare providers involved in the care of migrants at risk, suspects or those with COVID-19 disease, especially for the detection, diagnosis, and isolation of suspected cases (7) .Besides, the Colombian government recognizes the importance of adopting inclusive actions and avoiding discrimination against the migrant population. The fact that there could be present barriers to healthcare, together with a discriminatory treatment, would lead to an environment where people diagnosed with the virus, infected or sick, may not receive the required treatment generating a very high level of virus spread (7) .However, the implementation of all these strategies continues to represent a great logistical and financial challenge for Colombia, especially since it is not known whether the flow of migrants will increase during the progress of the epidemic. Colombia has called for increased international aid and the consequences of the shortcomings of the Venezuelan health system on health and migration from that country are unpredictable.Finally, measures that affect whole communities (in this case both Venezuelan migrants and Venezuelan and Colombian people living in the border regions) should be taken after discussion and coordination between national governments and policymakers in all sectors, as well as the public health community (academics, researchers, and practitioners). National governments must act in coordination and migrants should be included in all decisions that impact their health and wellbeing (8) . A deeper binational dialogue and effective cooperation between Colombia and Venezuela are therefore imperative. Regional and international agencies and States should rebalance migration policymaking to give greater importance to health including public health experts and decision-makers in high-level forums for migration policymaking. Leaders and health professionals should be fully involved in conversations about the macroeconomic forces affecting population mobility and participate in multi-sectorial budgeting and planning for migrant programs.To conclude, we hope that the COVID-19 pandemic will not become an excuse for the implementation of restrictive migration policies and that no additional burden will be placed on already vulnerable populations. If anything, this should be the opportunity to develop strategies to ensure that the migrant population, regardless of age, gender, or legal status, receives equitable healthcare in a framework of truly universal coverage (8) .",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-12,11
2fa67179d77768afea5b5f17dc7e4d1ac5ce4285,animals Live Attenuated Infectious Bronchitis Virus Vaccines in Poultry: Modifying Local Viral Populations Dynamics,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) was first described in 1931 in the USA [1] . The disease is caused by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a Gammacoronavirus belonging to Nidoviral order with a 27.6-kb IBV genome that is ssRNA (+). The first two-thirds of the genome encodes for 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp), which are encoded into overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b. The last third encodes for four major structural proteins: Spike (S), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N), and Envelope (E). Spike protein is cleaved in two by host proteases. S1 is responsible for cell attachment and induces neutralizing antibodies; S2 anchors the protein to the virion and has fusion peptides [2] . However, a recent in vitro study showed that the S2 portion is determinant to allow the viral replication in Vero cells [3] .The transcription mechanism of Nidoviral viruses has been previously characterized and includes the generation of intermediate subgenomic RNA (RNAsg) . Transcription Regulating Sequences (TRS) serve as an indication point for the genes that determine the generation of specific RNAsg [4] . This transcription mechanism has been shown to facilitate the exchange of complete genes between different virions, with the TRS serving as a hot spot, though intra-gene recombination is also recognized [5] . Polyproteins 1a and 1ab are generated by a frameshift −1 in the viral RNA. The proteases included in their genome cleave the polyproteins into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp), the primary function of which is to participate in the viral replication mechanisms. Of those, nsp 14 has been described with a proofreading function and reduced activity [5] . Thereby, IBV mutation reaches rates of 10 4 subs/site/year [6] .Even though IBV is highly labile to environmental temperature and detergents, IB remains one of the most prevalent diseases in modern poultry systems. High morbidity, but in most cases, low mortalities characterize IB. However, mortalities have been recorded in the presence of secondary pathogens [7] or when the IBV has renal tropism [8] . The main factor behind its high presence in poultry is its easy transmissibility through respiratory secretions, feces and even vectors and fomites [9] . The high variability observed in IBV due to high mutation rates and recombination between different strains impedes control and is another factor in the high prevalence of the disease. For a more comprehensive understanding of IB strains, Valastro et al. [10] have classified IBV into six genotypes and 27 lineages, according to the phylogenetic clustering of the S1 sequences.IBV belongs to the same family as the viruses that cause SARS [11] , MERS [12] , and the recently-described COVID-19 [13] , which spread widely around the world, causing the largest pandemic in modern history. Since all of these human outbreaks have been proven to be of animal origin [14] , understanding Coronaviridae dynamics and the veterinarians and farmers role in changing their populations has become one of today's leading research topics.There is currently no commercially available treatment for IB. However, it has been published that vitamin C and E supplementation may significantly improve the humoral response to IBV in broilers after a combination of live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines [15] . Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been shown to reduce IBV replication in vivo using transgenic chickens, minimizing the initial inflammatory process and improving weight gain [16] .Given the lack of cost-effective treatment for IB, the most critical control strategies are prevention through biosecurity measures and all-in/all-out procedures, together with immunization of chickens and breeders. A recent study analyzed the phylogeographic dynamics between two major poultry producers in Italy. The authors showed that integration within each of the companies, with all the implied biosecurity measures, is an efficient barrier for limiting IBV spread. They argued that the disparate biosecurity levels between the two companies could facilitate virus movement in a single direction [17] . Moreover, it has been proposed that the different biosecurity cultures in surrounding countries may explain differences in strain circulation within their territories [18] .Several considerations make the vaccination process a significant challenge. Depending on the age, bird type, and the purpose of protection, local availability of vaccines, manufacturer's instructions for use and the veterinarian's diagnose, the professional must establish the most appropriate tactic for use of live vaccines through a vaccination program. Thus, there are as many vaccination schedules as veterinarians prescribing vaccines according to farms circumstances. The first step to choose the most appropriate vaccine to apply is to identify the field strain responsible for the clinical signs, just so, the veterinarian can adjust its vaccinal schedule in order to control the disease.There are a wide variety of vaccines, which vary in strains and type of vaccines according to local requirements and legal dispositions ( Table 1 ). The most commonly used vaccines are live attenuated vaccines, which mimic the natural infection process of the field viruses without causing the disease.They are produced through an expensive process using embryonated eggs. While it is true that the production of such live vaccines has been industrialized for decades and nowadays it has been established as a massive production through a flow production, to develop for first-time a new vaccine based on a newly isolated field strain takes a long time. Beyond virus variability, several technical issues affect the outcome of a successful immune response. When evaluating IgM levels, flock characteristics like type of bird, flock size, housing type, ventilation and light management showed significant importance [19] . Similarly, vaccine management factors, including age/interval of vaccination, the interval between vaccination and blood sampling, and temperature of the water used to reconstitute the vaccine, also affect the IgM levels. Furthermore, a recent study made with the Arkansas serotype has shown that the variability in the subpopulations within an available vaccine could define the response of the bird. A more heterogeneous vaccine appears to inhibit viral replication of pathogenic strains more efficiently and to confer a better innate immune response. On the other hand, higher avidity and antibody levels were observer with a more homogeneous vaccine [20] .Several articles report recombination processes between field viruses ( Table 2 ). Isolates from Taiwan have shown recombination of strains from the USA and China in the N gene, which may have been involved in the origin of the strains circulating in Taiwan [21] . In another study involving Taiwanese isolates, the authors found multiple recombination points along the IBV genome associated with genes S, 3b, M, and 5a from two different phylogenetic clusters, referred to as TW-I and TW-II [22] but, more recently, grouped in the GI-7 lineage [10] . In Australia, a geographically isolated country, poultry farmers only use live attenuated vaccines manufactured with their own pathogenic strains. Thus, the exchange of viral strains with other countries is extremely limited, and the viral population evolves separately from the rest of the world. In this context, several recombination points have been identified along the entire IBV genome, where field and vaccine strains have been recognized as parental strains [23] . Another study with these Australian strains indicates that natural recombination between distant local strains could be responsible for the emergence of a new variant. Interestingly, a strain that has been undetected for the last decade appears to be involved as a parent strain, suggesting that it could still be circulating at a lower frequency [24] .The full-length sequence and recombination analysis of the CK/CH/Zhejiang/06/10 strain isolated in 2010 in the Zhejiang province of China showed that it is a recombinant of the GX-YL9 strain isolated in 2007 that acquired S1, 3a, 3b, and 3c, M, 4b, 4c, and 5a genes from the LX4 strain isolated in 1999 [25] . A more recent study, published in 2016, also observed the involvement of LX4 and TW-I strains as parent strains in a recombination process for new isolates obtained from China. Analysis of the sequences revealed different point mutations, suggesting that recombination and mutation are important drivers in IBV evolution [26] .In order to circumvent the limitations regarding to develop new live attenuated vaccines, several countries have decided to use the protectotype concept, which uses two heterologous vaccines to neutralize the disease, producing an additive effect greater than their protectives capabilities measured by separate [27] . Knowledge about protectotype effector mechanisms has not been fully understood yet, but it has been shown that protection of the cilia brought by the protectotype can reduce secondary bacterial infections and severity of the disease [28] , while a differentiate immune response has been shown to be stimulated by two serotypes involved in protectotype [29] .While the 4/91-Mass combination is the most effective protectotype to date, the concept is not exclusive to this combination [30] . Supporting this idea, the 4/91 vaccine was found to stimulate higher IgA levels in the upper respiratory tract than the Mass vaccine, while the inverse relation was observed for cell-mediated immunity. Thus, it has been proposed that protectotype effectiveness could be based on an additive effect at different levels of the host immune response [29] .Several reports support the use of protectotype against different strains [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Veterinarians and researchers agree on the effectiveness of this methodology. For example, recombinant viruses from chickens with various clinical signs have been retrieved in Russia, Sudan, Egypt, and China. Studies of Russian and Ukrainian field viruses recognized 4/91 and H120 as parental strains of QX recombinant strains, specifically in the S1 gene [36] . In QX Sudanese sequences, viruses isolated from chickens vaccinated with 4/91 and H120 vaccines have been shown to have acquired a fragment from ORF1a belonging to 4/91 vaccine and another fragment from ORF1b from a H120 vaccine [37] . A GI-23 virus isolated in Egypt exhibits recombination with 4/91 vaccine in genes 3a, 3b, E, and M; and with H120 vaccine in genes 4b and 4c [38] . Finally, a Chinese virus obtained in 2014 showed a recombination breakpoint within the S1 sequence, with the 5 segment more similar to H120 vaccine and 3 segment more similar to 4/91 vaccine [39] .In Chile, the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine was valuable for controlling the outbreaks caused by GI-16 strains [32] . Six years after this foreign IB vaccine genotype was introduced in the country, field strains belonging to GI-13 with high similarity to the 4/91 vaccine were identified, suggesting a change in the genetic and antigenic properties of the circulating virus [40] . Moreover, a sequence isolated in 2015 has a S1 gene of Q1 origin (GI-16) and a N gene from the 4/91 vaccine (GI-13) [41] .The introduction of the 4/91 vaccine where its homologous pathogenic variant has not been previously isolated or reported, remains controversial. The main concern is how this act could affect local viral populations. However, once it has been introduced under the protectotype concept, removing it from the vaccination schedules could be contraindicated because heterologous field strains continue circulating, though the protectotype keeps them at a lower frequency. If only one of the vaccines (Mass or 4/91) is maintained for field vaccination, the resulting poor cross-protection would not control the field strain. Consequently, an increase in viral population size, with the respective outbreaks, would be observed [42] .Many different strains have been described since the first IBV reports in the 1930s. Certain strains spread more than others, probably reflecting greater ability to keep themselves in poultry populations. Some authors suggest that the major spread of specific strains is a consequence of using live attenuated vaccines in poultry [10] , which is supported by the recent findings in Chilean strains, where after the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine, pathogenic strains belonging to the same lineage were retrieved from field cases with high homology [40] . The role of wild birds in spreading certain IBV strains has also been considered [43] . Thus, the strain migration by different mechanisms would be one an important driver in IBV evolution.The high variability of IBV has led to descriptions of different viral populations within individual birds, where mutation, recombination, and selection are constantly modeling IBV evolution through intra-host conditions [44] . Moreover, different subpopulations have even been described in commercial vaccines [45] . This fact is supported by Oade et al. [46] , who have shown that the attenuation process required to obtain a live attenuated vaccine could generate different mutation patterns with low consensus levels between them. This is important because heterogeneous mutation patterns afford live attenuated vaccines different initial points for evolution.Mutation and recombination as drivers of IBV evolution is supported by Zanaty et al. [47] , who found that the IBV-EG/1586CV-2015 strain arose from the Egy/var I and Egy/var II viruses isolated in Egypt, all of which belong to the GI-23 group [10] . Moreover, several mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain could be affecting virus tropism and affinity [47] . In another Egyptian study, the authors have suggested that the field strain CU/1/ 2014 would be a revertant of the vaccine H120, exhibiting that that the reverse of virulence is a current concern regarding to live attenuated vaccines [38] .Recombination has been described along the entire IBV genome; however, recombination rates are highest in genes encoding for proteins Spike, nsp 3, nsp 2, and nsp 16. Those immediately upstream of the Spike gene have the highest number of recombination breakpoints [5] . These recombination processes have even enabled crossing of the inter-species barrier, as was the case of Turkey Coronavirus (TCov), where a gallus gallus IBV recombined with a Spike protein of unknown origin from another Gammacoronavirus. Thus, when challenged with this new Spike protein, the turkeys' naïve immune system allowed TCov to spread quickly [48] .The field strain replacement facilitated by vaccines is a phenomenon deeply reviewed by Martcheva et al. [37] . The effectiveness of the vaccine on different circulating viruses can trigger a change in the dominant population, facilitating the rise of a less fit strain as the dominant strain is controlled. However, other virus factors, like the basic reproduction number (R0) and invasion reproduction number (Ri), affect strain replacement and, thus, must be considered. R0 indicates strain capacity to spread in a susceptible population, while Ri shows the same in a host population where another strain is already present and at equilibrium. The possibility of coinfection and the super-infection capability of specific strains can also impact the outcome of strain replacement, which will vary according to the vaccination rate reached [37] . The factors previously described regarding the immunization process will also affect the outcome of strain replacement [35] .Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines has been shown to define the viral population circulating in a specific poultry population. Thus, a homologous vaccine applied in the field leads to less variability in the viral population and negative selective pressure. On the other hand, a non-homologous vaccine is unable to neutralize other serotypes than itself, which causes higher variability, generates diversity through characteristics intrinsic to the virus and exerts positive selective pressure. Finally, when no vaccine is available, variability is high, but the circulating strains are under negative selective pressure [49] . These findings are concordant with the results published by Mckinley et al. [50] , who found that usage of live attenuated vaccines can reduce variability in field viral populations. Thereby, vaccine choice is a determining factor in controlling IBVs in the poultry flocks.Given the lack of effective treatment for infectious bronchitis, the best option for poultry farmers and veterinarians is prevention through biosecurity protocols and vaccination schedules aligned with the local reality. There are inactivated, live attenuated, sub-unitary, vectorized, monovalent, or polyvalent vaccines, but not all of them are available or authorized in every country. Moreover, new strains are continually being reported in territories where they have not previously been detected. Thus, establishing a vaccination program that is adequate in terms of strain choice, type of vaccine, periodicity of vaccination, among other issues, is becoming increasingly challenging.Live attenuated vaccines are utilized worldwide because they stimulate different pathways of the avian immune system. However, their use remains a sensitive subject because of how it could change field pathogenic populations through recombination along the entire genome, reversion to virulence, or enabling strain replacement. The issue is most concerning when introducing a new vaccine strain in countries where the pathogenic variant has not been previously detected because, once introduced, the new vaccine strain could evolve in unpredictable ways.To minimize the associated problems, veterinarians must ensure proper vaccine application in the field. Moving forward, researchers should work on alternatives that provide effective protection and avoid the collateral problems associated with live attenuated vaccines. Given IBV characteristics, developing highly adaptable vaccine-production platforms or expanding the concept of a universal vaccine is essential. ",Chile,first author,2020-11-07,11

14076bc0a8ac54bb35b43e378c2dec61323815cd,Pandemic and vaccine coverage: challenges of returning to schools,"Vaccination (along with other public policies, especially those aimed at expanding sanitation) has made possible to substantially decrease the number of deaths of children under five years of age worldwide 1 . Widespread vaccination allowed the eradication or control of immunopreventable diseases in several regions of the world, including Brazil, due to successful immunization programs [1] [2] [3] .In Brazil, since the 1990s, vaccine coverage in children under one year of age had rates above 95%, which indicated the high participation of the population in vaccination and the good performance of the National Immunization Program (NIP) 4 . The gradual implementation of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in the late 1980s allowed for a high rate of vaccine coverage through the expansion and decentralization of health services, mainly due to its principle of universal and free access to vaccination [5] [6] .Throughout its history, the NIP faced several challenges. In the 1980s, the first national surveys of vaccination coverage showed worse coverage in poorer segments of the population; this difference disappeared in the late 1990s, indicating that equity of access to vaccination had been reached in different socioeconomic strata of Brazil 2,7,8 . However, according to the 2007 national survey, the country now has a lower coverage on both the richer and the extremely poor demographics 9 . Moreover, from 2016 onwards vaccine coverage rates have declined about 10% to 20% 10,11 , due to factors not yet understood. The measles epidemic that hit several states in 2018 and 2019 is an immediate consequence of the decrease in vaccine coverage 12 .Among the possible explanations for this, we have the decrease in the perception of risk of these diseases and the increased perception of risk of adverse events following immunization (AEFI). This phenomenon was also recorded in other countries, due to the success of immunization programs when disease control or elimination is reached, a result of the prolonged maintenance of high vaccination coverage. Thus, success itself has become a great challenge 13 .However, it is accepted that this is not the sole reason: among other factors that influenced the drop in vaccination coverage since 2016, the emergence of vaccine hesitancy is highlighted. This a phenomenon that has gained importance in various parts of the world and is characterized by the delay in accepting or refusal of the vaccine, regardless of its availability and access to health services 10,14-16 .The political and economic crisis, the decrease in government support for the SUS 17 and the dissemination by social networks of distorted information about vaccines are also worthy of mention, all of which possibly contributed to the sharp drop in vaccine coverage in recent years [18] [19] [20] .In 2020, due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), face-to-face attendance in health services dropped dramatically in many countries; this included child vaccination, given the measures of social distancing to mitigate viral transmission [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .Efforts to contain the pandemic, which involve distant medicine practices and the use of other technologies in order to continue health care at home, have affected vaccination actions, which require travels to the healthcare unit 22 . Parental concern in exposing children to Sars-CoV-2 when taking them to health services for vaccination also contributed to the decline in vaccination coverage 22, [24] [25] [26] 28 . A risk-benefit study in African countries showed that avoidable deaths from routine vaccination outweigh the excess risk of death from covid-19 associated with attendance at the healthcare unit, evidencing the need for increasing vaccination coverage at this time 21 .Child vaccination coverage has declined sharply during the pandemic in several regions of the world 26, 28 . In the USA, a considerable decline in the vaccine coverage of children was found, starting in the week after the national emergency scenario was declared (March 13, 2020). Higher rates were found among children under two years of age 25 . In England, three weeks after the introduction of social distancing (March 20, 2020), there was a 19.8% drop in doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, compared to the same period in 2019 24 . In Michigan (USA), completeness of the vaccination schedule for five-year olds dropped from 67.0% to 49.7% in May 2020. At 16 months, it was found that measles vaccine coverage decreased from 76.1% to 70.9% 22 . In Indonesia, where immunization occurs in schools, a significant drop in coverage of the basic vaccination schedule was predicted after the closure of schools in March 2020 27 . Moreover, it is known that this impact will be even more important in families with unfavorable socioeconomic conditions 26 .The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that at least 80 million children will be susceptible to immunopreventable diseases such as measles, diphtheria and polio because of the decrease in vaccination coverage during the covid-19 pandemic 29 . It is worth remembering that outbreaks of measles were attributed to the interruption of vaccination services during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, causing a second public health crisis [30] [31] .The pandemic of the new coronavirus has challenged health systems around the world in providing essential services, including immunization programs, as routine vaccination and mass vaccination campaigns could contribute to the spread of covid-19 32 .On March 26, 2020, WHO and the Pan American Health Organization published recommendations on vaccination during the covid-19 pandemic. The measures considered three scenarios of availability of health services and included the temporary suspension of mass vaccination campaigns during this period. It was recommended that routine vaccination be maintained in places where essential health services had operational capacity of human resources and supply of preserved vaccines, respecting social distancing and other measures to control transmission of Sars-CoV-2 33,34 .In Brazil there was the recommendation of suspending routine immunization during the first 15 days of the influenza vaccination campaign, as this was a period in which older adults and health professionals were supposed to be vaccinated; although this was valid as a safety measure for the older population, it has generated concern among Brazilian medical societies 35 .The WHO recognizes this fragility and recommends efforts to ensure high vaccination coverage, seeking herd immunization for preventable diseases, in such way that vaccination programs should adopt innovative measures 36, 37 . Vaccination strategies in vehicles, at home or in specific rooms and well-separated from the locations of other clinical visits could be used, as well as the identification of absentees and recruitment for vaccination with the aid of electronic immunization registries (EIR) 22, [24] [25] [26] 28 .EIR allow greater efficiency of health services, because, in addition to providing the evaluation of vaccination coverage, they also help in routine practice and enable the convocation of absentees, thus increasing the scope of immunization 38, 39 . In addition, they are important sources of information, which can be applied in the evaluation of performance indicators and in the development of epidemiological research 38, 40 . In 2020, researchers from countries such as the USA and the United Kingdom evaluated in real time the decline in vaccination coverage and the number of doses applied during the covid-19 pandemic through EIR. With this quick identification, it is possible to quickly adopt strategies in the face of this challenge 22, 24, 25 .With the emergence of many radical groups worldwide that deny the importance of the pandemic and its associated mitigation measures, vaccine hesitancy might acquire more strength, especially considering the availability of vaccines for covid-19 in the near future that will have an important role in dealing with this disease 41 .The safe resumption of day care centers and schools should be a national priority. Children have lost fundamental benefits of social, educational and developmental nature. For many parents, it will not be possible to return to work if these institutions remain closed, thus exacerbating social inequities. Several individual practices (use of masks, hygiene, social distancing, temperature measurement etc) as well as environmental ones (maximum capacity and layout of classrooms, cleaning etc) will be necessary to prevent the transmission of Sars-CoV-2 between schoolchildren and staff, including in transportation to schools 42, 43 .However, in addition to care for covid-19 44 , the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that schools, health services, and local health authorities promote child vaccination well before the beginning of the school year. It is important that children receive vaccines at the recommended age and be updated in case of vaccine delay due to the pandemic 45 . This recommendation should be considered in other countries, including Brazil.In Brazil, the pandemic was an additional challenge for the return to schools due to the abovementioned immunopreventable diseases, as we recently faced a consistent drop in vaccination coverage and a wide epidemic of measles that reached several states and amounted for thousands of cases. This situation has worsened in 2020, which until August had registered more than 7,000 confirmed cases of measles 46 .According to data from the NIP Information System (IS-NIP), when comparing the number of first doses of the pentavalent vaccine applied in March 2020 with March 2019, we found a decrease of 27% ( Figure) [10] [11] . These data indicate that the return to classes may increase the risk not only of the expansion of measles epidemics throughout the country, but also of the reemergence of other already controlled diseases, such as diphtheria and the whooping cough. Studies show that outbreaks of diphtheria occur when vaccination coverage drops due to migration and/or political instability, emphasizing that it is a disease of relevant lethality [47] [48] [49] .Thus, it is evident that, before the progressive return of face-to-face school activities, intensive actions to assess the vaccine situation of this population will be necessary in order to recover sufficient vaccination coverage to prevent or reduce the spread of immunopreventable diseases 45 . Innovative instruments, such as EIR, can be useful for real-time assessment of vaccination coverage, as well as to warn about immunization and rescue individuals with vaccine delay 22, 24, 25, [38] [39] [40] .To date, there are no studies on the impact of covid-19 on the decline in vaccine coverage. Delays in child vaccination (a demographic that should have been immunized in the most intense moment of social distancing) are also yet to be studied, even in other countries. Moreover, despite the universal access to child vaccination achieved by the NIP in the last decade, this impact will probably be greater in children from families with unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, due to less access to health services and information.When social distancing measures are loosened, many children will be susceptible to preventable diseases, and there will be a need to assess the vaccine situation of schoolchildren before returning to school 22, [24] [25] [26] 28, 45 .The covid-19 pandemic recalled the importance of vaccination by showing how fast a disease can spread and cause irreparable harm in societies without this defense. When a safe and effective vaccine for Sars-CoV-2 is available, immunization programs will have an even greater challenge of strengthening and reaching those most vulnerable 28 .",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-05,11
1226334d96af76163f7525ecbd55e67cf07ce51e,Commentary The COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for the food information environment in Brazil,"COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which was first reported in China in December 2019 (1) .Subsequently, on 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (2) . In Brazil, the first case of the disease was confirmed on 26 February 2020 (3) .In an attempt to prevent and slow the spread of the virus, some social distancing practices were implemented (4) that resulted in the shutdown of schools, universities, non-essential commerce, public leisure areas, bars, restaurants, among others. Consequently, people spent more time at home which led to prolonged exposure to television and internet advertising content. The time people spend watching television increased by 1 h and 20 min (5) , and the internet usage grew up by 40-50 % during the pandemic (6) . Furthermore, people have also changed their work habits and the way they consume goods and how they spend their time off (4) , which impacted on how the food industry operates. All these changes have had an impact on the Brazilian food information environment, which is characterised by food advertising through various media (7, 8) . Systematic reviews and meta-analysis showed an association between excessive exposure to food advertising and unhealthy eating (9, 10) . The contextual changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may have increased the population exposure to ultra-processed food (UPF) advertising, which can have a negative impact on consumers' health.The objective of this commentary is to describe food information environment changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and propose a pathway to promote a healthier food information environment after this health crisis.Monitoring studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic already pointed to a high prevalence of UPF advertising on television (11) , social media (12) and food delivery apps (13) . During the current health crisis, new marketing strategies have emerged.The advertisements have been aligned with the context of social distancing, using messages that appeal to eating at home, reinforcing the idea of staying at home with family and stimulating personal interaction through digital technologies such as video calls. An example is the fast-food industry sharing advertising messages to stimulate food delivery ( Fig. 1 ; see online supplementary material, Supplemental Figures 1 and 2) .Food companies, especially ultra-processed ones, have also carried out social responsibility actions which were identified in campaigns to donate food products, money and personal hygiene items. In general, donations targeted hospitals and philanthropic institutions, health professionals and socially vulnerable populations. These actions gained traction due to the consequences of the economic crisis resulting from COVID-19 in Brazil (14) (Fig. 2) .Another strategy is the promotion of good hygiene practices and protection measures. Examples include big players in the beverage industry redesigning their product labels to display information on how to prevent the spread of the virus (see online supplementary material, Supplemental Figure 3 ).Food companies have also highlighted the protective measures they adopted to prevent the infection of their employees. These measures, however, despite being considered essential in the current health context, have been used for self-promotion. An example is food delivery apps which started implementing basic protective measures to their riders (such as offering masks and hand sanitisers) only after being publicly criticised due to the awful working conditions their riders were facing (see online supplementary material, Supplemental Figure 4 ).Another advertising strategy that has been used by UPF companies during the COVID-19 pandemic is the sponsorship of live concerts promoted by Brazilian musicians on social media. The ten most watched live events during the pandemic that were still available for access on YouTube on 23 July 2020 gathered a total of 174 million views (15) . In these events, UPF companies can be identified by merchandising actions, by the direct consumption or the indication that the product was or will be consumed (e.g., by exposure of the product close to the artists) or finally by explicit Fig. 1 Facebook post made by a fast-food company to stimulate food delivery. The text reads: 'Cornet at home. You won't dress up the same but will love it the same. Order for delivery or through the drive-through' advertisements made by the musicians themselves. For exemplification, an ultra-processed meat company developed a website to archive all the events that have been sponsored by the brand along with a channel for buying its products (see online supplementary material, Supplemental Link 1).All these strategies can negatively impact on consumers' health. First, social responsibility actions can increase the influence of the UPF industry on the country's health agendas. Their lobbying has always been present (16) , but we have noticed an intensification of this practice during the pandemic (17) . Second, the increased exposure of consumers to advertising of UPF may result in greater consumption of this kind of food (18) with unfavourable public health outcomes, such as overweight, obesity and cardiometabolic risks (19) .The advertising strategies adopted by the food industry during the COVID-19 pandemic are generating market demands at the time of crisis, influencing the consumer purchase decision and increasing their loyalty to the supplier brands. Companies take advantage of a period of increased vulnerability of the population in terms of social, economic and personal relationships to consolidate their market share and reach new consumers.The advertising messages of empathy and solidarity adopted by the food companies in their advertisements reflect a characteristic of humanisation of the brand that is associated with a closer relationship between company and consumer (20) . Consumers' exposure to brands through the sponsorship of live events means that the food company becomes part of the consumer's leisure and entertainment moments, encouraging consumers to choose a certain food or drink to consume during the broadcasting in function of what is being advertised. It is also worth mentioning the power of celebrities consuming or endorsing a product to influence the consumer's choice (21) .These changes in the food information environment, associated with other changes in the individual's context resulting from social distancing, such as greater exposure to media, new leisure and work habits, changes in the domestic routine, economic recession and changes in mental health, may leave individuals more vulnerable to excessive consumption of UPF (22, 23) .An example is the growth of online commerce. During the lockdown, food delivery through apps grew by 9 % on weekdays and 10 % on weekends (5) . Previous monitoring studies have demonstrated there is a large offer of UPF in such apps (13, 24) ; thus, a wider use of these tools can result in greater consumption of this food.The Brazilian online behaviour survey ConVid, carried out from April to May 2020 with 45 161 people, registered a decrease of about 4 % in regular consumption (5 d or more a week) of vegetables and beans and an increase of 4 % in frozen meals, 4 % in savoury snacks and 6 % in chocolate/sweet biscuits/pieces of tart from 2 d or more a week (25) . In contrast, the NutriNet Brasil study, survey conducted with 10 116 individuals, showed a slight increase in the frequency of consumption of vegetables, fruits and beans, as well as a stable high consumption of UPF during the COVID-19 pandemic (26) .In any case, both the increase in the consumption of UPF and their consumption in high frequency could increase the prevalence of overweight (55·4 %) and obesity (20·3 %) in Brazil (27) , which can worsen the health condition of individuals with COVID-19 since these conditions are independent risk factors in the prognosis of the disease (28) . This demonstrates the need for new ways to minimise the impact of exposure to UPF advertising in Brazil after the pandemic.Discussing a possible pathway to develop a healthier food information environment after the COVID-19 pandemic involves updating the existing food advertising regulation to the current context, enforcing its compliance and monitoring the food industry practices.The Brazilian legislation regarding food advertising is described in the Consumer Protection Code ('Código de Defesa do Consumidor' -CDC in Portuguese), which guarantees the individual's right to clear and adequate information about different products and services. The CDC protects the consumer against both misleading advertising, which is capable of inducing the consumer to misinterpret the information about the various aspects of a product, and abusive advertising, that is, the one which is capable of inducing the consumer to behave in a risky manner regarding their health or safety (29) . Also, the resolution 163/2014 of the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents ('Conselho Nacional dos Direitos da Criança e do Adolescente' -Conanda in Portuguese) handles the abusive advertising targeted to children (30) .Some limits on the application of this legislation have been observed in the digital environment. The wide reach and the many possibilities of engagement with advertising content in this environment allow ordinary people, who are not part of the food industry, to replicate such content by sharing or retweeting it on their social media. Data from the SocialBakers ranking (31) have shown that three of the big UPF companies had alone almost 4 million interactions (shares, likes and comments) on Facebook from April to June 2020. The easy and speedy sharing of these advertisements makes it difficult to trace and attribute responsibility. The process of identifying the advertisements is also hampered by sponsorship strategies involving digital influencers or celebrities. Companies have consistently sponsored these influencers to advertise their products on social media, frequently hiding the commercial partnership behind it.It is also worth mentioning, as a limitation of the current legislation, the use of personal data from media platforms to track potential consumers. Evidences demonstrate that companies have been using user data available on the internet to target advertisements and influence their choices (32) . This affects the consumer's right to be protected from these practices (32) . Unlike General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, until recently Brazil did not have appropriate legislation to regulate data privacy on the internet.Also, there are no regulations currently in place to protect consumers from the social responsibility actions of the food industry associated with self-promotion or sponsorship. When companies do not take responsibility for the health consequences of consuming their products and divert the attention from questionable practices through corporate social responsibility actions, they end up increasing their credibility before consumers, especially in vulnerable contexts such as the COVID-19 pandemic (33) . The health crisis cannot justify the promotion of the unhealthy food industry since it has a crucial impact on the epidemic of obesity and chronic non-communicable diseases, which in turn increases the population's vulnerability to COVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases (34, 18) .Finally, it is important to strengthen the regulation of food advertising in Brazil through effective compliance with legislation. This can be achieved by creating channels for registering complaints and forwarding them to the relevant bodies, and also by speeding up the process of dealing with these complaints. The food industry must comply with the regulatory terms in their advertisements and the public authorities must endeavour to inspect their actions. The academy should invest in research on the subject with the aim of systematically monitoring advertising practices in the food industry and their impact on consumer health. Civil society can be motivated through campaigns carried out by the academy and civil society organisations to raise public awareness regarding the issue of food advertising, which aims to encourage their participation in monitoring compliance with legislation by identifying and reporting breaches, and also by policing the competent bodies regarding the forwarding of these.The food information environment during the COVID-19 pandemic is changing in Brazil. The food industry, especially those of UPF, has switched their advertising strategy to incorporate messages of empathy, union and partnership, in addition to investing in social responsibility actions and sponsoring online events aiming at selfpromotion. As a consequence, the consumer is more vulnerable to the consumption of UPF. Recommendations have been proposed in order to provide a healthier information food environment in Brazil after the COVID-19 pandemic, which include updating the regulatory legislation and its effective compliance through industry accountability and public authority oversight, research on the topic and engagement of civil society.Financial support: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

a5c56215e651b4a0b148b51d908fdb5090aee918,"SARS-CoV-2 y RT-PCR en pacientes asintomáticos: resultados de una cohorte de trabajadores del Aeropuerto Internacional El Dorado de Bogotá, 2020 SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR in asymptomatic patients: Results of a cohort of workers at El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, 2020","La pandemia por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) ha generado múltiples y diversos desafíos a nivel mundial en todos los ámbitos laborales, no solo entre los trabajadores del área de la salud. En la semana epidemiológica 36, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) reportó más de 25 millones de casos en el mundo y la muerte de cerca de 800.000 personas por la enfermedad (1) . El 80 % de los casos de COVID-19 son leves y asintomáticos (2) (3) (4) .La infección asintomática se define como la detección positiva del ácido nucleico del virus SARS-CoV-2 mediante reacción en cadena de la polimerasa con transcriptasa inversa (RT-PCR) en muestras de pacientes que no presentan signos clínicos ni radiológicos típicos de la COVID-19 (5) . La incidencia de infecciones asintomáticas reportada oscila entre el 1,6 y el 56,5 % de los casos (6, 7) . Aunque la transmisión del virus por personas asintomáticas se ha reportado en varios lugares del mundo (8, 9) , el papel de este tipo de portadores en la diseminación de la infección aún no se ha aclarado (10).La detección de potenciales portadores del SARS-CoV-2 supone un reto para los sistemas de vigilancia epidemiológica y, sobre todo, para la reactivación de la economía mundial afectada por las diferentes medidas adoptadas por los gobiernos para disminuir la transmisión del virus (11, 12) . Una de las estrategias implementadas en la vigilancia epidemiológica ha sido la búsqueda activa de casos mediante la toma de la temperatura y el registro de la presencia de síntomas (13) , o las tamizaciones aleatorias en búsqueda de anticuerpos (14) o ARN viral (15) . cada siete días durante 21 días tomando muestras de hisopado nasofaríngeo y sangre total para la identificación de anticuerpos.Las muestras nasofaríngeas fueron procesadas por el Instituto Nacional de Salud según lo señalado en el protocolo de Berlín para la RT-PCR (18), y se amplificaron los genes ORF1ab y N para obtener los valores del umbral del ciclo (cycle threshold, Ct), cuya positividad se establece por debajo de los 40 ciclos.Se incluyeron en el estudio los contactos familiares de los trabajadores con COVID-19. Se consideró como portadores asintomáticos de la infección a aquellos trabajadores con seguimiento durante 21 días que no desarrollaron ningún síntoma en dicho periodo.Para las variables cuantitativas se estimaron los promedios, las medianas la desviación estándar y el rango intercuartílico (RI). Para las variables categóricas se establecieron frecuencias y porcentajes. Se estimó la incidencia acumulada en el periodo evaluado (18) y se utilizó la prueba de ji al cuadrado para establecer las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres en cuanto a los Ct. Además, se usó la prueba de Friedman para estimar las diferencias entre los grupos de seguimiento en las medias de los Ct. El nivel de significación estadística se estableció con un valor de p menor de 0,05. Se usó el paquete estadístico SPSS™, versión 23 (licencia del Instituto Nacional de Salud) y el programa R, versión 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) de acceso libre (19) .El proyecto, el consentimiento informado por escrito de los participantes y los instrumentos de captura de la información fueron aprobados por el Comité de Ética y Técnico del Instituto Nacional de Salud mediante el acta 012 de 2020.La cohorte prospectiva incluyó 212 trabajadores del Aeropuerto Internacional El Dorado ""Luis Carlos Galán"" de Bogotá. En el periodo de observación se tomaron 869 muestras de 212 trabajadores, correspondientes a cuatro seguimientos por trabajador como mínimo. El promedio de edad fue de 36,3 ± 8,2 años; el 73 % (n=155) de los trabajadores era de sexo masculino. Los estratos socioeconómicos predominantes fueron el dos y el tres (83,5 %, n=177); la muestra estaba conformada principalmente por mestizos y blancos (97,2 %, n=206). Se encontró que el 98 % (n=208) de los trabajadores encuestados usaba tapabocas desechables durante la jornada laboral y se lavaba las manos, por lo menos, una vez cada hora.La incidencia de SARS-CoV-2 se estimó en 16,51 % (35/212). De este porcentaje, el 68,67 % (n=24) correspondió a casos asintomáticos y el 31,43 % (n=11) a casos sintomáticos.En el seguimiento de las personas positivas la proporción de quienes siguieron siéndolo fue del 21,31 % (n=13) en el día 7, de 9,84 % (n=6) en el día 14 y de 6,56 % (n=4) en el día 21. En tres casos (dos hombres y una mujer) las pruebas de RT-PCR siguieron siendo positivas tras 28 días de seguimiento. En el análisis del Ct de cada gen en el momento del estudio (primera muestra positiva Vs. muestra positiva de seguimiento), se observó que la media tendía a ser mayor en la primera toma y a aumentar en las posteriores (figura 1). La prueba de Friedman evidenció diferencias significativas entre los días de seguimiento en las medianas del CT de los genes ORF1ab y N (c 2 =60.000, p=0,000 y c 2 =59.000; p=0,000, respectivamente). No hubo diferencias significativas en el Ct entre hombres y mujeres (p=0,44) ni entre grupos de edad (p=0,51).Se encontró una incidencia de la infección por SARS-CoV-2 del 16,51 % en el periodo de observación. De este porcentaje, el 68,67 % correspondió a portadores asintomáticos de SARS-CoV-2. El número de contactos cercanos de los casos asintomáticos osciló entre 1 y 5, cifra que difiere de la establecida en los ejercicios de modelado matemático diseñados en el primer semestre de la pandemia, en los que se estimaba el número de contactos cercanos entre 10 y 36 (20) , y que se explicaría por la implementación de las medidas de distanciamiento social que habrían reducido el número de contactos en la vida diaria. Este hallazgo concuerda con lo reportado por Afzal, et al., en cuyo estudio se determinó que el promedio de contactos por caso de COVID-19 era de siete personas (21) .Un resultado importante de este estudio fue que el 50 % de los positivos tuvieron valores de Ct por encima de 33 y la proporción de contactos cercanos infectados fue relativamente baja (11,86 %). Esto respalda dos planteamientos: primero, que la transmisión de la infección por asintomáticos no es tan eficiente como la de los pacientes sintomáticos y, segundo, que al tener Ct altos, la carga viral es baja y puede no ser suficiente para desarrollar la COVID-19 o para infectar a los contactos cercanos. En este sentido, en una revisión de la literatura sobre el problema de la infección asintomática por SARS-CoV-2, se plantea que es apresurado centrar las esperanzas en la inmunidad colectiva producto de la transmisión del virus por contacto con pacientes asintomáticos dadas las bajas tasas de seroconversión de los portadores asintomáticos (22) .Sin embargo, estos resultados difieren de otros reportados por varios autores en torno al papel de las personas asintomáticas en la transmisión de la enfermedad. Ye, et al., por ejemplo, señalaron que la transmisión del virus puede tener lugar en contextos de contacto estrecho, como las viviendas (23) , en tanto que en su estudio sobre pacientes asintomáticos y contaminación de superficies, Wei, et al. encontraron que las personas asintomáticas con SARS-CoV-2 contaminaron su entorno y, por lo tanto, pusieron en riesgo a otras personas (24) .Aunque el presente estudio no incluyó un grupo de comparación, la transmisión fue baja, en parte porque la población analizada seguía las recomendaciones de protección. La baja transmisión entre los contactos podría explicarse por el cumplimiento reportado del uso de tapabocas y del lavado de manos (98 %). Desde el cierre del aeropuerto el pasado 22 de marzo se ha implementado en varios frentes de trabajo la instalación de máquinas dispensadoras de elementos de protección personal (tapabocas desechables N95 y caretas de protección), así como lavamanos portátiles y dispensadores de gel para higienizar, puntos de control de la temperatura y demarcación de áreas para limitar aglomeraciones, además de la capacitación de los trabajadores sobre la prevención de la transmisión del virus (25) . El uso de estos elementos ha permitido la disminución del riesgo de infección en diferentes entornos (26) . Llama la atención el comportamiento de los Ct a lo largo de los seguimientos. En el análisis estadístico se observaron diferencias significativas en las medianas de los grupos de días de seguimiento para los dos genes evaluados (mediana del Ct del ORF1ab: 33,53, RI: 29,14 -36,61; mediana del Ct del N: 33,61, RI: 29,38 -36,81). Estos hallazgos son similares a los reportados por Singanaya, et al. (27) quienes reportaron el seguimiento de 324 casos de COVID-19 en Inglaterra durante el primer semestre de 2020 y observaron que la mediana de los Ct en pacientes asintomáticos era de 31,23 (RI: 28,21 -32,97).Un resultado interesante tiene que ver con el hecho de que los Ct de las personas asintomáticas se dan tardíamente y, aunque no hubo diferencias significativas importantes entre los grupos, es necesario resaltar que las medianas de los Ct fueron superiores a 33.En la actualidad, el punto de corte para determinar que una prueba es positiva está establecido en un Ct entre 38 y 40 (28) . Sin embargo, varios autores han propuesto replantear este punto de corte para la prueba diagnóstica de SARS-CoV-2. En un informe publicado por los Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) de los Estados Unidos se plantea la modificación del punto de corte del Ct para definir la recuperación en pacientes sintomáticos y se propone que sea de 33 (29). Por su parte, Binnicker, et al. encontraron en su estudio que cuando los Ct eran superiores a 34 la probabilidad de cultivar el virus decrecía significativamente y, por lo tanto, su capacidad de infectar a otros (30) .A la luz de la evidencia actual, la tecnología de cultivo viral disponible y la posibilidad de explotar el carácter cuantitativo de la PCR en tiempo real incluyendo en los experimentos curvas estándar de ARN viral sintético, sería necesario revisar los puntos de normalidad de la prueba en concordancia con las copias de virus en una muestra, especialmente en pacientes con infección asintomática.El presente estudio tiene varias limitaciones. En primer lugar, el tipo de diseño no permite hacer inferencias acerca de las cadenas de transmisión en cuanto a si la infección ocurrió en el ámbito comunitario o laboral y, aunque ello podría controlarse mediante el estudio de las secuencias genómicas de los pacientes infectados, hasta la fecha dicho análisis no se ha hecho. Por otro lado, están los aspectos relacionados con la capacidad operativa de la RT-PCR para detectar el ARN viral, lo cual se trató de controlar siguiendo el protocolo estandarizado para la toma de las muestras y con el entrenamiento de quienes las tomaron y procesaron.En resumen, el seguimiento de esta cohorte de trabajadores sanos evidenció la presencia de infección asintomática y leve por SARS-CoV-2 en esta población. Es necesario seguir desarrollando este tipo de estudios para conocer la dinámica de la transmisión de la infección en otros contextos ocupacionales diferentes al de los trabajadores de la salud.Los autores quieren agradecer a los trabajadores del Aeropuerto Internacional El Dorado ""Luis Carlos Galán"" , y especialmente a Tomás Aragón, Jairo Larrarte, Luis Soto y Sorent Chacón por su colaboración en el desarrollo del estudio.",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-15,11

The findings were negative for infection or metastases (white arrows). C, Afterward, a 68 Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT was performed. Maximum intensity projection image shows moderate and diffuse uptake in both lungs (black arrows) and high uptake in mediastinum (black arrowheads). No sites of metastatic disease were found. D and E, PET and PET/CT axial section demonstrates bilateral, multifocal, and peripheral ground-glass opacities with more involvement in both inferior lobes (SUVmax 4.3) and moderate somatostatin receptor expression in the lungs (black arrows) suggestive of COVID-19 infection. These findings were not present in the CT previously. F and G, PET and PET/CT axial section with right hilar, subcarinal, and Aortopulmonary window lymph nodes (white arrowhead), with high radiotracer uptake (SUVmax 5.5) suggestive of inflammatory process and COVID-19 infection. On January 30, 2020, the WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. By September 6, 2020, 7:00 PM GMT-5, there were 26,994,442 confirmed cases, 880,994 deaths, and 216 countries affected. 1 In Colombia, by September 6, 2020, 5:00 PM GMT-5, the confirmed cases are 666,521 with 21,412 deaths. 2 The nuclear medicine departments around the world have had a challenge in facing the pandemic. They did not discontinue their operation. The ""COVID-19 Pandemic: Guidance for Nuclear Medicine Departments"" 3 suggested some recommendations. One of these is the incidental COVID-19 finding in hybrid study that involves a CT of the chest. If COVID-19 findings are detected in the lungs, it must be reported immediately. The image acquisition of 68 Ga-DOTA peptides PET/CT is from the head to the middle of the upper leg 4 and includes the chest. Therefore, there may be incidental detection in chest part in asymptomatic but infected cases undergoing scans for other indications. 5 Moreover, uptake in inflammatory processes is described in 68 Ga-DOTA peptides because white blood cells including leukocytes and macrophages express somatostatin receptor 2, 6 and it should be considered in COVID-19 times. There are few cases reported of COVID-19 findings in PET/CT with radiotracers different from 18 F-FDG. Scarlattei et al 7 reported 5 cases of unknown SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia detected by PET/CT with 18 F-FDG, 18 F-choline, and 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen. Stasiak et al 8 reported 1 case with COVID-19 infection after 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen-11 PET/CT imaging in a patient with prostate cancer. Moreover, Vicente and Castrejón 9 and Olivari et al 10 reported one case with incidental COVID-19 pneumonia on 18 F-choline PET/CT for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer and COVID-19 pneumonia increased choline uptake with 18 F-choline PET/CT, respectively. However, none of these case reports are with 68 Ga-DOTA peptides. This case demonstrates findings of COVID-19 in 68 Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT in an asymptomatic patient with the infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.",Colombia,first author,2020-11-24,11
17a308c9db9bffef2b6af84b67944e39a5f782f4,Food Systems and Health: Prospects for Hope in the Brazilian Chaos?,"There seems to be more questions than answers about the post COVID-19 world. One of the most fundamental questions, indeed, is whether we are going to have more COVID-19 like pandemics in the coming years, and what the world is planning to do to place health for all people and for the planet at the center of a political agenda that brings solutions. Are we going to reinforce or challenge the paradigm of concentration of power in the hands of a few? Are we determined to become wiser or are we going to be carried away in the vortex of more polarization, in a world already inhabited by a growing number of authoritarian governments? Are we going to acknowledge that to achieve wellbeing, without leaving anyone behind, we need to seriously challenge business as usual? has ripped open the catastrophic management of the last 40 years of economic and social planning. More than ever, we now have a grand opportunity to recognize that our human and planetary health and are interwoven. And it has always been like this, by the way.This article is about how Brazil produces and consumes food. That topic may seem quaintly unconventional, particularly to international readers who at present, when they hear about Brazil, the main things they recall is massive fires in the Amazon, the erratic authoritarian government and a botched response to the COVID-19 pandemic. But discussions around health and food systems are necessary, because they are intertwined with environmental, economic and political issues. Building food systems that are efficient, fair, sustainable and healthy may not only open the way to a better approach to public health as a common good, but also lead society to a less fragmented and more consistent vision of the world. There is hope in the chaos.The chaos is real, of course. Even prior to COVID-19, Brazil was in a deep economic crisis and an even deeper political crisis, with extreme societal polarization, thriving of fake news, mounting attacks on science, and the rising of old and new inequities. Against this backdrop, the presidential party threatened to override the constitution and imperil democracy by restoring military rule (Austin 2019). 1 Arguably, Brazil was already facing an epidemic of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), a substantial portion of which are caused by the nation's transition to heavily promoted Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs) (Noll et al. 2019) .But the hope is also real, and the multiple crises have indeed triggered reactions and built links across organizations, groups and sectors that may potentially pave the way for necessary reforms in Brazil, such as the fiscal and political reforms. We may be naturally intersecting a phase of painful ripening of our young democracy. We see the dynamic of terrible news met by hopeful counter-reactions across a range of social, health and environmental issues. Brazil's plundering class, which puts its short-term profits ahead of the country and even ahead of its own children's future, is on the rampage. In the Amazon, rainforest is illegally burnt to provide transnational corporation with new soya fields and pasture that will be barren in a few years, trampling the human rights of indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups. 2 Deregulation is rampant, as the current government pushes for economic development at any costwith many politicians brazenly taking a cut of the profits. 3 On the other hand, Brazil's vibrant civil society has been able to mobilize important segments of the population and of the legislative and judiciary branches to push back and do significant damage control in relevant areas. The intermediate body of highly experienced civil servants is also playing a crucial role in damage control within the executive branch whenever possible.Opposing forces are also at work in relation to widespread insecurity provoked by exposure to hazardous substances and waste. The recent report to the Human Rights Council by Special Rapporteur Baskut Tuncak highlights Brazil's rapid environmental devastation, alongside the deteriorating human rights record in various areas of the country. 4 The state has allowed hundreds of thousands of its most vulnerable citizens to be exposed to environmental hazardsperhaps most spectacularly in the collapse of tailings pond dams-but also due to pesticides, smoke from forest fires, asbestos and a range of harmful emissions from factories located directly beside heavily populated residential areas. 5 Yet again, also in this context, the strength of NGOs and capacity of social movements, as well as the thick network of social solidarity activities, have proven to act as powerful antibodies of societal resistance and resilience. 6Brazil's large agri-business sector accounts for a substantial portion of the country's exports, and its most reactionary elements have tremendous influence on the Bolsonaro government. Extensive, industrialized agriculture has resulted in ever higher yields, greater labour productivity and increasing profits-at least, as long as balance sheets and national accounts ignore the massive socio-environmental costs. As is the case elsewhere, if corporations paid for the use of ecosystems, which they depend on and systematically destroy, they would have to interrupt their operations. Globally, according to a KPMG report, the environmental costs of business operations are doubling every 14 years. A chart that compares the environmental costs of production in various sectors of the global economy with gains explains how these costs soar up to 224% of business earnings in the agri-food sector. 7 This is a bright red indicator of the urgency of the problem which, translated in the real world disasters, means setting intentional fires in the Amazon to clear tracts of land for crops and livestock for export-a long-time problem that has rebounded to record levels under Bolsonaro, who dismisses concerns about deforestation as intolerable foreign meddling. This year in particular, Amazon faces' the perfect storm' of forest clearance, the free riding coronavirus and wildfires, making its people far more vulnerable to the pandemic. In the context of COVID-19, land invasions by timber poachers and miners and the uncontrolled spread of the contagion present a deadly dual threat for indigenous people in the Amazon region. 8 Brazil's drive to further expand agricultural production is also driving the introduction of hundreds of new pesticides, including categories forbidden in other countries, without any concern for the precautionary principle. The authorizations usually come via corrupt transactions with massive conflicts of interests. 9 At the same time, the critique about shortsighted productivism is well entrenched in Brazil too. Often at great personal risk, environmentalists and advocates for indigenous rights have not only documented specific deforestation and pesticide-related criminality, but also repeatedly proposed more sustainable economic pathways, where environmental, health and human rights impacts are well accounted for and more promising agro-ecological models are developed, sustained or revived. 10 Beyond Brazil's role as a testbed for food policies, good and bad, what happens here directly affects the whole world, and indeed, the future of the planet. The role of deforestation in the global climate emergency is well known; what is perhaps less widely appreciated is the Amazon's role as a reservoir of biodiversity. Currently, the world's population is more and more dependent on a shrinking diversity of foods (60% of calories consumed by humanity comes from three grains-corn, rice and wheat). This limited diversity presents a huge risk, particularly that of a devastating crop failure (e.g. a new fungus that destroys a large portion of the food supply).Brazil, in its Amazon region alone, is home to thousands of species and varieties of food, many known only to local inhabitants, usually indigenous. Therefore burning the forest so consumers in North America and Europe can eat cheaper hamburgers is more than just unjust-it is also incredibly short-sighted.The Brazilian state does not just turn a blind eye to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest-it actively subsidizes the agri-business sector that profits when the forest burns. 11 Hence, here too the world has a vital interest in the return of sanity to Brazilian politics. It helps that there is a large social base for resistance to the extensive agri-business model: the more than four million small landholders in the country. 12 Family and smallscale farming has a central role to play in the availability of food and territorial development. There are many regions and examples in which family farming and agroecological practices provides decent livelihoods from the land. Even where short-term yields are below those from industrial agriculture, family farming and agroecology (Wezel et al. 2009 ). 13 can provide a better route to socially and environmentally sustainable land stewardship: farmers care about their neighbors and about the environment they and their children live in.Moreover, family farming gets crucial support from longstanding government procurement policies for institutions such as schools, 14 and other public institutions. 15 Speaking of school environments, the Brazilian public education network offers daily meals to 43 million children, in an operation capable of mobilizing an entire system for the production, supply and preparation of food. These policies (though now under threat) give preference to purchases of locally produced food from small farms. When authorities buy food for Brazil's massive school meals programme, it is essential they continue to use their considerable purchasing power to provide steady business for family farms, which are then better able to offer a wide variety of quality foods and products to local markets. This approach has immediate healthy implications on adult and children's dietary habits, as it prevents the emergence of chronic diseases that heavily condition individual and family lives, as well as the national health system. Resorting to family farms' food, moreover, has an inherently regenerative outcome not only in supporting sustainable farming. It can reduce and minimize the waste of material and energy resources inherent in the concentration of distribution in the hands of metropolitan wholesalers; it can also regenerate ecosystems and reduce inequalities. Ultimately, it is the space par excellence for building a new relationship between food, health and environment through education.It is unfortunate that the COVID-19 puts this family farming at risk, when it comes to provision to the public infrastructures. The pandemic has severely deteriorated access to fresh food in Brazil, particularly for residents in low-income areas. This is true even for those that receive food donations on a regular basis: most food baskets contain processed, nonperishable foods because they are easier to handle, store, and distribute. The closure of schools and day care centres across the country during the pandemic has also deprived children and adolescents of the one daily healthy meal that they were guaranteed to receive (Duarte et al. 2020 ).While the production side of the Brazilian food system, skewed for global markets, is a perfect recipe for ecological disasters and viral spillovers, the area where Brazilian policy is worth emulating has to do with the consumption side of food systems. I refer to the 'Food Guidelines for the Brazilian Population' released by the Ministry of Health in 2014. 16 It promotes a novel approach to nutritional guidance 10 https ://agroe colog ia.org.br/; https ://aba-agroe colog ia.org.br/sobre -a-aba-agroe colog ia/sobre -a-aba/. 11 https ://br.boell .org/pt-br/2016/09/06/atlas -da-carne -fatos -e-numer os-sobre -os-anima is-que-comem os. 12 https ://sidra .ibge.gov.br/pesqu isa/censo -agrop ecuar io/censo -agrop ecuar io-2017. 13 https ://www.foods overe ignty .org/wp-conte nt/uploa ds/2015/02/ Decla ratio n-of-the-Inter natio nal-Forum -for-Agroe colog y-Nyele ni-2015.pdf. 14 http://www.fnde.gov.br/progr amas/pnae/pnae-eixos -de-atuac ao/ pnae-agric ultur a-famil iar. 15 https ://www.gov.br/cidad ania/pt-br/acoes -e-progr amas/inclu saoprodu tiva-rural /paa/paa-ci. 16 https ://www.fsp.usp.br/nupen s/wp-conte nt/theme s/nupen s/asset s/ pdf/dieta ry_guide lines _brazi lian_popul ation .pdf. by focusing on socially and culturally contextualized dietary patterns.A bit of context may be helpful for readers from nonnutrition backgrounds. For decades, nutrition discussions tended to focus on individual nutrients and/or 'bad' substances (fat, sugar, salt etc.) in people's diets. In international development circles, this tended to lead to a focus on getting specific nutrients to the population and on boosting calorie counts to avoid starvation. In high-income countries, where a substantial proportion of food is purchased in processed form, it has led to an emphasis on encouraging consumers to reduce their intake of 'bad' substances, e.g. by purchasing a different brand of boxed breakfast cereal, one with less sugar.This approach has not succeeded in reducing steady rises in obesity and diet-related illness in many high-income countries and, increasingly, in middle-income countries also. While the causes of these trends are hotly debated, in recent years attention has focused on shifts in dietary patterns to heavy consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF). 17 Critics have come to refer to UPFs as the 'new tobacco', comparing the business model of the ultra-processed foods and beverage industries to that of the tobacco industry (Monteiro and Cannon 2012; Capewell and Lloyd-Williams 2018) .Brazil is a middle-income country with high inequality, where UPFs are aggressively promoted in the media and at retail. And yet, compared to some middle-income countries, it has had less of a rise in obesity. A key reason for this is the resilience of traditional dietary patterns: more so than in other comparable countries, Brazilians continue to buy traditional local foods, cook them and take the time to eat real meals.Brazil's food guide aims to build on this resilience. 18 It is based on the NOVA classification, a concept coined by a Brazilian group of researchers that classifies food according to levels of processing and introduces the concept of ultra-processed foods. It is a bold move towards a more holistic approach to food systems and its connection with health (Ahmed et al. 2019; Scrinis 2020 ) It also has a social and commercial dimension: ultra-processed foods are primarily produced by large transnational and food processing companies that have an impact in the sustainability of food systems (Scrinis 2020) . 19 In short, alongside its climatedestroying industrial livestock farming, Brazil has a worldleading food guide and a vibrant family farming sector that provides a wide range of nutritious and environmentally sustainable foods. But just as food production is contested terrain, so too is the right to healthy and sufficient food.The first action of Bolsonaro's rule was to abolish CON-SEA (the National Council for Food Security), 20 which was re-established in 2003 by former president Lula da Silva to be a mechanism of social participation and oversight in the formulation, monitoring and evaluation of food and nutritional security policies with the objective of attaining the right to food in accordance with the Federal Constitution and in collaboration with the instances from the System for Food and Nutrition Security established by The Law for Food and Nutrition Security. 21 But the bonds built within Brazil's institutional mechanisms for social participation cannot be extinguished by a presidential decree. The National Health Council (NHC), established in 1937, 22 is an example of an institution that has survived several storms and cannot be extinguished. The NHC played a fundamental role in the creation of the Universal Health System (SUS) and still plays a major role in its defense and strengthening.After roughly a decade where improved welfare programmes and broad growth substantially reduced food insecurity, Brazil has jumped backwards due to the political and economic crisis. The latest Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (EBIA) data from the Brazilian Geographical and Statistical Institute (IBGE -POF 2017-2018), released in September 2020, shows that it took us less than 5 years to get back to the levels of food insecurity of 15 years ago. 23 The COVID-19 is now exacerbating Brazil's chronic structural problems of food insecurity and food inequity. A recent UNICEF survey 24 revealed that Brazilian low-income households with children and adolescents have been most hit by the sudden drop in incomes during the crisis, leading in turn to greater food insecurity and higher consumption of unhealthy foods. 'Around 63 per cent of families living with children and adolescents saw their income decline 20 http://www4.plana lto.gov.br/conse a/acess o-a-infor macao /insti tucio nal/o-que-e-o-conse a. 21 http://www4.plana lto.gov.br/conse a/confe renci a/docum entos /leide-segur anca-alime ntar-e-nutri ciona l. 22 http://conse lho.saude .gov.br/histo rico-cns. 23 https ://bibli oteca .ibge.gov.br/index .php/bibli oteca -catal ogo?view=detal hes&id=21016 70. 24 https ://www.unice f.org/brazi l/comun icado s-de-impre nsa/famil iascom-crian cas-e-adole scent es-sao-vitim as-ocult as-da-pande mia-revel a-pesqu isa-do-unice f. 17 https ://en.wikip edia.org/wiki/Ultra -proce ssed_food. 18 The guide is organized around 5 principles. The first states that diet, as well as involving nutrients, is about foods, meals, and eating modes, and also includes social and cultural aspects of dietary practices. The second states that sound dietary recommendations are tuned to changes in food supplies and population health patterns. The third acknowledges the interdependence between healthy diets and the social and environmental sustainability of the food system. The fourth states that reliable recommendations on diet come from a range of sources of evidence. The fifth states that dietary guidelines should enlarge people's choice of and right to adequate and healthy diets.significantly. Some 27 per cent even faced periods with neither food nor money to buy food, while 31 per cent said that they had moved towards an ""industrial diet"". These figures are even higher for the poorest sectors of the population' (Duarte et al. 2020) . It is of course scandalous that food insecurity can exist in a country as vast and fertile as Brazil, which prides itself on being a major agricultural exporter. Clearly the challenge is not producing food in sufficient quantity, but rather structuring the food system-and the distribution of income-so that healthy food is widely available and affordable. And we also need to curb a range of wasteful agri-food industry practices that result in widespread spoilage and waste.Brazil is the world's leading exporter of cigarette leaf, which is grown particularly in temperate southern regions, but despite the strength of the huge economic tobacco interests and the Brazilian political system's historic corruptibility, Brazil has also been one the first WHO members states to introduce strong restrictions on smoking and the tobacco industry, after the international health community reached consensus on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FTCT) in 2003. 25 Brazil was the second country in the world to introduce health warnings with photographs on cigarette packs. It bans smoking in public places and has comparatively high taxes. These policies have worked exceedingly well, thanks in part to a well-developed public health network at the federal and state levels, as well as many actives NGOs. They have given Brazil a sharp drop in smoking prevalence, of more than 50% in the last 20 years (Levy et al. 2012) .In part because of this experience that Brazil's burgeoning advocacy community has transferred some lessons from tobacco to the food arena. We are debating and promoting the prohibition of marketing of UPF, adoption of front of packaging warning labels to better alert consumers, increasing taxes and regulating school environments. 26 The advance of ultra-processed products, promoted by aggressive marketing techniques, facilitated access through artificial prices (not accounting to the real cost of its products), misinformation in labels and the growing population distance from real food production have definitely generated the need to invest in food literacy. What came naturally to past generations now needs to be taught. Schools are privileged spaces for that, since they also reach out to children's families, teachers, i.e. a much larger population than kids and students. Therefore, strengthening existing school feeding policies, such as the National School Feeding Program (PNAE), including the restriction of ultra-processed foods availability and marketing in those spaces, continues to be a priority medicine, if the government is serious about the health of the new generations.Taxation policies for UPFs also deserve to be highlighted as a not yet utilized path to improve health indicators in Brazil. As part of the current debates about the fiscal reform, taxation of sugary beverages is gaining momentum within the scope of products with negative externalities for both the environment and for health. Furthermore, adding to global evidence, 27 a recent study in Brazil shows that increasing sugary and artificially sugary beverages taxes is a measure good for health and for the economy. 28 Rather than tax sugary beverages, the Brazilian state actually subsidizes themnotably the major soda companies, including Coca-Cola, which operate in the so-called free trade zone in the Amazon. 29 By conservative estimates, this provides them with close to half a billion dollars in tax concessions-privileges given to a sector that has a huge health and also significant environmental impact in the country. 30In Brazil as elsewhere in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has shone a cruel light on the dysfunctions of politics and the inequalities and injustices that afflict us. It has also created an immense appetite for change, a widespread feeling that we do not want to return to the pre-pandemic status quo ante-which in the case of Brazil was already hair-raising.Most of the things that really matter in life have no value under the economistic thinking that has dominated our politics and destroyed our health, alongside the planet's. This indicates that the definition of wealth based on GDP fails to account for the human values that inspire us and make us happy.We need to build a world in which all people can do well in an environment that is doing well. It is inspiring to hear what some visionary leaders are discussing in some corners of the world. 31 Although our current political leadership in Brazil is trying to turn back the clock, the welfare revolution of the last couple of decades, alongside our social mobilization power and social participation structures, have taught us that things CAN and DO change. Millions in Brazil across multiple issues understand that all those issues are interrelated and that the stakes are high and that together we are the majority of the population.Last, but not least, hope is a powerful mobilizer. And I close that with another quote from the inspiring Maya Angelou:Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.",Brazil,first author,2020-11-23,11
8a2d5d30f622bae2fa17b7c0bafd659fed0eb574,Sepsis neonatal tardía por SARS CoV-2,"El coronavirus (SARS CoV-2), agente etiológico de la actual infección pandémica, recibe su nombre del inglés severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Este virus ARN pertenece a la familia Coronaviridae, cuyos miembros producen en los humanos infecciones respiratorias con fiebre, tos y disnea y, ocasionalmente, manifestaciones gastrointestinales (1).Hasta la fecha no se ha documentado la infección vertical por SARS CoV-2. Por la edad de aparición de las manifestaciones clínicas y la imposibilidad de documentar la presencia viral en el líquido amniótico y el tejido placentario, las escasas series de casos publicados de COVID-19 neonatal sugieren que la trasmisión es horizontal, por contagio con casos positivos para la enfermedad (2) (3) (4) .En el estudio retrospectivo de Wei, et al. (5) , se describen nueve pacientes menores de un año de edad diagnosticados en China con COVID-19, pero ninguno de ellos era menor de un mes. El curso de la enfermedad fue benigno en todos ellos. El reporte oficial de casos del Instituto Nacional de Salud de Colombia no determina cuáles corresponden a recién nacidos. Hasta el 19 de mayo del 2020 se habían reportado 96 casos en menores de un año, tres de los cuales fallecieron y nueve fueron atendidos en unidades de cuidados intensivos (6) .Se presenta el reporte de tres casos de recién nacidos diagnosticados con COVID-19, cuyas madres no habían manifestado síntomas compatibles con la enfermedad.Se trata de un recién nacido de 26 días de vida, procedente del área metropolitana de Barranquilla, de raza mestiza, producto del segundo embarazo y nacido por cesárea debido a bradicardia fetal; su peso al nacer fue de 3.100 g, la edad gestacional era de 38 semanas. Fue llevado a urgencias por presentar fiebre de tres días de evolución. La madre tenía 20 años de edad y era migrante irregular extranjera con pareja estable. La vacunación durante la gestación había sido adecuada y las serologías para HIV, hepatitis B, toxoplasmosis y sífilis (VDRL) no evidenciaron infección activa. Refirió que vivía en condiciones de hacinamiento y negó haber tenido contacto con personas que presentaran síntomas respiratorios en el último mes.En el momento del ingreso, el niño se mostraba activo y reactivo, afebril, con los signos vitales en los límites normales; no se registraron datos sobre enfermedades en el examen físico. La impresión diagnóstica determinó la presencia de sepsis neonatal tardía, por lo que se hizo un estudio séptico y se inició el tratamiento con ampicilina y amikacina en las dosis usuales. Durante el primer día de hospitalización el estado general del niño se deterioró, con distensión abdominal acentuada, mala perfusión periférica y sangrado por sonda orogástrica.En los exámenes de laboratorio se encontró hemoconcentración, leucopenia, función hepática alterada y dímero-D elevado, en tanto que la proteína C reactiva (PCR) fue negativa. Dado el riesgo epidemiológico por el lugar de residencia de la madre, se solicitó una PCR-RT para SARS CoV-2 en el segundo día de hospitalización, la cual resultó positiva (muestra de hisopado de nasofaringe). Sus síntomas se manejaron con hidratación endovenosa y tratamiento de sostén. La evolución fue satisfactoria y se le dio egreso en el décimo día de tratamiento (cuadro 1).Las pruebas de PCR-RT en las muestras de hisopado nasofaríngeo de su padre y su madre se reportaron como positivas y se los clasificó como casos. LDH Se trata de un recién nacido de 16 días de vida, procedente del área metropolitana de Barranquilla, afrodescendiente, producto del cuarto embarazo y nacido por cesárea motivada por una anterior. Su peso al nacer había sido de 3.600 g con una edad gestacional de 39 semanas; fue llevado a urgencias por presentar un cuadro de tres días de evolución con deposiciones líquidas acompañadas de sangre fresca en las últimas 24 horas. La madre tenía 39 años de edad, había recibido la vacunación adecuada durante la gestación y la serología para HIV, hepatitis B, toxoplasmosis y VDRL no evidenció una infección activa. Había sido hospitalizada en cuatro oportunidades por infección recurrente de vías urinarias y litiasis renal. El cultivo rectovaginal fue positivo para estreptococo del grupo B y negó haber tenido contacto con personas que presentaran síntomas respiratorios en el mes anterior.En el ingreso, el niño presentaba apariencia tóxica y estaba ictérico, por lo que la impresión diagnóstica fue de sepsis neonatal tardía y sospecha de enterocolitis necrosante (estado 1B) y trastorno hemorrágico del recién nacido. Se solicitó una PCR-RT para SARS CoV-2 cuyo resultado fue positivo (muestra de hisopado de nasofaringe). Se inició el tratamiento con ampicilina y amikacina en las dosis usuales.En los exámenes de laboratorio se encontró que la función hepática estaba alterada y que el dímero D, el fibrinógeno y la deshidrogenasa láctica estaban elevados; los tiempos de coagulación eran prolongados, en tanto que la PCR fue negativa. El urocultivo fue positivo al tercer día de hospitalización (Eschericha coli sensible) y el paciente evolucionó satisfactoriamente. Se le dio egreso al séptimo día de tratamiento (cuadro 1).La prueba de PCR-RT en la muestra de hisopado nasofaríngeo de su madre se reportó como positiva y se la clasificó como un caso asintomático.Se trata de un recién nacido de 20 días, procedente de Barranquilla, mestizo, producto del primer embarazo y nacido por cesárea motivada por dilatación estacionaria. Su peso al nacer fue de 3.750 g y su edad gestacional de 38 semanas; fue llevado a urgencias por un cuadro de cuatro días de evolución con intolerancia a la vía oral, lesiones pustulosas en la piel del cuello e ictericia. La madre tenía 18 años de edad, había recibido la vacunación gestacional adecuada y la serología para HIV, hepatitis B, toxoplasmosis y VDRL no evidenció ninguna infección activa. Negó haber tenido contacto con personas con síntomas respiratorios en el mes anterior.Al ingreso, el paciente tenía apariencia tóxica, estaba ictérico y afebril; la impresión diagnóstica se determinó como de sepsis neonatal tardía y sospecha de enterocolitis necrosante (estado 1). Se solicitó la PCR-RT para SARS CoV-2, la cual fue positiva (muestra de hisopado de nasofaringe). Se inició el tratamiento con ampicilina y amikacina en las dosis usuales.En los exámenes de laboratorio se encontró anemia, trombocitopenia, dímero D elevado y función hepática alterada, en tanto que la PCR fue negativa. El paciente evolucionó satisfactoriamente y se le dio egreso al séptimo día de tratamiento (cuadro 1).Las pruebas de PCR-RT en muestras de hisopado nasofaringeo tomadas a su padre, su madre y a los contactos domiciliarios se reportaron como negativas.En este grupo de recién nacidos la proteína C reactiva (reactante de fase aguda con un alto valor predictivo de la inflamación) era negativa en el momento del ingreso y durante el curso de la hospitalización, lo que sugiere que la inflamación es poco frecuente en la evolución de la enfermedad (cuadro 1).Este reporte de caso fue aprobado por el Comité de Ética en Investigación del Área de la Salud de la Universidad del Norte.Cuando se produce una infección viral durante el embarazo, su transmisión intrauterina suele generar complicaciones serias en los niños. El último agente infeccioso incluido en el grupo de infecciones perinatales por contagio vertical fue el virus del Zika (7, 8) . Aunque hasta el momento ha habido, por lo menos, un reporte de la presencia del SARS CoV-2 en las células del sincitiotrofoblasto de la placenta de una mujer embarazada sintomática para COVID-19 con preeclampsia grave y desprendimiento de la placenta (9), aún no hay evidencia de transmisión vertical en madres con infección activa sintomática en el momento del parto (10, 11) .En una serie de 214 mujeres gestantes a quienes se les hizo tamización universal con PCR-RT en muestras de cepillado nasofaríngeo para detectar SARS CoV-2 en el momento del parto, se encontró una positividad del 15,4 % (33/214), aunque solo cuatro tenían síntomas de la enfermedad en el momento de la hospitalización (12) . Este tipo de pruebas ayudaría a detectar madres asintomáticas para así disminuir las posibilidades de contagiar al recién nacido en el periodo neonatal con medidas de aislamiento respiratorio, distanciamiento físico e higiene frecuente y adecuada de las manos. Tales medidas podrían contribuir a salvaguardar la salud de los neonatos, pues todavía no se ha documentado la presencia del SARS CoV-2 en la leche materna (10) .La enzima convertidora de angiotensina 2 (ACE2), una metalopeptidasa, se ha identificado como el receptor funcional del SARS CoV-2. Se sabe que el ARNm de la ACE2 está presente en muchos órganos, pero su expresión proteica no se conoce del todo. Hamming, et al. (13) , reportaron su expresión superficial en células epiteliales alveolares pulmonares y en enterocitos del intestino delgado. También fue posible identificarla en las células endoteliales arteriales y venosas y en las del músculo liso arterial de varios órganos, lo que ha contribuido al conocimiento de la patogenia de las principales manifestaciones clínicas de la COVID-19.El tropismo del SARS CoV-2 por el tracto gastrointestinal, así como su detección en materia fecal (14, 15) pueden explicar perfectamente los cuadros gastrointestinales reportados en varias series de pacientes (16), una de las cuales incluía diez niños con síntomas inespecíficos y escaso compromiso pulmonar. En ocho de ellos la prueba de PCR-RT en las muestras de escobillado rectal seguía siendo positiva aún después del resultado negativo de las pruebas realizadas en las muestras de nasofaringe, lo que aumentaría la posibilidad de la transmisión fecal-oral (17) .En los pocos casos publicados de COVID-19 en recién nacidos se ha podido documentar que el curso de la enfermedad es más benigno. La sintomatología en ellos suele manifestarse con una sepsis tardía; llama la atención que la afectación pulmonar no se ha descrito tan frecuentemente como en los grupos de mayor edad (18) . La interacción del SARS CoV-2 con el sistema inmunitario de los adultos, y su posterior respuesta disfuncional, marca la progresión de la enfermedad (19) . Por su inmadurez inmunológica, el curso y la gravedad de la enfermedad en los recién nacidos podría ser completamente diferente.Los mecanismos fisiopatológicos de la COVID-19 incluyen la infección y el compromiso del tracto gastrointestinal. En los recién nacidos con manifestaciones gastrointestinales, febriles o afebriles, evaluados por cuadros sugestivos de sepsis tardía durante la pandemia debe hacerse la prueba de detección de la infección por SARS CoV-2, independientemente de que haya o no un nexo epidemiológico demostrado. La presencia de material viral en la materia fecal de los pacientes afectados debe motivar medidas de bioseguridad específicas para este tipo de contaminación.Al grupo asistencial de la Unidad Neonatal -MACSA del Hospital Niño Jesús de Barranquilla responsable de la atención clínica de los pacientes.",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-12,11
49d2fee8eee71c65d5dbfce8ed1e807d3c989004,Repercussion of COVID-19 Pandemic on Brazilians' Quality of Life: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study,"The world population has been greatly affected by the Sars-Cov-2 (Coronavirus Disease 2019-COVID-19) pandemic, and the related economic, social, psychological, environmental, and public health consequences. The disease brought the risk of death from infection along with unbearable psychological pressure to people in the world [1]. By 14 August of 2020, there were 20,730,456 cases of COVID-19, and 731,154 deaths were registered in the world [2] . Almost half of the official cases (n = 11,109,443 cases; 53.6%) and deaths (n = 402,734 deaths; 53.61%) occurred in Americas. In South America, Brazil is the country with the largest number of registered cases of COVID-19 (63.7%, n = 3,164,785, until 14 August, 2020) and deaths (62.9%, n = 104,201 in the same period) [2, 3] .to be Brazilian, living in Brazil, aged 18 years or older, and agree to participate in the study before opening the questionnaire. Those that did not agree to participate were directed to a page thanking them for their time; while participants that agreed were directed to the survey.Analysis of the data was done utilizing the GoogleForms ® tool and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). The statistical analysis was carried out, where higher scores indicate a higher QoL. Questions left blank were substituted by a median value of the corresponding dimensions. The total score was calculated for each participants' characteristics. If more than 20% of the questions were left blank, the questionnaire was eliminated from the analysis.The descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, floor effect, and ceiling effect) of the questionnaire's subscales were presented. The within-subject comparisons of domain means were performed by one-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc tests. A Student's t-test and Variance Analysis (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post-hoc analysis was used to compare the domains' values with the socioeconomic and demographic variables. All tests considered two-tailed hypotheses with a significance level of 5%.The factor validity was verified by confirmatory factor analysis. The Chi-squared test of minimum discrepancy (chi2), the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) evaluated the factor validity [14] . Both RMSEA and CFI ranges from 0 to 1 (RMSEA = 0 and CFI = 1 indicate a perfect fit). The model fit is accepted when RMSEA is less than or equal to 0.05 [15] , and CFI is greater than or equal to 0.9. The four domains presented a good fit in the confirmatory factor analysis (RMSEA = 0.0068 (95% CI: 0-0.0157); CFI = 0.9992 and chi2 = 109.63; df = 101; p = 0.262) [14, 16] .From 27 May to 14 August of 2020, 1877 respondents accessed the questionnaire, and of those, 1859 individuals from all five regions in Brazil (North, Northeast, Midwest, South, and Southeast) that met the inclusion criteria, answered the questionnaire. Most of participants were female (n = 1349; 72.56%); white (n = 1096; 60.88%); with children (n = 966; 53%); living in urban areas (n = 1771; 95%); have post-graduate degrees (n = 993; 53.4%) and a half of them (50.32%) age < 39 y/o., and 95% of them live in urban areas. The minority were unemployed (n = 130; 7%) (Table 1) . During the collection, most participants (n = 1800; 97%) did not test positive for Sars-Cov-2. There was no significant difference between the percentage of COVID-19 prospects with demographic and socioeconomic variables, except for educational level, where postgraduates had a higher positive percentage (Supplementary file-Table S1 ). Many participants had a family member who tested positive (n = 300; 16%). A small number of participants did not follow social isolation measures (n = 1.8%) ( Table 1) . Note: Some variables have a sum less than n = 1859, as some individuals did not inform their data; * T-Student test; ** ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test; Different letters (a, b, c) on the same column represent statistical differences (p < 0.05).In general, females presented worse QoL than males (p < 0.05), except for the economic domain, which was similar (Table 1) . Individuals age ≥ 40 y/o presented better QoL for all domains. Individuals with partners presented better QoL scores (except for the social domain-which was similar) to those without a partner. White individuals presented better QoL scores (both totals and domains) than brown and black respondents. Having children did not influence the general QoL, but individuals with children presented a lower perception of QoL regarding the economic domain than the ones without children. In most cases, a higher educational level was associated with better QoL, considering the psychological and physical aspects.Unemployed individuals presented lower QoL scores (both total and each domain). Individuals that tested positive for COVID-19 presented the lowest QoL scores (except for the economic domain). Likewise, the QoL was affected (except for the social domain) when a family member was diagnosed with COVID-19. Experiencing the disease or having a family member experience it can unearth feelings of fear of possible health consequences related to the disease and also fear of death, consequently impacting the QoL perception. Individuals not following social distancing rules presented better scores in the psychological domain than those that follow restrict social distancing rules or those that leave home only for essential purchases. However, those results were similar to those that leave home for work, family visits, and essential purchases. Regarding the social and physical domains and total score, the individuals not following social distancing rules only differed from the ones that followed social distancing rules, but leave for essential purchases and has a family member that leaves the house for work (Table 1) .The total score Cronbach alpha values for psychological, social, and economic domains scores were >0.6, demonstrating good internal consistency. The QoL during the pandemic was most affected by economic and social aspects (lower means evaluated by one-way repeated measures-ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc tests) followed by the psychological and physical, respectively ( Table 2 ). This study is the first to evaluate the Brazilian adult population's QoL related to the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic. During the data collection period (27 May to 14 August of 2020), the numbers of cases and death by COVID-19 were increasing in Brazil. During this research period, Brazil had already registered more than 3 million confirmed cases, and more than 100 thousand deaths by COVID-19 [2] . However, the number of people with COVID-19 is possibly nine to fifteen times higher than reported, due to the lack of diagnostic tests [17] [18] [19] .Our data indicate that the QoL during the pandemic period was most affected by economic and social aspects, followed by the psychological and physical factors. The results related to the economic domain were expected since the pandemic in Brazil aggravated an already difficult economic period, consequently affecting the QoL. Uncertainties about the future, such as work conditions, income, and social protection, lowered the mean scores for the economic domain of QoL. Moreover, the pandemic period in Brazil was marked by family income reduction and unemployment [20] . Despite that, most of the participants (n = 1458, 79%) were employed during the survey. However, during the pandemic, many families quarantined at home, increasing household expenses, such as water, energy, food, medicines, and other bills, which can influence the QoL, despite reducing their expenditure on other non-essential categories, such as office supplies and beauty products [21] [22] [23] . A small number of participants did not follow social distancing rules (n = 33; 1.8%), potentially influencing the social domain of QoL. However, only 125 (6.7%) followed social distancing, not leaving home to work, visit family members, or essential purchases. The individuals not complying with social distancing guidelines presented better scores in the psychological domain than those that followed these guidelines, as well as those that followed the guidelines and only left their home for the absolutely essential. In addition to social isolation, the psychological domain can be affected by the fear of contracting COVID-19. It could be speculated that because the Brazilian president repeatedly stated that COVID-19 was like the flu, that a portion of the Brazilian population was not worried about the possibility of contracting COVID-19.Social isolation measures were implemented in an attempt to prevent widespread community transmission. Most Brazilian cities closed restaurants, bars, night clubs, gyms, parks, shopping malls, and large events and gatherings were suspended while data was collected. Therefore, even those not following social distancing rules were restricted in their activities and the number of people they interacted with [24] . Additionally, these measures had critical socioeconomic implications, which affected the QoL of many, since these measures severely interfered with the outflow of industrial products and commodities, reduced local purchases, which interfered with people's daily lives [24] .Data suggests that female respondents presented a worse perception of QoL than male respondents. In Brazil, women play a central role in food purchase and preparation for the family and are frequently responsible for household food decisions and housework [25, 26] . While social distancing rules were in effect, women were responsible for the bulk of domestic chores, child-rearing, and education, in addition to their jobs, impacting their QoL compared to men. Data showed that white respondents presented better QoL scores (total and domains) than brown and black respondents. On average, black and brown Brazilians earn half the income of white individuals [27] and have limited access to healthcare services, negatively affecting their QoL. Data also suggests that individuals aged ≥40 y/o presented better QoL for all domains. Individuals with partners presented best QoL scores (except for the social domain-which was similar) than the ones without a partner, probably because marriage is associated with higher life satisfaction and happiness, related to better mental and physical health, emotional well-being and QoL and longevity [28] [29] [30] . Having children did not influence respondents general QoL. However, individuals with children presented a lower QoL perception regarding the economic domain than those without children. These results are most likely due to a larger household (children), generating additional expenses, such as water, energy, food, and other bills during the quarantine.A higher educational level is frequently associated with a higher perception of QoL. A study by Ryff and Heidrich, 1997 [31] showed that work and education experiences change life's purpose. Higher education levels are associated with happiness and satisfaction and strongly affect income [32] , potentially explaining our results. Unemployed individuals presented the lowest QoL scores (total and in each domain) explained by the economic burden that affects all QoL aspects, mainly during isolation, and the increase in household bills. Uncertainties about the future during a challenging economic period, such as future work conditions and employment, income, and social safety net, tend to lower the mean scores for QoL [8] .Our data showed that the four domains presented a good fit in the confirmatory factor analysis (RMSEA = 0.0068 (95% CI: 0-0.0157); CFI = 0.9992 and chi2 = 109.63; df = 101; p = 0.262), which means that the measures of the constructs are consistent with the understanding of their nature [14, 16] . The total score Cronbach alpha values for psychological, social, and economic domains scores were >0.6, demonstrating good internal consistency. However, this study presents some limitations. First, despite a large number of participants, a convenience sample was used, which makes it harder to generalize the results. On the other hand, utilizing an online survey during a pandemic made it possible to reach individuals in every region of the country. Data from the latest survey published by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics showed that three out of four Brazilians in metropolitan areas (most of our participants) have internet access [33] . Therefore, although web-based research might be limited because it is impossible to reach a portion of the population, it can still be considered a viable strategy, since our questionnaire could be answered on any device. Moreover, our sample was composed mainly of females (72%), which can also be seen as a limitation. However, females tend to be more concerned about their health and participate in health surveys more frequently than males [34, 35] .Another potential limitation is that it is a cross-sectional study and lacks pre-COVID-19 data for comparison; however, the data can be used for future comparisons. Although, social and family support is considered necessary in QoL study during the pandemic [8] , it was not measured in this study.Pandemics have historically posed a challenge for governments and individuals. During the pandemic, Brazilian's QoL was more affected by economic and social aspects than psychological and physical. Having children (or not) and place of residence (urban or rural areas) did not influence the total QoL score. The psychological and physical domains were not affected by the educational level, place of residency, or whether or not respondents had children or not. The social domain was not affected by having children (or not), and place of residency, a family member diagnosed with COVID-19, or by marital status. The economic domain was not influenced by gender, place of residency, or by individuals who test positive or not for COVID-19. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate how the length of isolation affected participants and compare the period during and after the COVID-19 pandemic period. How old are you (years)?

b0b83d576d104aded62370fbc44f3d366486f6b8,"diseases Can Melatonin Be a Potential ""Silver Bullet"" in Treating COVID-19 Patients?","According to Wikipedia, in folklore, a bullet cast from silver is often one of the few weapons that are effective against a werewolf or witch [1] . The term is also a metaphor for a simple, seemingly magical solution to a difficult problem: For example, penicillin was a silver bullet that allowed treatment and successfully cures of many bacterial infections. We discuss in the present minireview the potentiality of melatonin, a molecule of unusual phylogenetic conservation present in all known aerobic organisms, to serve as a preventive and therapeutic agent in COVID-19 pandemic.Such a possibility has been the subject of analysis in the literature [2, 3] . As an extension to that view, we hereby discuss evidence implying that melatonin (a) prevents SARS-of CoV-2 infection; (b) is suitable as an effective anti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory/antioxidant agent; (c) counteracts chronodisruption; (d) combats several comorbidities such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases, which aggravate COVID-19T lymphocytes are the most evolved cells of the human immune system. T helper lymphocyte (Th) (CD4+) cells typically include Th1, Th2, and Th17 (CD4+CD17+) cells and regulatory T (Treg) (CD4+CD25+) cells. Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells are called effector T cells, relative to Treg cells [23] . Despite the great complexity of the immune system, the foundations of its function are substantially based on three main T lymphocyte subsets, namely Th1, Treg, and T17 lymphocytes.Th cells activate T reg lymphocytes [24] , inhibit the Th17 cells [25, 26] , and promote antigen-independent cytotoxicity by inducing the evolution of natural killer (NK) cells into lymphokine-activated killer cells [27] [28] [29] . The most important actions of Th cells are accomplished by secretion of IL-2, the main growth factor for T lymphocytes [27, 30] .Relationships occurring among these three major T lymphocyte subsets constitute major biomarkers of the main human systemic diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Three relevant ratios include the Th1-to-Treg cell ratio (Th1/Treg R), Th17-to-Treg cell ratio (Th17/T reg R), and Th1-to-Th17 cell ratio (Th1/Th17 R). An abnormally low Th1/Treg ratio is the main characteristic of advanced neoplasms, depending on a decrease in Th1 cell count in association with an increase in T reg cell number [31] . An increase in Th17/Treg R, due to an increase in Th17 cells and a decline in T reg cells inhibited by the action of Th17 cells [26] , is the main characteristic of autoimmune diseases. Such an increase in Th17/Treg R occurs also in coronavirus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome [32, 33] .The primary pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection involves the dramatic upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, induced by the activation of neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells (""cytokine storm""). It includes increases in interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-17; C-reactive protein; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, and it is usually followed within one week by a gradual increase in levels and activity of the endogenous anti-viral cells, viz CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and γ δ-T cells [34] . However, the activity of this anti-viral response is impaired in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these suppressed cells showing evidence of exhaustion, which is classically associated with the immune-suppression observed in the tumor microenvironment.Melatonin exerts anti-inflammatory effects through various pathways. One of them is sirtuin-1, which inhibits the polarization of macrophages towards the proinflammatory type [35, 36] . The antiinflammatory effect of melatonin also includes the suppression of NF-κB activation [37] [38] [39] . Moreover, the production of Nrf2 was stimulated by melatonin in hepatoprotection and cardioprotection studies [40] . Inflammation is commonly associated with elevated production of cytokines and chemokines. Melatonin causes a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, L-8, IL-17) and an elevation in the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 [35, 41] . In SARS-CoV-2 infection, hyperinflammatory monocytes/macrophages accumulate in abundance in the lower respiratory tract, where they play a key role in determining the severity of the disease. Monocytes/macrophages infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus reprogram their metabolism from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the cytosolic glycolysis for ATP production (Warburg effect) via generation of reactive oxygen species that stabilize hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) [42] . Monocytes/macrophages functioning with this metabolic phenotype produce more cytokines, leading to T cell destruction and killing of the alveolar lining cells, severely aggravating the COVID-19 infection. Melatonin converts highly pro-inflammatory glycolytic M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, which utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [43] . This effect of melatonin may be exerted via the well-documented down-regulation of HIF-1α [36] .In both the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus, melatonin has important antioxidant and scavenging effects on free radicals, which are largely independent of receptors [41] . These effects are exerted in three ways: (a) melatonin is a free radical scavenger; (b) melatonin is metabolized to compounds with high antioxidant activity; and (c) melatonin is an indirect antioxidant, which stimulates the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes and inhibits that of prooxidant enzymes. Melatonin has a proven superiority to vitamin C and E in protection against oxidative damage and the elimination of free radicals [44] . In addition, melatonin potentiates the effects of other antioxidants, such as vitamin C and Trolox. Several antiapoptotic and cytoprotective effects of melatonin are exerted under conditions of ischemia (unrelated to free radicals) and can be attributed to its stabilizing action on the mitochondrial membrane [45] .In diseases showing a high level of inflammation, the application of melatonin showed promising results with strong attenuation of circulating cytokine levels. This was documented in patients with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis [46] and severe multiple sclerosis [47] . Moreover, in the acute phase of inflammation, during surgical stress [48] , cerebral reperfusion [49] , or reperfusion of the coronary artery [50] , treatment with melatonin reduced the level of proinflammatory cytokines.Generally, these anti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory and antioxidant effects of melatonin need doses as calculated by allometry that are well above the 3-10 mg/day range in which melatonin exerts chronobiotic effects. Allometry applies to properties whose proportions change as a function of size, as opposed to isometry whose relationship to size remains constant. Body surface area, rather than body weight, correlates well across several mammalian species with several parameters of biology, including oxygen utilization, caloric expenditure, basal metabolism, blood volume, circulating plasma proteins, and renal function, and has been advocated as a factor to be used when converting a dose for translation from animals to humans [51] . Allometry is commonly used for determining doses for Phase I human clinical drug trials. In clinical medicine, it has been feasible to convert adult data by allometry to predict drug pharmacokinetic parameters in children, which can significantly decrease the occurrences of toxicity and mortality for new drugs used in children. Noteworthily, theoretical human equivalent doses calculated from animal studies examining the anti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory/antioxidant activity of melatonin ranged from 2-to 3-orders of magnitude greater than those usually employed in humans, i.e., in the 100-300 mg/day range [52] .According to the COVID-19 clinical reports, patients with a severe infection have an increased risk of sepsis and cardiac arrest [53, 54] . The available information indicates that the application of melatonin can improve septic shock through inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway [55] . In rats, melatonin has a preventive effect against sepsis-induced kidney damage, septic cardiomyopathy, and liver damage [56] [57] [58] . In human neonatal sepsis, the improvement of clinical outcome after melatonin treatment was documented [59] [60] [61] [62] . Melatonin has also been reported as beneficial in patients with myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, and pulmonary hypertension. In critically affected patients, deep sedation is associated with increased long-term mortality, and the application of melatonin reduces the use of sedation and the frequency of pain, agitation, and anxiety [63] and also improves the quality of sleep in intensive care unit patients. Therefore, the rationale for the use of high doses of melatonin in COVID-19 focuses not only on the attenuation of infection-induced respiratory disorders but also on general improvement and prevention of possible complications, including neurologic complications [64] .A recent study determined the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose melatonin (36 mg/day to 72 mg/day p.o. in four divided doses) as adjuvant therapy, in addition to standard and/or empirical therapy [65] . All the patients were admitted with flu-like symptoms and chest imaging findings of ground-glass opacities highly suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. The 10 patients given melatonin had high-risk features determined for age (>60 years) or/and established comorbidities. No significant side effects were noted except for drowsiness. Benefits of time for clinical improvement (reduction of symptoms, stabilization and/or regression of lung infiltrates, decrease in proinflammatory markers) were observed, as well as the need for mechanical ventilation, duration of hospital stay, and outcome (death, or recovery and discharge) [65] .Another recent report was a retrospective analysis based on the clinical experience at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center related to drugs used to treat respiratory distress in COVID-19-infected patients who required endotracheal intubation [66] . After a comprehensive evaluation of 791 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who required intubation, the application of melatonin was the only drug that was statistically associated with higher positive clinical outcomes, including survival in intubated patients as well as in those requiring mechanical ventilation. As of the present date November 23, 2020, this paper is published as a preprint [66] .The term chronobiotic was introduced in the early 1970s and has been used to broadly define a drug that affects the physiological regulation of the body clock and, specifically, one that is capable of therapeutically recovering desynchronized circadian rhythms in the short or long term, or prophylactically avoiding its interruption after an environmental attack [67] . The magnitude and direction of phase changes depend on the circadian phase in which the compound is administered, which in turn produces pronounced phase changes in behavioral rhythms. For example, melatonin given in the morning delays the phase of circadian rhythms, while when given in the evening it advances the phase of circadian rhythms. For most of the day, melatonin administration is unable to modify the phase of the endogenous clock (phase-response curve) [68] .The association of aging with a higher vulnerability to COVID-19 infection is a subject of major importance. Several factors, including higher stress due to social isolation, diminished melatonin levels with age, and inadequate exposure of individuals to light in the evening, which reduces melatonin levels and disrupts circadian rhythmicity, are important for maintaining the circadian health in aged individuals. Among several other comorbidities, the aged population is more prone to suffer from coronavirus infection, and the association of aging with a higher vulnerability to COVID-19 infection is currently a subject of major importance [33] . Increased stress and depression in socially isolated seniors lead to increased proinflammatory and decreased anti-viral immune responses. Among the consequences of staying indoors during the forced lockdown period, disruption of circadian rhythmicity, particularly of the sleep/wake cycle, is highly frequent, and age-associated circadian misalignment develops. Dysregulation of circadian timing systems is thought to be involved in several medical and mental conditions in aged individuals, especially cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [69, 70] .Forced lockdown such as during the current pandemic disrupts timing and duration of exposure to ambient light, the most important environmental Zeitgeber. The use of mobile phones, tablets, and computers to watch the news, binge-watching of web series, and connecting on social media leads to excessive screen time in evening hours. The blue light emitted from screens suppresses the natural production of melatonin at night. Activity levels during the day also influence the sleep pattern; low levels of activity (whether due to confinement or depression) negatively affect sleep, as does strenuous activity (e.g., due to stress or work overload) [71, 72] .Aging often is associated with a significant reduction in sleep efficiency and continuity, and this coincides with a significant reduction in amplitude of the melatonin rhythm and consequently of many other circadian rhythms as well [73] . An increase in early morning awakenings and difficulty in falling asleep have been frequently reported in the elderly. Impaired melatonin secretion is associated with sleep disorders that are encountered in elderly insomniacs. Indeed, aging may be a process resulting from, or aggravated by, the relative circadian desynchrony produced by melatonin deficiency. Melatonin can be effective for improving the quality of life in the elderly via its recognized chronobiotic capacity [74] .The common causes of sleep disturbance during aging include, but are not limited to, lifestyle (e.g., retirement life), pre-existing medical and mental illnesses, polypharmacy, poor sleep habits, pre-existing sleep disorders, and psychological distress [75] . Sleep dysfunctions and sleep disorders are highly prevalent in the aging population [71] . As mentioned above, sleep disruption has become more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic.The objective of chronotherapy is to optimize medical treatments, taking into account the body's circadian rhythms [76, 77] . Chronotherapy works via two means: (a) it alters the sleep/wake rhythms of patients to improve the sequels of several pathologies; and (b) improved timing of therapies can be achieved by evaluation of the circadian rhythms of patients. Both approaches are relevant for implementation of chronotherapeutic strategies in aged individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic.Even minor dysfunctions of the biological clock can greatly affect sleep/wake physiology, causing excessive diurnal somnolence, increase in sleep onset latency, phase delays or advances in sleep onset, frequent night awakenings, reduced sleep efficiency, delayed and shortened rapid eye movement sleep, or increased periodic leg movements [78] . Chronotherapy is designed to restore the proper circadian pattern of the sleep-wake cycle in the elderly through adequate sleep hygiene, timed light exposure, and the use of a chronobiotic medication like melatonin, which affects the output phase of circadian rhythms, thus controlling the clock [79] .Concerning the second basis of chronotherapy, it should be stressed that the immune system displays very strong circadian rhythmicity [80] . At the beginning of daily activity, there is increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-12, as well as macrophage and leukocyte activity, which leads to potential damage to tissues. By contrast, anti-inflammatory mediators and other growth or angiogenesis factors peak during the resting phase (see, for example, [81] ). Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activities against viral antigens reach their highest levels during the resting phase, while the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells is most severe at the beginning of the active part of the day.Indeed, the time of day in which a viral infection occurs affects survival. For instance, infections at the beginning of the activity phase are more fatal than infections that occur at the beginning of the resting phase [82] . These temporal patterns may be disrupted in aged individuals, and thus circadian disorganization should be taken into account when using immune modulators and anti-inflammatory agents in the older population [81] . It is plausible that proper circadian timing of anti-inflammatory drugs (chronotherapy) can target the detrimental inflammatory cascade in COVID-19 patients without interfering with the fight of the immune system against the virus. This can be extremely important for low dose dexamethasone treatment, given the recent demonstration that it may reduce mortality in severely-infected COVID-19 patients to one-third [83] .Delirium is found in up to 50% of hospitalized elderly patients and 80% of critically ill patients who receive mechanical ventilation [84] . Treatment of this chronodisruption with melatonin is associated with a shortened intensive care unit stay, reduced prevalence of delirium, and improved sleep quality [85] . In COVID-19 disease, about 15% of hospitalized patients show impaired consciousness ranging from somnolence to confusion, delirium, stupor, and coma [86] . Melatonin should be considered as an agent effective in improving sleep and with the potential to minimize the administration of benzodiazepines or antipsychotics that could worsen delirium in the elderly or those with central respiratory depression [87] .Diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases are comorbidities that aggravate COVID-19 disease. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome varies from 15 to 30% depending on the region of the world considered, and an increase of 1.5 to 2.5 times in cardiovascular mortality occurs when the metabolic syndrome is present [88, 89] . As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, it is estimated that individuals with metabolic syndrome following diabetes mellitus type 2 might have up to ten times greater risk of death due to COVID-19 [90] . The number of identified cardiovascular comorbidities in confirmed COVID-19 cases varied from 4.2% to 40%, and the incidence of acute cardiac injury in the course of the disease ranged from 12% to 23% according to illness severity of COVID-19-patients investigated [91] . Thus, an adequate control of these diseases is a major goal to achieve in the ongoing pandemic.In humans, circulating melatonin levels are consistently reduced in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases, and the therapeutic value of melatonin has been suggested by a limited number of clinical trials generally employing melatonin in the 2-5 mg/day range [92, 93] . In animal model studies of the metabolic syndrome, and ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases, melatonin was very effective in curtailing symptomatology [52] . Almost every cell in the human body contains melatonin in quantities much higher than those circulating in blood-derived from the pineal gland [94] . The mitochondrial capacity to synthesize melatonin has now been confirmed, but for reasons that remain unexplained, intracellular melatonin does not enter the extracellular space. To modify intracellular melatonin levels, doses much higher than those employed as a chronobiotic are needed [95] . Moreover, allometric calculations derived from animal studies indicate projected cytoprotective melatonin doses for humans in the 40-100 mg/day range, doses that are rarely employed in clinical practice.In patients with severe COVID-19 disease, neurological complications comprising anosmia, stroke, paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, encephalopathy, delirium, meningitis, and seizures have been documented (see, for example, [64, 96] ). It remains to be established whether neurological abnormalities are caused by SARS-CoV-2 itself, by the exaggerated cytokine response it triggers, and/or by the increased formation of blood clots in brain blood vessels. In patients with neurological symptoms, augmented cerebrospinal fluid autoantibodies [97] , white matter change in the brain [98, 99] , and psychological and psychiatric consequences occur [100] .In a recent study, to the present date (23 November 2020) published as a preprint, cognitive test data were obtained from 84,285 Great British Intelligence Test participants who completed a questionnaire regarding suspected and biologically confirmed COVID-19 infection [101] . People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, and pre-existing medical disorders. The scale of the observed deficits was equivalent to an average 10-year decline in global performance between the ages of 20 to 70 within this dataset. As a comparison, the authors remarked that this deficit was larger than the mean deficit of 512 people who indicated they had previously suffered a stroke and 1016 who reported learning disabilities [101] . ""Brain fog"", i.e., confusion, forgetfulness, inability to focus, fatigue, and low mental energy [102, 103] may be thus an emerging major sequela of COVID-19 infection (Figure 1) .In this context, the neuroprotective properties of melatonin deserve consideration [104] . An analysis of published data using melatonin in the early stages of cognitive decline consistently showed that administration of melatonin, every night before retiring, improves the quality of sleep and cognitive performance disease [105] . Patients treated with melatonin showed significantly better performance in various neuropsychological tests. They also had lower scores in the Beck Depression Inventory concomitantly with improvement in the quality of sleep and wakefulness [106] . who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, and pre-existing medical disorders.

""Brain fog"", i.e., confusion, forgetfulness, inability to focus, fatigue, and low mental energy [102, 103] may be thus an emerging major sequela of COVID-19 infection ( Figure  1 ).Melatonin as a potential ""silver bullet"" in the COVID 19 pandemic, as exemplified in the brain. Melatonin has possible antiviral activity by interfering with SARS-CoV-2/angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 association. As an antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory compound, melatonin impairs the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Melatonin is an effective chronobiotic agent that reverse circadian disruption and delirium in intensive care unit patients. Melatonin may prevent neurological sequelae in COVID-19-infected patients like ""brain fog"" and cognitive decay. Melatonin can be an adjuvant for augmenting the efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Patients treated with melatonin showed significantly better performance in various neuropsychological tests. They also had lower scores in the Beck Depression Inventory concomitantly with improvement in the quality of sleep and wakefulness [106] .Retinal cells are particularly vulnerable to neurodegeneration. For example, in patients with Parkinson's disease, a thinner lamina cribrosa (the site where optic nerve axons of the retina run) has been documented [107] . A recent study [108] explored the effect of melatonin treatment on lamina cribrosa thickness in patients with minimal cognitive impairment. After 6 months, treatment with 0.15 mg/kg melatonin significantly augmented lamina cribrosa thickness and hippocampal volume, decreased CSF tau levels, and improved the mini mental score as compared to the untreated group. Collectively, the data support the effectiveness of melatonin to Figure 1 . Melatonin as a potential ""silver bullet"" in the COVID 19 pandemic, as exemplified in the brain.

However, even if such a vaccine is established, vaccine efficacy may be inferior for the elderly and other high-risk population groups compared to people who are healthy and young. Melatonin may help to close the gap in this respect [109] .The first evidence that melatonin could increase the IgG antibody response and counteract the immunosuppressive effect of corticosteroids and/or acute stress was provided by [110] . Melatonin is effective in counteracting the immunosuppression observed in aging [111, 112] . This effect of melatonin was linked to an increase in CD4+ T lymphocytes [113] .Concerning vaccines, several studies have shown that exogenous melatonin acts as an adjuvant improving the CD8+ T cell response in cancer vaccines [114, 115] and also humoral responses against a variety of pathogens [116] . Melatonin enhances the immune response to vaccines by increasing peripheral blood CD4+ T cells and IgG-expressing B cells. These findings are particularly interesting because a recent study in convalescent COVID-19 patients found a vigorous response of CD4+ T cells to the spike protein, the main target of most vaccines, and also that such response was correlated with the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA [117] . However, in many patients, the immune response may not be have been sufficient, as relapses have already been reported, so it appears that long-term natural immunity may not prevent current and future flare-ups [118] .Therefore, the development of an effective vaccination is imperative to control the disease. COVID-19 patients, particularly the elderly group, show a decrease in the number of CD8+ T cells due to inhibition of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. Melatonin is known to stimulate IL-2 production, and by doing this, CD4+ T cells increase [119] . Therefore, its use in vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 can enhance the type of immunity that is most effective against the virus.Administration of exogenous melatonin could increase the potency of the immune response and the duration of the immunity induced by the vaccine. Moreover, due to its antioxidant properties and its pleiotropic effect on the immune system, melatonin could also prevent the adverse effects of the vaccine [109] .Unquestionably, the current COVID-19 pandemic is the most devastating event in recent history. The virus causes relatively minor damage to young populations but imposes life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with chronic inflammatory diseases. Young people do not suffer from COVID-19 as much as the elderly, among other causes because they have much higher circulating melatonin levels.Viruses induce an outstanding increase in inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin, the best natural antioxidant-anti-inflammatory-cytoprotector, has very low levels in aged patients [34] . General immunity is impaired in severely compromised COVID-19 patients, and melatonin stimulates immunity. Therefore, the use of the very safe drug melatonin in adequate doses can prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over. In addition, melatonin may help to reduce reinfections and serve as a powerful immunopotentiating adjuvant for future vaccines (Figure 2 ).

f2c4baf6c43e64efee1a483ea6125a68b76bc1bc,Evolution patterns of SARS-CoV-2: Snapshot on its genome variants,"The respiratory syndrome responsible for the current pandemic initially detected in Wuhan in late December 2019 (Na Z et al., 2020) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped viruses, with a positive single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 30,000 bases with 5 0 -cap structure and 3 0 -poly-A tail, belonging to the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales [1] . They cause mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and are genetically classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. The Alpha and Beta-CoVs can infect humans, while the Gama and Delta-CoVs infect predominantly birds [2] .The SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the current Coronavirus disease , also belongs to the genus Beta-CoV and it is considered the third major coronavirus outbreak in the last 20 years, after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [2] . On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) having established the spread (and severity) of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, declared that the COVID-19 outbreak recorded in the preceding months was a pandemic [3] . It has currently affected >200 countries. As on October 2020, about 35.6 million people have been infected, with more than 1.04 million deaths [4] . More than 24.8 million people have recovered completely, but a large number of the infected people end up in critical condition that require respiratory assistance. The Countries that have been affected most severely are the USA, Brazil, India, Russia, Mexico, South American Countries, most European Countries [4] .Adaptive mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome could alter its pathogenic potential, and at the same time would increase the difficulty of drug and vaccine development. This contribution will not deal in detail with the mass of molecular information now available for SARS-CoV-2. It will rapidly summarize the information on its evolutionary and structural features that could be useful for the development of vaccines.Genomes of Coronaviruses include a variable number of open reading frames (ORF). The first 5 0 ORF (ORF1a/b) corresponds to about 2/3 of genome, and it is translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell into pp1a and pp1ab protein that are cleaved by proteases it yields 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) [5] . The 3 0 ORF, which corresponds to the remaining third of the genome consists of genes encoding accessory and structural proteins [5] . The four major structural proteins are: the surface Spike (S) protein, which recognizes the receptor of the host cell (the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)), binds to it, and mediates the penetration of the virus into the host cell the envelope E protein, the matrix protein (M), and the nucleocapsid (N) protein that binds the RNA and is fundamental for virion assembly [1, 5] (Fig. 1) . Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 contains 6 accessory proteins, encoded by the ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, ORF10 genes: their functions are still largely unexplored. Thus, most of the proteins encoded by ORF1a and ORF1ab are essential for virus replication and at least for the adaption of the virus to a new host. In addition, a 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) and a 3 0 -UTR have also been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome [1, 5] . Some of the nsp form the replicase/transcriptase complex: nsp 12 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that replicates the RNA of the virus, however, to function perfectly it also needs nsp 7 and nsp 8 and, possibly, of other non-structural proteins. The genomic organization of the SARS-CoV-2 shares about 89% sequence identity with that of other CoVs. Comparative sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates striking similarities to that of the Bat-CoV, suggesting a possible bat origin for that in the affected humans in Wuhan [6] . The possibility of other animal intermediate hosts from bats before the introduction of the virus into humans has been discussed. Initially, the Pangolin origin of COVID-19 in humans had received significant favour, particularly based on the finding that the virus of pangolins could use ACE2 as the receptor in the host cells. However, more recent results of various experimental approaches, e.g., on the very poor affinity of the pangolin virus for the human ACE2 receptor have apparently exempted pangolins from a possible role as intermediate host. The question of the intermediate host in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from bats to human is thus not settled, and it appears possible that the transmission occurs directly [7] (Fig. 2) .Generally, the rates of nucleotide substitution of RNA viruses are fast, and this rapid evolution is mainly shaped by natural selection. This high error rate and the consequent rapidly evolving virus populations [8] , which could lead to the accumulation of amino acid mutations, might affect the transmissibility of the virus, its cell tropism and pathogenicity. It would unfortunately also present daunting challenges for the design of effective vaccines and diagnostic means. Fortunately, however, until now the observed diversity among SARS-CoV-2 sequences has been low. There has been an exception that has had dire consequences, i.e., the replacement of aspartic acid 614 of the Spike protein with a glycine, which has greatly increased the infectivity of the virus, but, in principle, the possibility of positive natural selection mutations exists. Considering its high transmissibility and the absence of pre-existing immunity in the general population its natural disappearance appears to be unlikely. Furthermore, it is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 is already fully adapted for efficient growth in human cells after its host-jump from bats or from a putative intermediate host [9] . Genomic epidemiology has revealed that the spillover from bats to humans has most likely occurred in late November or early December 2019. and that from that moment the spread of the virus occurred mainly by a human-to-human transmission [6] .Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are relatively stable thanks to a proofreading mechanism that operates during replication. Many genomic studies have nevertheless revealed changes in their genomes, including mutations and deletions. The D614G pointmutation in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which rapidly became the most widespread variant of SARS-CoV-2, has just been mentioned: we were among the first to observe it [10e12], but we had also observed that this mutation clustered with a series of other point mutations, including one in the polymerase gene [10] . A series of other mutations were then identified, allowing the classification of several SARS-CoV-2 lineages [13] . At the same time, additional profound changes in the genome, i.e. deletions, started to be reported. In particular, an extensive deletion in the ORF7a gene [14] and a deletion in the nsp2 gene [15] . More recently, analysing a more comprehensive dataset of more than 17.000 sequences obtained from GISAID we identified the emergence of a strain with a deletion of 9 nucleotides in the nsp1 gene (nucleotides 686e694 corresponding to amino acids 241e243) in patients infected with COVID-19 from different areas of the world. The overall frequency of the genome deletion was 0.44%, but was not distributed homogeneously: for instance, we did not find it in Italy, Germany, and Austria, whereas it was more frequent in Sweden, Israel, and the USA. Structural analysis suggest that this deletion might affect the C-terminal region of the protein that appear to be important for the regulation of viral replication and appear to have negative effect on host's gene expression [16] . Those results were also confirmed by other groups that highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 appear to be undergoing profound genomic changes [17, 18] . While the D614G mutation confers a selective advantage for SARS-CoV-2 fitness [11, 12] , the exact biological relevance of the other mutations is still unknown. However, nsp 1, which is also known as the leader protein, is central in the inhibition of the antiviral innate immune response, in particular the expression of interferon-alpha [19] and is possibly the most important determinant of the viral pathogenicity. We feel it is appropriate to mention that a viral isolate from an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive subject had an unprecedented replication ability in VeroE6 cells in the absence of any clear cytopathic effect [9] . Even though it was a single observation, and even if the precise molecular mechanism that explains the absence of cytopathic effect has not yet been identified, we believe that the observation is significant. Such results could indicate the evolution of a possible new viral quasispecie, but further data will be necessary in order to confirm this hypothesis. On this respect we believe that priority in this moment will be the monitoring over time of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic subjects to confirm the spreading of this particular viral strain with a possible decreased viral pathogenicity.Environmental factors, e.g., temperature, population density and air pollution, seem to affect viral spreading and mortality rate [20e24]. In addition, interventions aimed at limiting people movement and interactions have been implemented in several areas of the globe to curb the pandemic. The overall effect of these measures has been a reduction of the number of infections and the decrease of death rates. However, while it is intuitively clear that, for instance, full lockdowns by themselves are very effective, they are economically so burdensome to become impractical and unsustainable in the long run. Consequently, it becomes important to implement a series of concomitant and complementary measures to limit viral spread. One important point to be considered concerns the virus itself: at the moment there are no reasons to believe that changes of the virus have occurred in the direction of decreased pathogenicity. The decrease in the seriousness of the infection which is now generally observed is prima facie related to the containment measures: they certainly influence one parameter that is important, i.e. de magnitude of the viral load which is transmitted, thus in a sense they alter, quantitatively if not qualitatively the virus. Whether the measures above also have an effect on the viability of the viral particles has been suggested as a possibility [25, 26] . But, as we have discussed above, the chances that the virus itself may change (i.e., mutate) in the direction of decreased pathogenicity could still be considered.The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed our health care systems in an unprecedented way and underlined once more the important role of the molecular evolution succinctly described in this review. Within a few days from the first reported cases of anomalous pneumonia, significant progress was made in the fight against it: the virus was isolated, sequenced, identified and genetically characterized. It was named SARS-CoV-2 because of its phylogenetic relationship with SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. Based on its genetic features, molecular and serological assays were developed and have been introduced in routine diagnostics. Pharmacological means have been gradually discovered and introduced, and general vaccine strategies have been developed or are in development. Trials are ongoing or are about to start to determine their effectiveness. This contribution has pictured the current research on the molecular evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 after its epidemic outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling have added knowledge to the fine details of the virus, and so have done the studies exploring the genome of the virus and the structure of its proteins. The search for viral variants with decreased or no pathogenic potential would be a significant step. The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.",Brazil,first author,2020-11-06,11
1850d08df739fee92f8d40df7cf69b5861ec3010,Inference of COVID-19 epidemiological distributions from Brazilian hospital data,"Surveillance of COVID-19 has progressed from initial reports on 31 December 2019 of pneumonia with unknown aetiology in Wuhan, China [1] , to the confirmation of 9826 cases of SARS-CoV-2 across 20 countries one month later [2] , to the current pandemic of greater than 28 million confirmed cases and 900 000 deaths globally to date at the time of writing [3] . Early estimates of epidemiological distributions provided critical input that enabled modelling to identify the severity and infectiousness of the disease. The onset-to-death distribution [4, 5] , characterizing the range of times observed between the onset of first symptoms in a patient and their death, proved crucial in early estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) where it was used to estimate the cumulative number of deaths in the beginning of the epidemic in Wuhan [6] . Similarly, the onset-to-death distribution was used in recent approaches to modelling the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the reproduction number R t and other important epidemiological quantities such as the serial interval distribution [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .Initial estimates of COVID-19 epidemiological distributions necessarily relied on relatively few data points, with the events comprising these distributions occurring over a period of time that was short compared to the temporal pathologies of the disease progression, resulting in wide confidence or credible intervals and a sensitivity to time-series censoring effects [6] . Global surveillance of the disease over the past 197 days has provided more data to re-evaluate the time-delay distributions of the disease. In particular, public availability of a large number of patient-level hospital records-over 390 000 in total at the time of writing-from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe) database published by Brazil's Ministry of Health [13] , provides an opportunity to make robust statistical estimates of the onset-to-death and other time-delay distributions such as onset-to-diagnosis, length of ICU stay, onset-to-hospital-admission, onset-to-hospital-discharge, onset-to-ICU-admission and hospital-admission-todeath. In this work, we fit and present an analysis of these epidemiological distributions, with the paper set out as follows. Section 2 describes the data used from the SIVEP-Gripe database [13] , and the methodological approach applied to fit the distributions using a hierarchical Bayesian model with partial pooling. Section 3 provides a description of the results from this study from fitting epidemiological distributions at national and subnational level to a range of probability density functions (PDFs). The results are discussed in §4, including associations with socio-economic factors, such as education, segregation and poverty, and conclusions are given in §5.The SIVEP-Gripe database provides detailed patient-level records for all individuals hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness, including all suspected or confirmed cases of severe COVID-19 reported by both private and public sector healthcare institutions, from small rural hospitals to large metropolitan academic centres [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The records include the date of admission, date of onset of symptoms, state where the patient lives, state where they are being treated, and date of outcome (death or discharge), among other diagnosis related variables. We extracted the data for confirmed COVID-19 records starting on 25 February 2020 and considered records in our analysis ending on 7 July 2020. The dataset was filtered to obtain rows for onset-to-death, hospitaladmission-to-death, length of ICU stay, onset-to-hospital-admission, onset-to-hospital-discharge, onset-to-ICU-admission and onset-todiagnosis. Onset-to-diagnosis data were split into the diagnosis confirmed by PCR and those confirmed by other methods, such as rapid antibody and antigen tests, called non-PCR throughout this manuscript. Entries resulting in distribution times greater than 133 days were considered a typing error and removed, as the first recorded COVID-19 case in Brazil was on 25 February [18] .Additional filtering of the data was applied for onset-to-ICUadmission, onset-to-hospital-admission and onset-to-death in order to eliminate bias introduced by potentially erroneous entries identified in the data for these distributions. We removed the rows where admission to the hospital or ICU or death happened on the same day as onset of symptoms, assuming that these were actually incorrectly inputted entries. The decision to test removing the first day is motivated firstly by the observation of a number of conspicuous data entry errors in the database, and secondly by anomalous spikes corresponding to same-day events observed in these distributions. An example of the anomalous spikes in the onset-to-death distribution is shown in appendix B, figure 5 for selected states.Sensitivity analyses on data inclusion, regarding the removal of anomalous spikes in first-day data indicative of reporting errors (e.g. in onset-to-hospital-admission), and regarding the sensitivity of the dataset to time-series censoring effects, are set out in the results §3.3.A summary of the data, including number and a range of samples per variable from the SIVEP-Gripe dataset is given in table 1. The age-sex structure of hospitalized patients in the database with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses is presented in figure 1 . A breakdown of the number of data samples per state is provided in appendix B, table 5.Gamma, Weibull, lognormal, generalized lognormal [19] and generalized gamma [20] PDFs are fitted to several epidemiological distributions, with the specific parameterizations provided in appendix B, table 4. The parameters of each distribution are fitted in a joint Bayesian hierarchical model with partial pooling, using data from the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, extracted and filtered to identify specific epidemiological distributions such as onset-to-death, ICU-stay, and so on.As an example consider fitting a gamma PDF for the onsetto-death distribution. The gamma distribution for the i th state is given bywhere shape and scale parameters are assumed to be positively constrained, normally distributed random variablesThe parameters α Brazil and β Brazil denote the national level estimates, and s 1 N þ (0, 1) and s 2 N þ (0, 1), (2:4) where N + ( · ) is a truncated normal distribution. In this case, parameters α Brazil and β Brazil are estimated by fitting a gamma PDF to the fully pooled data, that is including the observations for all states. Prior probabilities for the national level parameters for each of the considered PDFs are chosen to be N + (0, 1). The only exception was for the more complex generalized gamma distribution which used more informed priors to speed-up fitting. The priors for the generalized gamma distribution were chosen based on the previous fits to be: μ Brazil ∼ N + (2, 0.5), σ Brazil ∼ N + (0.5, 0.5) and s Brazil ∼ N + (1.5, 0.5). Additionally, for all fitted densities, the mean and variance parameters were constrained to be positive. Posterior samples of the parameters in the model are generated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with Stan [21, 22] . For each fit, we use four chains and 2000 iterations, with half of the iterations dedicated to warm-up.The preference for one fitted model over another is characterized in terms of the Bayesian support, with the model evidence calculated to see how well a given model fits the data, and comparison between two models using Bayes Factors (BFs). BFs provide a principled fully Bayesian approach to select between models, incorporating the full posterior densities and thus also the uncertainty of each of the parameters instead of point estimates [23] [24] [25] [26] . Moreover, BFs naturally balance the complexity and accuracy of the compared models, ensuring that the excessively complex models are not automatically favoured. Historically simpler methods have been favoured, as BFs can be costly to compute for complex models, however using recent efficient methods this is not an issue [27] . The details of how to estimate the model evidence and calculate the BF for each pair of models are given in appendix A.Data cleaning and the analysis of the results was conducted using Python (v. 3.7.7) programming language [28] . The PyStan (v. 2.19.0.0) interface was used for running model fitting with Stan [29] .Five trial PDFs-gamma, Weibull, lognormal, generalized lognormal and generalized gamma-were fitted to the epidemiological data shown in figure 2 .All of the models' fits were tested by using the BFs based on the Laplace approximation and corrected using thermodynamic integration [27, 30, 31] , as described in appendix A. The thermodynamic integration contribution was negligible suggesting the posterior distributions are satisfactorily approximated as multivariate normal. The conclusions on the preferred PDF were not sensitive to the choice of prior distributions, that is the preferred model was still the favoured one even when more informative prior distributions were applied for all PDFs. The BFs used for model selection are shown in appendix B, table 6.The gamma PDF provided the best fit to the onsetto-death, hospital-admission-to-death and ICU-stay data. For the remaining distributions-onset-to-diagnosis (non-PCR), onset-to-diagnosis (PCR), onset-to-hospital-discharge, onset-to-hospital-admission and onset-to-ICU-admissionthe generalized lognormal distribution was the preferred model. The list of preferred PDFs for each distribution, together with the estimated mean, variance and PDFs' parameter values for the national fits are given in table 2. The 95% credible intervals (CrI) for parameters of each of the preferred PDFs was less than 0.1 wide, therefore in table 2 we show only point estimates.Additionally, in figure 2, in each instance the cumulative probability distribution is given for the best model fit, revealing that out of patients for whom COVID-19 is terminal, almost 70% die within 20 days of symptom onset. Out of patients who die in the hospital, almost 60% die within the first 10 days since admission.The estimated mean number of days for each distribution for Brazil is compared in table 3 with values found in the literature for China, USA and France. The majority of the data obtained through searching the literature pertained to the early stages of the epidemic in China, and no data were found for low-and middle-income countries. The mean onset-to-death time of 15.2 (95% CrI 15.1-15.3) days, from a best-fitting gamma PDF, is shorter than the 17.8 (95% CrI 16.9-19.2) days estimate from Verity et al. [6] and 20.2 (95% CrI 15.1-29.5) days estimate (14.5 days without truncation) from Linton et al. [12] In both cases, estimates were based on a small sample size from the beginning of the epidemic in China. The mean number of days for hospital-admissionto-death of 10.8 (95% CrI 10.7-10.9) for Brazil matches closely the 10 days estimated by Salje et al. [32] The onset-to-death distribution, and other time-delay distributions such as onset-to-diagnosis, length of ICU stay, onset-to-hospital-admission, onset-to-hospital-discharge, onset-to-ICU-admission and hospital-admission-to-death, have been fitted in a joint model across the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil using partial pooling. The mean number of days, plotted in figure 3, shows substantial subnational variability-for example, the mean onset-to-hospital-admission for Amazonas state was estimated to be 9.9 days (95% CrI 9.7-10.1), whereas for Mato Grosso do Sul the estimate was 6.7 (95% CrI 6.4-7.1) days and Rio de Janeiro -7.2 days (95% CrI 7.1-7.3). Amazonas state had the longest average time from onset-to-hospital-and ICU-admission. The state with the shortest average onset-to-death time was Roraima. Santa Catarina state on the other hand had a longest average onset-to-death and hospital-admission-to-death time, royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsif J. R. Soc. Interface 17: 20200596 as well as longest average ICU-stay. For a visualization of the uncertainty in our mean estimates for each state, see the posterior density plots in appendix B, figures 6 and 7. Additional national and state-level results for the onset-to-death gamma PDF, including the posterior plots for mean and variance, are shown in appendix B, figure 8 .We also observe discrepancies between the five geographical regions of Brazil, for example states belonging to the southern part of the country (Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina) had a longer average ICU-stay and hospital-admission-to-death time when compared with the states in the North region. Full results, including detailed estimates of mean, variance, and estimates for each of the distributions' parameters for Brazil and Brazilian states can be accessed at https://github.com/mrc-ide/Brazil_COVID19_ distributions/blob/master/results/results_full_table.csv.In order to remove the potential bias towards shorter outcomes from left-and right-censoring, we tested the scenario in which the data to fit the models were truncated. For example, based on a 95% quantile of 35 days for the hospital-admission-to-death distribution, entries with the starting date (hospital admission) after 2 June 2020 and those with an end-date (death) before 1 April 2020 were truncated, and the models were refitted. With censored parts of the data removed, the mean time from start to outcome increased Figure 2 . Histograms for onset-to-death, hospital-admission-to-death, ICU-stay, onset-to-hospital-admission, onset-to-hospital-discharge, onset-to-ICU-admission onset-to-diagnosis (PCR) and onset-to-diagnosis (non-PCR) distributions show data for Brazil extracted from the SIVEP-Gripe database [13] . For each distribution, solid lines are for fitted PDFs and the dashed line shows the cumulative distribution function of the best-fitting PDF. The left-hand side y-axis gives the probability value for the PDFs and the right-hand side y-axis shows the value for the cumulative distribution function. All values on the x-axes are given in days. State-level fits are shown in figure 3 and To test the impact of keeping or removing entries identified as potentially resulting from erroneous data transcription (see the methods §2), we fitted the PDFs to some of the distributions on a national level with and without those entries. For onset-to-hospital-admission, onset-to-ICU and onset-to-death we find that generalized gamma PDF was preferred when the first day of the distribution was included, and gamma (for onset-to-death) and generalized lognormal PDFs if the first day was removed. For hospitaladmission-to-death, a gamma distribution fitted most accurately when the first day was included, and Weibull when it was excluded. Removing the first day results in the mean values shifting to the right by approximately 1 day for both onset-to-hospital-and ICU-admission, and by 0.5 days for hospital-admission-to-death (see appendix B, figure 9 ).Sensitivity analysis regarding the model selection approach is detailed in appendix A.We fitted multiple probability density functions to a number of epidemiological datasets, such as onset-to-death or onsetto-diagnosis, from the Brazilian SIVEP Gripe database [13], using Bayesian hierarchical models. Our findings provide the first reliable estimates of the various epidemiological distributions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and highlight a need to consider a wider set of specific parametric distributions. Instead of relying on the ubiquitous gamma or Table 2 . For each COVID-19 distribution the preferred PDF with the largest Bayesian support is listed, along with the estimated mean, variance and other parameters of the PDF. Ninety-five per cent credible intervals are given in brackets for mean and variance. The parameters p 1 , p 2 and p 3 for the preferred PDFs gamma and generalized lognormal (GLN) are given in the form gamma(x|p 1 , p 2 ) = gamma(α, β) and GLN(x|p 1 , p 2 , p 3 ) = GLN(μ, σ, s), with the formulae of the PDFs given in appendix B, [38] , and other low-and middle-income countries [39] , but we expect they are also highly relevant to the epidemics unfolding in other countries. royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsif J. R. Soc. Interface 17: 20200596Across Brazil, the epidemic has strong geographical heterogeneity, with some states such as Amazonas and Maranhão reported to be at advanced stages [40, 41] . To describe the observed differences at subnational level accurately, using a mathematical model, it is essential to account for variation in model parameters by state. By making use of the state-level custom-fitted onset-to-death distributions reported here, we have estimated the number of active infections on 23 June 2020 across 10 states spanning the five regions of Brazil using a Bayesian hierarchical renewal-type model [7, 38, 42] . The relative change in the number of active infections from modelling the cases using heterogeneous state-specific onset-to-death distributions, compared to using a single common Brazil one, is shown in figure 4 to be substantial. Relative changes are observed of up to 18% more active infections, suggesting common assumptions of onset-to-death spatial homogeneity are unreliable and closer attention needs to be paid when fitting models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in large countries.Notably, large subnational variability was observed for all fitted distributions, with the mean onset-to-death ranging between 11.2 days in Roraima to 17.8 in Santa Catarina. Hospital-admission-to-death time showed substantial variation between the regions of Brazil, ranging between 8.1 and 11.3 in the North, and between 9.6 and 12.8 in the South. A plausible hypothesis is that the observed differences in outcome timings could be explained by greater difficulty accessing hospitals in the North, or limited access to equipment such as ventilators.In order to explain the origin of the geographical variation of average distribution times across states, shown in figure 3, we present a basic exploratory analysis based on relevant high-level features. We examined the correlation between socio-economic factors, such as education, poverty, income, wealth, deprivation and segregation, using a number of socioeconomic state-level indicators obtained from Barrozo et al. [43] and additional datasets containing the mean age per state and percentage of people living in the urban areas (urbanicity) [44] . The Pearson correlation coefficients, shown in appendix B, table 8, suggest that poverty, income, segregation and deprivation elements were most strongly correlated with the analysed onset-time datasets. In particular, poverty was strongly negatively correlated with hospital-admission-to-death (−0.68), whereas income and segregation had a high positive correlation coefficient for the same distribution (+0.60, +0.62, respectively). The strongest correlation was observed for hospital-admissionto-death and deprivation indicator, which measures the access to sanitation, electricity and other material and non-material goods [43] . Interestingly, the indicators measuring economic situation were more correlated with average hospitalization times than mean age per state, which suggests that although the low-and middle-income countries typically have younger populations, their healthcare systems are more likely to struggle in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Socio-economic factors have been also shown to correlate with the accessibility of the COVID-19 diagnosis in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, which emphasizes the impact of the spatial heterogeneity of the socio-economic status on the various aspects of the epidemic, from capturing the active cases to providing treatment for the patients [14] . More detailed analysis is necessary to fully appreciate the impact of the economic components on the COVID-19 epidemic response.Spatial heterogeneity is not the only source of variability in the hospitalization times. Although in this study, we did not stratify the population according to age or other demographic features, other recent studies have used the SIVEP-Gripe database to characterize the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. Namely, they looked at the regional and ethnic distribution of the hospitalized patients [15, 16] , age-sex structure and clinical characteristics such as co-morbidities and symptoms [14, 15] . Souza et al. [14] show that 65.5% of cases are patients over 50 years old. Moreover, they also find that 84% of the patients reported having at least one underlying condition. It is clear, that both age and co-morbidities are highly correlated with the adverse outcomes such as hospitalization or death, and to calibrate the epidemiological models of COVID-19 the time-onset distributions presented in this study could be refined further.In the work presented, we acknowledge several limitations. The database from which distributions have been extracted, though extensive, contains transcription errors, and the degree to which these bias our estimates is largely unknown. Secondly, the PDFs fitted are based on observational hospital data, and therefore should be cautiously interpreted for other settings. Thirdly, though we have fitted PDFs at subnational as well as national level, this partition is largely arbitrary and further work is required to understand the likely substantial effect of age, sex, ethnic variation, co-morbidities and other factors.We provide the first estimates of common epidemiological distributions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, based on the SIVEP-Gripe hospitalization data [13] . Extensive heterogeneity in the distributions between different states is reported. The differences are identified by comparing parametric forms, that have been fitted for each epidemiological distribution, and give a more informed and reliable basis for comparison than the empirical distributions. Quantifying the time-delay for COVID-19 onset and hospitalization data provides useful input parameters for many COVID-19 epidemiological models, especially those modelling the healthcare response in low-and middle-income countries. royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsif J.

We thank Microsoft for providing Azure credits which were used to run the analysis.To characterize which model (gamma, lognormal etc.) best fits the data, the Bayesian model evidence z = z( y|M i ) is evaluated. Here and throughout this section, y denotes the data and M i denotes the i th model from the analysed model set. As determining the model evidence requires calculating an integral over the model parameters (θ) which is generally intractable, we approximate it with z 0 = z 0 ( y|M i ), which is based on a second-order Laplace approximation [45] , q 0 = q 0 (θ|M i , y), to the true un-normalized posterior density q = q(θ|M i , y). The second-order approximated density is estimated asHere, q(û ) denotes the value of the un-normalized posterior evaluated using the mean estimates of the model's parametersû , andŜ the covariance matrix built from MCMC samples of the posterior distribution. From this expression, a second-order approximation to the model evidence, z 0 , is, where det( · ) denotes the determinant of the matrix.For each model pair, BFs were computed from the marginal likelihoods. Considering two models M i and M j , the BF iswhere z( y|M i ) is the evidence of model M i given y. If B ij > 1, the evidence is in favour of model M i . Here, for readability, we will report the BFs as 2 log(B ij ) following Kass and Raftery notation [46] . The sensitivity of our model evidence is tested with respect to the choice of hyperprior distribution, and secondly with respect to the use of the approximate second-order density q 0 . In the latter instance, this is done by performing thermodynamic integration [27, 30, 31] between q 0 and the true density q in order to obtain an asymptotically exact estimate of the marginal model evidence,The right-hand term corrects the z 0 approximation to the exact Bayesian evidence by a path integral evaluated with respect to a sampling distribution that interpolates between the two densities as q(u; l) ¼ q (1Àl) q l 0 in terms of the auxiliary coordinate λ.See additional tables (4-9) and figures (5-9) Table 4 .

9f9f2772370f058b09e0f0888bd8cddd1f95dc8f,Factors Associated with Mortality among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging RNA virus associated with a severe acute respiratory disease known as COVID-19. Globally, SARS-CoV-2 infected more than 50 million people and caused more than 1.2 million deaths until November 9, 2020. In high-income countries, COVID-19 mortality has been higher in men, older people, and those with some comorbidity, including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. 1 However, information on the risk factors in low-and middleincome countries is still scarce. Herein, we report the factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients in a poor area of Brazil.This retrospective cohort study enrolled all adults with PCRconfirmed COVID-19 who were consecutively admitted to public and private hospitals in Aracaju, Sergipe state, Northeast Brazil, from March 17 to July 14, 2020. Aracaju is a coastal city located in the poorest region in a country marked by large regional disparities. This city has an estimated population of 657,053 inhabitants and a high proportion of low-income households (42.9%). Recently, it was found that neighborhoods with poor living conditions in Aracaju are more likely to have higher COVID-19 fatality rates. 2 Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths were extracted from the microdata catalog and official bulletin of the Municipal Secretariat of Health. We excluded patients with incomplete information, pregnant women, patients aged 18 years and younger, and those treated in hospital outside of Aracaju. Data collected included the outcome of interest (death) and potential factors associated with COVID-19 mortality: gender, age, and the presence of underlying medical conditions (gastrointestinal disease, chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, neurodegenerative disease, stroke, hypothyroidism, cancer, non-HIV immunosuppressive disease, obesity, infectious disease, kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes).Data were presented as absolute and relative frequencies, and comparisons between survivors and non-survivors were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs. Logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with mortality. First, a univariate model was performed. Afterward, interaction was checked to control the relationship between covariates and their effect on the outcome. Finally, we included in multivariate analyses with backward selection all factors that have shown a relaxed P-value £ 0.30. Two multivariate models were developed. Model 1 included a standard logistic regression, and model 2 incorporated interaction for age, hypertension, and diabetes. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data were deidentified, and analyzes were performed using JASP software version 0.13 (JASP Team, Amsterdam, Netherlands).A total of 1,207 of 1,632 patients initially considered met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The median (IIQ) age was 60 (46-73) years. Seven hundred twenty-four (60.0%) were men, and 708 (58.7%) patients had at least one coexisting condition (Table 1) COVID-19 mortality has been high among critically ill patients and varies widely according to country; population characteristics including biological, environmental, and socioeconomic factors; social isolation policies; and healthsystem capacity. As other reports, older age and people with kidney and heart diseases were at a higher risk of death. 1, 3, 4 In addition, this cohort identified some novel patient-level factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, including infectious diseases coinfection and the interaction between older age and combined hypertension and diabetes.In Brazil, one in five Brazilian adults has two or more comorbidities 5 which may increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 mortality. The pivotal link between SARS-CoV-2 and downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in people with multiple comorbidities especially diabetes and hypertension may be a critical role in the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and COVID-19 severity. 6 In addition to the relationship between older age and comorbidities, people in poor communities are less likely to have access to health care and social protection, and live in crowded homes with inadequate sanitation and hygiene, which increase the risk for COVID-19 transmission and death. 2 Although only 1.0% of patients were coinfected with some infectious disease and COVID-19, there was an increased risk of death. Some infectious diseases can cause increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. 7 The dysregulated immune response in individuals with severe COVID-19 seems to be associated with a cytokine storm. However, the interaction between COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is highly complex, and further epidemiological and immunological studies should be performed.Although we could not assess effects of other important variables, such as laboratory findings, respiratory support, chronic medications, and acute organ injuries during hospitalization, this large cohort provides data on potential factors associated with COVID-19 mortality from a poor area in Brazil. As risk factors may vary across populational groups, further studies in low-and middle-income cities should be performed to better understand what factors are associated with COVID-19 mortality.",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-17,11
2009286a7d3ece709b5bc2917ee08a3c0d7bf186,,"The pandemic caused by Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 has arguably been one of the most relevant events worldwide in the last hundred years. Up to this day. different efforts have been made in various disciplines to have a better understanding of the scope of the pandemic and its effects, not only on the health of populations, but in different areas of society, such as economics, education, leisure, among many others (and arguably all of them). Because the process it is still ongoing, many of the efforts to glimpse the magnitude of the consequences of the pandemic are transient in nature and should not be thought of as complete processes. In Argentina, the first case identified as positive by COVID-19 was on March 3, 2020. By the end of August of the same year, more than 400,000 positive cases detected and nearly 8,000 deaths have been counted, although this process has accelerated significantly in recent months along with the population's testing capacity: as of June 1, nearly 16,800 cumulative positive cases and a total of 539 deaths were reported. These numbers may be artificially low on the impact of the disease given the difficulties of conducting massive tests in the countries of the region (1), but this work does not seek to question ""the right number of cases"" (although it is a relevant question in any estimation on the matter) in the country but to provide a descriptive and approximate picture of the CFR attributed to the pandemic. Traditionally, age has been one of the determining factors when considering the negative health effects of most diseases. The case of COVID-19 is no exception, as particular emphasis has been placed on age as the main determinant of the risk of death caused by the disease, and in men as the main affected. This is because the observed CFR of the virus has mostly been concentrated in adult men over 65 years of age (2) . In both Argentina and other Latin American countries, there are populations with a more rejuvenated age structure when compared to Europe, but with a higher prevalence of noncommunicable diseases caused by its own unequal epidemiological transition process (3), coupled with greater social inequality (4), more precarious housing conditions, less social protection, among other unfavorable structural situations that made the region particularly vulnerable to disease and its consequences (1.5). As is the case for other countries, in Argentina the demographic and epidemiological transition recorded different durations and sequences according to socio-economic sectors, in the urban and rural spheres, as well as in the geographical regions that make up the national territory (6) . The early beginning of Argentina's demographic transition was associated with the growth of the Pampas region and particularly in the vicinity of the region of what now makes up the space of Greater Buenos Aires (comprising the entire Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and a part of the territory of the Province of Buenos Aires, creating one of the largest Metropolitan Regions in Latin America, with about 20 million inhabitants). The results of this process are expressed that today the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires has the oldest population pyramid and one of the highest life expectancies in the country. And the provinces of the North and Northeast of the country the youngest population structures, being the regions that have presented a later social development in the aforementioned transitions (7.8) . It is then to be expected that these various structural effects could affect subnational estimates of the net CFR caused by COVID-19. In other words, it is possible that some or all of the fatality estimates caused by the disease in Argentina may be hiding effects related to the age structure of the affected population (9), either by hiding or exaggerating some differentials presented to date.This work had the objective, on the one hand, to present an estimate of the case fatality ratio caused by COVID-19 in Argentina from its arrival in the country until the end of August 2020, both nationally and subnationally, through the separation of effects linked to the age structure of cases recorded through mathematical decomposition techniques. These inputs sought to provide a clearer picture of the fatality ratio of the virus at the general level, but also by identifying at which ages the differences are greater between provinces, detecting possible foci of premature mortality.So far, the case fatality ratio (CFR) has traditionally been presented in epidemiological analyses as an indicator of the strength of mortality of the pandemic, understood as the relationship between deaths (D) and positive cases (C) of the virus.Where information on deaths distributed by age group is available, the CFR can also be expressed as the weighted sum of the different proportions of death (P) in the different fiveyear age groups (e):However, it is well known fact that dissimilar structures of the affected population can affect phenomena such as mortality and CFR and can mask and confuse the magnitude of the effects in the results obtained. Typically, standardized rates are used for this type of analysis. But the technique has an important limitation: the results are expressed according to an arbitrary standard that does not allow to see the net effects of the phenomenon in question. So instead the technique of decomposition of effects suggested by Kitagawa (10) This procedure (also known as Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition) serves to separate, in a difference of two rates corresponding to two groups G1 and G2, how much of the difference can be explained by the net effect corresponding to the incidence of the phenomenon in question (also known as ""Rate Effect"" , or in this case ""RE"") and how much of that difference responds to a compositional effect (attributable to the age structure of the groups, known as ""Composition Effect"" or ""Structure Effect"", or ""SE"" in this case).This work aimed to illustrate a descriptive and comparative picture of mortality from COVID-19 in Argentina, emphasizing the jurisdictions that were most affected by the pandemic between march and August. After some exploratory analysis, regrettably the case-detection capacities in the different provinces make most of them unsuitable for analysis. However, a comparison is possible between the Buenos Aires province (the largest of the country in population size) and the northern province of Jujuy. We can confirm that in both provinces CFR and testing patterns seem similar, that that CFR grows exponentially with age, and that CFR is higher for males than females. Furthermore, the decomposition analysis shows that differences between the jurisdictions, albeit small in magnitude, would be slightly larger if both provinces would have the same age-structure in positive cases. By presenting component differences in age groups for different jurisdictions, it is appreciated that the small magnitude differences in CFR are actually a result of components going into opposite directions that in average tend up nullifying themselves. This would suggest higher premature mortality in Buenos Aires, but a higher net CFR in Jujuy, along with differences in the compositional effects.It is also worth mentioning the limitations presented by this work: it is worth remembering that there were reasons in the scientific and health community to think that Latin America could be one of the regions most hit by the pandemic caused by COVID-19 (Nepomuceno et al., 2020) . While this is still a fledgling phenomenon, Argentina appears to be no exception: to date there are no signs indicating a slowdown in mortality that the virus could cause. Therefore, the estimates presented here are of a partial type, which must be taken into account when analyzing them. Second, the CFR is a simple but inaccurate indicator of attributable mortality in a population. While some of these effects can be corrected with mathematical procedures (decompositions, standardizations), there are other situations that the indicator cannot account for: mainly asymptomatic infected ones, which are not recorded as positive cases because they have not been tested. While the fatality rate may account for early trends in a pandemic, perhaps in the long run other indicators will be more sophisticated (11.14) . There may also be deaths attributed to COVID-19 that actually correspond to other causes and vice versa, as well as other omissions delays in burdens. It is also worth remembering that we are working here with registration instruments that are not intended for demographic analysis. Therefore, once vital statistics data becomes available, parsing with the information presented would be desirable. In addition, the distribution of positive cases by age itself may be affected by the different age structures of the population (something for which it is not controlled in this work). On the other hand, the small number of cases, while allowing an overall analysis of the components of CFR, does not allow detailed distinctions to be made by sex when breaking down the effects caused by differences in fatality rates.Despite these limitations, this work succeeded in establishing that the effects attributable to the age structure only explains a portion of the COVID-19 CFR differences established between two jurisdictions in Argentina, identified in which age groups these differences are greater and lower, and illustrated a simple mathematical decomposition procedure to make the different rates of CFR in two provinces of the country.",Argentina,abstract,2020-11-30,11
d8acd046bf0ee476952afc1ef99905d94f9a47c2,Epidemiological characteristics of deaths from COVID-19: an analysis at almost three months of the first confirmed case in Peru,"The current COVID-19 pandemic reported since December 2019 constitutes the biggest public health problem in decades. To this scenario are added the diversity of economic, social, and demographic aspects, and the different responses of health systems to identify and provide medical care to affected people. [1] [2] [3] The evolution of the pandemic, in terms of incidence, mortality, and speed of expansion, is heterogeneous, with differences between countries and even between regions of the same country. Some studies report differences in the clinical presentation and severity of the disease; Likewise, a part of those infected will require health care, including hospitalization, therefore, the structure and capacity of health systems are important for the impact of the pandemic. 1, 4, 5 Since the introduction of the pandemic in Peru, epidemiological surveillance was implemented including the notification of deaths, which is a useful tool to measure the impact of COVID-19 and mortality is the most important final indicator in pandemic circumstances. The number of deaths from COVID-19 can be influenced by the diagnostic testing strategy, health system responsiveness and the social behavior of the population, the dynamic situation between countries, among other factors. 3, 6, 7 In these circumstances, the analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of deaths from COVID-19 including the pre-hospital and hospitalization time intervals (elapsed days) could provide valuable information related to the barriers of accessibility, capacity, health system responsiveness, course and severity of the disease. These allow to understand the behavior, evolution, and trends of the health emergency in Peru and other Latin American countries. 3.8 The Republic of Peru has a population of 32 495 500 inhabitants distributed in 24 departments and a constitutional province. It is grouped into three natural regions: the coast between the coast, the Andean region, located on the mountain range of the Andes, and the jungle that encompasses the Peruvian Amazon 9 . Lima is the capital of Peru and it is located on the coast with a population that exceeds 10 million inhabitants. 10 According to the aging index, Peru is ranked number 48 out of 96 positions in the Global Aging Index and has a life expectancy of 76.5 years. The Encuestas Demográficas y de Salud Familiar (ENDES) as well as the health analyses show that the Peruvian population has a health profile dominated by noncommunicable diseases such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes mellitus, comorbidities that constitute factors risk for COVID-19. People aged 80 years or older have the highest comorbidity rates (67.6%). [11] [12] [13] [14] In May 20, 2020, the Centro Nacional de Epidemiología, Prevención y Control de Enfermedades del Ministerio de Salud del Perú had reported 108,769 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3,148 deaths with lethality of 2.89%. At that time, there was a high demand for people who required health services compared to insufficient supply, which caused the health establishments to be overwhelmed by a large number of cases while the Ministry of Health tried to organize the response with the available resources. 15 By the end of August 2020, Peru became the country with the highest mortality rate from COVID-19 in the world, reaching 89.43 deaths per one hundred thousand inhabitants, so the analysis of the characteristics of the deaths is of national and international interest 16 . The objective of this research was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of deaths from COVID-19 in Peru from March 28 to May 21, 2020, 85 days after the report of the first confirmed case.Report of case series type. The database of the epidemiological surveillance of the coronavirus disease was revised, including the deaths investigated by the personnel of the Epidemiology Offices of the notifying health facilities at the national level. The quality control and monitoring of the notification were carried out by Epidemiology personnel at the national level, sector workers assigned to each region, and Regional Health Directorates.Confirmed deaths from COVID-19 were considered for analysis; it included only those with a positive (reactive) RT-PCR result, rapid tests, or both that were notified between March 28 and May 21, 2020. Deaths not attributable to COVID-19 were excluded from the study; that is, deaths caused by entities or processes in which there was no evidence that COVID-19 infection changed the course of the disease. The sources of information on deaths from COVID-19 were as follows.− Sistema Nacional de Defunciones en Línea (SINADEF) − Database of RT-PCR test results (Netlab) and/or rapid tests (SISCOVID). − Clinical histories of hospitalized cases. − If complete information on the death was not available from these sources, telephone communication was made with the epidemiologists of the regions, who in some cases performed a verbal autopsy.From these sources, epidemiological variables such as age, gender, department of residence (probable place of infection), date of onset of symptoms, date of hospitalization, date of death, place where the death occurred, health provider institution, and diagnosis of comorbidities. In the case of comorbidities, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic kidney disease, obesity, chronic pulmonary and bronchial diseases were considered.A time analysis was performed, the pre-hospital time was defined as the time from the onset of symptoms to the date of hospitalization, and time in hospital as the time from the date of hospitalization to the date of death. Finally, it was analyzed whether the pre-hospital and hospital times showed differences according to the epidemiological characteristics evaluated. The analysis was guided under the assumption that a longer pre-hospital time indicates a delay in reaching a health facility and that a longer hospital time is an indicator of a higher survival of the cases.The statistical analysis was carried out with the statistical program SPSS version 25 for Windows. Descriptive statistics were performed based on obtaining frequencies, percentages, measures of central tendency, and dispersion. Because the variables pre-hospital time and hospital time did not present a normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and the variances were heterogeneous (Levene's test), the bivariate analysis was performed with non-parametric tests such as the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. In the case of the Kruskal-Wallis Test, a posteriori analysis was performed with the Dunn-Bonferroni Test. The calculations were performed with a confidence level of 95%.During the study period, 3,263 deaths confirmed by COVID-19 were registered, of which 11 were excluded because the death occurred due to incidental causes (acute myocardial infarction, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, diabetic ketoacidosis, tuberculous meningoencephalitis, sepsis of dermal focus and perforated appendicitis) and 8 due to incomplete data, 3244 deaths being available for analysis. Of the 3,244 deaths, 95.7% corresponded to pneumonia; while the remaining 4.3% corresponded to home deaths of cases with very fast-evolving respiratory symptoms not explained by another disease.There was a statistically significant difference in hospital time according to the region of origin (p <0.001), observing in the post hoc analysis a significantly shorter hospital time in the other departments of the coast (Dunn-Bonferroni test; p <0.001) and the Andean region (Test Dunn-Bonferroni; p = 0.014) compared to Lima (Table 2 ).This research shows that, almost three months after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Peru, deaths from COVID-19 were more frequent in males, elders, residents of the department of Lima, and the rest of the Peruvian coast. A third of the deceased had comorbidities; likewise, a considerable fraction died at home, shelter, penitentiary institution, public road or in transit to a hospital. Pre-hospital time is affected by age group and gender; while, hospital time is also influenced by the region of origin and the health provider.Deaths from COVID-19 were more frequent in elders 17 which is similar to the study reported by Kang 18 who finds an exponential increase in the death rate from COVID-19 as age increases, regardless of the geographical region. The greater vulnerability in elders could also be explained by changes that occur in the immune system due to aging and that affect innate and adaptive immunity (Immunosenescence) [17] [18] [19] . Studies conducted in China show that the age-related pattern of death from COVID-19 differs from other respiratory viruses, where the severity pattern is often described as a U-shaped curve, with morbidity and mortality concentrated in groups of extreme age (young children and the elderly) unlike COVID-19 which affects adults and is concentrated in elders. 18, 20 In the present series of cases, it is observed that seven out of every ten deaths were men, which could be explained by the greater severity of the disease in them 21, 22 . On the other hand, it was observed that a third of deaths from COVID-19 were associated with comorbidity, which could be explained by the greater severity and speed of the clinical picture observed in people with comorbidities that frequently lead to death. 23, 24 Regarding the place of occurrence, 16% of the deaths during the study period were out-ofhospital. Casualty occurred at the patients' home, accommodation or nursing home, shelter, penitentiary institution, on the public road or in transit to a hospital. The proportion of out-ofhospital deaths is considerably higher than that observed on March 31, 2020, in which 0.2% of deaths confirmed by COVID-19 were out-of-hospital 25 and on April 30, 2020, where the proportion of out-of-hospital deaths accounted for 8.2 % of total confirmed deaths 26 . This could be related to the collapse of health services, observing that the number of hospital beds, ICU beds, medical specialists, and health professionals available was largely insufficient 27, 28 . The high proportion of out-of-hospital deaths that occurred in Peru, as well as in other Latin American countries, reflects the great impact of COVID-19 on health systems, as well as the inequity in the population's access to health services, particularly in countries with fragmented health systems like Peru. [29] [30] [31] Other aspects that would explain the high proportion of home fatalities were self-medication and insufficient oxygen supply. At first, a significant fraction of the population preferred to selfmedicate with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, and even chlorine dioxide instead of going to a hospital and causing death due to the rapid evolution of the disease. Later, the supply of oxygen proved to be largely insufficient in public health facilities in the interior of the country as they did not have oxygen plants, which led people to decide to manage their family members at home, acquiring oxygen from private providers combined with the exaggerated increase in the cost of this service, so many families could not afford it. It should be noted that a study carried out in a hospital in Lima 32 found that oxygen saturation less than 85% was the main predictor of death in people with COVID-19 pneumonia.On the other hand, hospital time was shorter in the departments of the coast and the Andean region, which indicates that the disease evolved very rapidly and cases died more quickly than in the department of Lima, which has also been documented in countries such as Ecuador, which experienced greater difficulties in cities located on the coast such as Guayaquil 35, 36 . This could be due to the delay in the arrival of the cases to health services, as well as the lower resolution capacity of the hospitals in these departments compared to Lima.Private clinics and hospitals of the PNP / FF.AA showed longer survival time of the cases, in contrast to the establishments of the Ministry of Health and Social Security, which faced high demand for cases that far exceeded the supply provided. Countries like China that were more efficient in improving their response capacity in the short term (Increase in the number of hospitals, the number of hospital beds, beds in intensive care units, and specialized health personnel) presented better results in the management of hospitalized cases. with the consequent reduction in the number of deaths. 37 Within the limitations, it must be considered that our study was carried out using secondary sources, so it is possible that there are quality problems and underreporting to some degree; however, the fact of having considered several sources of information, as well as the verification and investigation of each death, would partially offset these limitations. Studies carried out in Italy 8 show that at the peak of the epidemic, out-of-hospital deaths escaped more frequently from the official COVID19 registries, particularly deaths at home or those that occurred in nursing homes.Another limitation is that the molecular RT-PCR test is not considered a laboratory test in all cases, but rather a significant fraction of cases were diagnosed using rapid tests. Nevertheless, it should be considered that the vast majority of them presented a clinical picture compatible with coronavirus pneumonia and a significant fraction was hospitalized, for this reason, making it difficult for deaths to respond to another etiology.In conclusion, deaths from COVID-19 occur mainly in male, elder, residents of Lima, and other coastal departments, with considerable deaths at home, in shelters, on public roads, penitentiary institutions, or in transit to a hospital. Pre-hospital time is affected by age group and gender; while, hospital time is also influenced by the region of origin and the health care provider.",Peru,abstract,2020-11-07,11

7b6e23389d4865ffb306b3444369c58f61363aea,COVID-19 Infection Detection and Prevention by SARS-CoV-2 Active Antigens: A Synthetic Vaccine Approach,"COVID-19, also known as new coronavirus disease, is a severe respiratory acute syndrome in humans caused by the positive strand RNA SARS-CoV-2 virus which belongs to the beta-coronavirus family (β-CoVs) and which became a severe epidemic, currently having taken more than a million lives and infected close to fifty one million people worldwide between December 2019 and November 2020 [1] . The family of CoVs is a class of enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural origins. These viruses can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases.The SARS-CoV-2 is composed of a 30 kb genome coding for sixteen non-structural proteins (NSPs), four structural proteins (SPs) named S, E, M and N, as well as some accessory proteins (APs) under control of ten open reading frames (ORFs). Genome organization of SARS-CoV-2 is known as 5 -leader-UTR-replicase-S(Spike)-E(Envelope)-M(Membrane)-N(Nucleocapsid)-3 -UTR-poly(A) tail. Accessory genes are interspersed within the structural genes at the 3 -end of this genome. The first Wuhan (people's republic of China) SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated was reported and stored under the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), U.S. National Library of Medicine, as the reference sequence coded NC_045512.2. Then, worldwide virus sequence isolates were reported including Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964 and EPI_ISL_412964), Italy (MT066156.1), and Colombia (EPI_ISL_417924) as being the eighth most infected nation in agreement with data from more than 180 countries. Population genetic evaluations of more than 100 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, shown that this virus family possess two major lineages known as S and L, the L being more prevalent than the S lineage.Among structural proteins, a capsid containing the positive single strand (ss) viral RNA anchor a protein termed spike (S) coded by the ORF2 which is a 1288 amino-acids protein of apparent molecular weight of 142 kDa (GeneID: 43740568) [2] . Spike is composed of two S1 (700 amino-acids) and S2 (600 amino-acids) sub-units. S1 includes the receptor binding domain (RBD) from 333 to 527 position, which binds its human receptor to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein which is ubiquitously present in almost all human cells, tissues and organs including lungs, hearth, liver and kidneys. Three S1/S2 hetero dimers are assembled to form a trimer spike protruding from the viral envelope. The spike trimeric molecular arrangement on each single chain contains an ectodomain composed of sites 1 and 2 responsible for receptor binding and cell entry having a Kd of~15 nM [3, 4] . Interestingly, a highly conserved cryptic epitope on the spike RBD was identified [5] . Recently, evidence demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through ACE2 can be inhibited by specific compounds was reported [6] .It is known that the virus unit ranges between 60~100 nm of apparent diameter and appears round shaped. A simple scheme for genome and structure organization for the SARS-CoV-2 can be observed in Figure 1a . The virus harbors 10 open reading frames (ORFs) coding for all structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins as described in Figure 1b .The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a transmembrane glycoprotein family having a predicted size of 1255 amino-acids possessing a leader sequence from residues 1 to 14, an ectodomain from residues 15 to 1190, a transmembrane domain from 1191 to 1227 residue, and a short intracellular tail from 1227 to 1255 residue, as described elsewhere. Interestingly, the trimeric spike structure conformation possesses both a closed and an open form as recently published [7] . Structure coordinate files for both the open and closed spike protein-states were stored under codes 6vsb and 6vxx, respectively, in the protein data bank (PDB). The spike RBD-ACEII 3D structure-complex was deeply studied and filed with the 6m0j PDB code [8, 9] .Likewise, an envelope E gene is coded by the ORF4. E protein is a small polypeptide (76-109 amino acids) of apparently 10 kDa molecular weight and a pI of 8.57 and contains a single alpha-helical transmembrane domain. It is arranged as a pentamer protein on the virus capsid surface and has been identified as YP_009724392.1 (GeneID: 43740570) and its 3D structure coordinates were stored (PDB code 5x29) [9] . The E gene expression medium size polypeptide product is known as a non-glycosylated small transmembrane protein, and it appears to act as a molecular engine promoting the SARS-CoV-2 assembling in the host cytosolic compartments such as Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum [10] . A virus matrix named M protein, is coded by the ORF5, and identified as YP_009724393.1 (GeneID: 43740571), is a glycoprotein of 25-30 kDa and is highly abundant on the virus surface. It is known that M interacts with E protein, and so it seems to be relevant for the SARS-CoV-2 maturation, as such M becomes a key piece for the virus assembling. To date, the M protein 3D structure properties have not been reported to the PDB.On the other hand, a nucleocapsid phospho-protein known as N is coded by the ORF9 (GeneID: 43740575). This gene's expression product has a molecular weight between 45 and 50 kDa (YP_009724397.2). It is known that N is the most conserved among all structure proteins of coronaviruses, it appears to be required in virus RNA encapsidation, and it seems to be relevant for the virus replication. Protein dimers of N are assembled in hexamers and such complexes' 3D structure coordinates have been stored under PDB codes 6m3m and 6 wkp, respectively [9] .The membrane proteins S, E and M are inserted into the intermediate compartment of the virus capsid while the viral RNA undergoes replication as being assembled in the N protein. This RNA-protein complex is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-inserted M protein, allowing the virus to assemble and migrate to the Golgi complex and an eventual virus release from the host cell can occur by exocytosis.Additionally, 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs) are coded by ORF1a/1b and actively participate in the virus RNA replication. Some accessory proteins of non-well understood functions are coded by genes from ORF3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, 9c and 10. All SARS-Cov-2 protein 3D structures were revised from their primary sources [11] .On the other hand, a global effort started with more than 140 vaccine candidate proposals for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine but only two have been currently approved despite lacking safety information thereof. The most promising 37 vaccine candidates were focused on approaches based on non-replicating RNA virus vectors and inactivated virus, and a few of them are viral inserts on double-stranded foreign DNA, and others presented as recombinant protein sub-units, most of them based on the spike protein structure [12] . To date, most of these vaccine candidates are enrolled on Phases I/II/III clinical trials evidencing encouraging results. However, these candidates' safety and potency become a real concern for the scientific community [13, 14] . Due to the importance of having vaccine candidates able to be used in large human populations, synthetic strategies emerged as an alternative pathway towards specific, safe and efficient vaccine candidates. In addition, animal models and ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests for assaying COVID-19 vaccine candidate stimulated antibodies are relevant matters which are undergoing testing world-wide.In the present work, we present evidence of antigenic activity of synthetic site-directed designed components based on SARS-CoV-2-structure when faced with the antibodies of patients with COVID-19, revealing the potential of an envisioned strategy towards infection detection, and virus vaccine candidate selection. Evidence of long-lasting antibody immunity is briefly discussed.Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 reported genomes were the basis for designing and obtaining the main amino-acid sequences and peptides reported in the present work. Therefore, genome data to isolate the SARS-CoV-2 virus and sequencing information was downloaded from NCBI and GISAID databases [11, 15] .A second step, consisting of a multiple sequence alignment of mostly SARS-CoV-2 reported genomes was performed using the Clustal omega tool of EMBL-EBI, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK and led to the establishment of a ≥ 96% identity value among all compared sequences. Hence, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) from the NCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S.A, led to the performance of sequence analyses for all ORFs coding for structural, non-structural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Subsequent in silico analyses consisted of submitting each ORF coding sequence to identify the presence of possible LB epitopes, including the presence of proteasome cleavage sequence sites, HLA-I and HLA-II different length binding epitope sequences regarding endosomal and phagosome-lysosome protease cleavage sites, by accessing remote servers for B-cell epitope prediction, also known as B lymphocyte epitopes as linear arrangements thereof or Linear B (LB) epitope prediction with LBtope and ABCpred main page bearing a threshold: 0.51. Other bioinformatics tools used were used for B-cell epitope prediction [16] [17] [18] .For predicting proteasome cleavage, the IEDB server was employed [19] . HLA-I binding motifs were analyzed with netMHCpan v4.0 and NetMHCpan-2.3 servers. HLA-II binding motifs from SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed with the netMHCpan v3.2 and a IEDB tool were also employed. To identify phagosome-lysosome protease cleavage sites the PROSPER server was used [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .For obtaining target sequences to be synthesized, more than 100 amino-acid sequences in a range from 10 to 23 residues in length passed the first design filter, and some selection criteria were then considered, including those potential epitopes showing binding scores from 50 to 100 nM. Those sequences which had simultaneously identified both proteasome cleavage sites, LB epitopes and HLA-I binding sequences were pre-selected. Among preliminary sequences from this filter, those matching HLA-II binding sequences, proteasome including potential phagosome-lysosome cleavage sites, were regarded for a further selection step. A molecular map consisting of all the preliminary sequences from each SARS-CoV-2 consensus ORFs was built and those coincidences among susceptible and resistant infection HLA-I and HLA-II were assessed as inclusion criteria to be considered in the selection list. Considerations regarding HLA haplotype global distribution and their impact on resistance and sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection led us to define the candidate proposal among all sequence candidates. The non-polymorphic-screened unique sequences were regarded as the source of a final preliminary antigen list consisting of 15 different epitope-peptides to be synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis by standard Fmoc (9-methyl fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) procedures based on literature reported elsewhere [25] .Representative peptides from structural and accessory ORFs-expressed proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were then modified by some amino-acid substitutions at given residue positions. Thus, different length peptides ranging from 10 to 23 residues from ORFs 2, 3a, 3b, 4, 5, 7a, 7b and 9, including accessory and structural S, E, M and N proteins, were selected as the target sequences of this work. Therefore, peptide sequences presented as single monomer and polymer forms were designed. Monomer peptide sequences are represented by the single-viral-motif (SVM) code beside an odd number and their polymer peptide forms are represented by the polymer-hybrid-element (PHE) code besides a pair number. Thus, a single sequence will be named in agreement with its molecular state, the monomer having an odd number and its polymer form with a consecutive even number.Fifteen epitope-sequences were obtained by solid phase synthesis by 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy as monomer and polymers form for a total of 30 polypeptides. Solvents and soluble reagents were removed by filtration. Washings between deprotection, couplings and subsequent deprotection steps were carried out with N,N -dimethylformamide (DMF) (5 × 1 min), dichloromethane (DCM) (4 × 1 min), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (2 × 1 min) and DCM (2 × 1 min) using 1.5 mL of solvent/50 mg of resin each time. The Fmoc group was removed from the resin by two treatments of 15 min with piperidine-DMF (25:75 v/v). Couplings were performed at 20 • C and monitored using standard Kaiser tests for solid-phase synthesis.For the synthesis of monomer forms, after Fmoc removal of the commercially available Rink amide resin (50 mg, 0.46 mmol/g), the first Fmoc-amino-acid (0.115 mmol, 5.0 equiv.) was added with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (18.2 mg, 0.115 mmol; 5.0 equiv.) and N,N -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (23.7 mg; 5.0 equiv.) as coupling reagents dissolved in DMF/DCM (7:3, v/v) and the coupling reaction was stirred for 2 h. Next, the Fmoc group was removed, and a second Fmoc-amino-acid was incorporated in the resin using the same conditions. The Fmoc removal and the coupling reactions of the rest of the Fmoc-amino-acids were carried out under the same conditions using 5 equiv./coupling. Finally, monomer peptide was Fmoc deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid-water-triisopropylsilane (TFA/H 2 O/TIS) (95.0:2.5:2.5) for 6 h followed by filtration and precipitation with cold diethyl ether (Et 2 O). Crude products were then triturated 3 times with cold Et 2 O, dissolved in the system water-acetonitrile (H 2 O:CH 3 CN) (9:1 v/v) and then lyophilized.Synthesis of polymer forms was carried out on 150 mg of Rink-amide resin. In order to further obtain a molecule of high molecular weight represented by a polymer, an active cysteine residue was incorporated at both Nand Csequence ends. The synthesis of polymer forms was carried out under the same strategy and conditions used for their corresponding monomers (5 equiv./coupling).Synthesized Cys-peptides were Fmoc deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with a cleavage mixture including ethanedithiol (EDT) in the system TFA/H 2 O/TIS/EDT (94.0:2.5:1.0:2.5) for 6 h followed by filtration and precipitation with cold Et 2 O. These crude products were then triturated 3 times with cold Et 2 O and dissolved in H 2 O:CH 3 CN (9:1 v/v) and lyophilized as before. Finally, cysteinyl peptides were submitted to disulfide bridge oxidation to obtain the target polymeric molecular forms. Oxidation was carried out from a peptide solution in water (4 mg/mL, pH 7.0) by an oxygen stream under stirring for 16 h. Polymer peptides obtained were dialyzed in water for 24 h using a 500 Da cellulose acetate membrane and further lyophilized as previously published [26] . Monomer and polymer SARS-CoV-2 sequences were employed for serological tests with human sera samples, as well as for further biological assays.All SARS-CoV-2-based peptide antigen monomer and polymer forms were characterized by analytical reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatograph (RP-HPLC) and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Analytical RP-HPLC was performed using an Agilent 1200 series chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Analyses were performed on a Zorbax ® HPLC C18 column (4.6 × 50 mm, 5 µm) (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 mL/min rate flow, mobile phase system was A: H 2 O/TFA (99.9:0.1 v/v); and B: CH 3 CN/TFA (99.9:0.06 v/v), on a 5% to 95% of B linear gradient during 5 min at a 25 • C temperature and the UV detector was adjusted to 220 nm. A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out to the external service to identify a molecular ion of each peptide. Fmoc-Rink Amide MBHA resin and Fmoc-amino-acids were purchased from Iris Biotech GmbH (Marktredwitz, Germany); DCC and HOBt from AAPPTec (Louisville, KY, USA); piperidine, EDT, TIS and TFA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and Et 2 O, DMF, DCM, IPA, CH 3 CN, from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). All commercially available reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification. Distilled and deionized water was used for the preparation of all solutions and chromatography eluents.ELISA standard assays were performed for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from sera samples of humans with COVID-19. Polystyrene 96-flat bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were immobilized overnight with representative amounts of each synthetic antigen ranging from 5 µg/mL to 40 µg/mL in a carbonates/bicarbonate buffer at a pH of 9.6 at 4 • C. Following washings and non-specific binding blocking steps with a solution of 1-5% of skimmed-milk in 0.15 M (phosphate buffered solution) PBS-0.05% (v/v) tween-20, different dilutions of human sera samples were poured onto peptide-ELISA plate wells and incubated for 1 to 3 h at 37 • C. Then a goat alkaline phosphatase anti human-Ig-conjugate was poured at different dilutions on PBS-Tween-20 and incubated for one-hour at 37 • C to bind specific human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. After performing standard washings, the test was developed with a 1 mg/mL p-nitrophenylphosphate solution in 0.1 M diethanolamine, pH 9.8 to reveal those antibodies' specific binding to designed virus epitopes by a yellow color appearance which was then detected on a microplate-reader (Multiscan EX ® , Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) adjusted at 405 nm. When necessary, enzyme activity was stopped by adding a 3 N NaOH solution before absorbance reading. Human sera samples were collected under Colombian and international ethical regulations (Presidency of the Republic of Colombia, decree number 266, 2006), in agreement to the world medical association WMA-Declaration of Helsinki of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, from either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with COVID-19, were tested by a standard PCR for a positive viral charge and informed previous blood sampling as reported [27] . A follow-up for serum antibody conversion was accorded with patients involved in the present research. GraphPad Prism 7 software was used for statistical analyses.Information of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF gen coding for those 3D structure resolved proteins was obtained [11] , and PDB coordinate files were downloaded from the protein data bank site (PDB) [10] as mentioned above. Protein molecular modeling and personalization was performed using downloaded available protein coordinate files whose PDD code files were, for S (open and close states 6vsb and 6vxx), S-RBD-ACE II (6m0j), E (5 × 29), M (not yet reported) and N (6m3m and 6 wkp), respectively. For those proteins whose 3D structure has not been reported yet to the PDB, molecular modeling was carried out by submitting epitope-sequences to remote servers to obtain predicted structurehomology models in coordinate files, being the PepFold structure-prediction server selected to fulfill this aim [28, 29] . Thus, PDB files for representative epitope-peptides and their modified versions for ORF3a, ORF5 (M protein), ORF7a and ORF7b were achieved, all fulfilling the Ramachandran plot structure requirements, as well as the geometrical constraints and restraints parameters for a valid protein structure. Finally, personalized molecular modeling for displaying all PDB 3D structure coordinate files, were allowed by using the VMD 1.9.3 version software, from the NIH Biomedical Research Center for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics, University of Illinois [30] .A molecular design to determine the most likely epitope-peptides from SARS-CoV-2 virus was based on concerted strategies in which was used not only bioinformatics basin, but experience and knowledge on peptide chemistry, vaccinology and infectious diseases transmission. Therefore, all ten of the virus' OFRs coding for a number of proteins among structural, accessory and non-structural were submitted to a deep analysis and theoretical characterization. Screening of potential epitopes derived from the virus' most representative proteins lead us to propose fifteen amino-acid sequences out of more than one hundred that were preselected, having different sizes ranging from 10 to 23 residues in length and different hydrophobic profiles. These selected 15 peptide sequences were synthesized by Fmoc chemistry showing average yields ranging from 65% to 85% and were produced as monomer (SVM) and polymer (PHE) forms, under controlled production steps following standard protocols for GMP production and analysis. Purification lead to obtaining purities higher than 90% for most molecules. Representative polymerized epitope-peptides were obtained and termed PHE as mentioned, thus from proteins coded by ORF2 (spike S) peptides were PHE-2, PHE-4, PHE-6, PHE-8 PHE-10, PHE-12 and PHE-14, from ORF3a PHE-16; for ORF3b PHE-18; for ORF4 (envelope E protein), PHE-20; for ORF5 (M surface protein) PHE-22; for ORF7a PHE-24; for ORF7b PHE-26 and for ORF9 (Nucleocapsid protein) two sequences coded PHE-28 and PHE-30, respectively. The relative position of each epitope-peptide on its parent SARS-CoV-2 protein 3D structure can be observed in Figure 2 .We decided to assess each single obtained epitope-peptide representative of target SARS-CoV-2 proteins as monomer and polymer form thereof. Therefore, as observed in Figure 3a , the sera reactivity of PCR-diagnosed patients recognizes in higher OD magnitudes to those epitope-peptides presented as polymer forms, as expected, that the multi-copy presented epitopes would give the chance of being recognized by human antibodies from patients with SARS-CoV-2 as seen for PHE-4, PHE-6, PHE-10, PHE-12 and PHE-14 all representing different epitopes of the spike protein (coded by ORF2) at different sequence positions including the RBD to ACE2. With the aim of testing a possible epitope synergy-effect for antibody recognition, monomer and polymer forms thereof were pooled in an equimolar ratio and subsequently tested for their immuno-reactivity. As observed in Figure 3b , optical densities drastically enhanced their magnitude, especially those regarding recognition of epitope-polymer forms as previously evidenced, this time faced with 4 positive and 2 negative sera samples. Subsequently, epitope-peptides representative of ORFs 3a, 3b, 4, 5, 7a, 7b and 9 were also tested for immuno-reactivity against a number of human PCR positive and negative sera samples as both monomer and polymer forms. As shown in Figure 3c , polymer-presented epitope-forms seem to be better recognized by all positive diagnosed patients in a differential fashion. The controls 2 sequences from the influenza A H1N1 virus (codes C31 and C 33) were tested simultaneously as observed. Thus, polymer epitope-peptides PHE-20 (E protein), PHE-22 (M protein), PHAE-24 (ORF7a) and PHE-28 (ORF9, N protein) were highly recognized beside some monomer forms thereof, such as SVM-19 (E protein), SVM-21 (M protein) and SVM-27 (N protein).We then performed ELISA tests to assess a possible serological reaction of COVID-19 positive (n = 20) and negative (n = 20) serum samples using synthetic epitope-peptides as the antigen (Figure 4 ).It is important to bear in mind that the design of the epitope-peptides considered within the strategy the genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 lineages present in Colombia and targeting several structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including spike, nucleocapsid, envelope and others as mentioned above. Most of the epitope-peptides showed higher absorbance values when faced with serum from COVID-19 positive diagnosed individuals than faced with that of the negative diagnosed ones. The mean differences in absorbance were significant (p < 0.05) for epitope-peptides PHE-6 ( Figure 4a) , PHE-28 ( Figure 4g ) and PHE-30 (Figure 4h ). A five-month follow-up study of Covid-19 symptomatic patients over after being PCR diagnosed by assaying the whole set of epitope-peptides representatives from structural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, serum samples obtained after one and five months of PCR diagnosis were challenged against the synthetic epitope-peptides by a standardized ELISA test ( Figure 5 ). Interestingly, having obtained the results evidenced after one month of being challenged by the virus, all synthetic epitope-peptides were more immuno-reactive for specific components when faced to the patient serum compared with historical pre-pandemic sera obtained for a representative number of human beings. Remarkably, as showed in our experiments, after five months of the virus infection, some epitope-peptides have an increase in their immuno-reactive capacity revealing a strong humoral immune response to selecting epitopes, suggesting a long-lasting humoral immunity caused by the virus itself in controversy to recently published data [31] .However, reactivity to some other epitope-peptides significantly reduces their immuno-reaction by patients' sera to levels near to those revealed by negative sera. Hence, these results could help to explain the performance of some IgG-detection based tests, which mostly fail in the screening of patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 seroprevalence studies, and this fact could be related to a short-lasting immunity for some specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that data presented herein corresponds to a case study, among a number of observations of many patients, which reveals that the epitope-peptides PHE-6, PHE-14 from the spike protein, PHE-20 from the envelope E protein and PHE-28 and PHE-30 from the nucleocapsid protein seem to be the higher immuno-SARS-CoV-2 reactive targets, while immuno-reactivity for PHE-22 and PHE-24 sequences from M and ORF7a decreases over the observation time.A molecular design aimed to propose some epitope-peptides was conducted considering multiple factors associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is most representative world-wide reported genomes for obtaining a representative virus set of epitopes. Molecular designing steps were built to fulfill hypotheses regarding a proper selection including reasoned on antigen presentation in the classes I and II contexts, as well as proteasome and phagosome-lysosome cleavage preferences and frequencies bearing world populations sensitive and resistant to the virus infection. Bioinformatics tools were useful for this aim, but knowledge and experience in immunogenic molecules design were key pieces for this complex molecular puzzle fixing, which is still in progress beyond this work. A number of sequences higher than one hundred were regarded as key epitope-peptides representative of S, E, M and N proteins as well as expression products from ORFs 3a, 7a, lead to identify 15 target sequences which were then obtained and characterized as being monomer forms herein identified as single-viral-motifs (SVMs), as well as their polymerized forms denoted as polymer-hybrid-elements (PHEs). Interestingly, PHEs were more highly recognized by human antibodies than their monomer counterparts, probably due to the high conformer number of a given sequence presented as a polymer.Serum samples from COVID-19 diagnosed Colombian patients, assessed by the standard SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based methodology, among those asymptomatic and symptomatic at different clinical conditions, were assessed in seroprevalence studies regarding those selected SARS-CoV-2 epitope-peptides. As observed, antibodies from sera samples were able to differentially recognize the most representative designed epitope-peptides, evidencing in some particular cases a long-lasting immune response to specific epitopes from N, S and E, while the opposite effect can be seen for epitope-peptides from M and ORF7a, this being a controversial matter that should be assessed in further assays, as well as specific B cell clones' stimulation by given epitopes. Experiments to evaluate antibody-stimulation under controlled vaccination schemes, safety and human adjuvant system formulations of the herein reported epitope-peptides on animal models are undergoing processes in our research group. Increasing the number of individuals from different world regions, ethnicity, gender, age and different clinical status should be further considering as an important step towards finding universal answers to the current COVID-19 pandemic.Altogether, the obtained results encourage us to propose some of the herein presented molecules as possible tools to be considered at different levels and conditions for the detection and prevention of patients with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a vaccine formulation composed of site-directed designed synthetic epitope-peptides constitutes an attractive approach and a reliable conceptual contribution for preventing COVID-19.Provisional patent applications for designed epitope-peptide amino-acid sequences were filed under EFS IDs 40568238 and 40943743, whose application numbers were 63078840 and 63105478, respectively, on 15th September 2020, in the United States Patent and Trademark Office-USPTO.

48113c9cb9949be1babf4cd6148a688ba8f23dbf,Journal Pre-proof Associations between sociodemographic factors and physical activity and sedentary behaviors in adults with chronic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic TITLE PAGE Original article Title: Associations between sociodemographic factors and physical activity and sedentary behaviors in adults with chronic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic Short Title: Physical activity and COVID-19 Author names,"Organization to declare the outbreak by COVID-19 a pandemic. 1 In this context, social distancing measures (such as restricting events requiring a physical presence, closing schools and non-essential businesses, and recommendations to stay at home) have been implemented to reduce the virus contagion and avoid the collapse of health systems. 2 On the other hand, these social distance measures have decreased the practice of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activities (PA) and have increased sedentary behavior (SB). 3, 4 As physical inactivity and SB have serious health implications in the short term, 5-7 the incentive to maintain a good PA level becomes a vital ally to health in times of a pandemic. 8, 9 A physically active lifestyle is even more relevant for subjects with chronic diseases since PA is indicated for their control and treatment. 10 Related to this, as more severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with chronic diseases, 11 the regular practice of PA can play an essential role in improving the functioning of the immune system and reducing systemic inflammation, which are essential factors to decrease the severity of viral respiratory infections. 10 Although online survey studies have been conducted to verify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA and SB aspects, [12] [13] [14] [15] to the best of our knowledge, no study has collected data through face-to-face interviews. Face-to-face interviews allow the researcher to clarify specific questions (such as duration and intensity of daily physical activities), engage responders, and provide higher quality data. In contrast, an internet-based survey is restricted participants with internet access, tending to lead to a bias selection and making it challenging to achieve representativeness of the investigated sample (external validity). 16 The COVID-19 pandemic does not affect everyone equally, especially in countries with high levels of social inequality. 17 Understanding how the sociodemographic profile has impact behaviors is relevant to public health authorities, which can propose strategic actions to mitigate other pandemic adverse effects. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate, through face-to-face interviews, the prevalence of physical inactivity and SB among adults with chronic diseases and their associations with sociodemographic factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted July 13 to 24, 2020 (the winter period) to investigate the prevalence of following the PA recommendations, SB, and their associations with sociodemographic factors in adults with chronic diseases (≥18 years) who were residents of Piranguinho during the COVID-19 pandemic.Piranguinho is a small city in the state of Minas Gerais, located in the southern region of Brazil (latitude: 22° 24' 3''/ longitude: 45° 32' 6''). The city occupies an area of 124.803 km², with a demographic density of 64.23 inhab/km 2 . In 2010 (last population census-IBGE), the entire population consisted of 8,016 inhabitants, and the urban population corresponded to 4,953 residents. The human development index (HDI) was 0.717, and the dimension that most contributed to the HDI was life expectancy, with an index of 0.841, followed by per capita income with an index of 0.672, and education with an index of 0.651.The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Piranguinho was diagnosed on May 12, 2020. On April 13, the city officially recognized the state of public calamity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing policies were implemented, including the closure of schools, gyms, churches, and non-essential businesses, and public and private events of any kind were prohibited. During the research period, the number of suspected cases reported were between 113 and 134, and confirmed cases were between 21 and 27.The city has adopted the Family Health Strategy (FHS) for the reorganization of primary care and has three teams responsible for serving three areas of the city, which includes both the urban and rural territories. This study was developed in partnership with the local health department to help the FHS program, which is responsible for monitoring citizens with chronic diseases. The study sample size calculation was based on the numbers of adult patients registered in the FHS databases (n = 911), considering an estimated physical inactivity prevalence of 70%, a sampling error of 5%, and a 95% confidence interval. The minimum recommended sample size was 239 participants. The sampling process was conducted by an independent researcher who was responsible for coding and allocating 300 participants (100 participants in each of the three areas) using a random sequence generator (www.randomizer.org).Four postgraduate students in Human Movement Science with previous research fieldwork experience accompanied the health agents and were responsible for the face-to-face interviews. A prior pilot study was conducted in a random sample (n=20) to simulated the interviews and permitted a standardization of the researchers' approach. During visits, all research staff used safety equipment (laboratory coats, gloves, masks, and face shields), and the interviews were carried out at a safe distance (two steps). The pens and clipboard used were cleaned with 70% alcohol after each interview.In the first stage of the interview, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors data were collected, including age, sex, self-reported body weight and height (for calculating body mass index[BMI]), skin color (divided into white or nonwhite), employment status (retired, unemployed, employed), monthly total family income (≤R$ 1.039.00, between R$ 1039.01 and ≤R$ 3117.00, and >R$ 3117.00), education (primary or less, secondary and further), the number of people in the household, and current smoking (yes or no). The compliance with self-isolation was assessed using the question: ""Concerning the social distancing that is being suggested by health authorities, that is, staying at home and avoiding contact with other people, how well do you think you are following these recommendations?"" The alternatives were: (a) I am not following them; (b) sometimes I follow them; (c) I am following them.In the second stage of the interview, information to determine states of polypharmacy and multimorbidity were collected. Briefly, the participants were asked to bring all containers of the medicines they had used in the last 15 days. For the analysis, we included only regularly consumed medicines prescribed by a physician or dentist, and polypharmacy was defined as the regular use of ≥5 drugs. 18 The presence of chronic disease was based on self-reported physician diagnosis of one or more of the following conditions (except for obesity, determined by BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ): hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, pulmonary disease, renal disease, cancer, and depression. We defined multimorbidity as the presence of ≥3 conditions in one individual. 19 In the third stage of the interview, the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was applied, and the participants reported over the last 7 days the frequency and amount of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activities (MVPA) in bouts ≥10 minutes. 20 The responders received brief prompts to help them remember past physical activities events (type, intensity, and duration), when necessary, starting at the most recent day until complete the last week. The energy expenditure in walking activities (3.3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Metabolic Equivalents [METs]), in moderate activities (4.0 METs), and vigorous activities (8.0 METs) were quantified as MET-min/week. 21 The cutoff point score used (< or ≥500MET-min/week) was based on the most recent recommendations of the aerobic component proposed by the ACMS. 22 The SB was determined by asking about the total time spent sitting in the last 7 days. The sedentary risk was defined as spending ≥4 hours per day sitting. 23 After the interviews, the participants were instructed on the importance of physical isolation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and they were given a printed infographic Of the 300 randomly selected subjects, the research team was able to meet with 284 during the eleven days of the study period, and 249 participants were finally included in the analysis. pandemic on compliance with PA recommendations and SB as assessed by an internationally validated questionnaire. The prevalence data of physical inactivity and SB risk indicated that 71.5% of adults with chronic diseases did not meet the minimum PA recommendations, and 62.7% spent at least 4 hours sitting per day. One notable fact was that one-third of the participants did not perform any MVPA at all in bouts ≥10 min.Although our cross-sectional study design is unable to reveal their physical inactivity and SB levels prior to the pandemic, they are likely to have increased due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Online and telephone survey studies conducted in Spain indicated that responders with chronic diseases perceived decreases in PA and increases in SB. 13, 24 Briefly, López-Sánchez et al. 13 observed a significant decrease in selfreported moderate-intensity physical activity in adults with chronic conditions (n=163) during the COVID-19 quarantine compared to the before period (60.5 vs. 90.5 min/day).Furthermore, Ruiz-Roso et al. 24 also showed that participants with type II Diabetes (n=72) reported lower mean time spent in walking/moderate activities and increased sitting time perweek assessed by the IPAQ questionnaire in the COVID-19 lockdown period compared to before. Direct comparison with these findings is complicated and should be interpreted with caution due to the difference in survey strategies, and the memory recalls to the period before the pandemic can undoubtedly present a high bias level. Thus, the current study expands on these findings showing that face-to-face interviews project a high level of physical inactivity in adults with chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.Therefore, public health strategies that also mitigate the effects of a pandemic scenario on PA levels are urgent, and this study adds to our understanding of the factors associated with not meeting the PA recommendations and SB risk. Our findings indicated an association between not meeting the PA recommendations with current smoking and female sex, and this is consistent with previous studies that showed a higher rate of physical inactivity among smokers 25 and women. 26 We observed that the number of people in the household during the pandemic was also a factor that influenced not meeting the PA recommendations, and participants that lived alone or with only one other person were more likely to meet the minimum PA recommendations. This can possibly be related to a greater need for more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f household duties of light intensity when a larger number of people live in the household, limiting free time and decreasing motivation to perform MVPA. 27 Additionally, participants that reported that they sometimes performed self-isolation were three times more likely to meet the minimum PA recommendation than those that were fully observing self-isolation after controlling for any potentially confounding factors. One may speculate that these participants may be performing some MVPA outdoors and therefore be more likely to remain physically active during the pandemic. On the other hand, the participants who reported not self-isolating were no more or less active than those who performed self-isolation. We hypothetically suggested that these participants could be involved in formal or informal work outside the home and could not perform continuous (≥ 10 min) MVPA.It is important to note that these data are not related to a lockdown condition, even though SB is another PA domain that has attracted increased interest in recent years. It is characterized as any waking behavior of low energy expenditure (≤1.5 METs), while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture. Emerging evidence has shown that prolonged sedentary time is associated with health conditions and mortality, independent of PA levels. 29 In our study, we used total sitting time as a proxy measure of SB, and the results indicated that older adult participants (≥60 years) had a two times higher chance of sitting ≥4 hours. These findings are supported by other studies that reported that increasing age is associated with high sedentary risk. 30 Our data also indicate that participants with ≥three chronic conditions had higher odds of spending more time sitting, similar to those found by Kandola et al. 31 Experimental studies have found that prolonged time spent sitting impacts acute metabolic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and inflammatory responses that may contribute to the development of chronic diseases, 32, 33 and thus, it should be avoided.The major strength of this study is that it used face-to-face interviews, and the sampling method adopted allowed for the inclusion of broad sociodemographic characteristics while avoiding bias selection, as is observed in studies using online surveys. The face-to-face interview technique can also minimize falsely and nonresponse rates and provide some other information that would not have been captured in an online survey. Another strength is the use of the IPAQ, a validated questionnaire that allows for comparisons with other regions of Brazil and with different countries. Among the limitations of the study, we can first highlight that no self-reported information was raised about PA and SB level before the COVID-19 pandemic, and we can not infer how much the behavior was affected. Second, the use of objectively measured physical activity monitors could provide a more accurate estimation of PA levels. Third, we considered only compliance with the aerobic component of the PA recommendations. Fourth, the multimorbidity analysis was limited to counts of self-reported cases, and the severity of the chronic diseases was not assessed. Last, the use of a cross-sectional design precludes any evaluation of a causal association regarding the results.In conclusion, the results of the current study showed that more than half of adults with chronic diseases living in a small town in Brazil did not adhere to the minimum PA recommendations and had a high sedentary risk. Our study indicated that factors like male sex, fewer people in the household, and less adherence to self-isolation were associated with meeting the minimum PA recommendations. At the same time, increased age and multimorbidities were positively associated with a higher sedentary risk. Therefore, wesuggest that public health policies should inform and encourage people with chronic diseases to maintain or increase their PA level safely at home to mitigate adverse effects of physical inactivity, especially during the periods of more severe control of the pandemic.Besides, older people or those with multimorbidities that may have physical limitations should be encouraged to reduce sitting time.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-19,11

Then βI/N is the average number of contacts that are sufficient for transmission with infective individuals per unit of time of one susceptible and (βI/N)S is the number of new cases per unit of time due to the S susceptible individuals. Furthermore, let γ be the recovery rate, which is the rate that infected individuals recover or die, leaving the infected class, at constant per capita probability per unit of time.Based on these definitions, we can write the SIR model asIt is worth mentioning that we can also evaluate the number of recovered individuals from Eq. (1) using also the number of susceptible and infected individuals, since in this version of the SIR model (Eq. 2) the population is constant. Actually, since we are modeling a short term pandemic, we do not consider the demographic effects and we assume that an individual does not contract the disease twice. We do not implement this model, we only included it for the sake of reference.We actually want to estimate the fraction of people that die from the disease. Then we include a probability ρ of an individual in the class I dying from infection before recovering 4 . In this case, we get the following set of equations where ρ 1−ρ γ I is the number of people in the population that die due to the disease per unity of time and D is the number of people that die due to the disease. Note that in this case the number of individuals in the population reduces due to the infection according to dN dt = − ρ 1−ρ γ I . For the ease of reference, we call this model ""SIRD"" (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead) model.Since, in the case of the COVID-19, there is a relevant percentage of the infected individuals that are asymptomatic, we split the class of infected individuals in symptomatic and asymptomatic 7-9 : where I A is the number of asymptomatic individuals, I S is the number of symptomatic individuals, R A and R S are the recovered individuals from the asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, respectively, and p is the proportion of individuals who develop symptoms. For ease of reference, we call this model ""SIRASD"" (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered for Asymptomatic-Symptomatic and Dead) model. Like the SIRD model, the condition that N is constant does not hold anymore and if we need to evaluate N over time, we need to integrate dN dt = − ρ 1−ρ γ S I S . In order to consider the effect of the social distancing policy, we modify the transmission factors of Eqs. (3) and (4) by multiplying them by a parameter ψ ∈ [0, 1] , when the date belongs to the period of the implementation of government policy. Otherwise, we use ψ = 1 . To be precise, we replace β in Eq. (3) by ψβ , β A in Eq. (4) by ψβ A and β S in Eq. (4) by ψβ S . Note that doing this procedure we avoid the introduction and estimations of new "" β s"" and we may use ψ to evaluate the effectiveness of social distancing policy. In the end, we may measure the social distance as 1 − ψ.Our models provide estimates of the epidemiological parameters, that are consistent with the international literature, and good forecasts of the short-term Brazilian time series of infected individuals in Brazil. Furthermore, one of our models assesses the number of asymptomatic (or individuals with mild symptoms that do not(3) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ look for the hospitals and are not being tested). We use these models to simulate long-term scenarios of the pandemics that depend on the level of engagement of the Brazilian social distancing policy. We show that: (1) the social distancing policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of contamination provided by the COVID-19; (2) there is an optimal date for abandoning the social distancing policy; (3) short-term social distancing policies only shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value. (4) The proportion of asymptomatic individuals affects the amplitude of the peak of symptomatic infected, meaning that it is important to invest in testing the population, massively or by random sampling. Our work relates to the recent interesting contributions [10] [11] [12] [13] in the sense that all these works try to model the spread of the COVID-19 and to evaluate the countermeasures against this virus. However, our paper differs from these works in the following dimensions: (1) data: our work focuses in Brazilian data. This is an important characteristic since different countries may present different demographies and we know that the COVID-19 is riskier for older populations that appear with higher proportion in developed countries. Furthermore, the level of nutrition of the population of the country may affect the probability of contracting and developing the disease. The quality of data may vary from developed countries to underdeveloped ones and, in our paper, we do not use data from other countries to calibrate our models. (2) Model: we use variations of the SIR model mentioned above. One of the advantages of the SIR model is the simplicity and researchers have used this model in several successful attempts to model the spread of infectious diseases [14] [15] [16] [17] . (3) Estimation: our paper estimates all the parameters based on a clear hierarchical procedure based on squared error minimization.Data analysis. We use the real data provided by the Ministry of Health of Brazil from February 25, 2020 to March 30, 2020 in our estimations. If we change the final date of the period of estimation of the epidemiological parameters of the model, we note that there is a structural change in the data suggesting the effectiveness of the social distancing policy. It is worth mentioning that it is hard to know exactly when social distance measures took effect mostly because there is a variable incubation period of the virus given by a range from 2 to 10 days 18 and some initiatives of social distance measures (such as home office) started even before the official implementation of the social distancing policy. In fact, after March 23, 2020, we are able to see in the data three consecutive reductions in the first difference of the cumulative number of infections, so depending on the final date that is used for the estimation of the SIRD model, the estimated parameters cannot fit the real data anymore, as shown in Fig. 1 . Thus, we define two estimation periods: (1) February 25, 2020-March 22, 2020, in which we estimate the epidemiological parameters of Eqs. (3) and (4); (2) March 23, 2020-March 30, 2020, in which we estimate the paramter ψ.Regarding the estimation of the epidemiological parameters of Eqs. (3) and (4), we estimate all parameters of our model by minimizing the squared error of integrated variables and their real values 5, 28 . We proceed in a hierarchical procedure. We start by estimating the parameters of the SIRD model, namely β , γ and ρ by minimizing the squared error where I cum t and D t are the cumulative number of infected individuals and deaths, which are the real data provided by the Ministry of Health of Brazil, and Î t , R t and D t are estimated values of the infected, recovered and deaths, respectively. We use the nonlinear function f (z) = C 2 log (g(z)/C) 2 to correct the exponential characteristic of the series so that the errors of the last values of the series do not dominate the minimization, where www.nature.com/scientificreports/ g(z) = log(1 + z) . Furthermore, we use the scaling parameter C = 2 to soft threshold between inliers and outliers. Using this procedure, we note that the estimated epidemiological parameters vary less among simulations with different random seeds.After estimating the SIRD model, we proceed by estimating the SIRASD model. Note that we lack information on the number of asymptomatic individuals, since the clear recommendation of the Ministry of Health is to test for the virus only if one has moderate or severe symptoms. Otherwise, follow the ""stay at home"" policy, which recommends individuals with mild symptoms to stay at home and do not seek for medical attention. Furthermore, the mortality rate is evaluated mostly over the symptomatic ones, since the asymptomatic are in many cases not tested. Therefore, we suppose that β S = β , γ S = γ and we keep the value of ρ . Using these parameters, and assuming that there is only one asymptomatic individual in the beginning of the simulation, we estimate the parameters β A , γ A and p in order to minimize the squared error where I cum t and D t are real data provided by the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the cumulative number of infected individuals and deaths, and Î S,t , R S,t and D t are estimated values of the symptomatic infected and recovered individuals, and deaths. Table 1 presents the epidemiological parameters of our model and some reference values. We also show other values for these epidemiological parameters obtained from other simulations in Table 5 in ""Methods"". Some of the lines of Table 1 deserve remarks. First, the basic reproductive number R 0 in both models are comparable to the values for China and Italy. Second, the death rate ρ is very close to the values disclosed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the average of international values. We point out that our estimation of the death rate uses data that presumes there are places in hospitals to treat patients with severe infections, that is the situation that is present in the data now. Depending on the government policy, we do not know whether this is true or not at the peak of infection. Third, the proportion of symptomatic individuals p is smaller than the international reference due to the Brazilian Ministry of Health policy ""only test if you have strong symptoms"". In fact, the same problem of underdiagnosis also seems to have happened in the early epidemics in China 29 .In the last step of the estimation procedure, in order to estimate the parameter ψ , we keep all model parameters as previously estimated and we also minimize the mean squared error using loss functions similar to the ones defined in Eqs. (5) and (6), depending on the case, in the period after March 23, 2020. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the social distancing policy, we estimate a new value of ψ for each new point of the time series as shown in Table 2 , where the column 2 shows the estimations of ψ for the SIRD model and column 4 shows estimations of the same parameter for the SIRASD model. Although there is a small gap between the values of ψ for different models (SIRD or SIRASD), both columns suggest that the social distance factor ψ is going down, meaning that more people are joining the government policy. According to the models, the transmission rate is reduced to approximately 62% of its original value. Table 2 also presents the effective reproductive number derived from the impact of ψ on the transmission factors. Figures 2 and 3 present respectively the short-term forcasts of the SIRD and the SIRASD models, where the models incorporate the ψ factor in order to rescale the transmission factors ( β , β A and β S ) in the scenario with the social distancing policy imposed by the government. Note that Fig. 3 explicitly shows the propor- (2) Some parameters have not presented relevant variation in the significance level of this study. In these cases, the 90% interval includes only the value of the parameter. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ tion of unknown asymptomatic individuals that when added to the symptomatic individuals skew the total value of infected individuals upwards. We also use the SIRD and SIRASD models to provide long term forecasts of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil depending on the social distancing policy considered. While Fig. 4 shows the forecasts for the SIRD model, Fig. 5 shows the forecasts for the SIRASD model. In particular, we may note that while the SIRASD model predicts that the number of infected is higher than the estimates of the SIRD model, it also predicts a lower peak for the infected with symptoms, which are the ones that could require medical attention.We explore four cenarios: (I) no measures of social distancing policy (black line); (II) current social distancing policy imposed by the government for an indefinite time (blue line); (III) 2-month social distancing policy imposed by the government (yellow line); and (IV) optimum limited time social distancing policy imposed by the government, so that the second infection peak is not greater than cenario II (red line). Scenario III suggests that policies based on short-term social distancing policy are not enough to constrain the evolution of the pandemic, that is, if social distancing policy measurements are released before the optimal time, a second peak should be experienced. The peaks and dates in which they occur are detailed in Table 3 . In the case of Scenario IV, the last day of the social distancing policy is June 22, 2020 for the SIRD model and June 16, 2020 for the SIRASD model.In addition to Fig. 5 , we also present the evolution of the proportion of asymptomatic and symptomatic in Fig. 6 . In this figure, we show the instant proportion [ I S,t /(I A,t + I S,t ) for the symptomatic and I A,t /(I A,t + I S,t ) for the asymptomatic] and the cumulative proportion as well. Note that the proportion of individuals who develop symptoms, p in Eq. (4), alters the transmission rate, so it also affects the evolution of the number of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals over time. So this plot estimates the evolution of this proportion. The last column of the last line of Table 1 shows that the proportion of asymptomatic may vary from 29 to 37%, but this value is not fixed and evolves over time 26 . Our estimates suggest that the proportion of cumulative asymptomatic is approximately 68% in March 30, 2020, which converged to 1 − p (with p given in Table 1 ); that may account for some individuals with mild symptoms that were not tested. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Finally, it is worth considering that the SIRASD differential equations, presented in Eq. (4), need an initial condition for the number of asymptomatic individuals. If we find the parameters values (β A , γ A , p) by solving the optimization problem of Eq. (6) using different conditions, we get different results, that is, different peak values for the symptomatic individuals. If the proportion of asymptomatic individuals is larger, then this may be good news since it may represent less pressure for the health care system. But since we do not have enough tests to map the whole population, we need to work with hypotheses. Figure 7 shows the effect of different initial conditions in the symptomatic percentage and the peak value of symptomatic, that is, we vary the initial conditions, evaluate www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the symptomatic proportion (parameter p in the SIRASD model), then calculate the peak value of symptomatic infected. So if we assume that the number of asymptomatic (symptomatic) individuals in data is larger (smaller) today, the number of asymptomatic (symptomatic) individuals will also be larger (smaller) in the time of the peak, leading to a smaller peak for the symptomatic.We use the Brazilian recent data from February 25, 2020 to March 30, 2020 to model and forecast the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. We estimate two variations of the SIR model using historical data and we find parameters that are in accordance with the international literature. We also introduce a factor ψ to account for the effect of the government social distancing measures. Our methodology is able to estimate the asymptomatic individuals, that may not be entirely present in data. Since the Brazilian government does not have enough tests for mass testing, this measure may provide some additional information. In fact, we show the relevance of the number of asymptomatic individuals, since the larger the number of asymptomatic individuals, the smaller the number hospital beds needed. The ""stay at home"" and ""only test if you have strong symptoms"" policies present contradictory effects in the disease control. While they avoid an increase in the number of infected people and the use of extra resources with people that present only mild symptoms, they reduce the amount of information about the real number of infected individuals. In particular, it explains the low value of the parameter that measures the proportion of individuals who present symptoms, since we count many individuals with mild symptoms as asymptomatic.While our short-term forecasts are in great accordance with the data, our long-term forecasts may help us to discuss different types of social distancing policies. We also show that the social distancing policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of contamination provided by the COVID-19, but short-term policies are only able to shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value. Furthermore, we define the idea of the optimal social distancing policy as the finite social distancing policy that the second peak that happens after stopping the policy is not larger than the first. Based on this definition, we provide an estimate of the optimal date to end the social distancing policy.An important discussion is about the effectiveness of vertical containment policies, where only people at risk follow social distance policies. In these kinds of policies, the two fractions of the population, the one at risk and the other one, present very different behaviors. First, the dynamics of the population at risk behaves similarly to the case with social distancing measures, but with a higher death rate. Second, the dynamics of the population that is not at risk behaves similarly to the case without social distance measures but with a low death rate. Third, since the fraction of the population that is at risk is much smaller than the rest of the population, the number of infected of the total population behaves similarly to the case without control. In fact, the policy's effectiveness is not in reducing the number of infected, but in reducing the number of deaths by confining individuals at risk. It is worth mentioning that the effectiveness of these vertical containment polices depends strongly on the ability to separate the individuals at high risk from the individuals at low risk and on the number of vacancies in hospitals to treat the disease. We may extend our model to explore these type of scenarios and we leave for future work.Finally, another interesting research path is to evaluate the economic side effects of pandemic control 30, 31 and to propose measures to minimize these impacts 32 .The solution of the systems of differential equations. We find the numerical solutions of Eqs. (3) and (4) through integration using the explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4) 33 . While this method controls the error assuming accuracy of the fourth-order, it uses a fifth-order accurate formula to take the steps. We use the implementation ""solve_ivp"" of the scipy Python's library.The solution of the systems of differential equations depends on the definition of initial conditions. We use N 0 = 210147125 , that is the Brazilian population according to Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) which is the agency responsible for official collection of statistical, geographic, cartographic, geodetic and environmental information in Brazil, for both models. For the case of the SIRD model, we use S 0 = N 0 − 1 and I 0 = 1 . For the case, SIRASD model, we use I S0 = 1 and S0 = N 0 − I A0 − I S0 . We use I A0 = 1 in all simulations of the paper but the simulations presented in Fig. 7 , since we want to learn about the effect of I A0 in the proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the peak date.The estimation procedure. Our estimation procedure requires simultaneous integration of the differential equations (SIRD or SIRASD model depending on the case) and minimization of the loss functions [(5) or (6) ] depending on the case for each time t. We minimize the loss functions using the method ""optimize. least_squares"" also from the scipy Python's library 34 using the cauchy loss with scaling parameter C = 2 35, 36 . To minimize the impact of the initial point assumption and data incompleteness, we repeat the estimation procedure 100 times using random initial conditions, but we discarded estimations which did not converge. Since this is a difficult nonlinear problem we bound the parameters estimation region. In particular, we use the bounds presented in Table 4 . To be clear, the fact that β S = β and γ S = γ is a consequence of our hierarchical estimation procedure previously described in ""Results"" section. Furthermore, β A ∈ [0, β S ] means that β A ≤ β S 7 , since the asymptomatic individuals do not have symptoms that may help the spread of the infection.Finally it is worth mentioning that this estimation procedure is sensitive to the random seed used by the algorithm as an initial condition. In particular, depending on this seed, we have found different epidemiological parameters in different simulations of the SIRD model, as presented in Table 5 . We have chosen the simulation results that provided the closest value of the median of the parameter γ , which is the one that used the random seed 7. We emphasize that although any of the presented epidemiological parameters could be a possible ",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-10,11
9f3eb701c2d3b67ab3071d6edb294b7eaa6e5456,Análisis bibliométrico de la producción científica latinoamericana sobre COVID-19,"La situación global provocada por la COVID-19, enfermedad infecciosa causada por el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, obligó a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) a declarar el estado de pandemia (1) . La necesidad de encontrar posibles tratamientos para frenar la enfermedad ha llevado al aumento de la producción científica sobre el tema. En este contexto, la colaboración entre países e instituciones y el trabajo coordinado que aporte soluciones para la prevención y mitigación de la pandemia cobran especial relevancia (2) . En este sentido, se han emitido recomendaciones encaminadas al fortalecimiento de las políticas de emergencia de salud pública y se ha reforzado el trabajo en cada país para determinar los factores de riesgo y hacerle seguimiento a su comportamiento, dando cumplimiento a las normas sanitarias internacionales.El crecimiento y la expansión de esta enfermedad desde diciembre de 2019 han traído consigo un aumento considerable de la producción científica a nivel mundial en diferentes frentes de trabajo debido a la necesidad de encontrar soluciones sanitarias y controlar la enfermedad y su avance en los países afectados (3) .A partir de la necesidad de soluciones que frenen el avance de la enfermedad, un gran número de investigaciones e importantes editoriales como Elsevier, Taylor and Francis y Springer han dado acceso abierto a sus contenidos relacionados con la COVID-19 (3) . Esta iniciativa busca incrementar el acceso a las nuevas investigaciones como soporte para la generación de conocimientos y la búsqueda rápida de soluciones.Entre los innumerables estudios disponibles, los análisis bibliométricos han dado cuenta del ritmo acelerado de la producción científica, sus tendencias y regularidades, los muchos países e instituciones contribuyentes y los temas más tratados (4) . También han descrito las principales tendencias de la producción existente, como las características de la enfermedad y los posibles tratamientos (5) . Se ha evidenciado el liderazgo de China en la producción científica global, además de la representatividad de otros países como Estados Unidos, Francia y Alemania. Desde el punto de vista temático, es notable la orientación hacia la investigación de temas epidemiológicos y de virología (6) .En este marco, se hizo un estudio bibliométrico de corte descriptivo de la investigación latinoamericana sobre COVID-19, analizando la participación de la región a partir de indicadores bibliométricos. Al igual que en estudios recientes (3), se espera que los resultados que aquí se resumen contribuyan al desarrollo de investigaciones futuras y sirvan de guía en la gestión del control de la enfermedad. Aunque restringido a un periodo limitado, el análisis de la información registrada en una muestra de algunas de las más importantes fuentes de datos, ofrece resultados cuantitativos y revela regularidades y comportamientos de la temática, por lo que pueden ser punto de partida para análisis posteriores, además de un aporte a la gestión de las investigaciones sobre la enfermedad en las instituciones de Latinoamérica.La pregunta de investigación se planteó en los siguientes términos: ¿cuáles son las principales tendencias en la producción científica latinoamericana sobre COVID-19?Los documentos que sirvieron de fuente para el análisis bibliométrico provienen de las bases de datos Web of Science (SCI), Scopus y PubMed, la fecha de corte de la búsqueda fue el 23 de abril de 2020. Se empleó la ecuación de búsqueda para la extracción de documentos (""COVID-19"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""new coronavirus"" OR ""coronavirus disease 2019"") en los campos de título, resumen y palabras clave, y las tipologías de ""Article"" y ""Review"" en los países de la región. Se normalizaron las variables de autor, institución, país y palabras clave, dado que a partir de ellas se generaron los indicadores bibliométricos.Mediante esta estrategia de búsqueda se recuperaron 215 documentos, los cuales fueron sometidos a un proceso de normalización de metadatos y de eliminación de documentos duplicados. La muestra final para el análisis bibliométrico quedó compuesta por 142 documentos (figura 1).Se empleó la herramienta bibliográfica EndNote 7.0 para el procesamiento de los datos, en tanto que las listas de distribución de frecuencia se generaron con los programas Microsoft Excel 2016. Para el estudio del comportamiento de la productividad de los autores se recurrió al modelo inverso de Lotka (ley de Lotka), el cual permite conocer cuáles son los autores élite y transitorios en una disciplina (7-9), además, el modelo de Bradford para conocer las revistas más productivas que se encuentran en el núcleo (10) y el modelo de Price como instrumento para analizar el crecimiento acumulado de la producción científica (11 En la figura 2 se presenta la producción científica acumulada mediante el modelo exponencial de Price (11) con una tasa de crecimiento semanal de 41,3 % y con un índice de bondad de ajuste de R 2 =95,5 %. Este volumen de producción está registrado en 86 revistas científicas con la participación de 874 autores de diversas instituciones. La semana 1 inició el 29 de enero con un aumento sostenido en el crecimiento a partir de la séptima semana.En la figura 3 se presenta la participación de los autores según el número de documentos publicados. Del total de 874 autores, 788 publicaron un solo documento, en tanto que un solo autor publicó 23 documentos. Se cumple, por lo tanto, que una cantidad reducida de autores concentra el mayor volumen de la producción científica, en tanto que la mayoría de ellos registra poca productividad. Comportamiento de la producción Indica el comportamiento de la producción científica sobre COVID-19 en el periodo para conocer sus regularidades y tendencias. El modelo de Price permitió evaluar el ritmo de crecimiento de la producción científica. Productividad de los autores Evidencia si una menor cantidad de autores concentra el mayor volumen de la producción científica. Se emplea la ley de Lotka que permite conocer cuáles son los autores más importantes (élite), frente a los transitorios (poco especializados). Producción por revistas Establece las revistas fuente de la producción científica sobre COVID-19 y sus indicadores de visibilidad e impacto. Se utiliza el modelo de Bradford para conocer en un listado de productividad por revistas, aquellas de mayor número de documentos sobre el tema (núcleo), frente a las de mediana y escasa productividad (centro y periferia). Patrones de colaboración Los patrones de colaboración indican la forma en que los autores se relacionan en el proceso de escritura y da cuenta de la apertura de la investigación.Liderazgo científico Indica la participación latinoamericana en las investigaciones en cuanto a si se genera o no investigación en la región. Datos extraídos del autor de correspondencia de cada documento. Red de coautoría Se utiliza para determinar la forma en que los autores trabajan en red formando colegios invisibles.Red de palabras clave Indica cómo aparecen los principales descriptores en el conjunto de documentos analizados y permite analizar el enfoque temático y los frentes de investigación en la producción científica a partir de los clúster.Este fenómeno, conocido como el Efecto Mateo en la producción científica (14) , refleja la existencia de un número pequeño de autores especializados que concentra el flujo de información y una gran cantidad de autores transitorios con pocas publicaciones. El modelo inverso de Lotka, cuyo coeficiente de determinación es de R 2 =77,3 %, se ajusta a los datos analizados.La importancia del modelo aplicado en el presente análisis es que permite conocer cuáles son esos investigadores élite que lideran la investigación sobre el tema.En el cuadro 2 se evidencia la relación de los autores que hasta la fecha han aportado la mayor cantidad de estudios sobre COVID-19. Los 874 autores de los 142 documentos analizados se agrupan en pequeños, medianos y grandes productores según la ley de Lotka. Entre aquellos que han aportado más de tres documentos hasta la fecha, se destacan investigadores como Rodríguez-Morales, Bonilla-Aldana, Giovanetti y Balbin-Ramón, entre otros.El liderazgo científico de una institución se refleja en la cantidad de estudios cuyo investigador principal (autor de correspondencia) pertenece a ella y refleja la capacidad que tiene para generar proyectos de investigación (15) y, en este caso específico, de generar proyectos relacionados con la COVID-19. De los 142 documentos regionales, un alto porcentaje refleja el liderazgo latinoamericano (71 %) comparados con los de investigación participativa (como integrantes de proyectos de otras instituciones) (29 %), lo que evidencia la labor de las instituciones regionales y su capacidad para generar proyectos. La coautoría como vía explícita de la colaboración permite el aumento de la visibilidad, del impacto de la investigación y la existencia de colegios invisibles, es decir, agrupaciones de investigadores y de grupos de investigación en torno a temas específicos. Existe una relación entre la calidad, el impacto, la relevancia científica y la cantidad de autores que aparecen en los textos, lo que es muy diferente entre las disciplinas científicas (16) .Un total de 874 autores participan en los 142 documentos obtenidos, lo que equivale a un índice de colaboración de la producción científica de 6,15 (promedio de autores firmantes por trabajo), y a un grado de colaboración de 0,87 (el 87 % de los documentos fue escrito por dos o más autores). Esta tendencia refleja la elevada participación de autores en las investigaciones, lo que responde no solo al comportamiento por disciplinas: las básicas y las aplicadas tienden a tener un mayor número de autores en los documentos (17) , y a los diferentes hábitos de producción y citación (18) , sino también a la necesidad de cooperación en las investigaciones sobre el tema analizado.La coautoría, es decir, cuando dos o más autores deciden escribir un documento en colaboración, es la manifestación más clara de la colaboración científica y refleja los vínculos entre los investigadores. En la red de coautoría, los nodos o vértices representan a los autores y los vínculos son las relaciones en la producción de documentos (19) , lo que refleja los autores que trabajan en red y los que trabajan en solitario. En la figura 4 se presenta el mapa de la red de coautoría obtenido con el programa VOSviewer, donde cada círculo (nodo) representa a un investigador.El autor más productivo es A. J. Rodríguez-Morales, afiliado a la Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira y a la Universidad Autónoma de la Américas, ambas en Colombia, con 23 documentos publicados, seguido de D. K. Bonilla-Aldana, con ocho documentos. Según la red de coautoría, cuanto más cerca uno de otro se ubican los investigadores en la red, mayor es la relación de coautoría entre ellos, por ejemplo, Bonilla-Aldana con C. Franco-Paredes. Los colores indican agrupaciones de investigadores que están relativamente relacionados entre sí. De las 18 agrupaciones, 11 están conformadas solo por un autor, lo que evidencia la tendencia al trabajo individual por parte de algunos autores.En el estudio se encontraron 120 documentos con colaboración, 75 de ellos (52,8 %) con colaboración internacional y 48 (33,8 %), con colaboración nacional. Se demostró un patrón determinante de colaboración internacional, comportamiento lógico, dada la urgencia del tema y la necesidad de compartir información y esfuerzos para el logro de vacunas y resultados positivos frente a la pandemia. Es de destacar, además, la presencia de 19 contribuciones de un solo autor (13,4 % del total de los 142 documentos).En cuanto a la productividad por institución, 546 instituciones internacionales han participado en la producción latinoamericana sobre COVID-19 y solo 21 (4 %) han producido más de cinco artículos. En el cuadro 3 se presentan los resultados de las instituciones con una frecuencia de publicación de cuatro o más documentos, entre los que se destacan las instituciones de Colombia, Brasil y México. Como dato de interés, el autor de mayor productividad (Rodríguez-Morales), ya mencionado, pertenece a las dos primeras instituciones. Nota: se tuvieron en cuenta autores con dos documentos como mínimo (n=2). De los 887 autores, 77 cumplían con el umbral (8,7 %); método de conteo: fractional counting; método de normalización: fuerza de asociación; atracción: 2; repulsión: -3; resolución de agrupamiento: 0,5 En el cuadro 4 se presenta el listado de las revistas más productivas, entre las que se destaca Travel Medicine Infectious Diseases (15 documentos). Esta revista se ubica en el cuartil 1 del SJR y está clasificada en las categorías de enfermedades infecciosas y salud pública. La producción científica está concentrada en revistas de los cuartiles 2 y 3, lo que demuestra no solo la alta visibilidad de las contribuciones sino también su posible calidad.El modelo de dispersión de Bradford describe el comportamiento de la distribución de las revistas en zonas centrales y periféricas según la productividad (20) . La cantidad de revistas en el núcleo y en las zonas sucesivas permite visualizar las más utilizadas por los investigadores latinoamericanos en el tema objeto de estudio.Siguiendo el proceso metodológico de Bradford, los 142 documentos publicados en 86 revistas. En la zona 1 aparecen siete revistas en las que se ha publicado el 32 % de los estudios. La zona 2 está conformada por 30 revistas (35 %) y la zona 3 por 49 revistas (57 %) para el total de 86 revistas. Como se observa en la figura 5, el crecimiento exponencial de la producción mantiene un ritmo de dispersión hacia la periferia.En la figura 6 se observa que el descriptor de mayor frecuencia es COVID-19 (nombre de la enfermedad), con 79 apariciones, le siguen humans y pandemic, con 43 y 39 apariciones, respectivamente. En este caso, el número de coocurrencias de dos palabras indica el número de publicaciones en el cual ambas palabras aparecen en la lista de las palabras clave de los documentos seleccionados (7). Los colores indican agrupaciones de palabras clave relativamente relacionadas entre sí según la fortaleza de asociación obtenida por el programa VOSviewer, además de la diferencia visual de agrupaciones.Con los 64 descriptores de un total de 400 registrados en los 142 documentos recuperados y los cinco clústers observados, se analizó el enfoque temático de cada agrupación con sus cinco descriptores más importantes según el número de apariciones (cuadro 5). Así, el clúster 1 (rojo) incluye el virus SARS-CoV-2, los primeros nombres como enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 y 2019-ncov, la relación con epidemia y con animales.El clúster 2 (verde) analiza los temas de población, brotes de la enfermedad, el linaje de los betacoronavirus y las posibles consecuencias del contagio. El clúster 3 (azul) tiene que ver con la pandemia, la incidencia en el sexo masculino, y el estudio de los posibles factores de riesgo. El clúster 4 (amarillo) se enfoca en tratamientos médicos para enfrentar la COVID-19 y, por último, el clúster 5 (morado) abarca los temas relativos al brote, la reproducción y la transmisión de la enfermedad en China.Aunque incipiente, la producción científica latinoamericana sobre COVID-19 registrada en las bases de datos utilizadas evidencia un ritmo de crecimiento sostenido y exponencial. Este comportamiento es similar al de otras investigaciones recientes, con gran número de documentos publicados (6) y ritmos de crecimiento acelerados, incluso en el término de una semana (3).Esta tendencia permite ver la importante participación de las regiones en las investigaciones referentes al tema en un periodo de tiempo reducido, pero, además, un fenómeno importante como la rapidez con la que las revistas científicas se encuentran publicando la investigación sobre COVID-19, con el fin de divulgar en el menor tiempo posible los resultados de los estudios y ofrecer una gran parte de ellos en acceso abierto.Resultados como la alta colaboración, el liderazgo y la publicación en revistas internacionales reflejan los esfuerzos coordinados en la búsqueda de respuestas a la enfermedad, la gran cantidad de países e instituciones que realizan aportes conjuntos a la investigación mundial mediante el trabajo colaborativo, en una dinámica que revela no solo liderazgos individuales sino el aporte de muchos como la práctica que se impone. La alta tasa de colaboración internacional encontrada en el análisis (52,8 %), resultado de la cooperación en torno al tema, así como la elevada producción con liderazgo, muestra la capacidad de las instituciones regionales de generar investigaciones y aportar recursos a la investigación mundial.El liderazgo de un importante grupo de autores, instituciones y países en la región con investigaciones relativas a la contribución y la transmisión zoonótica de la COVID-19, su relación con el SARS-CoV-2 y otros aspectos importantes, así como su relación con instituciones de países que lideran la investigación como India, Estados Unidos y Alemania, es más que un La enfermedad vista desde China, el brote y su reproducción y su transmisión resultado de tendencia y visibilidad, pues refleja, además, los aportes de la región a través de instituciones como la Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, la Fundación Universitaria Autónoma de las Américas y otras de Brasil, México y Colombia. Estos patrones de colaboración en la producción científica latinoamericana sobre COVID-19 siguen los patrones de colaboración internacional usuales en la investigación médica de la región (21) .La publicación de los artículos en revistas internacionales (más que en las regionales), en su mayoría de elevada visibilidad e impacto (cuartiles intermedios en el SJR), muestra una tendencia positiva en cuanto a la calidad de las investigaciones. En este sentido, el 8 % de las revistas núcleo cubren más del 30 % de la producción de la región, especialmente la revista Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease del Reino Unido, situada en el Q1, con 15 documentos sobre el tema y autores cuya filiación corresponde a instituciones de algunos de los países latinoamericanos. Este resultado es importante si se tiene en cuenta que, como se ha expuesto (22) , la publicación en revistas con buenos indicadores (citas, impacto, cuartil), supone una mayor cantidad de citas.Asimismo, la cantidad de países e instituciones dedicadas a la investigación sobre COVID-19 supone que en el mediano plazo aumenten considerablemente los resultados científicos de investigaciones de todo tipo y los artículos producto de las investigaciones. Los resultados que se presentan evidencian que la mayoría de documentos se han publicado en revistas internacionales como resultado de la colaboración internacional, visión que las revistas de nuestros países pueden también adoptar.El análisis de coocurrencia de palabras o descriptores arrojó cinco agrupaciones y refleja los diferentes enfoques en las investigaciones, lo que clarifica las tendencias de la investigación sobre el tema estudiado. Términos como SARS-CoV-2, el virus causante de la enfermedad, y sus diferentes nombres adoptados, así como los factores de riesgo de la pandemia, los tratamientos necesarios, la transmisión de la enfermedad y las consecuencias del contagio, se relacionan con los resultados de otras investigaciones globales (23) . Lo importante de este resultado es que la investigación en Latinoamérica se desarrolla en línea con la que se lleva a cabo en los principales países, entre ellos, China, Alemania, Estados Unidos, y otros también mencionados en estudios recientes de corte bibliométrico (24) .",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-13,11
3fd9aa463cf963d6ba2b699c48a242ea43dd32d2,The emerging role of neutrophil extracellular traps in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19),"| (2020) 10:19630 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76781-0 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ majority of those infected in the COVID-19 pandemic are asymptomatic, however about 20% of the patients can progress clinically to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe patients with an increased risk of vascular hyperpermeability, pneumonia, sepsis, ultimately leading to death 1, 2 . The overproduction of early response proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and IFN-γ) during innate response against SARS-CoV-2 virus results in a cytokine storm, leading to a diffuse alveolar damage evolving with shock and pulmonary dysfunction 3 . The disease has been revealed as a systemic disease, the increased expression of ACE2 in patients with comorbidities may represent a propensity for an increased viral load of infection and the spread of the virus to extrapulmonary tissues [4] [5] [6] . This systemic virus dissemination brings complications to different organs in patients who evolve for the severe clinical form, which may affect central nervous system, eyes, heart and gut, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and extensive microthrombus formation with multiorgan failure 7 . Evidence has shown that patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection show signs of antiviral T and B cell adaptive immunity, with clonal expansion and activation 8 .However, the deregulated innate immune response and consequent viral dissemination in patients susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to events driving a nonresponsive state of T cell responses. Lunginfiltrating CD8 + T cells from severe COVID-19 patients potently exhibit hallmarks of T cell exhaustion, upregulating PD-1 and Tim-3 markers 9 . Analysis of highly expanded T cell populations obtained from peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients indicate a pronounced expression of MKI67 and TYMS markers of terminally exhausted T cells 10 . The failure of an efficient immunological response early in disease may lead to persistent viral antigen thus contributing to the clinical presentation of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Histopathologic analysis of COVID-19 patients have revealed the viral persistence in severe clinical forms 11, 12 . In the absence of a protective immune response, the burst of load promotes sustained levels of neutrophils described as a clinical hallmark of COVID-19. In fact, severe patients show higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which is suggested as a predictive marker of death 13 .A mounting body of evidence shows that severe clinical forms are associated to coagulation dysfunction markers, mainly D-dimer, platelet reduction, increase in prothrombin time as well as fibrin degradation products 7 . These factors suggest hyperactivity of the coagulation system in organ failure and death. All these findings indicate a potential cross-talk with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are structures made up of intracellular components released by activated neutrophils that discharge DNA, histones and proteins derived from intracellular granules. This process is called NETosis and plays a role in controlling pathogens, but also has a dentrimental effect in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases 14 . Intravascular NETosis in COVID-19 infection could play a role in the vasculature complications, where thrombotic disease can drive organ damage. Therefore, in this report we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 leads to NETs formation and the production of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils that could contribute to disease pathogenesis.Human samples and SARS-CoV-2 isolation. Serum samples from 20 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the acute phase of infection were used in this study (Table 1 ). Blood were collected into a serum vacutainer tube and allow it to clot at room temperature for 1 h. The criteria for confirmed cases with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection included positive result of the nucleic acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab samples based on FDA-approved RNA testing. Severe COVID-19 patients were clinically classified as having fever, respiratory infection, respiratory rate of 23 incursions/minute, dyspnea and oxygen saturation < 93% at room air. Healthy volunteers and severe COVID-19 patients were recruited from Hospital Naval Marcílio Dias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. COVID-19 infected patients were selected with ages ranging from 18 to 83 years (Table 1) . Donors, age and sex matched-non-infected controls were included in the study. SARS-CoV-2 virus (provided by Amilcar Tanury, Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) was isolated from nasal swab specimens obtained from severe COVID-19 patient. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by performing real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, followed by viral N gene sequencing, and virus isolation on Vero E6 cell line. The research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) from Brazilian National Health Council and all patients signed a free and informed consent form in accordance with current legislation and the relevant ethical regulations approved by the Hospital Naval Marcílio Dias (CAAE # 31642720.5.0000.5256) and Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho (CAAE # 30424020.0.0000.0008).NETosis and phagocytosis assay. Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood from the collection of 20 mL of heparinized blood. The blood collected was slowly placed in a 50 mL tube containing 1:2 Ficoll, the gradient was centrifuged for 30 min at room temperature without braking and without acceleration (400g). After centrifugation, the upper part containing mononuclear cells was discarded and the neutrophils were collected with a Pasteur pipette and, after lysis of the red blood cells, the leukocytes were resuspended in RPMI medium, counted and adjusted for each experimental condition. For NETosis assays, neutrophils were suspended in RPMI medium containing 1% nutridoma and adjusted to 1 × 10 5 neutrophils/mL. We stimulated or not with virus MOI 9.0, PMA 100 nM, serum from normal and severely infected patients, LPS 10 ng/mL. PMA and LPS (E. coli O55:B5) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Invivogen (San Diego, CA), respectively. Samples were then incubated for 90 min at 37 °C/5% CO 2 15 , the cells were centrifuged at 4 °C/1600 RPM for 6 min, and the supernatants were collected for extracellular DNA measurement. Then, 25 µL of the supernatants were added to 50 µL of tris-EDTA buffer (1 mM at pH 8.0) and 25 µL of Quant-it Picogreen dsDNA reagent (Thermofisher), a highly sensitive fluorescent DNA dye. The reading was made using a 528 nm emission filter, with 485 nm excitation in a microplate reader (Spectramax M3). For phagocytosis assays, 5 × 10 4 neutrophils were cultured in black 96-well plate treated with 0.001% L-polylysine and incubated in at 37 °C/5% CO 2 for 90 min with or without www.nature.com/scientificreports/ radicals in general and emits green fluorescence. For the assays, the 5 × 10 4 neutrophils were cultured in a 96-well plate treated with 0.001% L-polylysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO 2 for 90 min in the presence or absence of stimuli: COVID-19 virus (MOI 9.0); 10% serum from normal or severely infected patients; PMA 100 nM. Quantification of ROS was done by adding 20 μM H2DCFDA probe (Invitrogen) 15 min before the end of incubation. The plates were read at 530 nm emission and 485 nm excitation using a fluorimeter (Spectramax M3). Data analysis. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM and p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. For multiple comparisons, One-way ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey's least significant difference was performed. Paired t-test analysis was performed for some experiments as indicated in the figure legend. Data analysis was performed by using the GraphPad Prism 5.03 software.We sought to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 virus could activate neutrophils to induce NETosis. Although there is no evidence that viruses can use neutrophils to establish productive infections, many viruses can be detected within neutrophils, being even able to activate neutrophils to produce NETs. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully characterized, it is possible that this process occurs via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present in endosomes or even expressed on the surface of neutrophils 16 . To assess the induction of NETosis by SARS-CoV-2, human neutrophils were stimulated with virus at MOI of 9.0 and the release of DNA was measured 90 min later. We strikingly found that SARS-CoV-2 was able to induce a significant increase of DNA released to supernatant in the presence of virus as compared to spontaneous release from negative control. We did not find any statistical differences between the MOI of 9.0 and 3.0, both being significantly higher than MOI of 1.0 (Fig. 1A) . Additionally, in a control experiment for rapid NETs release, neutrophils were incubated with PMA for the same time point. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 induced the classical NETosis at comparable levels of PMA, after 90 min of incubation (Fig. 1B) .Further studies indicate that these findings are corroborated by the evidence of myeloperoxidase staining in neutrophils treated with virus, a classic marker of NETs 17 . This staining was reduced when the virus was heatinactivated (60 °C/30 min), indicating the importance of viral activity for NETosis (Fig. 2) . Besides their ability to control infection of pathogens by inducing NETosis, neutrophils have a plethora of defense mechanisms. In the human blood, neutrophils are the prevalent phagocytic cells, accounting for about 50% of all leukocytes. They are the major phagocyte of the innate immunity and plays a key role in the host defense against infectious pathogens 18, 19 . We next addressed whether the SARS-CoV-2 could activate the phagocytic capacity of neutrophils. To approach this issue, we used dextran beads conjugated to fluorescein as a marker of phagocytosis. Human neutrophils were plated in monolayers in 96-well plates and stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI of 9.0 in the presence of fluorescein-labeled dextran beads. Phagocytosis was assessed 90 min later by measuring the intracellular neutrophil uptake. Our results indicate a reduction in the incorporation of beads in cells treated with SARS-CoV-2, as compared to the phagocytic activity of control neutrophils. This magnitude of reduction was observed in neutrophils treated with PMA for the same time point, indicating that NETosis in these groups partially impaired the ability of the cells to phagocyte (Fig. 3A ).Next we tested whether SARS-CoV-2 could induce neutrophilic Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). ROS generated by NADPH oxidase play an important role in the clearance of RNA virus by neutrophils. These cells release Scientific Reports | (2020) 10:19630 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76781-0 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ large amounts of ROS at the site of infection following the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), toll-like receptors or IL-8-induced priming of the oxidative burst. ROS released by the NADPH oxidase complex can also activate granular proteases to induce NETosis 19, 20 . Our findings demonstrate that neutrophils are capable of inducing the production and release of ROS when incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 90 min (MOI of 9.0). The same response was observed in the positive controls treated with PMA (Fig. 3B) . Furthermore, neutrophils have a preformed capacity to produce the cytokine IL-8, considering that IL-8 mRNA is produced constitutively by these cells. The production of this proinflammatory cytokine could have a possible autocrine effect in stimulating ROS by neutrophils 20 , as our results indicate that treatment with SARS-CoV-2 induced a modulation in the levels of secreted IL-8, when compared to other control groups (Fig. 3C) . Detection of active viral particles in the peripheral blood is linked to disease severity [21] [22] [23] . Sera derived from these patients presents several thrombolytic factors and inflammatory cytokines that could activate NETosis in neutrophils. According to our hypothesis, our results demonstrated that addition of sera from severe COVID-19 patients (Table 1) to neutrophil monolayer induced the release of DNA compatible with NETs, as compared with heterologous control sera. Our results indicate that this increase was progressive over the 120 min of kinetics analyzed. Both serum groups had a higher DNA release index than spontaneous release of negative controls. The addition of LPS ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) to sera did not confer any synergistic effect on DNA release by activated neutrophils (Fig. 4A) . In a larger cohort, using 20 individuals per group, our data corroborate the previous analysis showing a significant increase in the release of DNA by neutrophils treated with sera obtained from severe COVID-19 patients when compared with normal sera, used as controls (Fig. 4B) . The cells were incubated with virus or PMA (positive control) and after 90 min the supernatants were collected and the extracellular DNA release quantified by the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA method, specific reagent for double-stranded DNA labeling in optical density assay (528 nm). The baseline control autofluorescence for the excitation/emission wavelengths (485/538 nm) is 6.30 ± 2.14. The data are representative of three independent experiments. The results were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's. Differences between groups are significant *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.0025, ***p ≤ 0.0001. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In an independent experimental set using this cohort, we showed that the neutrophil response to COVID-19 serum was not synergistically modulated by the addition of LPS (Fig. 4C) . Immunocytochemistry analysis by staining myeloperoxidase and extracellular DNA indicates the deposition of structural NETs (Fig. 5) . We further investigated whether this NET is actually functional in terms of its microorganism trapping capability. For this purpose, we use as a sentinel pathogen of its action, the Leishmania parasite, a pathogen that presents stages with flagellar motility and is known to activate NETosis 24 . In our experimental approach, neutrophils were activated with COVID-19 serum or PMA as positive control, and after 90 min the cultures were treated with motile promastigote forms of Leishmania parasites. After fixation and labeling with fluorescent nucleic acid dye picogreen for visualization of the double-stranded DNA neutrophilic network, our results demonstrated the functional capacity of NETs induced by the serum from COVID-19 critically infected patients in trapping live parasites, compared to PMA positive controls (Fig. 5) . The parasites trapped in the neutrophilic network activated by the COVID-19 serum showed loss of integrity probably due to the action of the complement system.The ongoing pandemic COVID-19 is a respiratory viral infection associated in about 20% of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome, predisposing to thrombosis both in veins and arteries due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction and stasis. The most frequent hemostatic change due to infection is thrombocytopenia and elevation of D-dimer 7 . In Case-control studies using a cohort of 183 patients it was found that the degree of activation of D-dimers was much higher in patients who did not survive than in those who survived. In addition, in 71% of those who died, clots were found. The increase of D-dimer was correlated to an increased need for invasive ventilation, intensive care and death 7,21 . It is still unclear whether Recent studies have shown that many critically infected patients admitted with COVID-19 exhibit generalized microthrombi formed in veins or arteries, and that can be directly related to the severity and lethality of the disease. These studies revealed that 31% of 184 patients hospitalized for the new pneumonia virus had abnormally clotted blood, a percentage considered extraordinarily high, as compared to hospitalization for others causes 25 . Despite all the data converging to a strong relationship between the new coronavirus and the formation of microthrombus, the mechanisms leading this process remains incompletely understood. It has been revealed that severe COVID-19 patients share common characteristics to the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome with the presence of thick mucus secretions in the airways and the development of blood clots 26 . These symptoms are similar to those of diseases already known as being caused by NETs, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia induced by pathogen infections. The pathological effect of NETs is not restricted to airway obstruction in lung injuries, but also play a role in the occlusion of arteries and vessels in degenerative cardiovascular disease 14 . Recent studies have demonstrated elevated levels of NET markers such as cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3) in serum samples from patients with severe COVID-19, but not in healthy controls 27 . In such a study, the authors showed that the sera from infected patients could trigger NET formation by healthy neutrophils. This notion was corroborated in our study using a cohort of 20 severe COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We showed that the neutrophilic network activated by the serum from patients in the severe form of the disease is structurally and functionally active, in view of its ability to induce extracellular NET-mediated entrapment of pathogens, such as Leishmania parasite. It is possible that the activation of NET in these sera is due to the presence of active virus in the blood of patients in the severe form of the disease 22, 23 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ We further showed for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to activate NETosis in human neutrophils. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this process is associated with increased levels of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) of neutrophils incubated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Reactive oxygen species can kill pathogens directly by causing oxidative damage or indirectly, in neutrophils, by stimulating pathogen elimination via extracellular neutrophil trap formation 16, 19 . ROS also has a detrimental role, promoting venous thrombus formation through the modulation of the enzymatic cascade of fibrinolysis systems of coagulation and the complement system 28 . These findings undoubtedly point to a critical role for neutrophils in the pathology of infection. It will be important to determine whether the presence of NETs in immunohistochemistry analysis of lung tissue from autopsy samples are associated with disease severity and/or particular clinical characteristics of COVID-19. In other severe or persistent viral infections, neutrophil-mediated alveolar damage leads to interstitial edema, ventilation/perfusion mismatch and respiratory failure. Recent studies have identified neutrophil infiltration in the pulmonary capillaries in autopsy reports of COVID-19 patients 29 . This further supports the hypothesis that neutrophils may be responsible for the severity of the disease. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Taking into account that the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection has linked to NET formation, it is possible that compounds that degrade NETs or block their formation could relieve ARDS associated with disease. This is seen in cases of cystic fibrosis in which the therapeutic use of dornase alfa, which dissolves NETs by cleaving DNA, and provides loosen sputum and relieve symptoms 30 . The protocol for administering these medications cannot be organ-specific since the disease has been revealed as a systemic disease. The upregulation of ACE2 in patients with comorbidities may represent a propensity for an increased viral load and spreading of infection to extrapulmonary tissues 4, 5 . The systemic infection would lead to a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to an extensive microthrombus formation with multiorgan failure in severe patients. As an alternative to this therapeutic target, studies have revealed that the use of heparin, a low-cost anticoagulant, was associated with an improvement in the prognosis of severe cases in COVID-19 resulting in increased oxygen levels in the patients' blood 31 . Our studies also suggest the importance of using antioxidant treatments aiming at abrogating the possible participation of ROS generated by thrombosis in neutrophils activated by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further clinical studies are, however, needed to bring clarity to this issue. Despite the limitations in our capacity in responding promptly to the clinical demand for this disease, a comprehensive understanding of the viral pathogenesis is needed in order to eliminate this devastating pandemic virus. Substantial significance statement. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more serious infections, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), and recently the new Coronavirus disease 2019 . Therefore, in the context of the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 stimulates extracellular neutrophils traps (NETs) in a process called NETosis. Our findings indicate that this process is associated with increased levels of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in neutrophils. The ROS-NET pathway plays a role in thrombosis formation and our study suggest the importance of this target for therapy approaches against disease.",Brazil,first author,2020-11-12,11

Vilaró (Conceptualization) (Writing -original draft) (Writing -review and editing) Respiratory function in patients post-infection by COVID-19: a systematic review and meta- analysis","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 to be a pandemic, with approximately 20% of patients infected requiring hospitalisation and 6% in critical care and needing invasive ventilatory assistance. 1 Early J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f epidemiological reports showed that 8.2% of total cases presented with rapid and progressive respiratory failure, similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2 Recent evidence suggests that the lungs are the organ most affected by COVID-19 3 with different pathophysiological events that include diffuse alveolar epithelium destruction, hyaline membrane formation, capillary damage and bleeding, alveolar septal fibrous proliferation, and pulmonary consolidation. 4 A characteristic of COVID-19 is the extensive injury to alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells with secondary fibroproliferation, 5 indicating a potential for chronic vascular and alveolar remodelling leading to lung fibrosis and/or pulmonary hypertension. 6 These findings generate concerns regarding the assessment of lung injury for discharged patients. 4 Different types of functional respiratory evaluations can be carried out objectively, the most commonly used are pulmonary function tests (PFTs), such as spirometry, diffusion capacity and lung volumes, 7 However, other tests that complement lung function tests, such as the evaluation of respiratory muscles or airway resistance, can help to improve the study of the properties of the lung and allow us to determine the consequences of acute or chronic respiratory disease objectively.The abnormalities of chest computed tomography (CT), as described in the epidemiological reports, can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and, for this reason, can be analysed together with pulmonary function. 3, 8 Recent clinical guidelines suggest following up patients with severe pneumonia due to COVID-19 with full PFTs 12 weeks after discharge. 9 In the case of mild to moderate pneumonia, the PFTs must be conducted after abnormal chest x-rays. In both cases, if any abnormality in lung function, together with a CT abnormality, is found, the patient must be referred to a specialist in interstitial lung disease. 9 The first reports on lung function related to COVID-19 indicated that patients have a restrictive defect and a small airways dysfunction that can be persistent and not related to the disease severity. 10 Additionally, Mo et al. reported an impairment of diffusion capacity followed by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 restrictive ventilatory defects, which are both associated with the severity of the disease. 4 The literature on previous coronavirus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is concordant with these reports and suggests that patients may experience persistent impairment lasting for months or even years after being discharged. 11, 12 Because it is essential to detect alterations in pulmonary function for the diagnosis and followup of patients with respiratory and functional sequelae produced by COVID-19, we decided to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence of restrictive pattern, obstructive pattern and altered diffusion in patients post-COVID-19 infection and to describe the different evaluations of respiratory function used with these patients.We performed a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 13 The meta-analysis was designed and performed in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (MOOSE). 14 The review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42020198178).We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies (cross-sectional, longitudinal, case-control and cohort) of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The studies included aimed to determine the use of PFTs to assess post-infection COVID-19patients. The selected studies had to follow the ATS / ERS clinical guidelines. 7 In the case of studies that include spirometry, the restrictive pattern had to be confirmed by lung volumes.To analyze the obstructive and restrictive pattern, the studies had to be based on clinical guidelines, such as the ATS / ERS. 7 However, in clinical practice, an FEV1 / FVC ratio of less than 0.7 has been used, so this relationship was also considered. 15 We reviewed the Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) databases on July 15, 2020.

We also conducted a manual search of the references included in the selected articles. All references were analysed using Rayyan web software. 16 Reviewing procedure and data extraction An assessment of the methodological quality of the primary articles was carried out using the Quality Assessment Tools from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). 17 Each tool contains criteria against which internal validity and risk of bias are evaluated. The criteria were evaluated as ""Yes"", ""No"", or ""Other"" (not reported, not applicable, or not determinable), and an overall rating was provided for each study based on the items rated with an affirmative answer: ≥ 75% = good, 50-75% = fair, < 50% = poor. Two authors carried out this evaluation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f independently (XAR, LVC), and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. For discrepancies that could not be resolved, a third author (HP) was consulted.We used MetaXL software version 5.3 (EpiGear International, Sunrise Beach, Queensland, Australia) for our meta-analysis and generation of a forest plot that showed combined estimates with a 95% confidence interval. We pooled the prevalence of the studies structured around individual outcomes using the double arcsine transformation method. 18 We obtained combined measurements of effect for each primary outcome through meta-analysis under a random-effect model due to the expected heterogeneity between studies in prognostic reviews. 19 Statistical heterogeneity was measured through the I 2 statistic and classified as low (I 2 < 25%), moderate (I 2 25-50%), or high (I 2 > 50%). 20 Subgroup analysis, according to the outcome assessment and severity, was carried out. Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to assess the change in pooled prevalence due to the selective exclusion of studies.The initial search yielded 1,973 potential studies (1,971 from selected databases and 2 from manual searches). In total, 228 duplicate records were deleted. We screened 1,745 titles and abstracts and excluded 1,677 records which did not meet our inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f these were assessed as full-text. Of these, 30 studies were excluded for being wrong publication type, 16 for wrong study design, nine for wrong outcome, six for being wrong protocol and one for wrong population. Ultimately, seven studies met the criteria for eligibility and were included in the review. 4, 6, 10, [21] [22] [23] [24] The flow chart of the study selection process is shown in Figure 1 .Six studies were conducted in China 4,10,21-24 and one in France. 6 The designs of the studies included one RCT, 21 three retrospectives, 6, 22, 24 and three prospectives (Table 1) . 10, 21, 23 Participants In total, 380 post-infection COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the included studies. Sample sizes varied between 18 10,23 and 110 4 participants. The studies included 162 females and 190 males with mean age varied between 46.7 ± 13.7 and 69.1 ± 7.8 years. One study did not report the gender and mean age of the patients. 23 Five studies reported that between 6% and 18% of patients had a history of smoking, 4,6,22-24 while two studies did not report this. 10, 21 Three studies reported respiratory comorbidities, 4,6,23 including emphysema, 6 asthma, 4, 6 sarcoidosis, 6 tuberculosis, 23 chronic bronchitis 4 and bronchiectasis. 4There was a wide range in the time of assessment. Two authors reported that respiratory assessment were conducted one month after symptom onset. 4,6 a further two authors reported that they were conducted one month after discharge, , 10, 22 One author reported that they were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f conducted three months after discharge. 24 another reported two assessment times, close to discharge and two weeks after discharge, 23 and one author did not report the time of assessment. 21 The methodological quality of the studies was determined to be ""fair"" in four studies 4,6,21,24 and ""poor"" in three studies 10, 22, 23 (Supplementary file S2) . In our analysis of design, we used the NHLBI's Quality Assessment of Controlled Intervention Studies tool in one study rated as ""fair"". 21 We used the NHLBI's Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies in six studies, with three being rated as ""fair"" 4,6,24 and three being rated as ""poor"". 10 10, 23 Only one study reported tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume and inspiratory capacity. 10 One study did not report patterns of PFT abnormality; 21 (Figure 4 ). In the analysis of severity, we excluded one study that had not performed this sub-analysis. 24 The prevalence found was 0.66 (CI 0.31-0.94, p<0.01, I 2 =82%) for severe patients and 0.36 (CI 0.28-0.46, p=0.27, I 2 =25%) for non-severe patients.One study reported the use of an impulse oscillation system. 22 The parameters reported were airway resistance at an oscillation frequency of 5 Hz (R5) and of 20 Hz (R20). 22 The values obtained were 126.6 ± 29.5%pred and 132.8 ± 30.9%pred for R5 and R20, respectively. One study reported on respiratory muscle strength. 22 In this study, the parameters reported were maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). 22 The MIP and MEP were 76.2 ± 24.3%pred, and 102.7 ± 32.7%pred, respectively (Supplementary file S3).Altered diffusion capacity, restrictive pattern and obstructive pattern were found in 39%, 15% and 7% of studies, respectively. The assessments most commonly used to assess the respiratory function of patients with COVID-19 were spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion capacity.We found a high prevalence of altered diffusion capacity. Similar data were found in three studies. 4, 6, 22 in one of which the prevalence was nearly a third smaller than in the other studies. 24 A possible explanation for this difference is the time of assessment. Zhao et al., who reported a 16% prevalence, performed the PFTs three months after COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospital. 24 Three other studies, which reported a prevalence of between 44% and 56%, 4,6,22 performed the PFTs during the first month post-infection.An important aspect to consider is the ideal time to perform respiratory assessment tests. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guide recommends the evaluation of PFTs at three months post-discharge, especially at follow-up with patients suspected of having an interstitial disease. 9 However, in the reviewed studies, most PFTs were conducted one month after the onset of COVID-19 or one month after discharge. Haste of evaluation may lead to errors in functional diagnosis since we cannot determine how much of this limitation is a result of the disease and how much is due to inflammation from the acute event.Autopsies of COVID-19 patients revealed different degrees of destruction in alveolar structure, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis was observed. 25 Pathological changes in the lungs could explain the impaired diffusion capacity. This finding, added to the initial reports of lung damage evidenced by CT, 8 confirms the need to follow these patients, looking for interstitial diseases specifically, as recommended by some clinical guidelines. 9 We found a very high prevalence of altered diffusion capacity (66%) in severe patients, especially those with high inflammatory indicators who are more likely to develop pulmonary fibrosis. 26 We found a prevalence of restrictive patterns in 15% of patients. The current guidelines suggest a restrictive pattern if the FEV1/FVC ratio ≥ lower limit normal (LLN) and the FVC is < LLN, which should be confirmed by evaluating the TLC. 7 An important confounding in our obstructive pattern analysis is the presence of chronic respiratory diseases as comorbidities. Frija-Masson found only two patients with obstructive patterns, but these patients had underlying respiratory diseases (one had asthma and one had sarcoidosis). 6 Other authors also reported the presence of respiratory comorbidities that could influence PFTs. 4, 23 For this reason, we analysed this outcome with caution as the data may be overestimated.We identified other respiratory function assessments, such as respiratory muscle strength, that provide essential information about the state of respiratory pumps and airway resistance, which is important for the confirmation of lung obstruction. 22 All these assessments help to improve the respiratory characterisation of COVID-19 patients and have been recommended to characterise the functional limitations generated by this disease. 27 Given the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation of COVID-19, it is essential to have simple tools to assess and monitor the impact of symptoms on the respiratory function of patients. 28 Considering the large number of COVID-19 survivors who require follow-up, the use of reproducible instruments to identify patients suffering from slow or incomplete recovery will help guide the reasonable use of medical resources. 28 The systematic review process was rigorous. The review was preceded by the publication of a protocol with all review methods described and all review authors were appropriately trained and had experience in review preparation.We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, including full-text publications, without language restrictions or the use of filters in the search strategy. Although we only included studies published between December 2019 and July 2020, it is unlikely that any have been missed, given that publications on the topic only began to appear in December 2019.This systematic review followed the standard recommended methodology and was constructed in line with PRISMA guidelines. 13 Two independent review authors assessed the inclusion criteria for the studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies, thus reducing the risk of performance bias in the review and data extraction errors.We found wide heterogeneity in the designs. We were only able to analyse seven studies, and these were not necessarily of good quality. The majority were qualified as ""poor"". The most significant concern was the time of assessment. Haste in evaluation may lead to errors in functional diagnosis since we cannot determine how much of this limitation is a result of the disease and how much is due to inflammation from the acute event.The most important limitation of this study is the high heterogeneity of the selected studies, particularly among the different evaluations used. The criteria for determining the severity of pneumonia differ according to the literature; variations such as based on CT findings, guidelines of COVID-19, or use of ventilatory support. Assessing the methodological quality in the studies reviewed was difficult because different designs were identified. Another significant limitation is that the studies did not report the previous lung function of the patients, so it is not possible to know the real affect generated by the infection. This limitation can be partially remedied since it is compared with reference values; however, it should be considered that there may be a reduction in lung function due to previous respiratory diseases, effects of smoking or environmental pollution.Finally, the assessment times were different. Although the PFTs follow specific guidelines given by the clinical guidelines of respiratory societies, it is necessary to establish standard evaluation times to facilitate comparison between different populations. In this way, we will be better able to know the real impact on respiratory function generated by COVID-19. ",Chile,first author,2020-11-25,11
52d84c0bd5ee6c94ed03a800e0e3f5e67493d346,Elderly individuals living by themselves: knowledge and measures to prevent the novel coronavirus*,"COVID-19, from the term ""coronavirus disease 2019"", is an acute respiratory disease, caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (1) , which was declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern and characterized as a pandemic on March 11 th , 2020 (2) .have not yet been fully recognized (1) . It is known, however, that the virus is highly transmissible and mainly spreads from person to person (3) . Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets released through the nose or mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes (1) . The presence of the virus on objects or surfaces is another form of contagion; hence, people are at risk of becoming infected if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching contaminated objectives or surfaces (1) .The clinical condition of COVID-19 in most cases is similar to other respiratory infections: fever (≥37.8ºC), running nose, dry cough, and fatigue (2) . Approximately 5% of the infected individuals develop the most severe form of the disease, with symptoms such as dyspnea and/or pulmonary bleeding, severe lymphopenia, and renal failure (4) .Given the seriousness of the world situation and the need to decrease the spread of COVID-19 and flatten its epidemiological curve, preventive measures were adopted such as hand sanitation, respiratory etiquette, cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and objects, and social distancing (2) . Delay in adopting these measures resulted in an epidemiological curve with high mortality rates in Brazil, Italy, Spain, and the United States of America, even surpassing China (2) .Due to the physiological changes inherent to the human aging process, which compromise the immunological system, and the greater number of complications accruing from chronic diseases at old age, the elderly are more susceptible to the more severe manifestations of COVID-19 and, consequently, death (5) (6) . Additionally, sociodemographic and economic characteristics, such as advanced age; low educational and income levels; and single-person households, favor the greater vulnerability of elderly individuals to COVID-19. These factors may interfere in the access to information and, consequently, knowledge and implementation of measures to prevent infection by the novel coronavirus (7) (8) (9) (10) .Coupled with these, there has been an increase in the number of elderly individuals living by themselves (11) .In Brazil, 15 .7% of individuals aged 60 years old or older live alone (12) ; with the South (15.9%) and Southeast (15.7%) presenting the highest percentages (11) . Singleperson households may be seen as an accomplishment considering that older people can enjoy greater privacy and independence as they age (11) , however, elderly individuals living by themselves may become more vulnerable and deprived of social support when facing health problems (11, 13) . Additionally, access to information depends on the context in which individuals live (7) (8) andknowledge regarding preventive measures is one of the crucial factors to prevent the contagion and spread of the novel coronavirus (1) .In this context, the identification of factors related in long-term residential facilities for the elderly (14) (15) ; the knowledge held by adult and elderly individuals living in the community and their behavior in the face of COVID-19 (7) (8) ; the beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic held by the population in a Brazilian state (16) ; the consequences of social isolation in the lives of elderly individuals (13, 17) ; and the clinical characteristics and prognosis factors among COVID-19 patients aged 60 years old or older (5) (6) . Therefore, the objective was to describe the occurrence of COVID- 19 (Table 3) . The following variables met the criterion (p≤0. 10) in the bivariate analysis and were included in the multiple linear regression final model: sex, age range, schooling, monthly individual income, and number of morbidities (Table 4) . Being a man, 80 years old or older, and having a lower level of education were associated with poor knowledge of COVID-19 preventive measures (Table 5) . The higher percentage of women found in this study is in line with the reports of Brazilian studies (11) .One study conducted in a city in Minas Gerais verified that most elderly individuals in the group who lived by themselves were women (19) . The predominance of women among elderly individuals may be explained by the higher life expectancy among women in comparison to men, which is currently 80.25 years old in Brazil (20) .The larger percentage of widows may be related to the predominance of women and their life expectancy, though women are also more likely to live by themselves than remarrying or being the head of the family (21) .Regarding age, similar results were found in a Brazilian study, in which a larger number of individuals aged 75 years old or older lived alone compared to younger individuals (p<0.001) (11) . A Brazilian regional study, however, verified that most elderly individuals living by themselves were 60 to 69 years old (19) .Individuals in advanced age living by themselves may face problems to use health services and perform daily tasks, which may become more difficult in the absence of family members (19) .Similar to these findings, a study verified that most elderly individuals living by themselves had from one to four years of schooling (19) . Divergent data were found in a Brazilian survey in which the percentage of elderly individuals in single-person households (16.9%) had from eight to ten years of schooling (11) . A low educational level negatively affects self-care behavior (9) due to difficulties to access and assimilate information (10) .Concerning monthly individual income, most of the participants living by themselves in a city in the interior of Minas Gerais received from one to three times the minimum wage (19) , a piece of information that is in line with this study's findings. and in the face of comorbidities, favoring the more severe forms of the COVID-19 (5) (6) .International studies report that the main signs and symptoms presented by individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, and body ache (5, (22) (23) , the same symptoms presented by this study's participants. Note that a few participants for hours to days (27) when expelled through cough or sneeze (27) (28) , and the need to avoid handshaking and touching contaminated surfaces (27) , considering that a single droplet may contain an infectious dose (27) .An international study reports that 71.7% of elderly individuals had knowledge of three symptoms of COVID-19 (7) , which is in line with the mean identified in this study. The infectious condition with the onset of fever is the clinical symptoms more commonly identified in COVID-19 (29) (30) , considered essential to screening the disease (25) , which is corroborated by the elderly individuals' reports. The period in which fever manifests, however, is unknown (30) . Elderly individuals may present Additionally, people may complain of body ache, fatigue, and malaise (5, 29) . One scoping review and metaanalysis identified that 36% of the patients reported body ache, 12% reported headache, and 10% sore throat (30) . When the percentages are totaled, the results are similar to those found in this study, in which 52.8%of the elderly participants living by themselves reported being aware of these COVID-19 symptoms. (1) .The use of face masks is a measure adopted worldwide to prevent and control COVID-19, which has been widely reported by scientific studies (27, (31) (32) and is is spread is from person to person through droplets, followed by aerosols (25) , and hands are the main route of cross-contamination (27) . The virus may remain on surfaces and in the environment for different periods, ranging from hours to days (34) . For this reason, besides being a low-cost practice, hand sanitation is highly effective and is considered one of the most relevant measures to prevent COVID-19 (27) . Nonetheless, for microorganisms to be inactivated and levels of infection and transmission to decrease, the alcohol needs to present a concentration between 62% and 71% (36) . Its use is necessary in environments outside the home where water and soap are not readily available, whenever one has physical or close contact with people, objects, or surfaces that may be contaminated.Note that social distancing was not a preventive measure most frequently reported by the elderly individuals, which is opposed to the expressive dissemination in the media and scientific studies of its needs and positive effects in the control of the transmission of COVID-19 (32, 37) .One study conducted in the state of Ceará, Brazil reports that elderly people partially adhered to social distancing and received visits (62.5%) (16) .The same was found in this study, in which most elderly individuals left their homes during the time social distancing was recommended. Even though the Brazilian authorities emphasize social distancing, specifically for the groups most susceptible to develop the severe form of the disease (1-2,26,32,37) , one needs to consider and understand the reasons that lead these individuals to leave their homes.social support need to run errands to meet their needs, such as: go to the grocery store and pay bills, among others, while the information they received may not have been sufficient to convince them of the need to adhere to social distancing. Emotional aspects such as loneliness also need to be considered in addition to beliefs and values. One Brazilian study reports that elderly individuals believed that the pandemic would be less severe in Brazil than in other countries (16) . Note that the way individuals respond to situations, such as a pandemic, vary according to their engagement in preventive care, and how they address problems and search for solutions (9) . soap and water, were the ones most frequently adopted, followed by avoiding crowded places.The use of masks was also verified in a systematic review with meta-analysis, which reports an association between its use and the protection of healthy individuals at home and whenever social interaction is necessary (38) .Its use involves a series of measures though, necessary to keep it viable, without becoming an object of new contaminations. For this reason, for a mask to function as a mechanical barrier against the novel coronavirus (35) , one should follow recommendations on how to put and remove it, how to sanitize it, and regarding the period it remains viable, up to its discard (35) .The use of masks is coupled with hand sanitation, the second preventive measure the elderly individuals reported, which is consistent with the literature (27, 33, 35) .Nonetheless, even when implementing the aforementioned measures, agglomerations should be avoided (33) (34) (35) .Even though these measures are recommended (33) (34) (35) to ensure greater protection against transmission, one has to implement various measures together (27, (31) (32) , such as those necessary to implement when returning home, which few participants reported.www.eerp.usp.br/rlae 8 Rev. Latino-Am. Enfermagem 2020;28:e3383.Considering that behavioral change depends on the context one is inserted in, and is characterized by the unpredictability of different sociodemographic and economic characteristics (39) , these findings reinforce the need for nurses to implement educational actions together with elderly individuals by using effective communication.The association identified in this study between women and adult individuals (p<0.001) (7) (8) .The little knowledge of COVID-19 preventive measures among the elderly men may be related to the fact that they do not value self-care; are little concerned with their health, and have difficulties sharing their feelings and verbalizing their needs (40) . This context may also affect the mortality rates caused by COVID-19, which are higher among male elderly individuals (41) (42) (43) . InItaly, 83.0% of the deaths occurred among 60-year-old or older individuals; 80% of whom were men (42) . The last Epidemiological Bulletin published on May 23 rd , 2020reports that 69.4% of the deaths caused by COVID-19in Brazil were among 60-year-old or older individuals, while 60.2% of them were men (43) . According to the Epidemiological Report of the COVID-19 pandemic, published on June 6 th , 2020, 72.7% of the deaths in Minas Gerais were among the elderly, 53.0% of whom were men (24) .In this context, educational actions in the nursing field should be planned to reach elderly men living by themselves. In addition to educational practices within the healthcare network (44) , nurses' competencies such as preventive actions and the early detection of infections by the novel coronavirus should be implemented during gerontological nursing consultations.In line with this study, one international study addressing adult and elderly individuals in the community reports that individuals of advanced age and those living by themselves presented a lower level of knowledge of COVID-19 (p<0.001) (7) , showing that older individuals are more vulnerable to the infection caused by the novel coronavirus (6) . These circumstances reinforce the need for actions and specific interventions for 80 years-old or older individuals living by themselves, as they may need more complex care with greater investment in health, like in the case of the infection caused by the novel coronavirus (7) .The bond established between long-lived individuals and health workers was associated with preventive measures to combat COVID-19 (p=0.008) in a study conducted in the state of Ceará, Brazil (16) . This bond contributes to elderly individuals being more pro-active in the health-disease continuum and also promote the delivery of comprehensive health care (45) . The primary health care policy provides for the establishment of bonding and co-accountability between health teams and the population, ensuring the continuity of actions as well as establishing the service as a reference for these individuals (46) . From this perspective, bonding emerges as a fundamental element to favor the adherence of elderly individuals who live by themselves to the COVID-19 preventive measures.One study conducted in the United States also found that elderly individuals (p<0.001), as well as those living alone (p<0.001), and with a low educational level (p<0.001), presented the worst level of knowledge concerning COVID-19 (7) . The low educational level of the elderly individuals may be considered a risk factor for the dissemination of viral infections and death (7, 16) , considering that it may negatively influence the way elderly individuals understand and perform self-care (47) . Additionally, a low educational level may be associated with an individual's social status, suggesting that lifestyle, living conditions, and knowledge concerning COVID-19 influence its prognosis (7, 16) . Therefore, less educated elderly individuals would be more prone to the infection caused by the novel coronavirus because they use crowded public transportation and have poor access to medical resources (16) .This context represents a challenge for health workers, especially nurses providing care to elderly individuals living by themselves with a low educational level. For this reason, strategies that favor the knowledge and adherence to measures that prevent the spread and transmission of COVID-19 are needed (16) . Nurses should attempt to use efficient communication with these individuals, using clear and objective language when addressing the care necessary to prevent this disease.Communication in the nursing scope is an essential strategy in the care provided to elderly individuals because it encourages individuals to trust health workers and expose their needs, promoting positive interaction between care recipients and nurses (48) .One of this study's limitations refers to its cross-sectional design, which does not allow for the establishment of causal effects, and its sample, which strategies that are specific to elderly men, aged 80 years old or older, with a low educational level.Additionally, the results can also direct the practice of nurses working in the primary health care network and having greater contact with these individuals, to perform nursing actions intended to prevent the infection by the novel coronavirus.

There are more than 47 million confirmed cases at the present moment, with a cumulative number of deaths of over 1,215,000, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (updated data can be accessed at https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Currently, vaccines are still under trial, and there are no effective drugs to treat this disease [1] .Indeed, most of the available evidence supports the proposal that social distancing, wearing masks, and eye protection effectively prevent transmission [2] . Better hygiene (handwashing) and the use of sanitizers have also been found to reduce the spread of the disease (COVID-19) [1, 3, 4] .WHO has recommended using masks, and governments have established face protection policies for public spaces [4] . The resulting increase in demand and a shortage of market availability have led to price increases for masks [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Health professionals are at high risk for infection with the new coronavirus, and a lack of adequate protective equipment during critical procedures in infected patients is increasing that risk considerably [10, 11] . In Brazil, for example, more nurses and nurse assistants have died due to COVID-19 than any other country [12] ; most of them have been infected during their work with infected patients, and in some situations, using home-made masks.N95 respirators are a type of respirator mask used as facial protection by healthcare providers and are specifically advocated when performing aerosol-generating procedures [7, 13] . They present a hermetically sealed fit, and wearers do not breathe the surrounding air unfiltered. These respirators can filter over 95% of pollutant particles (>0.3 µm) in the air due to a higher electrostatic charge (which blocks the particles) andhave been suggested to be used to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread [14] . These masks are intended for single use and, based on the manufacturer's instructions, they are heat sensitive and not designed to be sterilized; however, due to their high costs and limited availability [6, 13] , different methods to decontaminate N95 [5, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] respirators have been discussed to allow multiple usages. Other types of N95 respirator include a mask with a valve designed for people exposed to asbestos and dust.Decontamination methods can be classified into chemical or physical treatment, dry heat, or moist heat [7] . Such approaches need to fulfill specific criteria: elimination of harmful pathogens; minimal damage to the facemask structure; low toxicity and costs; J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f for the term ""N95 AND Decontamination OR Disinfection"" posted between ""01 March 2020 and 10 August 2020"" and considering the inclusion criteria reported previously.The search was undertaken using EndNote (EndNote X9, Thomson Reuters, New York, US). Two researchers independently identified relevant records by analyzing titles and abstracts for relevance according to the eligibility criteria. Retrieved records were classified as include, exclude, or uncertain. The full-text articles of the included and uncertain records were selected for further eligibility screening by the same two reviewers, again independently. Discrepancies in the screening of titles/abstracts and fulltext articles were resolved through a discussion. In case of disagreement, the opinion of a third reviewer was obtained. The study selection of published studies and preprint materials was carried out separately.We created a form using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, US), which was pilot tested by three reviewers to reach a consensus on what data to collect and how. Then, two reviewers extracted the data independently, and a third reviewer evaluated this process.Five studies reported the process for N95 decontamination with vaporized hydrogen peroxide. Schwartz et al. (2020) described the process implemented at Duke University (US) and demonstrated that vaporized hydrogen peroxide is an efficacious decontamination method that does not cause physical or performance degradation of the masks [25] . Perkins et al. (2020) described the process implemented at the University of New Mexico (US) and reported on the low toxicity of their methods. The authors highlighted the importance of physically assessing masks after decontamination [61] . Grossman et al.(2020) described decontamination using vaporized hydroperoxide employed by Washington University (US). They demonstrated that the entire process requires less than 24 hours and showed that it is important to create a workflow to achieve effective decontamination considering pre-processing steps, decontamination, and post-processing steps [60] . Jatta et al. (2020) presented the decontamination using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (59%) and demonstrated that this approach could be used safely without affecting mask performance [36] . Hankenson et al. (2020) described a process to develop a multiroom animal housing into a vaporized hydrogen peroxide center and found that this method can decontaminate a significant number of masks [34] .Further studies evaluated this latter strategy combined with others or discussed its availability and feasibility. Cadnum et al. (2020) performed an in vitro study and compared the use of a high-level decontamination cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide with ultraviolet C light and dry heat at 70 °C for 30 minutes. They demonstrated that aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide are useful for the decontamination of N95 respirators [5] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Kobayashi et al. (2020) assessed the authority recommendations in the Netherlands, the state governments in the US, the European Commission Directorate-General for Health and Consumers, and the European Medicines Agency regarding the use of vaporous hydrogen peroxide. They found that although this method seems to lead to acceptable decontamination while retaining mask integrity according to visual inspections, this type of decontamination is not available throughout all countries and institutions, and currently, no standard for its application exists [23] .Ten reviews noted that vaporous hydrogen peroxide appears to be a highly promising method for N95 respirator decontamination [45, 47, [51] [52] [53] 55, 57, 58, 64] .Hamzanzi et al. (2020) presented a prototype model for N95 respirator decontamination using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation that would allow decontamination of 18 to 27 masks in one process [22] . Kobayashi et al. (2020) assessed the authority recommendations on ultraviolet germicidal irradiation use and found that although this method is promising, it has not been standardized by any of the authorities so far [23] . Cadnum et al. (2020) demonstrated that ultraviolet C could reduce N95 respirator contamination, but efficacy varied with different mask types and locations on the respirator [5] . demonstrated that ultraviolet C light inactivated SARS-CoV-2 more slowly on N95 respirators than stainless steel, most likely due to its porous nature [32] . Simmons et al.(2020) noted that a pulsed xenon ultraviolet system is promising for N95 respirator suggested using a hybrid method, including ultraviolet C and heat treatment, that can be extended to other infections agents [28] . highlighted that at least 1 J/cm2 of ultraviolet C applied to all surfaces is necessary to ensure N95 respirator decontamination. However, the authors emphasized that ultraviolet C decontamination has limitations, mainly because each mask type requires a specific irradiation dose to be reliably effective [24] .In sum, eight reviews commented that ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is a highly promising strategy for N95 decontamination [45, 47, [50] [51] [52] [53] 57, 58] .Different decontamination methods and protocols using heat have been discussed in the literature and found to be promising for N95 respirator decontamination.The use of moist heat was cited in two letters [7, 13] , six in vitro studies [17, 27, 29, 31, 37, 38] , and two other study designs [66, 67] . Regarding the in vitro studies, Anderegg et al. (2020) demonstrated that moist heat is a scalable method; all masks passed the fit testing and maintained filtration efficiency after five cycles [27] . Bopp et al. (2020) noted that N95 respirators could resist up to three cycles of moist heat [29] . Daeschler et al. (2020) tested different humidity scenarios and found that it is possible to use 50% relative humidity for up to 10 cycles [31] . However, Pascoe et al. (2020) demonstrated that moist heat was effective only in some types of N95 respirators [38] .The use of dry heat was cited in four in vitro studies [32, 37, 38, 43] , one review [46] , and one other study design [66] . Fischer et al. (2020) and Pascoe et al. (2020) demonstrated that the use of dry heat at 70 ºC is effective [32, 38] , but Fischer et al. (2020) highlighted that this approach is not recommended for more than two rounds [32] . Ou et al. (2020) compared dry and moist heat; dry heat was a better method for maintaining filtration efficiency and fit testing, but by adding moisture, the virus inactivation was higher [37]. Xiang et al. (2020) demonstrated the successful use of dry heat at 70 °C after 1, 2, and 3 hours for N95 respirator decontamination [43] . Other methods cited included the deposit of silver nanoparticles [68] .Thirty-seven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria from which the data were extracted ( Figure 1 ).Tables 3 and 4 present the characteristics of the included studies. Related to the study design of included studies, two articles were letters to the editors explaining the results of in vitro studies [70, 71] , 24 were in vitro studies [16, , 3 were literature reviews [95] [96] [97] , and 8 were classified as other study designs [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] . Details regarding preprint in vitro studies are presented in the Supplemental Material.Related to the decontamination regimens tested or discussed, the use of vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation were the regimens most cited. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide was cited in one letter [70] , 9 in vitro studies J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [74, 76, 78, 79, 81, 86, 87, 92, 93] , one review [95] , and two other study designs [98, 101] . The use of ultraviolet irradiation was cited in 8 in vitro studies [16, 72, 79, 80, 81, 89, 92, 93] , 3 reviews [95] [96] [97] and 5 other study designs [99, 100, 102104, 105] .Seven in-vitro studies demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide is effective as a decontamination method of N95 respirators [75, 76, 78, 81, 86, 87, 93] . One review [95] showed that vaporous hydrogen peroxide has substantial potential for the decontamination of these respirators. Cramer et al. (2020) , in a qualitative study, supported the use of SteraMist iHP technology [98] , and Kenney et al. (2020) demonstrated in a letter the use of the BQ-50 system [70] .Four in vitro studies [16, 72, 81, 89] demonstrated that ultraviolet C is effective as a decontamination method of N95 respirators. Two reviews showed that ultraviolet C light is one of the most promising decontamination [95, 96] . However, Tommey et al.(2020) highlighted concerns about using this method due to incomplete penetration into deeper layers of the filter [97] . Five studies presented different devices to use ultraviolet C light as a decontamination method [99, 100, 102, 104, 105] .Different decontamination methods and protocols using heat were discussed and demonstrated.Moist heat was cited in 6 in vitro studies [73, 77, 80, 83, 91, 93] and one review.Daescher et al (2020) demonstrated that moist heat could be used even after ten cycles, maintaining mask integrity [73] . Doshi et al (2020) presented a method using moist heat that could be scaled for low resources settings [77] . Liao et al. (2020) tested different disinfection methods; moist heat was found to be the most promising approach [80] .The use of dry heat was cited in 5 in vitro studies [81, 83, 84, 94, 103] and one review [96] . Meisenhelder et al. (2020) showed that 95 °C dry heat could be used for 30 minutes and five cycles, maintaining mask properties [84] . Lensky et al (2020) proposed the use of industrial dryers to heat masks for 65 min at 80 °C and demonstrated that the masks maintained their properties after three cycles [103] .Other methods cited included ozone [74, 82] and 70 0 ethanol [85, 92] . Dave et al (2020) . and Manning et al. (2020) demonstrated that ozone is effective as a disinfection method [74, 82] , and Manning et al. (2020) highlighted that this method did not degrade mask properties [82] . Nazeeri et al. (2020) showed that the use of a vacuum chamber is important after 70° ethanol treatment to recover filtering efficiency [85] .This study discussed the evidence about the effectiveness of decontamination strategies of N95 respirators against the novel coronavirus. Our results demonstrate a lack of evidence and consensus related to the best method for N95 respirator decontamination.However, vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation were the regimens most cited and seemed to be the most promising methods for such decontamination.Hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination is common in different fields and facilities, including scientific, pharmaceutical, and medical ones. The method has low toxicity and uses the catalytic reduction of peroxide to oxygen and water [106] . However, it requires a specific room and equipment to achieve effective decontamination and, hence, is rather expensive. Ultraviolet irradiation is a decontamination method using ultraviolet light to inactivate microorganisms through RNA damage and cell function disruption [107] . This method has limitations due to different masks requiring a variety of irradiation dosages; a high dosage, in turn, could result in increased toxicity and mask structural damage. Moreover, this approach also needs specific equipment, limiting its availability.Ideally, any decontamination method should eliminate all pathogens and maintain mask integrity and filter capacity at low toxicity and cost. Today, no one method fulfills these criteria, and the extended use of masks seems to be an appropriate, low-cost approach for overcoming the discussed availability limitations. Current recommendations consider mask-wearing periods between 4 and 40 hours [23] . Notably, additional protection, such as face shields and strict adherence to hand hygiene practices is necessary, particularly if extending mask-wearing periods [108] .Outcomes such as mechanical integrity and performance of N95 respirators should be observed when assessing decontamination strategies of such respirators because decontamination may come at a price; decontaminated but ineffective masks are not useful and can even be dangerous. indicated that fit testing must be performed after decontamination, and if decontamination is achieved but the masks lose J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f their integrity, further usage should be stopped [18] . Hence, both integrity and performance should be prioritized when implementing decontamination strategies, although not all included studies concomitantly tested decontamination and subsequent mask performance.Our study presents some limitations. First, because this was a scoping review, we did not conduct a risk of bias/quality assessment of the included studies. Second, we included only studies in English. Third, the included studies present different designs and protocols, making it difficult to compare the results, particularly because many N95 respirator brands are available on the market, different regimens were tested, and individual scenarios of wearers (such as the influence of cosmetics or sunscreen use for ultraviolet decontamination) are difficult to test. Further, many studies presented severe limitations, including small sample size and poor quantitative data reporting. Fourth, we included articles discussing decontamination methods based on opinions rather than evidence, making it difficult to provide more general conclusions and recommendations, and we included preprint studies; however, these are preliminary reports of works that have not been certified by peer review results and should, therefore, be interpreted with caution. Finally, we included different reviews that could generate an overlap of papers; however, 34 preprint reports (not considering preprint reviews) were included, but they were not part of the 16 published reviews.The global COVID-19 pandemic is still currently accelerating. The shortage of protective equipment, particularly for healthcare workers, indicates that more investigations for safely decontaminating N95 respirators are necessary. The availability and cost-effectiveness of decontamination should also be considered in future primary studies.The evidence supporting appropriate decontamination strategies of N95 respirators against the novel coronavirus remains scarce. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation are the current standard for these respirators. However, cleaning is an essential step prior to decontamination, and decontamination methods should be followed by fit testing. Further, the extended use of masks appears to be an effective, low-cost approach to overcome the global shortage of N95 respirators. The study discussed about fittesting performance collected for the different respirator models treated with UVGI.The data of this study strongly indicates that to protect the safety of the N95 respirator user, fit-testing after decontamination must be done each time a new model is introduced to a healthcare system. This has significant safety implications as varied decontamination methods are being used by different institutions. The study talks about a quality assurance (QA) step, after complete aeration, to ensure both qualitative and quantitative degradation has not occurred, ensuring that there was no physical or erformance degradation. Also, a standardized quantitative fit testing was preformed to ensure the integrity of the respirators is maintained over many decontamination cycles. In addition, we validated the efficacy of the decontamination process by using 9 individual 6-log biological indicators (Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores).Using hydrogen peroxide vapor is a proven method of decontamination. Authors believe that decontamination of N95 respirators with hydrogen peroxide vapor is one such solution that affords us better ability to protect our health care workers as we continue to tackle this monumental issue. The study shows that overall, strategies involving the use of UVGI, ethylene oxide, dry oven heating and hydrogen peroxide vapour may be most promising for preservation of mask function and integrity. Decontamination with UVGI, moist heat incubation and microwave-generated steam does not appear to significantly affect N95 respirator fit or comfort. Until application of these methods has been adequately investigated in the hospital setting, their safety and effectiveness in the particular context of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is unknown. Overall a thermal disinfection at 60°C for 30 min, 65°C for 15 min and 80°C for 1 min was effective to strongly reduce coronavirus infectivity. Data do not allow to evaluate if the function of a face mask remains unchanged after heat treatment. If thermal disinfection is used for the re-use of masks all institutions should evaluate the effect on their own masks in use, as different brands of masks and different specifications (e.g. with or without cellulose) will react individually towards a combination of time and heat. Easy tests to do are ""fitting"" and ""water-resistance"". In addition, the numbers of re-uses should be traced (mark at the side of mask per cycle) and its effects examined.To synthesize existing data on the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation for N95 FFR decontamination Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation -The authors findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination. To outline a procedure by which PPE may be decontaminated using ultraviolet radiation in biosafety cabinets and discuss the dose ranges needed for effective decontamination of critical PPE. Furthermore, discuss the obstacles to this approach including the possibility that the UV radiation levels vary within biosafety cabinets.Determining if ultraviolet lights used in biosafety cabinets could be temporarily repurposed for ultraviolet germicidal irradiation decontamination to preserve a dwindling supply of PPE Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 Measurements of ultraviolet radiation fluence using a ultraviolet radiation meter and variance.Authors recognize that institutions will require robust quality control processes to guarantee the efficacy of any implemented decontamination protocol. They also recognize that in certain situations such institutional resources may not be available; while we subscribe to the general principle that some degree of decontamination is preferable to re-use without decontamination. Daeschler et al. 2020 To investigate whether thermal disinfection at 70°C for 60 min inactivates pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, while maintaining critical N95 respirator protective properties for multiple cycles of disinfection and re-use in a realworld setting Authors found that one cycle of treatment with all modalities was effective in decontamination and was associated with no structural or functional deterioration. Kumar et al. 2020 (2) In this context, three types of masks, which are being used most of the countries, include N95, nonwoven fabric masks (often called as surgical mask) and self-made two-ply cotton masks are tested for filtering efficiency (before and after sterilisation) with and without gamma sterilisation. Comparison of filtering efficiency of the current work and with the results available in the literature for N95 masks,and testing in accordance with two breath condition (normal and during sneezing) is highlighted. however, the filtration efficiencies stayed within a certain range after 60 minutes of heat treatment rather than a steady rise.Authors evaluates the virucidal activity of hydrogen peroxide vapor using a BQ- 50 Hydrogen peroxide vapor reprocessing may ease shortages and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative to non-NIOSH masks.Demonstrate that an atmosphericpressure plasma generated by the microwave oven can decontaminate the respirator.Tulane virus in artificial saliva and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores.The plasma species generated in this manner are capable of decontamination in 30 seconds and anyone with a microwave oven and a few simple household items can create a N-95 respirator decontamination unit for emergency use. --There is considerable discrepancy to the extent that no single reprocessing method is supported by all the guidance documents. The intervention with most support is vaporised hydrogen peroxide, though one document cautions about chemical residues and another indicates it has only been tested with some of the respirator models in common use. Similarly, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation receives both cautious support and concerns about inadequate decontamination because of incomplete penetration into deeper layers of the filter. Moist heat is cited as promising, though there are concerns when steam is microwave-generated where there may be uneven heating and where the metal nose band may generate sparks.

394c7b2ae9c996a3bf8dc88e58720777acf2b80a,"Robustness analysis in an inter-cities mobility network: modeling municipal, state and federal initiatives as failures and attacks toward SARS-CoV-2 containment","Since early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread to the entire world and became a pandemic in a short time. As of 2 September 2020, the virus has reached more than 180 countries, with more than 26,065,382 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by consists of closing the borders to the flow of people to/from other regions, as performed in Wuhan, China. (Li et al., 2020a) .Our contributions are the robustness analysis of the Brazilian inter-cities mobility network, where random failures abstract local actions from cities or states, and the targeted attacks are the federal's. We assess the impacts of nodes' removal with three metrics: the size of the giant component, the number of components, and the total remaining flow within the network. Strategies based on centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and topological vulnerability guide the targeted attacks. Lastly, we compare both the random failures and the targeted attacks with the reactive strategy. While the nodes' removals through targeted attacks follow the sorted values of the centrality measures, from the higher value to the lower, in the reactive strategy, the removal starts from the first node that notified COVID-19 in its territory, followed by the next, until the last node in a temporal order.The complex network approach is often applied to treat mobility data, taking areas as nodes and movements between origins and destinations as edges. Formally, a network is defined as an undirected graph G(V,E), consisting of the set V of vertices (or nodes) and set E of edges, with the total number of nodes N = |V| and the total number of edges |E|. The edges' weights are represented as the matrix W = {w ij }, for i, j = 1, : : : , N, so that w ij is the weight between edges i and j. The mean value and standard deviation of this matrix are w and σ, respectively.The network flows (weights) (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), 2017) are here aggregated within the round trip, which means that the number of travels from city A to city B is the same as from B to A. We produce three types of undirected networks with a different number N of nodes to capture actions in distinct scales (country and state):1. N = 5,420-Brazil (BR): nodes are cities and edges are the flow of direct travels between them. The dataset encompasses almost all Brazilian cities.2. N = 620-São Paulo state (SP): a subset of the previous network, containing only cities within the São Paulo state, the first Brazilian state with a confirmed case.3. N = 27-Brazilian states (BS): in contrast with the others, in this network, each state is a node, and the edges are the accumulated flows between them.Several networks are analyzed from the three models (BR, SP and BS), with flow thresholds employed in three levels: (i) original data with all recorded flow, (ii) only edges of at least an average flow, and (iii) a more restricted topology with the higher flows. The chosen thresholds are η 0 = 0, h 1 ¼ w and h 2 ¼ w þ r. Edges with flows below these values are discarded. We thus end up with nine networks in total, as described in Table 1 , where N is the size of the network, and |E| is the number of edges/links. The motivation behind the threshold levels is the fact that most centrality measures we investigated do not account for the flows and thus consider all edges with the same importance. Besides, neglecting some small flow connections may help to approximate the network measures to the real spreading dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 (Freitas et al., 2020) .The degree k is the number of cities (or sates) that a city (state) is connected to, showing the number of possible destinations for the SARS-CoV-2. The betweenness centrality b considers the entire network to depict the topological importance of a city in the routes more likely to be used. The vulnerability V accounts for the impact in the network efficiency when a particular city (state) is isolated. Lastly, the strength s captures the total number of people that travel to (or come from) such places in a week. From a probability perspective, the cities that receive more flow of people are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.The topological degree k of a node presents its connectivity: it is the number of edges it has to other nodes. The networks are undirected with no distinction between incoming and outgoing edges. On the other hand, the betweenness centrality captures the importance of a node. Between any pairs of nodes l and m of a connected network, there is at least one shortest path, and the betweenness b i is the rate of such paths that pass through i (Barthélemy, 2004) in which l, m, i ∈ V, g lm is the total number of shortest paths (or geodesic paths) between l and m, and g lm (i) are those that pass through i.The efficiency e ij in the communication between a pair of nodes i and j can be defined as the inverse of the shortest path length between them, and the network efficiency E (Goldshtein, Koganov & Surdutovich, 2004; Wang, Du & Deng, 2017) isthe average of all efficiencies, with i, j ∈ V. The vulnerability index V i (Santos et al., 2019b) , quantifies how vulnerable to the removal of node i a network is: Note:The Brazilian (BR), Sao Paulo state (SP) and Brazilian states (BS) networks, with three flow thresholds: η 0 = 0, η 1 = w and η 2 = w+s, where w is the average flow and s is the standard deviation.in which E Ã i is the average network efficiency after the removal of node i. In brief, the flow of information is considered more efficient in networks with small shortest path lengths.The strength s i of a node is the accumulated flow from incident edges:The robustness of a network is its capacity to keep connected even after the removal of nodes and/or edges (Barabási, 2016) . A breakdown (for example, an energy drop) of some computers in computer networks, or a car accident on an important road, are usually unpredictable events that depend on several internal and/or external causes, thus characterizing a system failure. Conversely, an intentionally removed node to disrupt the network structure typifies an attack (Schneider et al., 2011) . We propose strategies to identify the municipalities (states) that play a key role in mobility. Our motivation is the fact that real networks are robust to random failures but are fragile to attacks (Barabási, 2016; Callaway et al., 2000; Cohen et al., 2000; Iyer et al., 2013) . The main question is to figure out how many and which nodes must be removed until the network collapses. Understanding which cities are important for mobility to know exactly which node to isolate in a disease outbreak is of major interest. We keep track of three measures to quantify the network response to both random failures and targeted attacks when a rate f of nodes are removed: the number of nodes in the giant component P ∞ (f), the total number of components C(f), and the total remaining flow W k kðf Þ ¼ P ij w ij . Within this framework, whether a single node or a small group is isolated from the rest, it is considered a component itself.There are different ways to choose which node to remove. Random failures are the trivial case for which nodes are randomly selected. However, targeted attacks demand some strategy like always removing the nodes with higher degrees. We propose four strategies: deleting nodes with a higher degree (max k), betweenness (max b), vulnerability (max V), and strength (max s). Attacks oriented by higher degrees are effective to reduce the size of the giant component and produce better results than non-local measures in most cases (Iyer et al., 2013) .The BR network (N = 5,420) has a degree distribution that follows a power-law with a coefficient γ = 2.57, which characterizes a scale-free topology. This means that, under random failures, the critical threshold f c = 0.9911, for f c = 1 − (1/(k -1)) with k ¼〈k 2 〉 / 〈k〉 , gives the exact fraction of random 155 node removals that break the network. This structure is strongly robust to failures, that is, almost all nodes must be removed before the giant component takes apart (Barabási, 2016) . On the other hand, such networks are vulnerable to attacks, especially when they target higher degree nodes (hubs).for R ∈ (0,1/2) and C(f) is the network response function after removing a fraction f of its nodes. The higher the R, the more robust the network is according to the function C, which could be either P ∞ or W k k. Note that the normalization factor 1/N allows the comparison of networks of different sizes. For P ∞ , the star-like topology reaches the minimum value R = 1/N, and the complete graph achieves the maximumThe R measure cannot be computed from C(f), since this function does not always decrease like in P ∞ and W k k. The number of components and their number of participants may oscillate instead. Two components with dozens of nodes each or two components with a single node are evaluated alike with C(f), thus not giving a direct notion of connectivity or flow.The simulations of the next section were carried on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4210U CPU 1.70 GHz × 4, with 8 GB Ram, using Python programming language. The respective data and source code are available at https://github.com/vanderfreitas/network_ robustness.The measures related to the BR, BS, and SP networks for each flow threshold are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 1 presents a sketch of the national network with two different flow thresholds.All measures (degree, betweenness, vulnerability and strength) for the BR network under η 0 exhibit the cities of São Paulo and Belo Horizonte within the top-five higher values and most present Campinas and Brasília. Concerning the SP network, the measures rank the cities of São Paulo, Campinas, São José do Rio Preto, and Ribeirão Preto within the top-five values as well. Differently, the BS network does not display a clear pattern for the degrees, but the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais come out in the first positions Fig. 2) . However, the targeted attacks are more effective when it comes to P ∞ (f).We normalized C(f) according to the initial number of components (before removing nodes). There is about 25 times the number of components observed in C(0), when half of the nodes (f = 0.5) are removed under the guidance of the betweenness centrality in the BR network with η 0 (blue curve of Fig. 2A ). The C(0) does not equal 1 (one) necessarily since some cities are either isolated or compose small components that do not have terrestrial flows of people to the rest.The number of components C(f) increases almost linearly under random failures for BR with η 0 (black curve of Fig. 2A ) and only decreases in the end, with f ≈ 0.9. The giant component for the same network is initially well connected and does not break easily, then the number of components remains closely the same. On the other hand, C(f) only decreases for η 1 and η 2 , due to the lower number of links. This results in a maximum number of components that is smaller than in η 0 , since the initial number of clusters is higher in the former cases. The same is observed in Figs. 3 and 4 for SP and BS network, respectively.Attack-wise, the degree is more well-succeeded in decreasing the size of the giant component, and strength performs better regarding the total remaining flow in both BR and SP networks. The degree (yellow curves) indeed decreases the size of the components, because it targets the most connected nodes. The betweenness, on the other hand, generates a larger number of components (blue curves), since it detects the shortest paths between groups of well-connected nodes, which coincide with their bridges. Some methods for community detection -like the Girvan-Newman-systematically remove the edges with higher betweenness (Easley & Kleinberg, 2010) .Although some cities have not reported COVID-19 cases until 2 September 2020, we computed the R related to the reactive strategy, since the number of remaining cities is negligible: 61 for BR (1.1% of its nodes). Note that Eq. (5) takes into account the entire curve of C(f) for f ∈ [1/N,1]. We verified that the remaining nodes of the BR network would impact in fluctuations of a maximum of 10 −2 in R for P ∞ (f), and 10 −3 for W k kðf Þ. The reactive strategy has a low impact on the number of connected cities in the giant component, but has a strong effect in the remaining flow in BR. There is an important feedback mechanism in this case: the emergence of COVID-19 cases is possibly associated with both imported cases and community transmission between cities in the country. Thus, the flow of people is on both sides of this relation.The São Paulo mobility network (SP) produces similar results as the BR, but the topological vulnerability starts to play a more significant role than in BR, being the second-best under η 0 and P ∞ . The differences between failures and attacks are only noticeable for higher thresholds in the network formed by the Brazilian states (BS)-see Fig. 4 . Removing nodes with the attacking strategies does not cause much more impact than picking by chance under η 0 and P ∞ . The results differ for other thresholds when the shortest paths between nodes increase.Notice that some plateaus represent regions where the removal of nodes does not impact on robustness. An example is the interval f ∈ similarly, and sometimes the failures are even more effective (Figs. 4E and 4G) . The strategies follow the same order of efficacy for W k k under all thresholds: strength, degree, vulnerability, and betweenness, with strength being the best and betweenness the worst. The reactive strategy is even better than betweenness for η 0 .Regarding P ∞ , there is an increasing importance of the vulnerability measure from BR to BS. Besides, while the degree is the best measure to guide the attacks for the National and São Paulo networks, it is not for the BS, where vulnerability and betweenness have more importance. Similarly, in BR and SP, for W k k, the strength is the leading measure for attacks, and vulnerability is the worst. Conversely, although strength is also the best for BS, betweenness is the worst.As expected (Barabási, 2016) , random failures do not break the network until almost all nodes are removed, due to its scale-free structure, and all targeted attacks dismantle the networks for small f, except for the reactive strategy. The higher the threshold, the fewer nodes must be removed to break the network structure since the giant component is initially smaller than the observed for η 0 . The R measure shows that the more effective attack strategy for P ∞ is guided by degree, and by strength for W k k for all thresholds. The smaller the R, the more destructive the corresponding attack strategy is. The maximum number of components arises in targeted attacks guided by the betweenness centrality for BR and SP networks. When it comes to the BS network, the same happens for η 0 , but other measures also hit the maximum for other thresholds.The reactive strategy produces an impact similar to that of targeted attacks on decreasing the flow of people, although slightly worse. The number of remaining connected cities is always higher. Therefore, despite reacting to the disease spreading is a valid action, targeted attacks provide better results in terms of the size of the giant component and remaining flow in the system.The cities from the state of São Paulo that have higher values are also cited in recent studies (Freitas et al., 2020; Guimarães et al., 2020) on the most vulnerable cities to COVID-19 due to the intensive traffic of people.Quickly breaking the transmission network is vital to contain any highly contagious disease, which demands the rapid implementation of control measures such as travel restrictions. Cities that preemptively adhered to the measures reported fewer cases than the others, and the virus reached them later (Tian et al., 2020) . The city of Wuhan was the main focus in China, and the complete isolation of the area was essential to mitigate the virus spreading (Li et al., 2020a) . On the other hand, the rest of the world received the SARS-CoV-2 concurrently at different places and had to divide efforts to restrain it.The targeted attacks are especially relevant in areas where people are not sufficiently tested for COVID-19 since the reactive strategy strongly depends on effective epidemic surveillance. Li et al. (2020b) estimate that 86% of infections were undocumented in China before the travel restrictions of 23 January 2020, and the undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases. Underreporting is also present in Brazil, as Hallal et al. (2020) pointed out in a nationwide seroprevalence survey they conducted.The US response to COVID-19 is mostly guided by Governors and Mayors primarily because of their political system. Korea and Taiwan implemented a centralized national strategy with the support of other government instances (Haffajee & Mello, 2020; Kim, Oh & Wang, 2020) . Canada has the Health Portfolio Operations Centre (HPOC), which concentrates the operations at different levels of government. While in UK the response to the crisis was diverse in the different regions, in Switzerland, the communication and agreement between all levels of government was strong from the very beginning, based on mutual learning and integration (Gaskell & Stoker, 2020) . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development OECD (2020) argues that coordinated response across regions and states minimize coordination failures since they avoid the ""pass the buck"" behavior.We assume that the targeted attacks represent the centralization of the efforts to isolate municipalities and states following specific and well-engineered strategies. Such coordination is only possible with a consensus at federal, state, and municipal levels since systematized isolation rely on the adherence of all involved parts. The random failures, on the other hand, abstract independent and decentralized actions. Within this framework, the federal initiatives towards SARS-CoV-2 containment are more effective in breaking the transmission network than leaving the cities (or states) on their own. We have shown that random failures usually take longer to dismantle the networks than choosing the nodes with some criteria.However, both the targeted attacks and the reactive strategy are possibly not feasible in some regions due to the widely divergent kinds of issues they may face (Gaskell & Stoker, 2020) , where the authorities must tailor specific strategies at the local level. The conducted robustness analysis points out the more central cities according to the network metrics and how their isolation impacts in connectivity and the flow of people. We thus present action plans that depend on cooperation and could conceivably rearrange in real-world scenarios.Based on the robustness analysis, the reactive strategy is not effective in reducing the size of the giant component nor breaking the mobility network into disconnected groups when compared to the targeted attacks. Moreover, the federal actions have a substantial impact on the network, while the local ones usually do not break it before almost all cities are isolated. Choosing the cities with higher degrees for the targeted attacks is the best option in most cases, considering the size of the largest component, especially for the two largest networks (N = 5,420 and N = 620 cities). However, there is a transition, showing that the vulnerability index performs nearly the same as the degree for the São Paulo State network, and it is the best choice for the network of the Brazilian states (N = 27 nodes) under most threshold levels. The total flow of the network is affected similarly by both the targeted attacks and the reactive strategy, but the former is more well succeeded when guided by the strength measure. Lastly, the removal of regions ordered by their betweenness centrality generates a higher number of disconnected islands in the mobility network, which ensures the containment of the disease within small isolated groups.",Brazil,first author,2020-11-05,11

Within days, the virus had spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China (The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020). An increasing number of cases were reported in countries around the world in the ensuing weeks (WHO, 2020b) . In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as COVID-19, which stands for ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (WHO, 2020c) . The virus that causes COVID-19 was then named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020). COVID-19 has since been declared a global pandemic (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020) , with 15,301,530 cases worldwide and 625,005 deaths globally. In the Americas, the numbers are also staggering: 11,667,196 confirmed cases with 419,995 deaths (as of August 17th, 2020) (PAHO, 2020) .The initial stage involves an incubation period when SARS-CoV-2 multiplies and establishes itself mainly in the respiratory system. During the second stage, localized inflammation can occur in the lungs. The third (and most severe) stage of the disease can cause the syndrome of extrapulmonary systemic hyperinflammation (Siddiqi and Mehra, 2020) .RT-PCR is a test for diagnosing COVID-19, based on nasopharyngeal swab samples or other upper respiratory tract samples (Wang et al., 2020b) . In symptomatic individuals, viral RNA can be detectable early on day one of symptoms and culminate within the first week of symptom onset. By week three, positivity of the test for detecting viral RNA starts to decline (Sethuraman et al., 2020) . A downside of this sample collection approach involves falsenegative results, largely due to inappropriate timing of sample collection relative to illness onset and poor sampling technique, especially for nasopharyngeal swabs. Given that the design for the RT-PCR test is based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, its specificity is almost 100%, with few false-positive results (Sethuraman et al., 2020) .Another diagnostic tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is serological testing which evaluates the host immune response (Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020) . It is essential for patients with mild to moderate illness who may present two weeks after illness onset. Serological diagnosis is also becoming an important tool to help understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community (Sethuraman et al., 2020) .Antibodies start to increase from the second week of symptom onset, constituting the earliest and most sensitive serological marker, with IgM and IgG levels peaking in the second and third weeks of illness. Subsequently, IgM decreases by week 5, while IgG remains high beyond 7 weeks (Sethuraman et al., 2020) .These findings together with the plethora of available testing methodologies (CDC, 2020b; Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020) , evolving knowledge on the behavior of the virus, and the complexity of the human immune response, have led to the need for guidance on how to use and appropriately interpret results of the available tests.As the pandemic progresses, it has become clear that the primary transmission pathway is through respiratory aerosols (Bahl et al., 2020) as well as through direct contact of eyes, nose, or mouth with contaminated surfaces (Ong et al., 2020) . The virus has also been detected in nonrespiratory samples such as stools, urine, blood, ocular secretions, and semen (Wang et al., 2020b) . The risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person to another appears to vary and depends on the type and duration of exposure, use of preventive measures, and other individual factors (Rosenberg et al., 2020) .Latin America is a large and heterogeneous territory, including well-developed and poor areas with limited resources, in which the pandemic rapidly spreads. The aim of this paper is to provide Latin American clinicians with guidance on the use of RT-PCR and serological high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests.Five recognized experts in Latin America joined an online expert panel and worked collaboratively on an online application (Within3 1 ) from June 12th to 24th, 2020, supported by Roche Diagnostics. Panel members had either clinical or scientific experience in infectious disease or immunology and serological tests. Adopting standard guideline development processes (Linstone and Turoff, 2015), a literature review was performed on serological diagnosis and panelists shared the articles on COVID-19 listed in Chart 1 .Chart 1. Articles selected by panelists for discussion during expert pane.C.E. Ferreira, P.E. Bonvehi, J.C.G. de la Torre et al.International Journal of Infectious Diseases 103 (2021) 260-267The search was performed on Medline only, from January 2020 until the start date of the expert panel in June 2020.All MESH Terms related to ""COVID19"" and ""COVID19 testing"" were used as main descriptor terms by using the Boolean connector ""OR"" to include all their supplementary concept terms; plus ""AND"" to connect both. These are shown in Chart 2 .The purpose of the expert panel was to develop a test algorithm for the three situations proposed in the paper, not including antigen or antibody rapid testing, and no search for rapid testing was conducted.On the basis of the papers retrieved, an infectious disease specialist prepared nine questions (Chart 3 ) and drafts of algorithms testing for SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the use of RT-PCR and serology testing in different settings. Panelists had the opportunity to suggest modifications to these algorithms and were required to propose evidence-based best practices for the RT-PCR and serological diagnosis of COVID-19.These preliminary efforts served as the basis for discussion and to establish the guidelines. The panelists had the opportunity to make further reviews and remarks using the online platform in reaching the consensus for the guidelines presented.Algorithms emerged in a consensus of the panelists on serologic testing for COVID-19 in Latin America in three different settings:1. Asymptomatic individual exposed to Sars-CoV-2 infected patients -Algorithm 1.For asymptomatic individuals who had contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 (Algorithm 1), RT-PCR should be performed preferably after 5 days of contact, while a serology test can be performed to detect mature antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG), ideally 21 days after contact.Accordingly, because of the lower sensitivity of antibody tests in detecting infection during earlier phases , the panelists proposed adoption of a minimum cut-off period after potential infectious contact for performing serological evaluation of asymptomatic individuals (Figure 1 ) (Dramé et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) .2. Epidemiological purposes -Algorithm 2.Serological testing also has utility for epidemiological purposes such as virus exposure screening, especially of high-risk populations (police and military personnel, food market suppliers, traffic agents, medical personnel), planning public health strategies and actions for seronegative asymptomatic populations, and planning vaccine distribution through population sampling. In these situations, the use of mature antibodies serological tests can help understand those who are sensitized to SARS-CoV-2. For those, PCR testing should be considered in the case of a new set of symptoms. In such cases, social distancing and other precautionary measures according to local health authority decisions should be taken. For nonsensitized individuals, performing daily activities using personal protection equipment (PPE) should be considered as well as regular retesting with PCR and serological tests (Figure 2 ).3. Symptomatic individuals -Algorithm 3.For symptomatic individuals, the gold standard is the RT-PCR test performed predominantly on nasopharynx and/or oropharyngeal swab samples. If patients present with a negative PCR test, retesting for PCR (same and/or other body site) should be considered, as well as performing a respiratory virus panel. In all symptomatic people, a serology test to measure high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) could be performed at least 14 days after PCR test or 21 days after symptom onset (Figure 3) .The rationale for this timeframe relies on a study that reported the proportion of patients with positive virus-specific IgG reached 100% approximately 17 to 19 days after the onset of symptoms (Long et al., 2020) .Some clinical conditions were not discussed in this expert panel, such as patients with or without symptoms that have longterm SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swabs, developing weak or no clinical signs, and undetectable antibodies in serum 15-20 days after manifesting clinical symptoms, and the rare clinical condition of patients suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.A decrease in IgG antibodies in patients with SARS-CoV-2 has been documented. A recent study showed a drop of 26.5% in detectable IgG antibodies over 3 months by using lateral flow assay. In the population aged 75+ years, the drop was 39%. These data suggest that the possibility of decreasing population immunity over time could increase the risk of reinfection (Ward et al., 2020) . Currently the importance of antibody decline for reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 is not yet answered and further longitudinal studies are needed. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies will also support the clarification of this issue.Lastly, the participants explained the rationale for their recommendations until a final consensus was reached (Figure 4 ).RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, based on samples obtained preferably from the upper nasopharynx (Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020) remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of the acute phase of COVID-19 (Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020; Wang et al., 2020b) . However, there are some drawbacks of this technique, namely its variability in accuracy depending on the specimen (Wang et al., 2020a) , hazards in collecting samples (Shen et al., 2020) , and sensitivity concerns (Hase et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020) . For instance, negative tests in patients with SARS-CoV-2 lower respiratory tract infection and minimum upper respiratory symptoms are not uncommon (Hase et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a) . Given the limitations of the RT-PCR, in the context of urgent need for accurate detection of infected subjects and their subsequent isolation as a pivotal step for effective prevention of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Guan et al., 2020) , serological testing plays an essential role in differential diagnostic and epidemiological settings (CDC, 2020b; Lou et al., 2020; Yong et al., 2020) .Nevertheless, relying solely on IgM serological detection for the diagnosis of acute disease is not a suitable strategy, particularly for the early acute phase. In one study (Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020) , all 39 patients had both IgM and IgG after 5-7 days of symptom onset. In another Chinese study of 285 patients, three seroconversion patterns were observed: synchronous seroconversion of both IgM and IgG, IgM seroconversion earlier than IgG (expected pattern), and IgM seroconversion after IgG. The proportion of patients with virus-specific IgM peaked at 94.1% in approximately 20-22 days, whereas for IgG, 100% reached a peak 17-19 days after symptom onset (Long et al., 2020) . However, antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood (Callow et al., 1990) , and the neutralizing activities of detected IgG antibodies have yet to be determined (Lou et al., 2020) . According to the North American Centers for Disease Control (CDC-USA), the results of serological tests should not be used as a single diagnostic test for an acute infection, excluding, or diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections (CDC, 2020b). Moreover, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends use of serological tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by health professionals, as this may help identify individuals exposed to or who have recovered from COVID-19 infection (CDC, 2020a). In Latin America, the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommends the use of laboratory tests, RT-PCR until the eighth day of symptom onset and immunological, which detects the presence of antibodies in samples collected from the eighth day of symptom onset in patients presenting with a flu-like syndrome or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Brasil, 2020) . Despite the increased knowledge on the utility of serological tests, a recent survey by the Royal College of Physicians highlighted misinterpretation issues, where 40% of respondents considered patients to have ""cleared COVID-19"" in cases with active symptoms and IgM-IgG + serologies (Bermingham et al., 2020) .Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 high-specificity antibodies can also be used as an additional diagnostic tool for suspected false-negative RT-PCR results (Perkmann et al., 2020) or for individual determination of antibody levels to trace who has been infected in the past (Perkmann et al., 2020; Yong et al., 2020) . In some situations, the use of serological testing may also be applied to determine the immunity status of asymptomatic subjects with an epidemiological history of a high risk of exposure to people with COVID-19 (Lou et al., 2020) . In such settings, serologic testing at appropriate intervals following contact with infected subjects might result in relatively fewer false-positive results (Liu et al., 2020b) .Serological testing also plays a pivotal role in population-based seroepidemiological studies. It provides essential data about SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and allows interventions to reduce transmission of the disease. Moreover, this testing can be used to assess seroprevalence overall or in specific groups, thereby helping to estimate core characteristics of the pandemic and to plan intervention measures such as vaccination of populations (Altmann et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Yong et al., 2020) .The World Health Organization (WHO) states that seroepidemiological investigation can help understand and provide robust estimates of clinical, epidemiological, and virological characteristics of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020a) .In Latin America, given the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a serological test can be used to determine the level of exposure and identify people who may be sensitized. The latter tests should ideally provide high specificity, with a small confidence interval, detection of high-affinity antibodies and no cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses (Lau et al., 2020; Muench et al., 2020) . Finally, the CDC Interim Guidelines for COVID-19 Antibody Testing (CDC, 2020b) recommend the use of serological assays in some other scenarios: (a) as a method to support the diagnosis of acute COVID-19 illness for persons who present late onset, for whom serologic testing is offered in addition to RT-PCR; (b) as a method to support establishing a diagnosis when patients present with late complications of COVID-19 illness; and (c) as a method to reduce false-positive results in high prevalence settings.Although based on well-established consensus formation techniques and drawing on panelist's expertise, these recommendations do not constitute a statement from the institutions or associations to which these professionals are affiliated. The main limitations of this expert panel consensus are selection bias, observer bias, confirmation bias, publication bias, and cohort effects (different features and pace of the COVID-19 pandemic in each country of Latin America).This expert panel consensus can help clinicians to apply testing for SARS-CoV-2 on an individual level. Moreover, the guidance can also support decision-making stakeholders when acting on public health measures such as seroprevalence studies and business reopening. Lastly, the consensus can support payers from both private and public settings with a more straightforward tool for evaluating the use of a specific test (or sequence of tests).In conclusion, serological testing and studies are of great importance for public health strategies, such as population screening, and will prove pivotal to support planning of vaccination strategies. Serological status for high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) should be determined 21 days after potential infectious contact to allow appropriate time for sensitization to SARS-CoV-2 following exposure.Antonio Condino-Neto: no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

6ccd5b3a2878a0afb63102b0c6ffd7eb3973ccf5,,"El 30 de enero de 2020, el Director General de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declaró el brote de enfermedad por coronavirus (COVID-19), notificado por primera vez en Wuhan (China) el 31 de diciembre de 2019, como una emergencia de salud pública internacional (1) . La COVID-19 es la infección viral causada por el SARS-CoV-2 que, para septiembre del 2020, ya había contagiado a más de 25 millones de personas en el mundo y causado la muerte de más de 840.000 (2) . El 28 de septiembre de 2020 los casos confirmados en Colombia alcanzaron los 818.203 y las muertes ya eran 25.641 (3) . En estos momentos, el diagnóstico de la enfermedad es principalmente clínico y se confirma mediante una prueba de reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR).Las unidades de imágenes diagnósticas y medicina nuclear no han sido ajenas a la enfermedad. Como ha sucedido con el resto de especialidades, los pacientes han continuado asistiendo a practicarse los exámenes diagnósticos y los procedimientos terapéuticos que requieren (4), lo cual implica la posibilidad de registrar hallazgos incidentales en las imágenes de medicina nuclear, como la tomografía PET/CT F18-FDG ( Se ha reportado una prevalencia de hallazgos incidentales de casos sospechosos de COVID-19 de hasta el 16,25 % en este tipo de exploraciones (5) , los cuales incluyen opacidades pulmonares con patrón de vidrio esmerilado, engrosamiento de los tabiques interlobulillares e intralobulillares, opacidades alveolares (consolidaciones), engrosamientos broncovasculares y bronquiectasias por tracción. Es común el compromiso bilateral y multilobar, sobre todo en las zonas inferiores. Estas alteraciones se acompañan de un incremento metabólico del trazador, con rangos en el Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmáx) de 3,7 a 12 (6) . Asimismo, se debe tener en cuenta que los pacientes con cáncer tienen un mayor riesgo de infección por COVID-19. Cerca del 40 % de los pacientes con cáncer y COVID-19 han debido ser hospitalizados, el 20 % desarrolló la enfermedad respiratoria grave y el 12 % murió en el curso de los 30 días posteriores al diagnóstico (7) .Además, este tipo de pacientes evolucionan, al parecer, con peor pronóstico porque deben asistir a más citas médicas en diferentes centros hospitalarios para las quimioterapias, los procedimientos médicos y quirúrgicos, y los frecuentes estudios diagnósticos en servicios de medicina nuclear, radiología y PET/CT. Suelen llegar asintomáticos y, por ello, los médicos especialistas en medicina nuclear y los radiólogos deben estar atentos a dichas eventualidades.Se presentan aquí imágenes de PET/CT F18-FDG con hallazgos incidentales de COVID-19 de pacientes con diferentes condiciones oncológicas, pero sin sintomatología respiratoria. Los pacientes ingresaron al servicio de medicina nuclear y PET/CT de dos instituciones de salud de Bogotá y, debido a los hallazgos de las imágenes, se remitieron para la prueba de PCR, la cual fue positiva.Hombre de 60 años, asintomático respiratorio, con antecedentes de linfoma B difuso de células grandes, remitido para PET/CT F18-FDG de estadificación inicial (figura 1).

c228eb1fdae47c0454bf452d110d2fd32694804f,The risk of induced cancer and ischemic heart disease following low dose lung irradiation for COVID-19: estimation based on a virtual case,"Coronavirus disease 2019 , which is now a pandemic, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Some symptomatic patients with COVID À19 have pneumonia, which may progress to a lifethreatening clinical condition (Zhou et al. 2020) .Pneumonia is an inflammatory immune response to infection. The pulmonary alveoli become inflamed, secreted fluid increases, and this compromises pulmonary function (Chen and Li 2020) . In COVID-19, the immune cells are stimulated by the viruses to synthesize cytokines and chemokines, producing an immune response. This leads to pneumonia (Chen and Li 2020) . There are currently limited clinical options for treating COVID-19 patients with pneumonia (Cascella et al. 2020) . Therefore, some authors have suggested that radiotherapy (RT), with a total dose to the whole thorax ranging between 0.35 and 1.5 Gy, could be effective in reducing the inflammatory response. Moreover, a moderate dose will at the same time not appreciably increase the risk of radiation-induced cancer (RIC) for the patients being treated (R€ odel et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2014; Dhawan et al. 2020; Kirkby and Mackenzie 2020; Kirsch et al. 2020; .Although there is a biological plausibility to the use of low dose RT to restrict the immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is scarce and of low quality (Kirsch et al. 2020; ). There are currently fifteen prospective studies being carried out to assess the role of low dose RT in COVID-19 patients. The first results of two trials have just been published and have shown promising results (Ameri et al. 2020; Hess et al. 2020 ). However, a careful interpretation is required as they are based on very small participant numbers (n ¼ 5, n ¼ 5), are non-randomized, and have no control groups. It is also clear that many patients additionally received other drug treatments such as remdesivir and dexamethasone, which could as well account for the clinical improvement observed. Kirsch et al. presented a letter indicating that the potential risks of such trials outweigh their potential benefits (Kirsch et al. 2020) .In this scenario, we designed a study using data collected from a simulated patient who received whole lung irradiation to treat COVID-19 pneumonia by conformal RT (3DRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques with a dose ranging between 0.5 and 1.5 Gy. The lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of developing RIC and the risk of exposure-induced death (REID) by cardiovascular disease were evaluated.Whole lung treatment was simulated in a median female body (20 cm of anterior-posterior distance and 30 cm of lateral-lateral distance) at the treatment planning system. A 3DRT plan with two parallel opposed fields in the anteriorposterior directions and an IMRT plan with seven fields were prepared. A dose of 1 Gy was initially planned for the PTV, and 95% of the planned dose covered 90% and 95% of the target volume for the 3DRT and IMRT techniques, respectively ( Figure 1 ). The breast, liver, heart, and esophagus doses were evaluated and used to simulate the risks of the exposures.All the RIC estimates after RT treatment were based on LAR values provided by the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VII report (Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation -National Research Council 2006) . The relationship between LAR and age at exposure was studied since it can help in developing clinical protocols for patient selection. Cardiovascular risks of ischemic heart disease (IHD) due to radiation exposition were also estimated based on REID, following the systematic review and meta-analysis performed by Little et al. (2012) . These estimations were performed for whole lung RT treatments using 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.5 Gy, by only changing the simulated planned dose, without any other alteration in the plans. We considered a LAR and REID <1% as acceptable, 1-2% cautionary (i.e. used if necessary), and >2% unacceptable.Simulation of whole lung treatment with 1 Gy resulted in the following mean doses for the lung, liver, esophagus, heart, and breast: 1.0 Gy, 0.413 Gy, 0.869 Gy, 1.0 Gy, and 0.465 Gy for 3DRT, and 1.0 Gy, 0.280 Gy, 0.780 Gy, 0.624 Gy, and 0.356 Gy for IMRT, respectively.The LAR results for men and women were evaluated as a function of the age at exposure (Figure 2 (a,b)). For both sexes, the exposure of young persons may lead to a higher incidence of cancer, and the highest risk of cancer incidence was for lung cancer. Irradiation of the lung with doses ranging between 0.5 Gy and 1.5 Gy presents an absolute LAR below 5200 cases/100,000 for women and 2250 cases/100,000 for men. For women, the breast presents the second-highest LAR, especially for exposures of young women. The liver and esophagus presented LARs below 700/100,000 for both sexes, with a higher incidence of esophageal RIC for women and liver RIC for men. These values were also stratified in groups related to age at exposure (Figure 2 (c,d)) and evaluated in a percentage form (Table 1) . Regarding the LAR cutoff, we observed an unacceptable and cautionary LAR for lung cancer in all women and men between 20-60 years of age, with RT dose >1 Gy (Table 1) . LAR for lung cancer with an RT dose of 1 Gy was cautionary for women aged >60 years and men aged <40 years. No LAR estimation was unacceptable for the RT dose below <0.7 Gy in all groups irrespective of sex or age at exposure (Table 1 ). The REID for 1.5, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.5 Gy was 2.5% (CI95% 1.1-3.9%), 1.6% (CI95% 0.7-2.6%), 1.1% (CI95% 0.5-1.8%), and 0.8% (CI95% 0.3-1.3%), Table 1 .Our main objective was to estimate the risks involved in using low dose RT for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, based on a virtual lung irradiation simulation.The interest in using lung irradiation to treat pneumonia came between 1905 and 1946. Historical reports of patients with severe pneumonia (bacterial or viral) treated with low doses of kilovoltage X-rays showed a good clinical response. Similar results are being reported in published clinical trial results using low dose RT to treat COVID-19 patients (Ameri et al. 2020; Hess et al. 2020) . However, these studies are limited, present a low-level of evidence, involve a small sample of patients, and have no appropriate control group. The reanalysis of historical radiobiological data also does not provide support for reductions in morbidity or mortality associated with post-infection radiation exposure (Little et al. 2020) . Therefore, the possible potential harm and the extent to which benefits may exceed risks from low-dose lung irradiation remains unclear (Kirsch et al. 2020; Little et al. 2020; ). This caution may be kept in mind when evaluating the present results.Currently, we have fifteen clinical trials registered, and are recruiting patients around the world, including patients of different ages and disease severities, as well as using different radiation doses (Table 2 ). In these trials, a single lung dose ranges between 0.35 and 1.5 Gy, and patients from 18 to 65 years of age are included. Age is a critical component of these trials' inclusion criteria since the RIC directly relates to the age of the patient at radiation exposure. Regarding this point, for seven (50%) of the trials, the age cutoff for one to be enrolled in the study was higher than 18 years. Thus, our study evaluates the risks of the treatment for the involved organs, stratifying the lung radiation treatment doses and the age at exposure per sex (Table 1) . Lung irradiation with doses !1 Gy crossed the unacceptable limit for lung RIC estimation for populations of ages lower than 40 years, especially females. These outcomes call for attention once several trials are enrolling younger patients to be submitted to a dose of 1 Gy or 1.5 Gy. Considering the dose of 1.5 Gy, the LAR in females crossed the unacceptable limit for all ages, reaching 4.09% for ages between 20 and 40 years (Table 1) . Using our criteria, the RIC would be acceptable for patients aged >40 years, delivering a radiation dose of 0.7 Gy for both sexes, and would still be better if the studies enrolled elderly patients of >60 years of age, irrespective of the sex. Regarding the cardiac risks, the REID analyses for whole-lung irradiation with 1.5 Gy, 0.7-1.0 Gy, and 0.5 Gy resulted respectively in an excessive, a cautionary (i.e. used if necessary), and an acceptable risk irrespective of age.The lung was observed as the primary organ at risk for RIC after the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with RT, with a higher incidence in women than men. This sex difference can be explained by the difference in background cancer incidences between the sexes. The background male incidence is almost three times higher than that for females. This is due to the higher prevalence of smoking in men than in women since cigarette smoking is the most important cause of lung cancer. Its effects, combined with radiation exposure, lead to higher rates of lung cancer incidence (Furukawa et al. 2010) .Our work significantly differs from the paper recently published by Kirsch et al. (Kirsch et al. 2020) . We used data from a simulated patient, and we collected the dose received by the involved organs to run the estimations. From our analysis, it is possible to observe that even for organs with a relatively low LAR (Table 1) , the absolute risk is high (Figure 2(a,b) ). For example, the mean LAR for the lungs of females aged 20-40 years using 1 Gy was 2.73%, but the absolute number of the new attributable cases reached almost 3500/100,000 for exposures at the age of 20. The absolute number is an essential component from a public Ã LAR values extracted from BEIR VII document and considering a dose and dose rate effective factor (DDREF) of 1.5 Gy.ÃÃ REID values extracted from Little et al. (2012) from the IHD disease data and correspond to a mean value of several countries, independent of sex and of the age at exposure. Cardiovascular risks estimated by the mean percentage REID without stratification by age and sex. All values are followed by a parenthesis with the 95% confidence interval value found in the group. health/epidemiological perspective when deciding on an intervention like radiation to treat a massive number of patients in the COVID-19 pandemic. In countries like Brazil, or the USA, with more than five million cases, estimating that 10% receive lung radiation with a dose of 1 Gy, by our data, about 17,500 new lung cancer cases due to the intervention would be expected in the next few years. Due to these outcomes, we also evaluated if the treatment technique would reduce the risks of radiation exposure. Comparing the 3DRT to the IMRT technique, the impact of both on the LAR of RIC was insignificant. For the cardiac risks, IMRT can reduce the heart doses and consequently reduce the involved cardiac risks. However, IMRT is an expensive and more time-consuming technique; it needs more treatment fields, making the patients' time in the machine longer.It is essential to highlight that our study has limitations inherent to the risk estimates. The LAR for RIC estimates were extracted from table 12D-1 of the BEIR VII report published in 2006. The main reason for using it was the straightforward availability of parameters for specific organs, sex, and age at exposure, which is directly related and aligned with the inclusion criteria of the trials investigating the role of radiation in treating COVID-19 patients. LAR estimates include high uncertainties due to estimate variability from the life span study (LSS) data, the risk transportation from the Japanese atomic bomb survivor to other populations, and the appropriate dose and dose rate effectiveness factor. LAR is a linear approximation of the radiation exposure induced cancer (REIC) or REID. Its estimates are approximately the same for doses smaller than 0.4 Gy, but as the dose increases, the LAR estimates become higher than the REIC/REID ones, reaching þ2% at 1 Gy . Therefore, the presented LAR estimates for doses up to 1 Gy may be within this difference from the REIC estimates, but a higher difference may occur for the 1.5 Gy estimates. However, all data were extracted from a simulated case using strict criteria for admission, provided the lung irradiation is safe for COVID-19 patients.By evaluating the lung irradiation with the doses used in the ongoing clinical trials to treat COVID À19 patients, our data shows that a radiation dose 0.5 Gy provides an acceptable RIC risk estimate (LAR 1%), irrespective of sex and age at exposure, while also maintaining the cardiac risks at acceptable levels. It is important to note that even with favorable initial clinical outcomes from lung RT, it is still unknown if the benefit is derived directly from the intervention or from the combination with other treatments. Therefore, due to the potential shorter latency period in elderly patients and the high risk of pneumonia induced with doses >1 Gy, trials should initially test doses 0.5 Gy to maintain an acceptable threshold of the RIC/REID risks. Only patients who fail or do not have any other clinical treatments for SARS-CoV-2 should be included in the trials.No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Gustavo Viani, Ph.D., is a professor at the Medical School of Ribeirao Preto -University of Sao Paulo.

It was first reported in December 2019 after an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was identified in Wuhan, China [1, 2] . Currently, the virus continues to spread to different regions of the world, including several countries in Europe and the United States, which reported the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in March and April [2] . disagreements about the articles were discussed by the research team to make a consensus decision. The data extracted from the studies were as follows: (1) Signs and symptoms of the mother and fetus, (2) gestational age and pregnancy results (maternal or fetal death), (3) type of delivery (natural, emergency or elective cesarean section, abortion, or complications), and (4) possibility of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) [16, 17] . The quality of the evidence from the studies was classified into four categories: High, moderate, low, or very low [16, 17] .A flow diagram based on the PRISMA guideline was created to represent the different stages of article selection (Figure 1 ).From the 1720 studies retrieved, 1708 were identified in Embase and PubMed while 12 were taken from other sources. After exclusion of duplicate studies, a total of 1035 titles and abstracts were collected. Among these, 218 manuscripts were retrieved for full reading by the three authors (C.R.M., C.L.M., and J.T.A.) independently. A total of 70 studies met the inclusion criteria [5, 7, 9, . The main findings of the selected studies are shown in Table 1 . First and third trimesters (≥27 weeks gestational age) ( The distribution of studies in terms of quality of evidence based on GRADE are as follows: High quality (n = 1) [41] , moderate quality (n = 11) [9, 21, 22, 33, [48] [49] [50] 52, 55, 63, 68] , low quality (n = 26) [5, 9, [23] [24] [25] [26] 28, 29, 36, 40, 43, 46, 47, 51, 54, 56, [60] [61] [62] [64] [65] [66] [67] 69, 70, 73] , and very low quality (n = 32) [7, 18, 20, 27, [30] [31] [32] 34, 35, [37] [38] [39] 42, 44, 45, 53, [57] [58] [59] 66, 71, 72, 74, 75, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [83] [84] [85] . The studies that were classified as ""low-quality"" and ""very low-quality"" are case reports or small series of cases which also characterizes a high risk of bias.Of the 70 studies included, 34 were carried out in China [5, 9, [25] [26] [27] [28] [30] [31] [32] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] 53, 54, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] 73, 78] , 10 in the United States [21] [22] [23] 37, 48, 49, 52, 75, 79, 85] , eight in Italy [24, 33, 51, 55, [81] [82] [83] [84] , three in Iran [36, 39, 76] , one in Korea [7] , one in Turkey [38] , one in Peru [18] , one in Switzerland [20] , two in France [56, 74] , three in Spain [50, 77, 80] , one in Australia [71] , one in Spain [72] , one in the Netherlands and Ireland [34] , one in Canada [40] , one in the United Kingdom [41] , and one in Sweden [35] .A total of 1457 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 and 1042 newborns from infected mothers were included. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR or PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples [9] .Among infected pregnant women, 116 (7.9%) were asymptomatic at the beginning of medical care. Of the symptomatic pregnant women, the most frequent symptoms were fever (>37.3 • C) (n = 695, 47.7%), cough (n = 647, 44.4%), and nausea (n = 148, 10.2%). Less common symptoms included dyspnea (n = 87, 6.5%), fatigue (n = 58, 4.3%), myalgia (n = 42, 2.9%), and diarrhea (n = 14, 0.9%). In the immediate postpartum period, the most frequent symptom was fever (37.8-39.33 • C).Twenty-one (1.4%) of the pregnant women were in the first trimester, 97 (6.6%) in the second trimester, and 1339 (91.9%) in the third trimester of pregnancy.In terms of the type of delivery, 597 (57.3%) underwent elective cesarean section, 36 (3.4%) received emergency cesarean sections, and 364 (34.9%) went through spontaneous vaginal delivery.The most reported maternal comorbidities were obesity (n = 191, 13.1%), hypertensive disorders (n = 117, 8.0%), diabetes (n = 49, 3.3%), asthma (n = 44, 3.0%), and preeclampsia (n = 15, 1.0%). Pregnancy complications included gestational diabetes (n = 91, 6.2%) and gestational hypertension (n = 12, 0.8%). Comorbidities and complications in pregnant women with COVID-19 are described in Table 2 .Among pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19, 68 (4.6%) were admitted in intensive care units (ICU) [21] [22] [23] 33, 36, 55, 56, 67, 85] . There were 15 (1.0%) cases of maternal death [21, 36, 39, 41] , mostly from United Kingdom (n = 5) [41] and Iran (n = 7) [36] . Hantoushzadeh et al. [36] reported that pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the second or third trimester of pregnancy can suffer cardiopulmonary complications and die.

There were 16 (1.5%) total cases of neonatal death and fetal intrauterine death [20, 36, 39, 41, 42, 48, 49, 63, 70] . Karami et al. reported a case of an infected pregnant woman who vaginally delivered a cyanotic fetus in the third trimester [39] . In the study by Zhu et al. [67] , a newborn delivered at 34 + 5 weeks of gestation from a 30-year-old mother with COVID-19 experienced refractory shock, gastric bleeding, multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. There were four total cases of fetal demise: One at 17 weeks [49] and three at the third trimester of pregnancy [42, 48, 63] . Lookken et al. [48] reported one case of stillbirth at 38.7 weeks in which the qualitative PCR tests of placental and fetal tissue were negative for SARS-CoV-2 and cytomegalovirus. However, the delay between fetal death and sample extraction for PCR analysis may have led to inaccurate results.In the study by Li et al. [42] , biochemical examination of umbilical cord blood at birth revealed a marked increase in myocardial enzymes, suggesting severe damage of the fetal myocardium. Considering severe hypoxia, the possibility of immunologic damage cannot be ruled out. This may have led to difficulties in resuscitation and eventually neonatal death. Maternal hypoxia and unstable circulation secondary to COVID-19 can endanger the fetus and cause intrauterine fetal death [42] .Among the seven total cases (0.7 %) of miscarriage [20, 24, 41, 56] , the distribution by type are as follows: Spontaneous miscarriage (n = 1) [24] , threatened miscarriage (n = 1) [29] , medical miscarriage (n = 4) [54] , and induced miscarriage (n = 1) [29] .Among various studies, there were 64 (6.1%) cases of premature birth [25, 36, 54, 61, 63, 64, 69, 70, 73, [75] [76] [77] 82, 85] , 10 (0.9%) patients with complications in pregnancy [73] , and 28 (2.7%) cases of intrauterine fetal distress [25, 47, 48, 53, 60, 63, [68] [69] [70] 73, 84] .Decreased fetal movements were reported for 19 (1.8%) fetuses [21, 30, [36] [37] [38] 49, 57, 58, 68, 69] . There were five (0.5%) cases of severe neonatal asphyxia [63, 64, 69] and four (0.3%) cases of low birth weight (<2500 g) in the third pregnancy trimester [25, 63] . Abnormal fetal heart monitoring [29] , fetal tachycardia [28, 34] , and placental detachment [48] were also reported. Other outcomes include premature rupture of membranes (n = 26, 2.5%) [36, 50, 62, 69, 86] , abnormal amniotic fluid (n = 3, 0.3%) [69, 70] , and abnormal umbilical cord in the third pregnancy trimester (n = 6, 0.6%) [64, 70] .Of the 70 studies analyzed, 21 studies included a total of 39 (3.7%) newborns who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [18, 24, 33, 36, 40, 41, 50, 51, 55, 58, 66, 68, [74] [75] [76] 82, 83] . In only five studies (23.8%), newborns were tested within the first 12 h of birth [33, 41, 50, 74, 76] . Two studies have presented neonates with symptoms; however, tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative [32, 35] . SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 13 placenta samples [20, 51, 52, 74, 79, [81] [82] [83] 85] and six breast milk samples of infected pregnant women [61, 82, 84] . There was also a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in umbilical cord and vagina samples [82] (Table 3 ). In addition, one newborn received an inconclusive result but was otherwise asymptomatic [22] . Twelve newborns presented IgG positive in umbilical cord plasma [82] and two neonates born to a mother with COVID-19 had elevated antibody levels (IgM) 2 h after birth [31, 82] . [70] , fifth day (n = 1) [69] , seventh and ninth days (n = 1) [70] , and fourth to fourteenth days (n = 1) [46] .In addition to oropharyngeal swabs, other samples for testing included placental tissue [7, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 38, 44, 47, 53, 58, 59, 62, 78] , fetal membrane [27] , umbilical cord blood [5, 7, 20, 29, 32, 38, 44, 45, 53, 58, 59, 65, 78] , breast milk [25, 29, 31, 32, 35, 38, 44, 45, 47, 53, 57, 58, 80] , amniotic fluid [7, 20, 25, 29, 44, 45, 53, 59, 62, 65, 78] , serum [32, 53] , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [53] , vaginal secretions [20, 31, 32, 53] , axillary swab [20] , mouth swab [20] , neonatal gastric fluid [78] , meconium [20] , urine [44, 45, 53] , rectal swab samples [24, 56] , feces [44, 45, 57] , and anal swab [53, 61, 78] . In addition to RT-PCR, other tests such as IgM and IgG antibody [31, 64] , cytokine [31] , and blood biochemistry tests [31] were also used. The results of all the various tests using a myriad of samples were negative.In one study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in vaginal discharge and amniotic fluid in four pregnant women with mild acute symptoms of COVID-19 who underwent amniocentesis during the second trimester of pregnancy [72] . In addition, in another study, a case of vaginal delivery without complications was described in a mother with COVID-19 [47] . The test for neonatal COVID-19 24 h after delivery was still negative despite the fact that the infant was breastfed and not separated from the mother [71] . RT-PCR Placental swabs (both maternal and fetal sides) were obtained Placental tissue was sent for PCR and histopathologic examination Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the neonate on the day of birth, day 2, and day 7, after thorough cleansing of the baby and before contact with the mother Cesarean section (n = 1) All 3 of the neonate's nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 gene targets via RT-PCR testing; neonatal plasma tested positive on day 4, and stool was positive on day 7 (1) The newborn had positive NP swabs immediately at birth, after 24 h, and after 7 days; he remained asymptomatic (2) Neonatal NP swab was 60 negative at birth and turned positive on day 7, with no contact between mother and neonate during that period Histological, immunohistochemical, in situ SARS-CoV-2 RNA, RNA in situ hybridization and electron microscopy This systematic review gathered evidence available on pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2 infection from the international literature to investigate signs and symptoms, type of delivery, comorbidities, clinical outcomes (maternal and neonatal), and vertical transmission risk of COVID-19. This study included a significant number of newborns and pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. Although most studies which were included were case reports or case series that have low levels of evidence quality, these are still important in the current context due to the need for information to support public health policies.In terms of signs and symptoms of COVID-19, fever above 37.0 • C was the most frequent symptom reported by pregnant women, followed by cough and nausea in the prenatal period. In the postpartum period, subjects were reported to experience fever (37.8-39.33 • C) and a general worsening of the condition, especially in those who were initially asymptomatic. Among symptomatic pregnant women, 4.99% were admitted in the ICU. The results in our study are consistent with those of studies in the general population, where fever and coughing were the most reported symptoms [87] .Obesity and hypertensive disorders were the most reported comorbidities in pregnant women with COVID-19. It is noted that the majority of the pregnant women did not have serious complications, with a low occurrence of maternal death (1.0%) and premature rupture of the membrane (2.5%). However, pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension, were reported. Many pregnant women presented with worsening of the general condition that required an induced delivery or emergency cesarean section. However, we found that the maternal risk in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 was relatively low.In contrast, 17.9% of newborns were admitted in the neonatal ICU. Fetal and neonatal complications including premature delivery (6.1%), fetal distress (2.7%), decreased fetal movements (1.8%), and fetal and neonatal death (1.5%) were identified. There were also cases of miscarriage and severe neonatal asphyxia. Therefore, we hypothesize that there is a greater risk of fetal and neonatal complications in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.This systematic review included cases where SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the placenta (n = 13), breast milk (n = 6), and neonates (n = 39). It is important to note that only five studies confirmed a diagnosis within the first 12 h of birth. In other studies, SARS-CoV-2 was detected 12 h after birth, hinting at the possibility of late-onset neonatal infection. Nevertheless, we highlight that 92% of newborns from mothers infected with COVID-19 did not acquire the infection during birth.Although there is a theoretical risk of vertical transmission, it seems to be low and, so far, remains poorly understood. It has been reported that the placental barrier does not allow for the passage of SARS-CoV-2 [88] . However, there is evidence of histopathologic placental changes in women infected with COVID-19, showing poor maternal vascular perfusion and inflammation [89] . It is not clear whether this can disrupt the maternal-placental interface to allow the transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [89] . Furthermore, its role in the occurrence of premature births and other fetal complications remains unknown. Thus, more robust studies, preferably longitudinal studies, involving a large sample size with long-term follow-up are crucial to establish the full implications of COVID-19 on pregnancy and early development. It is unclear whether maternal and newborn COVID-19 infection will cause any sequelae in childhood. Nevertheless, it is essential to formulate guidelines for the management of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 as a way to minimize viral exposure and transmission [7] . These protocols also play important roles in protecting the medical team and providing a suitable hospital environment (e.g., respiratory precautions, use of personal protective equipment, and negative pressure rooms) [90] .The Lancet Infectious Diseases has published guidelines on the management of pregnant women exposed to COVID-19. For asymptomatic cases, home isolation for 14 days is recommended. In symptomatic cases, key recommendations include prioritization of vaginal delivery when possible, late fixation of the umbilical cord, without early cleaning of the newborn, and isolated neonatal surveillance. In both cases, mother-child separation and breastfeeding are discussed individually by an interdisciplinary team [19] . In addition, a recent guideline published in June recommends that for cases where separation is not applicable, other measures to reduce risk of infection (e.g., physical barriers and face mask) must be adopted. For those who choose to breastfeed, mothers must wear face masks and practice good hygiene (hand and breast) before each feeding. Newborns from mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at the time of the delivery should be tested 24 h after birth. If negative, another test at approximately 48 h must be done if testing capacity is available [91] .This review was completed after an extensive bibliographic search using two databases, reference lists, and Google Scholar. We included a large number of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 from 16 countries and data on the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. However, our study has some limitations: First, our findings are mostly limited to case reports and retrospective studies with a small number of cases analyzed. Second, there was a lack of methodological criteria in the conduction of many included studies, which can contribute to erroneous results. However, it is important to highlight that we have gathered all the evidence available in the literature to date and that this information is important to guide health and management policies for pregnant women affected by COVID-19 in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. In addition, the justification for conducting our study is the need to quickly assess and discuss the evidence that has been generated. Finally, some relevant publications may have been released during the submission or publication process of this paper.With the worsening of the COVID-19 global situation, new well-designed research is needed to clarify the risk of vertical transmission (via placenta or hematogenous routes, birth canal, and lactation) of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, further studies are necessary to investigate potential therapeutic interventions that prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity and possible sequelae resulting from COVID-19 infection. In addition, it is important that future studies assess complications arising from COVID-19 in pregnant women in the first and second trimester. These studies are important to improve clinical and preventive strategies for managing COVID-19 in pregnant women and their newborns.This review revealed that pregnant women with COVID-19 usually present with fever, cough, and nausea. Among various comorbidities, obesity and hypertensive disorders are the most common. It is important to highlight the prevalence of premature birth, maternal death, premature rupture of the membrane, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal death, miscarriage, decreased fetal movements, and severe neonatal asphyxia among cases of infected mothers. Although we found only 27 cases of newborns infected with COVID-19, viral exposure of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and intrapartum period cannot be ruled out and should be further investigated in future studies. Thus, it is important to follow-up all newborns from mothers diagnosed with COVID-19. Funding: This work was carried out with its own financing.",Brazil,first author,2020-11-24,11
0157c92bfafee1dbd964918a0f1dc24a987564fd,"Predicting Hospital Demand During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Bogotá, Colombia","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic had spread from China to almost all the countries in the world by April 1, 2020. The first official case was reported in Colombia on March 6, 2020, from an imported case, and evolved to local cases of transmission. In order to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bogotá, the largest city in Colombia, a local lockdown was introduced on March 15, 2020, followed by a national lockdown on March 19, 2020. Colombia, like many developing nations, does not have a strong health system able to respond to a pandemic of the magnitude of the present one. Neither in terms of infrastructure and medical personnel, nor in terms of logistical preparedness and the technical capacity to provide all medically needed resources. The latter is the main motivation to create a model that allows particular clinics and hospitals to estimate the number of beds and respirators needed during the peak days. Specifically, we are interested in estimating the number of patients that require Intensive Care Units-ICU care (critical), and the number of patients that require hospital care (severe), but not ICU care.As of April 4, 2020, Colombia had only carried out 460 tests per million people (https://infogram.com/, https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing), whereas other countries, such as Germany and South Korea, had carried out over 1,000 tests per million people. Additionally, on March 26, one of the two available machines used to run the detection tests broke, leading to a reduction operations and causing delays in the detection of the total number of cases. Unfortunately, for developing countries like Colombia, it has been an enormous effort to expand facilities and the production of biotechnology inputs to run the necessary number of tests required to detect all active cases of the virus; the highest number up to date has been 17,000 tests, on June 19, 2020. Thus, one of the biggest concerns is that the data may not be well-informative as to how many hospital beds (and ICU beds) will be needed during the peak of the outbreak. In fact, one of the main caveats for this study is that the official data is very likely to be under estimated, as only patients with at least one symptom or that have had contact with another detected case are being tested (1) (National Health Institute by its acronym in Spanish). Moreover, we are employing an overall probability of requiring ICU treatment, although sex, age, and co-morbidity (diabetes, hypertension, acute respiratory diseases, and depressed immune system) give rise to differential probabilities, that are not taken into account here.We implemented an SEIR model (Susceptible -Exposed -Infectious -Recovered) to forecast the number of cases in Bogotá, the largest city in Colombia and the one with the largest numbers of cases to date, using the public official COVID-19 information from the Health Secretariat-Saludata and available at (http://saludata.saludcapital.gov.co/osb). The model includes three different categories of infection: Infected that require ICU care, Infected that require hospital care, but not ICU care, and Infected that only require Home care. The model accounts for the effect of control strategies introduced by the government by changing the transmission rate over time. We developed a Shiny app that displays the results from the model. It is publicly available at (https://claudia-rivera-rodriguez.shinyapps.io/ shinyappcovidclinic/). Users can change the initial parameters according to their specific situation. The Shiny app can work as a forecasting tool for individual clinics by specifying the market share (percentage) of the population corresponding to the clinic. During the outbreak, some clinics should be ready to see an increase in their market share because they may have more resources, such as ICU beds, and the model allows each clinic to adjust this. The model can be used for specific cities or towns: the user only needs to change the population size and some of the parameters of interest.SIR methods (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) have become widespread in the prediction of communicable diseases since their creation in the early 20th century (2) . Several authors have provided forecasting models using this method, as presented in (3), but SIR models rely heavily on initial assumptions that are strong. SEIR models are a variation that relaxes some of those assumptions, including closed populations, and account for communicable diseases that transmit in transitions, starting from the entire population (Susceptible) that incubate the disease for a period of time (Exposed) making the person infected but not infectious (I) and finally become Recovered (R) (4) . Each transition has a rate based on what is observed from a population, that is, a susceptible person gets infected at a transmission rate once in contact with an infected individual, and becomes exposed. Once exposed, the transition to infected happens at a rate that captures the inverse of the mean latent period of the disease. The final transition is recovery with permanent immunity. We chose this model to estimate the demand for beds for each institution in Colombia, distinguishing between regular and ICU (Intensive Care Units) beds, which allows different transition rates for each type. We also estimate the requisite preparedness and logistical needs for the health providers. Similar methods have been used to forecast similar needs in Europe and the United States of America (5-7) and more recently they have also been part of the discussion in developing nations: SIR models are also used to forecast the virus progression in Colombia.We fitted a deterministic SEIR model over 6 months. For practical purposes, it is important to bear in mind that policies were changing over this period of time, and therefore models must be updated. The population is divided into compartments or states that individuals transition from one state to the other, corresponding to Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D). Those Infected (I) are subdivided into three compartments: I U , I NoU , I H which, respectively, denote infected individuals that require ICU care, infected individuals that require hospital care but not ICU, and infected individuals that only require home care.One implication of our model is that it does not consider events such as births or migration, and it only considers deaths due to COVID-19. Note that we assume that patients transit from E to ICU care directly, therefore we assume that the average time from (E) to (I U ) is larger than the average time from (E) to (I NoU ) and subsequently this is larger than the average time from (E) to (I H ). These transitions and considerations are summarized in Figure 1 . We also assume that the only patients that transition to death are those in ICU, whilst other infected patients recover: this assumption is based on the fact that at the beginning of the pandemic, when this document was written, there was no collected evidence besides patients in clinics, and the observed rates showed a disproportionately large mortality rate for ICU patients in Wuhan and Washington State (8, 9) . The total population of Bogotá is 7.4 million, but we assume an initial population size of 8 million to account for its metropolitan area because people commute daily to work and study from the surrounding towns to Bogotá's Capital District.We describe the epidemic transitions through the model using the following equations.where κ NoU = p NoU κ, κ U = p U κ and κ H = p H κ. This set of equations is the core model, where, at time t, the population is divided into susceptible (S(t)), exposed (E(t)), infected ICU (I U (t)), infected in hospital but not ICU (I NoU (t)), infected that require only home care (I H (t)), recovered (R(t)) and dead subjects (D(t)) individuals. The total of infected individual is I(t) = I U (t) + I NoU (t) + I H (t), with respective proportions p U , p NoU , and p H . The transmission rate, β(t), controls the rate of spread, i.e., the probability of transmitting disease between a susceptible and an infectious individual. We allow this to be a step-wise function to adjust for the measures taken by local authorities to control the spread of the virus. The term 1/κ represents the mean incubation period and γ U , γ NoU , γ H are the daily probabilities that the respective patients recover. Furthermore, d denotes the probability of death for ICU patients. The model's transitions are described in Figure 1 . Equation (1) describes the rate at which new individuals are exposed, this rate is β(t)S(t) I(t) N ; Equation (2) describes the rate at which exposed individuals become infected, this rate is (κ U + κ NoU + κ H )E(t). Infected individuals become infected in one of the three categories: I U (t) + I NoU (t), and I H (t) with probabilities p U , p NoU , and p H , respectively. Additionally, Equation (3) describes the rate at which infected individuals in ICU either die or recover, this rate is γ U I U (t). Similarly, Equation (4) represents the rate at which infected individuals in hospital (but, not ICU) either dies or recover, this rate is γ NoU I NoU (t) andEquation (5) describes the rate at which infected individuals at home either die or recover: γ H I H (t). Equation (6) describes the rate at which infected individuals recover. Note that this rate is always positive and the number of recovered individuals never decreases. Similarly, Equation (7) describes the rate at which infected individuals die. Note that only individuals from ICU die and this rate is also positive. The total population is N =We are aware that other variables, beyond total population counts, such as age and sex distribution and having an identified co-morbidity such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or cancer, increases the probability of developing complications due to Covid-19 that increase the chances of dying. However, Colombian data was not available at the microdata level when the pandemic erupted, and still is not available, not even in tabular form, including any of these additional variables. Hence, the best we could do was to implement the model for the general observed numbers.To model the impact of the interventions introduced by the government, we allow the transmission rate to be a step-wise function β(t), with three steps at t 0 , t 1 and t 2 . The time t 0 (2020-05-24) corresponds to the time when we start predicting, t 1 (2020-06-16) is when new measures were introduced, and t 2 (2020-06-30) is the date when measures were revised and implemented. We estimate β(t 0 ) from the basic reproduction number such that R 0 = 1.1 (10) . For t > t 0 , we choose β(t) such that R(t) ≈ 1.3, for t 1 ≤ t < t 2 and R(t) ≈ 1.2, for t ≥ t 2 (10) (Appendix).The terms p U , p NoU and p H denote the probabilities that a case requires ICU care, hospital non-ICU care, and only home care, respectively. Note that p U + p NoU + p H = 1. To estimate these probabilities, we use information from the Colombian National Health Institute, finding p U = 0.0168, p NoU = 0.14 and p H = 0.843. The parameter κ is the daily probability of an exposed individual becoming infected, and γ U , γ NoU , γ H are the daily probabilities that an infected individual recovers given that they are in ICU, Regular bed and home, respectively. The probability d denotes the probability that an infected ICU individual dies. Figure 2 shows the results the model predicts for each category. Even with all the positive measures assumed in the model, we predict that the peak of the epidemic could happen around November 11, 2020. During the peak of the epidemic, the model predicts that 1,362 ICUs will be needed for coronavirus patients, and 9,470 non-ICU hospital beds. We predict that the maximum number of prevalent cases will be 67,866 (2020- [11] [12] [13] [14] for the 6 months of the prediction. With the parameters in the models, the total number of deaths could reach 13,268 in 6 months' time. FIGURE 1 | We divided the population into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected ICU (I U ), infected in hospital but not ICU (I NoU ), infected that require only home care (I H ), recovered (R), and dead subjects (D). Infected subjects are I U , I NoU or I H with probabilities p U , p NoU and p H , respectively. The term 1/κ is the mean incubation period and γ U , γ NoU , γ H are the daily probabilities that the respective patients recover. d is the probability of death for ICU patients. Stepwise function (11, 12) κ Daily probability of an exposed individual becoming infected: κ = 1/α, with α being the mean incubation period 1/5.2 (13) p U Probability of patient being ICU 0.0168 (10) p NoU Probability of patient being in Hospital, but not ICU 0.14 (10) p H Probability of patient being mild/at home 0.843 (10) γ U Daily probability that an infected individual in ICU recovers, when the mean infection period is b U , γ U = 1/b U 1/6 (13) (14) (15) γ NoU Daily probability that an infected individual in Hospital, but not ICU, recovers, when the mean infection period is b NoU , γ NoU = 1/b NoU Figure 3 displays a closer picture of those infected and the total number of deaths. We can see that the total number of infected that will need hospital care (ICU and non-ICU) is high enough for concern. Additionally, Figure 4 shows those infected that will need hospital care, compared to the current number of ICU beds in the city. It shows that the number of ICUs needed will be 1,362, i.e., the city has to increase its capacity in order to provide care to everyone that needs it. The local authorities in Bogotá are planning to have a total of 1,200 ICU beds in the city, but the current number is still lower than that. The number 1,200 will be overrun by mid-September, 2020, with a death toll of 4,850 people by then. Unfortunately, the trend keeps on increasing over the following months, which reflects the lack of preparedness for a catastrophe like the current one in Bogotá, and probably in other similar developing nations.When we increase the number of days that ICU patients take to recover, i.e., 1/γ U = 14 days, rather than 7, the number of ICU beds needed almost doubles. If the probability of being an ICU patient p U is reduced, the number of beds is reduced, but even a small increase in this probability will cause a large increase in the number of ICU beds needed during the peak of the epidemic.This paper presents a prediction of the total number of ICU and regular beds that will be needed during the pandemic COVID-19 for Bogotá, Colombia. We use a SEIR model that differentiates between three types of infected patients: those who can stay at home, those who need regular hospital beds, and those who need ICU treatment. It employs a mean incubation period of 5.2 days and mean infection periods of 4 days (for patients at home), 5 days (for patients in regular hospital beds), and 7 days (for patients in ICU). The parameters assumed in the model are for a positive scenario, where the effective reproduction number during the lock-down is assumed to be 1.1, and 1.3 after the lockdown, and 1.2 when other measures are introduced. We assume that 2.6% of patients require ICU treatment, 13.4% require regular hospital beds, and the rest only require home care. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of 1 year. The model predicts that by mid-November, 2020, the city will reach the peak of the epidemic with a total 67, 866 prevalent cases and 1,362 active ICU prevalent cases.The number of patients that need hospitalization can surpass the current planned capacity, set at 1,200 beds for ICU beds in the city, and the death toll can reach a total of 13,268 in 6 months' time (by the end of December). The unpreparedness of the health system will only increase COVID-19 related and unrelated mortality, as already observed in Italy, the USA, and other countries. Measures like lockdown have been used in most countries to diffuse the demand for health services due to COVID-19 over time, however it may be insufficient if there are not enough resources to ramp the health services in developing nations, such as is the case of Colombia, where the need for additional resources is a priority at this point.Other than the intrinsic limitations of SEIR models, this prediction model does not take into account the age and sex distribution of the population, but we plan to introduce such distinctions in a future version of the model with an additional mixing including the contact matrices, as the recent national population census in Colombia is available. Also, we have fitted a model with two interventions: a lockdown and mitigation measures, but this can be modified later in time. Neither do we take into account regional differences, in a tropical context relate to weather and climate, because there is no evidence, to date, whether the pattern of spread of the novel coronavirus depends on weather conditions.Finally, we provide a Shiny app available at https://claudiarivera-rodriguez.shinyapps.io/shinyappcovidclinic/. The original values in the app reproduce the results of this paper, but the parameters and starting values can be changed according to the user's needs. COVID-19 has posed too many challenges to health systems around the globe. It is remarkable that governments everywhere have swiftly responded by increasing laboratory tests, medical personnel, infrastructure, and data production linked to the disease. It is even striking that a developing nation, such as Colombia, has publicly available information updated daily on the evolution of the pandemic, with all the attendant pros and cons. Daily data is probably defective, and by now is preliminary, but still very helpful when trying to find solutions to the hard issues imposed on the demand for health resources due to the pandemic. The standard time of production of mortality data is 2 years and a trimester, according to the official national statistical office (DANE).This model is a useful tool for cities, hospitals and clinics in Colombia that need to prepare for the excess demand of services that a situation like this imposes. The model predicts that by mid-November, the current capacity of ICUs in Bogotá will not be enough if no other measures are taken. Lockdown rules in fact were strengthened, tracking, surveillance and testing capacities also increased, and social behavior tilted toward following preventive measures. As a result, the observed reproductive numbers dramatically diminished, and when used in the model we obtain a fairly similar number of beds demanded as those actually observed, and a slightly higher mortality than observed. We expect all those measures and preventive behavior will be maintained for the remainder of the pandemic, otherwise there will be a demand for beds that will surpass the current capacity in the city.The materials(code) used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

So, we have that β(t) ≈ R(t) * N/(τ * S(t)) So, we have β(t) = 0.26 for t 1 ≤ t ≤ t 2 , and β(t) = 0.24 for t > t 2 .",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-11,11

Since the report on March 13, 2020 of the first two cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in Venezuela, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the country. The areas of highest transmission flank the Colombian-Venezuelan border, where the reported incidence reaches 47,9% with a 34,2% overall mortality (ESRI Venezuela,Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has had a severe impact on its health care system: the country has experienced a mass exodus of medical personnel, shortages of treatment and supplies, as well as a systematic dismantling of public health infrastructure (Daniels, 2020) . In addition, the increased poverty and violence, plus the abandonment of all epidemiological surveillance programs, has set the stage for the re-emergence of vaccinepreventable and vector-borne diseases (Grillet et al., 2019; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2019) .The Venezuelan public health system cannot withstand current autochthonous threats, let alone emerging infectious agents such as SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the political and economic turmoil in Venezuela has precipitated one of the largest refugee crises witnessed in the hemisphere. This has resulted in the establishment of disease corridors to neighboring countries---particularly Colombia, which houses 1.4 million Venezuelan migrants (Daniels, 2020; Torres and Castro, 2019) . Despite early implementation of lockdown and border restrictions starting in March 2020, control of cross-border migration has remained a challenge due to the length (approximately 2,219 km) of the Venezuelan-Colombian border, and the unregulated transit of individuals through illegal trails known as ""trochas"". J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f As of July 8 th 2020, the majority of COVID-19 cases in Venezuela have been reported from three border states, Apure, Táchira and Zulia. (""Estadísticas Venezuela | COVID-19 en Venezuela,"" n.d.) .Here we report sequences for three of five SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, representing the first viral genomes from Venezuela, and providing a snapshot of the epidemiological landscape across the Colombian-Venezuelan border.The Colombian National Institute of Health (INS) is defined as the reference laboratory in Colombia. When a public health emergency occurs as is the COVID19, the national law 9-1979, decrees 786-1990 and 2323-2006 , authorizes the INS to use the biological material and associated epidemiological information without informed consent, including the anonymous disclosure of results. This study was performed following the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. The data of the patients was anonymized which do not represent any risk. Complete viral genomes were generated from specimens from three of these five cases. The patients, aged 30 (♂), 42 (♂) and 56 (♀) years, came from different regions, Cucuta, Norte de Santander, and Bolivar, (Fig 1A) . Sequencing was unsuccessful for the other 2 specimens, most likely due to insufficient target material.We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from NP viral transport medium (VTM) clinical specimens. Sample preparation for sequencing was done using whole-genome amplification with custom designed tiling primers and the Artic Consortium protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) with a read length of 150, and the modifications previously described . Amplicon libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, cat. FC-131-1096), as recommended by the manufacturer that then were sequenced by Illumina sequencing.The initial bioinformatic analysis was previously described .Briefly, the primer sequences were trimmed using cutadapt version 2.8, and were aligned to SARS-CoV-2 genome MN908947.3 using minimap2 version 2.17-r941, to call a consensus sequence using Pilon v1.23, allowing for all variant types (single nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, large insertions/deletions or block substitution events, and local misassemblies). Regions with less than 10 fold-coverage were masked and unamplified regions at the end of the viral genome were also removed. Finally, consensus sequences were annotated using Prokka v1.14.6 and a custom SARS-CoV-2 reference annotation file. The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof complete genomes were typed using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages ""Pangolin"" tool (Rambaut et al., 2020) .A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes encompassing the lineage diversity from South America were downloaded from the GISAID EpiCoV TM database (https://www.gisaid.org/) for comparative genomic analyses (Table S1 ). These sequences were aligned in MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2018) , using the Wuhan-1 strain (NC_045512.2) as reference. The complete data set was subjected to the same typing scheme using Pangolin (Rambaut et al., 2016; Sagulenko et al., 2018) revealed that there was no clustering by originating country in the reconstruction, although a general clustering by pangolin lineages was observed (Fig. 1C) . These analyses are in agreement with the simultaneous circulation of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from different geographical origins.Herein, we report for the first time three genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from patients in the Colombian-Venezuelan border. Despite the small number of samples, this data provides valuable initial information about potential transmission routes and vulnerabilities, particularly in the context of government limitations on access to data related to SARS-CoV-2 in Venezuela. Access to additional genomic information will be needed to enable robust conclusions regarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the Colombian-Venezuelan border.The presence of mutations previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity and transmissibility in the genomic sequences we determined for SARS-CoV-2 from both Venezuela and neighboring border regions of Colombia may represent an additional challenge for control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. The specter of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with increased infectivity further complicates the already-complex epidemiological landscape with its chronic limitations of biomedical understaffing, poor healthcare infrastructure, limited or inadequate diagnostic capacities, and poor compliance of the general population with disease containment measures (Miller et al., 2020) . The concurrent humanitarian crisis has forced millions of Venezuelans to flee to neighboring countries ---mainly Colombia---seeking economic and social stability (Torres and Castro, 2019; Tuite et al., 2018) . Venezuelans with ongoing health issues also travel to Colombia to obtain high-quality healthcare such as surgical procedures and hemodialysis (Daniels, 2020) . However, massive Venezuelan migration has resulted in an unprecedented infectious disease exodus, representing one of the most concerning public health threats in the region (Grillet et al., 2019; Torres and Castro, 2019) . COVID-19 has deepened the situation and has prompted xenophobia and further marginalization of Venezuelan migrants and refugees at the Venezuelan-Colombian border (Daniels, 2020) . An important limitation to our study is that the small number of genomes currently available from Venezuela could potentially result in sampling bias. Given the difficulty in obtaining samples, the extent to which our findings truly reflect Venezuela""s overall phylogenetic landscape remains to be determined. Future studies are needed to expand the SARS-CoV-2 genome repertoire in Venezuela and related areas, and to enable better understanding of the interplay between genotype and phenotype, and their relevance for disease surveillance and containment. Additionally, collection and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from all geographical regions (Colombia and Venezuela) will be needed to understand the true spread between these two neighbors.The Venezuelan humanitarian and refugee crisis, coupled with uncontrolled migration across the Colombian-Venezuelan border, is a devastating reminder of the potential effects of infectious disease spillover on the already vulnerable public health systems of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f neighboring countries. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread across Latin America, public health authorities and the international community should carefully follow the impact of the pandemic on displaced populations. Intensive efforts are urgently needed to help minimize the impact of Venezuela's crisis on the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Future efforts to obtain additional viral genomes will be essential to fully uncover the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the Colombian-Venezuelan border. ",Venezuela,abstract,2020-11-04,11
2ad5e22df8beafa4025dce32a648eced2ba3832b,"Taking critical thinking, creativity and grit online","This paper is in response to the article ""Designing for 21st century learning online: a heuristic method to enable educator learning support roles"" (Nacu et al. 2018) . In this paper, the authors outline a framework for heuristic evaluation when designing online experiences to support twenty-first century learning.Twenty-first century skills can be key to success in a modern knowledge society. Among these skills, critical thinking is important not only at work, where problem solving is essential, but also in any social setting where adequate decision making is required (Dwyer and Walsh 2020) . Additionally, creativity helps ensure that the outcomes of critical thinking can be both culturally ingenious as well as treasured (Yeh et al. 2019b ). This is achieved by embracing cognitive abilities in order to create new combinations of ideas (Davis 1969) .Technology has been shown to facilitate the development of higher-order thinking skills in learning (Engerman et al. 2018) . However, in general, schools have failed to take advantage of this by incorporating adequate use of technology into their practices (Olszewski and Crompton 2020) . Therefore, the rush towards online learning by education systems during COVID-19 can also be seen as an opportunity to develop students' higher-order thinking skills. One potential drawback with online learning is the distance it creates between peers, thus hindering student engagement and the development of higher-order thinking skills (Dwyer and Walsh 2020) . We show how this barrier can be overcome when developing critical thinking and creativity in an online context.Critical thinking includes the ability to identify the main elements and assumptions of an argument and the relationships between them, as well as drawing conclusions based on the information that is available, evaluating evidence, and self-correcting, among others. It is seen as a self-regulated process that comes from developing skills such as interpretation, analysis, evaluation and explanation; going beyond technical skills. It can therefore be considered a metacognitive process (Saxton et al. 2012; Facione 1990) .By taking learning online, both self-study and teacher-led sessions can be enhanced through a problem-based learning strategy. In the first stage, students build on a question or topic posed by the teacher, e.g. a mathematical problem or an essay writing assignment. In the second stage, students peer-review their classmates' responses or essays using a rubric provided by the teacher. Students break down their classmates' responses and see how they relate to the objective of the activity. They then compare this analysis with the rubric in order to provide feedback. In a third stage, the students develop a new response based on their initial response, the experience of giving feedback, and the feedback they received. This process develops self-evaluation as the students compare their own response with their classmates' and discover any gaps in their knowledge. It can also develop metacognition as they integrate various sources of knowledge (initial response, feedback received and the experience of giving feedback) when developing a new response. In the final stage, the teacher discusses the different responses with the class. The teacher then compares the students' work with the expected response and provides a general summary, transferring the responses to different domains.While Stages 1 through 3 are asynchronous and computer-aided, stage 4 can be synchronous and supported by the use of a web-based video conferencing tool. Active student participation and teacher mediation are both key since interactive and instant feedback has been shown to improve critical thinking (Chang et al. 2020) .In addition to the problem-based strategy presented here, other active learning strategies can also be used to develop critical thinking, e.g. structured questioning, role playing, and cooperative learning (Cruz and Dominguez 2020) . How these might be implemented online is still open to discussion, though heuristic evaluations may be a good alternative given the possibilities presented by online learning as a resource provider, learning broker and learning promoter (Nacu et al. 2018 ).Creativity is an essential element of the problem-solving process. Creative people often find ways of addressing a problem that others cannot see, while also having the ability to overcome barriers where others may otherwise give up (Kaufman 2016 ). There are different techniques for developing creativity. In-depth learning is facilitated when students represent concepts based on their own personal perceptions (Liu et al. 2018) . In this sense, analogy can be a powerful tool for boosting creativity. Analogical transfer includes the idea of making analogies by analyzing objects, ideas or concepts across domains, i.e. information is transferred from the known (the original domain) to the unknown (the new domain) by searching for similarities (Shen and Lai 2014) .We propose an analogical transfer strategy. In the first stage, the teacher identifies a concept with examples from different domains. This might include showing a video that not only introduces the concept but also provides a context that is both familiar and relatable for the students. In the second stage, students reflect on situations from their own lives where they can apply the concept that is being studied. Here, the use of open-ended questions allows the students' creativity to be explored in greater depth, while adapting to their different backgrounds and levels of prior knowledge. In the third stage, which is mediated by the teacher, the students discuss their responses from stage 2. The teacher should focus on original responses from different domains, or responses where it is not clear whether the solution is correct.Stages 1 and 2 can be conducted asynchronously and scaffolded using technology through the inclusion of multimedia and student guides. However, stage 3 should be synchronous and supported by the use of a web-based video conferencing tool. In this way, technology facilitates the development of creativity by facilitating the discovery process, the collection of ideas, and the integration of knowledge (Yang et al. 2018) . Mediation in stage 3 is therefore key (Giacumo and Savenye 2020) . Effective teacher-student dialogue can improve the teacher-student relationship and enhance the creative process. Heuristic evaluation can therefore help us understand this relationship by looking at these interactions on the online platform (Nacu et al. 2018 ).As with any learning process, critical thinking and creativity require students to be both present and focused, which in turn requires grit (Yeh et al. 2019a) . In other words, the way in which students approach their schooling is just as important as what and how we teach them (Tissenbaum 2020) . Grit should therefore not only be considered an essential element of academic achievement but also as a mental process that activates and/or directs people's behavior and actions (Datu et al. 2018, Lan and Moscardino 2019) . This is particularly relevant in a COVID-19 context, where the pandemic is affecting the wellbeing and mental health of many students, families & communities (OECD 2020).In order to achieve effective student engagement, the objective must be attainable, interesting and accessible (i.e. in their zone of proximal development). The means used to complete the task must be attractive and feel more like a reward than an assignment. Finally, the teacher should work on the students' persistence, not just in order to complete the task but as an essential quality for everyday life (Barnes 2019) .Teacher grit may also be key. As Haderer (2020) suggests ""Why do some teachers stay when others run from the challenges?"" In this sense, reflection has been shown to be relevant for teacher efficacy and grit (Haderer 2020) . Heuristic evaluation methods may therefore allow the educator to understand the learning system as a whole (Nacu et al. 2018 ).As indicated in (Nacu et al. 2018) we are ""faced with the need to create youth-centered spaces that also provide adult facilitation of learning"". Heuristic evaluation can therefore help connect online platforms with students, teachers and twenty-first century skills needs.",Chile,first author,2020-11-09,11
a9c021dffa7570eb4c1aab54037be955747fa911,"Nutritional Inadequacies Among Post-bariatric Patients During COVID-19 Quarantine in Sao Paulo, Brazil","It is well established that post-bariatric weight loss is mainly due to the dietary and gastrointestinal hormonal (such as satiety signals) adjustments imposed by surgery [1, 2] . However, postoperative control of food intake is also influenced by psychological and behavioral factors [3] . The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) and social isolation measures taken worldwide to control the spread of the disease have dramatically changed the way of life among patients who underwent bariatric surgery, along with reduced access to face-to-face patient care [4] . In this scenario, adhering to postoperative dietary recommendations and maintaining appropriate control over dietary intake may be challenging.Considering these aspects, we investigated dietary habits and food intake during COVID-19 quarantine among patients who recently underwent bariatric surgery.In this screening study, we enrolled patients who underwent bariatric surgery from the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Unit of the Clinical Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Patients aged ≥ 18 years, with surgery elapsed time ≤ 12 months and without any COVID-19 symptoms, were considered eligible. Information about age, sex, surgery technique, postoperative time, and body mass index (BMI) were collected from medical records. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Trained dietitians conducted three non-consecutive 24-h food recalls (two weekdays and one weekend day) over the phone to gather information on food consumption during quarantine. Using appropriate nutritional software (Dietbox softwareonline version), we analyzed energy (in kcal), protein, carbohydrates, and lipids (in grams and percentage of total energy intake-TEI) and fiber (grams) intake. Per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) energy and macronutrients intake were also assessed. Food consumption was classified and calculated for processing level in accordance with the NOVA classification [5] . For this, we evaluated the frequency of food consumption (times/day) and energy contribution (%TEI) of each category (culinary ingredients; unprocessed or minimally processed foods; processed foods and ultra-processed foods).In addition, patients were categorically classified (""yes"" or ""no"") according to their adherence to nutritional recommendations provided during follow-up in our outpatient clinic for patients who underwent bariatric surgery for the following criteria: meal skipping habit; daily consumption of three structured meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner); consumption of snacks; consumption of animal and vegetal protein source in main meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner); and minimal protein intake of 60 g/day [6] . Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or frequency (absolute and relative). Data on food consumption are presented as absolute values, %TEI and daily frequency of intake.We evaluated 65 patients (56 (86.1%) women) aged 47.2 ± 11.4 years. Forty-seven (72.3%) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, whereas 18 (27.7%) underwent vertical gastrectomy. Average postoperative time and BMI were 7.4 ± 2.2 months and 35.5 ± 6.8 kg/m 2 , respectively. Twenty-one (32.3%) patients had the habit of skipping meals; thirty-four patients (52.3%) had daily consumption of three structured meals; and only twenty-three patients (38.5%) consumed animal protein in all main meals and thirty-seven (56.9%) consumed any source of protein (animal or vegetable) in all main meals ( Table 1) .The average energy intake was 824.5 ± 255.4 kcal/day. The frequencies of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods consumption were 10.1 ± 2.9, 2.2 ± 1.1, and 3.1 ± 1.5 times/day, respectively. Energy from ultra-processed and processed foods corresponded to 23.8 ± 12.3% and 11.1 ± 10.1% of TEI, respectively ( Table 2) . We observed that most of the consumed protein was during lunch, whereas carbohydrate was mostly present during snacks (Fig. 1) . In comparison to guideline recommendations, we observed that most patients (fifty-eight patients (89.2%)) did not achieve the recommended daily protein intake (animal + vegetal source). A representative 24-h recall from one of the patients is showed in Table 3 .Our results are indicative of inappropriate nutritional intake during COVID-19 quarantine in patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Despite current recommendations regarding the implementation (whenever possible) of telemedicine, online, or phone follow-up strategies during quarantine in order to provide health support, especially nutritional, to patients who are less willing or unable to travel [7] , the emergency status of the pandemic impeded the implementation of remote follow-up in our institution. This is of clinical relevance, as inadequate eating practices and lifestyle arising from lack of nutritional guidance and counseling (as those experienced by our cohort due to constraints imposed by social isolation measures) may compromise the effectiveness of surgery on weight loss [8] . More than one-third of the patients had the habit of skipping main meals (breakfast, lunch, or dinner), which could possibly be related to an elevated consumption of snacks throughout the day. Considering the energy content of snacks (293.6 ± 196 kcal), their frequent consumption may lead to excessive calorie intake, which in turn could result in reduced weight loss or even weight recover in the postoperative period [9] . The rather low sugar intake observed in most of our patients (2.5% TEI) is not surprising. Previous studies have shown a decreased preference for sugar among patients undergoing bariatric surgery [10] as its highly osmotic feature increases the incidence of dumping syndrome [11] . Despite adequate dietary fiber intake being essential for gut function and laxation (bowel habits) [12] , there is a lack of fiber intake recommendation in current guidelines [6, 13] . The number of available studies on post-bariatric dietary fiber intake is limited, but food intolerance to cereals, rice, fruits, and vegetables has been considered as a potential contributing factor to reduced postoperative fiber intake [14] .Protein is thought to play a central role in postoperative nutrition of bariatric patients. Current recommendations state that protein-rich foods (e.g., dairy products, eggs, fish, and lean meat) should be consumed in the main meals of the day [6] . We observed that many of our patients failed to meet both the recommended daily protein intake (89.2%) and the recommendation for frequent animal protein intake (38.5%). Inadequate protein intake has been previously reported in Brazilian patients undergoing bariatric surgery [15, 16] . Considering the relatively short postoperative time (7.4 ± 2.2 months), one may speculate that food intolerance may have hampered proper protein intake [17] ; however, previous studies did not observe any association between food intolerance and protein consumption [15, 18] . Although speculative, the low protein ingestion may be related to our population's low socioeconomic status [19] . These results reinforce the importance of monitoring protein intake after surgery. No recommendation is currently available for per-meal protein intake in postoperative bariatric surgery; however, there is evidence to suggest that a high per-meal protein intake (> 30 g/meal) is associated with better functional status in older obese adults engaged in a weight loss intervention [20] . In our patients, average per meal protein intake was~1 7 g. Reductions in fat-free mass during energy restriction typically account for a significant amount of total weight loss. This is also the case in patients who underwent bariatric surgery, for whom the loss of fat-free mass may rise as high as 23% within the first months after surgery [21] and may significantly impact functional capacity, bone remodeling, and cardiometabolic parameters [22] . In this scenario, adequate protein provision may constitute an important nutritional support to mitigate energy restriction-induced muscle waste.Moreover, no guideline is available for carbohydrate and lipid daily intakes during the postoperative period. Despite the last UpToDate Report [13] allude carbohydrate and lipid intakes of approximately 130 g/day and 20 to 35% TEI, respectively, these are not official recommendations; therefore, no adequacy assessment was performed.Despite the high intake of unprocessed or minimally processed foods (predominantly in the form of natural foods), our patients showed a high consumption of ultra-processed foods (23.8 ± 12.3% of TEI). Because of its energy dense profile characterized by high fat (mainly saturated fat), sugar, and sodium levels, the ingestion of ultra-processed foods is strongly associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease [23] . Moreover, ultra-processed foods can activate brain regions associated with the reward system, affecting food choices and stimulating food consumption [24] . In line with this, previous studies have explored the caloric contribution as a function of food processing in patients who underwent bariatric surgery [25, 26] . Pinto et al. [25] observed that the caloric contribution of ultra-processed foods was 19.7% after 3 months of bariatric Data are shown as frequency (% of patients) or mean ± standard deviation (95% confidence interval). TEI total energy intake Fig. 1 Panel a Per meal macronutrient contribution (relative to total energy intake) (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) (%). Panel b Per meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) protein intake (g) surgery, which is~20% lower than that seen in the current study. The qualitative analysis of food intake has become more important recently, as good-quality diets have been considered a protective factor against weight recovery after surgery [23] . It is possible, however, that the longer shelf life and lower cost of ultra-processed foods [27] may have driven its increased consumption during quarantine. Longitudinal assessments are warranted in order to confirm whether the nutritional inadequacies observed in this study are causally associated with social isolation and lack of face-to-face health care.In conclusion, the screening of dietary habits and food intake during COVID-19 quarantine of patients who underwent bariatric surgery showed low protein consumption and a relatively high intake of ultra-processed foods (~1/4 of the diet). Despite the inherent limitations of an observational study, thus hampering more in-depth investigation of the actual role of COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits, data herein allow us to suggest the need for the development and implementation of virtual strategies, such as app-based tools and telemedicine, in order to extend nutritional care to at-risk patients during social distancing.Funding This study was financially supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) (grants #2015/26937-4, #2017/13552-2, #2019/ 18039-7, #2020/07860-9) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) (grant #402123/2020-4).Conflict of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate This study has been approved by the Hospital's Ethical Committee.

The 21st century is 8 marked by globalization and an intricate and intense social network connecting 9 in one way or another to everyone on the planet. The latter fact increases 10 the danger that a local epidemic disease will rapidly evolve into a pandemic 11 like what happened in Wuhan, China, and now is all over the world. 12 The form of propagation and contagion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is through 13 direct contact between individuals, via secretions, saliva, and especially 14 droplets expelled during breathing, speech, coughing, or sneezing. The virus 15 also spreads by indirect contact, when such secretions reach surfaces, food, and 16 objects [1] . Besides, infected people take a few days to manifest symptoms, 17 which can be severe or as mild as a simple cold. There is even a large 18 proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic [2] . Therefore, it is 19 hard to quickly identify the infected and apply effective measures to limit 20 the disease's spread. Also, the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 21 is very recent in the face of the current epidemic. Little is known about 22 the COVID-19 disease, which appears to be highly lethal, with no drugs to 23 prevent or treat. The concern is more significant since direct (individual -24 individual) and indirect (individual -objects -individual) social relations are 25 the means of spreading the disease. Thus, the social interaction structure is 26 the key to create strategies and guide health organizations and governments 27 to take appropriate actions to combat the disease. 28 One of the main concerns is overloading the health system. The first 29 known case in Brazil was confirmed on February 26, a 61-year-old man who 30 traveled to the Lombardy region in northern Italy. In the middle of May, 31 there are more than 200,000 cases and 14,000 deaths in all states of Brazil [3] . 32 The concern is even worse due to the country's social inequality. Over 80% of 33 the population relies solely on the public health system, and this distribution 34 is not uniform. According to [4] , there are only nine hospital beds per 100,000 35 people in the northern region, while southeast accounts for 21 hospital beds. 36 The treatment of severe cases requires the use of respirators/ventilation in The proposed model can be used to study any society given sufficient 60 demographic data, such as medium/big cities, countries, or regions. Here sociologist is the author of the well-known idea that there are always chains 104 of up to six people connecting any two individuals globally, which reinforces 105 the importance of analyzing the pandemic spread from a graph view.In the context of epidemic propagation analysis, one of the best known 107 and widely used models is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, • Infected: the ones that have the disease.• Recovered: a person usually recovers after some time and maybe will 114 not susceptible to infection again due to the immunity process (in this 115 case, this is an assumption of the process). The recovery rate of infected Also, the model can be described aswhere s, i and r represents the ratio of susceptible, infected and recovered 119 people in the population, respectively and N represents their absolute sum.Usually, the SIR model is solved with differential equations. can be compared to the statistical analysis in [26] , however here we introduce 264 a more detailed model of social contacts with specific layers and connection 265 patterns better to fit the particularities of a given country or city. connected at group j of layer i, its edge weight is then defined bywhere t i represents the average weekly contact time on layer i, k i is the . The dotted lines represent the standard deviation, and in the case of the real data, the curve is the average over a 5-day window, and the solid lines the real raw data. The highest average number of deaths produced by the proposed model may be related to underdetection (See Figure 5) . possible to notice that the number of undiagnosed cases is much higher than 536 the diagnosed cases. This reflects the number of asymptomatic cases and the 537 lack of tests for mild cases. In the worst scenario, which means ending the 538 isolation, the total infected number may go above 5 million. The recovered 539 rate is directly proportional to the infected rate, as one needs to be infected 540 to either die or become resistant to the disease. If the infected rate is high, 541 so is the recovered rate, e.g., the scenarios of keeping or ending isolation. A 542 high recovered rate also helps in mitigating the epidemic propagation (natural 543 immunization). However, increasing isolation decreases the spread much 544 faster than natural immunization, with a considerably smaller death toll. It 545 is also possible to observe the differences at the start of effective recovering, 546 i.e., when the recovered rate surpasses the infected rates, this is due to the 547 early increase in isolation levels. beds, which is around three times higher than the entire country's capacity.The other alternative, which is the increase of isolation levels (lockdown), 641 appears to be the only alternative to stop the healthcare system from entering Although the proposed method includes various demographic information 652 for the network construction, and an improved SIR approach to COVID-653 19, it still does not cover all factors that impact the epidemic propagation.As future works, more information can be included, such as an increased ",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-12,11

9f25eb839c4053df9684e2b1b86aa25c2004304f,Prognostic factors for severity and mortality in patients infected with COVID-19: A systematic review,"Introduction COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [1] . It was first identified in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019 [2] ; five months later, more than six million cases had been identified across 215 countries [3] . On March 11, 2020, WHO characterised the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic [1] . While the majority of cases present with mild symptoms, a minority progress to acute respiratory illness and hypoxia requiring hospitalization, and a subset develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or have fatal outcomes [4] . The case fatality rate reported across countries, settings and age groups is highly variable, ranging from about 0.5% to 10% [5] . In hospitalised patients it has been reported to be higher than 20% [6] .Prognostic factors (stand-alone or combined in risk assessment models) may guide the stratification of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease based on their risk of severe disease or death. This risk stratification may subsequently guide optimised management and resource utilisation strategies in the care of these patients.Although multiple prognostic factors have been proposed and some have been accepted as ""established"" by the scientific community (i.e age), the predictive value of most of these potential prognostic factors has not been robustly evaluated and remains uncertain. As pointed out by Wynants et.al: ""unreliable predictors could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions"" [7] . For example, aggressive and risky interventions might be attempted if the risk of poor outcomes are inaccurately defined as high based on unreliable predictors.Using innovative and agile processes supported by advanced evidence synthesis tools and collaborative efforts across several international research groups, this systematic review aims to provide a rigorous summary of the evidence available on prognostic factors that may be used in decision-making related to the care of patients infected with COVID-19.We published [8] and registered the protocol for this systematic review with PROSPERO (CRD42020178802).We conducted highly sensitive searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Embase. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database until April 28, 2020. No study design, publication status or language restriction were applied.Detailed strategies for each database are reported in the S1 Text.In order to identify articles that might have been missed in the electronic searches, we reviewed the reference list of each included study and performed cross citation in Google Scholar using each included study as the index reference.Four reviewers working independently and in duplicate, performed study selection, including screening of titles and abstracts and of potentially eligible full-text articles. Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion.We included studies examining individual prognostic factors or risk assessment models based on the typologies of prognosis proposed by Iorio and colleagues [9] and the PROGnosis RESearch Strategy (PROGRESS) Group framework [10] without applying any restrictions based on analytical methods (i.e performing multivariable analysis).Specifically, we included studies that evaluated patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease regardless of the healthcare setting (i.e ambulatory or inpatients) and of baseline disease severity. We investigated all candidate prognostic factors reported by individual studies and compared patients exposed (the factor was present) with patients unexposed (the factor was absent) to each one of those factors.We considered studies that assessed mortality or severe COVID-19 disease as outcomes and accepted the author's definitions of the latter. When severe COVID-19 disease was reported as a multi-categorical scale, we used the most severe category. Additionally, when severe COVID-19 disease was not reported as an outcome, we considered ICU requirement, invasive mechanical ventilation (IVM) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as surrogate outcomes.For each eligible study, five pairs of reviewers, independently, abstracted the following information on study characteristics (year of publication, country, medical center and time period in which the study was conducted); population characteristics (sample size, context in which the study was conducted and other population characteristics); description of prognostic factors and outcomes and their definitions; and study results (measures of association or crude event rates for every candidate prognostic factor and outcome reported).Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias of individual included studies independently and in duplicate. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for prognostic factor studies [11] which considers population characteristics, attrition, prognostic factor and outcome measurement and potential residual confounding. For ""study confounding summary"" and ""statistical analysis and presentation domains"", in order to assess adequacy of the multivariable models, we considered appropriate model adjustment as based on inclusion of age, one comorbidity (e.g diabetes) and one parameter of disease severity (e.g. respiratory rate) at minimum.We presented the results of individual prognostic factors in both tabular and narrative formats. We standardized the units of measurement for each prognostic factor, unifying the direction of the predictors and adjusting the weights of the studies, and calculated crude effect estimates when not provided [12] . When possible, we meta-analysed all prognostic factors whose association with the selected outcomes of interest was explored and were reported by more than one study. We used the generic inverse variance-based method to produce an overall measure of association and random-effect models based on the DerSimonian-Laird method provided by the metafor package for R software [13] .For every candidate prognostic factor, we presented the measure of association as odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). In studies that reported the measure of association as a hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR), we converted them to ORs using the baseline risk (death rate or incidence of severe COVID-19 out of the total sample) reported in the studies [14, 15] . For dichotomous variables, we used the crude event rate to calculate ORs when no measures of association were provided. We excluded information on continuous variables for which no measures of association were available. We also calculated absolute risk differences (RDs) that can be attributed to every individual candidate prognostic factor by applying the ORs to estimated baseline risks (see below ""Baseline risks""). When the same candidate prognostic factor was assessed in alternative ways (e.g. dichotomic and continuous) we used the one for which we found better certainty of evidence.For every explored candidate variable, we performed sensitivity analysis excluding high risk of bias studies and studies that did not report adjusted estimates. In cases where the effect estimates provided by the primary analysis and the sensitivity analysis significantly differed, we either presented the moderate/low risk of bias-adjusted estimates or the primary analysis estimates but rated down certainty of the evidence because for risk of bias (see below). In addition, when we observed inconsistent results for disease severity outcome, we performed subgroup analyses accounting for outcome definition (i.e severity scale vs. IVM vs. ARDS) as a potential source of heterogeneity.depending on the grading of the individual domains [16] . See S1 Text for a detailed description of the certainty of the evidence assessment.To define which candidate variables provide valuable prognostic information we adopted a minimally contextualized approach [17] . To this end, we arbitrarily set thresholds to define important incremental increase in the risk of our outcomes. In setting those thresholds we aimed to define the minimal incremental increase in the risk of mortality or severe COVID-19 disease that could be interpreted as valuable prognostic information without considering the potential consequences of using that information in healthcare decision-making. These thresholds represent the line that separates a risk increase that is trivial from a small but important risk increase. We set those thresholds in 0.5% increase in mortality and 1% increase insevere COVID-19 disease. We performed a sensitivity analysis in which we adopted a purely noncontextualized approach [17] to assess mortality outcome. In doing so we only considered the relative measures of association and used an OR of 1 as the threshold for minimal important risk increment.To define baseline risks we selected clinical scenarios based in the severity categories proposed by WHO [18] . To assess the prognostic value on mortality, we used the clinical scenario of a patient infected with COVID-19 with severe but not critical disease (i.e patients with respiratory failure but not invasive mechanical ventilation and/or hemodynamic support requirement). We identified one study informing prognosis in this specific subgroup with a mortality risk of 9% [19] . However, as we identified significant variability in mortality risks reported for similar clinical scenarios (i.e in the RECOVERY trial [20] mortality risk in hospitalized patients assigned to the control arm, with no baseline oxygen requirement was 14%), we performed a sensitivity analysis using a baseline risk of 26% as reported by a large cohort of non-ICU inpatients treated in 255 sites across 36 countries [6] .To assess the prognostic value on severe COVID-19 disease, we used the clinical scenario of a patient infected with COVID-19 with non-severe disease. We identified 7 studies informing prognosis in this specific subgroup with a median risk of progression to severe or critical state of 13% [21-27]. We calculated baseline risks (risks in patients not exposed to the prognostic factor) by also considering the prevalence of every prognostic factor and the estimates of association [28] . When prevalence of prognostic factors was not available we used described baseline risks (9% for mortality and 13% for severe COVID-19 disease).An artificial intelligence algorithm deployed in the Coronavirus/COVID-19 topic of the L. OVE platform (https://app.iloveevidence.com/loves/5e6fdb9669c00e4ac072701d) will provide instant notification of articles with a high likelihood of eligibility. These will be screened by paired reviewers iteratively and will conduct data extraction and iterative updates of estimates for selected prognostic factors accordingly. We will consider resubmission to a journal if there is a substantial modification on the measure of association or the certainty of the evidence for a given prognostic factor such that it is clinically significant, at the discretion of the reviewer team. This review is part of a larger project established to produce multiple parallel systematic reviews relevant to COVID-19 [29] . (Fig 1) illustrates the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Our search identified 7631 citations of which we included 569 studies for full text assessment. 207 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria [21, [23] [24] [25] 27, . These 207 studies, with sample sizes from 10 to 8910, enrolled a total of 75607 patients and were conducted in 12 different countries (China, USA, Canada, Spain, France, Turkey, Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, India and Singapore). In 78 (37.7%) of the included studies a multivariable analysis was performed. In the 150 studies in which the severity of included patients was described the mean proportion of patients in each category was: non-severe disease 63.8%, severe disease 22.6%, critical disease 13.6%.limitations in at least one domain or item. Most frequent were retrospective design, which may have introduced classification bias, and lack or inappropriate adjusted analysis. S2 Table  provides detailed judgements for each of the risk of bias domains criteria.We investigated 96 candidate prognostic factors for mortality from 116 studies including 57044 patients. S3 Table provides a summary of findings for all the candidate prognostic factors and S1 Appendix includes the corresponding forest plots.We found high or moderate certainty that the following 35 variables provide valuable prognostic information on mortality outcome ( We investigated 96 candidate prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease from 131 studies including 28538 patients. S3 Table provides a summary of findings for all the candidate prognostic factors and S2 Appendix includes the corresponding forest plots.In addition to identified prognostic factors for mortality, we found high or moderate certainty that the following 14 variables provide valuable prognostic information on severe COVID-19 disease outcome (Table 1) The remaining variables analysed were: asthma, tuberculosis, HIV infection, immunocompromise, autoimmune disease, malnutrition, chronic liver disease, thyroid disease, chronic gastric disease, chest pain, high fever, cough, rhinorrhea, odynophagia, conjunctivitis, sputum production, enlarged lymph nodes, rash, headache, vomits, diarrhea, anemia, low WBC, low neutrophil count, glomerular filtration rate, blood urea, cystatin C, prothrombin time, APTT time, ferritin, cholinesterase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fibrinogen degradation products, globulin, prealbumin, blood glucose, alfa-HBDH, low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, any abnormal radiologic finding, radiological interstitial pattern, ground glass opacity, crazy paving pattern, radiological evidence of enlarged lymph nodes, bilateral radiological compromise, APACHE (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II), qSOFA (quick sepsis related organ failure assessment).For all of these variables we found low or very low certainty evidence both for mortality and severe COVID-19 disease. Hence, it is uncertain if these variables provide prognostic value in the context of COVID-19 infected patients.We performed a sensitivity analysis on mortality outcome using a non-contextualized approach and assuming adjusted estimates as at low risk of being biased (less demanding risk of bias approximation in comparison with the primary analysis) (see methods, risk of bias assessment in S1 Text). The results were similar to the primary analysis. However our certainty increased to moderate or high for some prognostic factors for which we had very low or low certainty: Chest pain, cough, sputum production, anemia, high ferritin, high ALT, increase in blood glucose and high APACHE score.A second sensitivity analysis in which we set a significantly higher baseline mortality risk (26%) for patients with severe but non-critical COVID-19 disease did not show differences with the primary analysis.When we found inconsistent results for severe COVID-19 disease outcome (n = 43), we performed subgroup analyses accounting on outcome definition. Observed heterogeneity could not be explained by this analysis for any of the candidate prognostic factors explored (see S3 Appendix).In this systematic review we evaluated prognostic factors for poor outcome in patients with covid-19 infectious disease. We found 49 variables that provide valuable prognostic information for mortality and/or severe COVID-19 disease. Identified prognostic factors include socio-demographic characteristics (age, male sex and smoking) medical illness and patients history information (comorbidities including chronic respiratory, cardiac and endocrinologic conditions), physical examination findings (respiratory failure related symptoms as well as general clinical condition deterioration), laboratory (multiple biomarkers and alterations in basic laboratory tests) and radiological findings (consolidation pattern and pleural effusion) (Table 1) . Overall the risk of severe COVID-19 disease or death resulted higher in older patients and those with previous medical conditions including COPD and cardiovascular disease as some of the most relevant predictors. Additionally, those patients that presented with clinical signs and symptoms suggesting respiratory failure or laboratory biomarkers showing inflammation or organ damage were also at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease or death. Radiological features did not show good predictive value.Our systematic review has a number of strengths. First, it provides the most comprehensive and trustworthy body of evidence up to date as it includes a significant number of studies not included in prior reviews. Secondly, we followed the GRADE approach to summarize and rate the certainty on the evidence. And thirdly, we presented our results both as relative estimates of association as well as absolute risk differences and used the latter to interpret and analyse our results. We consider that the absolute risk modification that can be attributed to a prognostic factor is a critical piece of information for those aiming to make decisions using prognostic information.Regarding limitations, most of the studies included in this review were not published in peer review journals (only as preprint) at the time we performed the search. We identified most of those studies by cross reference search in google scholar, but it is possible that some may have not been detected by our search strategy. Additionally, given the high publication speed of COVID-19 studies it is probable that new relevant information not included in our review is available at the time our review is published. We aim to address this issue by updating our results in the short term. Although we made efforts to identify data duplication, in many instances it was not clear if studies reported, totally or partially, on the same cohorts of patients hence we assume there is a considerable chance of some degree of data overlap between included publications.Significant variability in study design, study type, patient eligibility criteria, prognostic factor definition was observed, however, given the huge amount of information analysed, it was not feasible to explore subgroup effects accounting for those differences.In analysing our results we implemented a minimally contextualized approach for which we arbitrarily set thresholds to define the minimal important risk difference necessary to assume valuable prognostic information. As the degree of contextualization was minimal, we set very low thresholds (near the point of no effect). We acknowledge that readers might find those thresholds inappropriate, hence we also provided relative estimates of association which can be used with alternative thresholds or analytical approximations (e.g partially contextualized approach). In addition, for some candidate prognostic factors, baseline risk could not be adjusted for prevalence which might have resulted in an overestimation or underestimation of the risk difference estimates. Finally, for risk of bias assessment, we defined a set of requirements for dealing with potential confounders that were not previously validated.We identified multiple systematic reviews addressing prognostic factors in patients with COVID-19 infectious disease [232] [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] . All analysed certain prognostic factors or groups or prognostic factors that we included in the present review, and measured mortality and/or disease severity as outcomes. Most of the reported results are in consonance with our findings with only a few exceptions. Kumar et.al [246] reported diarrhea, productive cough and high ALT as prognostic factors however we found low certainty evidence on those variables in our primary analysis. Wang et.al [249] reported no association between chronic kidney disease and malignancy with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients however we found that both conditions are associated with an increased risk of mortality and severe COVID-19 disease. Other significant differences of our review in relation to these prior reviews include multiple characteristics that were previously not identified as prognostic factors. In contrast to previous reviews, here we provide both relative and absolute estimates of risk and provide our certainty in those estimates.Significant information has been published since our search was finalized. An update of the ISARIC registry [252] including 15194 hospitalised patients discharged or dead, the openSA-FELY registry [253] included 17425445 adults potentially exposed to COVID-19 infection and a Chinese registry [254] that included 44672 patients with COVID-19.These studies identified the following variables as prognostic factors for COVID-19 related mortality: Age, sex (male), obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, COPD, smoking, malignancy, cerebrovascular disease, dementia and chronic kidney disease. All these variables were captured by our analysis as predictors of COVID-19 related mortality or severe COVID-19 disease for which moderate or high certainty evidence exists. In addition, other prognostic factors were identified by these studies: race (not white) [253] and deprivation [253] , two variables we did not explore, and immunocompromise [253] , asthma [253] , autoimmune diseases [253] , and chronic liver disease [252, 253] , four variables for which we found low certainty evidence.Our approach considered two clinical scenarios in which we assumed that the prognostic information of each predictor for each outcome could potentially impact decision-making. In patients presenting with mild disease, predicting the risk of progression to severe status could support decisions on the level of healthcare required and more extensive follow up strategies. In the same way, in patients presenting with severe disease, predicting mortality risk could support the use of certain, more aggressive, therapeutic interventions. Clinicians or decisionmakers can use our results to tailor management strategies for patients with COVID-19. For example, they could select a set of prognostic factors for which there is high certainty in a significant risk incremental increase (e.g Age, gender, comorbidities, respiratory failure and myocardial injury) and use them to define hospitalization rules for patients consulting to the emergency department. However, to what extent accounting for these prognostic factors will improve clinically important outcomes is a question that cannot be addressed with our results. Furthermore using information on multiple individual prognostic factors for outcome prediction is challenging. Multivariable models provide a solution to this limitation, however, considering the high demand for accurate risk prediction models for patients with COVID-19 [7] , our work can also provide solid grounds for development of these prognostic tools.We have identified a set of variables that provide valuable prognostic information in patients with COVID-19 infectious disease. Clinicians and policy makers can use our results to tailor management strategies for patients with this condition while researchers can utilise our findings to develop multivariable prognostic models that could eventually facilitate decision-making and improve patient important outcomes.

afb7addeafe01bf120c25cae40a9fecbcb157bd0,ELIPSE-COL: A novel ELISA test based on rational envisioned synthetic peptides for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Colombia,"The life-threatening respiratory illness called COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and impacted the public health on a global scale with no precedence in the 21st century (1, 2) . The COVID-19 disease caused almost 100.000 cases and 5.000 deaths in China, however, after global dissemination and ten months of the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 infection has cost over one million of life lost and near 35 million cases (3) . The first case of COVID-19 in Colombia was reported on March 6th and to October near 900.000 cases and 25.000 deaths have been reported (4) .The genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 is encoded in a single, positive-stranded RNA (ssRNA[+]), with near 30.000 nucleotides long. The first of the nine open reading frames (ORF) composing the SARS-CoV-2 genome is subdivided in ORF1a and ORF1b by ribosomal frameshifting and encodes two polyproteins which are processed into non-structural proteins involved in subgenomic/genome length RNA synthesis and virus replication. In the subgenomic region, the structural proteins, Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) are encoded in subgenomic mRNA transcripts within ORFs 2, 4, 5, and 9, respectively (5) . The Structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been exploited as an ideal antigen from different applications including, IgG or IgM chromatographic rapid test (6) , ELISA test (7) and to produce polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in animal models (8) . Most of the reported applications use recombinant DNA approaches, however, synthetic peptide technologies are also available as desirable ligands in the development of new antibody detection tests.Short peptides became important reagents in epitope mapping since the technology to synthesize large numbers of peptides on solid support was developed in the 1980s (9, 10) . Peptides can be synthesized in large quantities with very high purity and without recombinant cellular expression systems, and those who specifically bind to target antibodies are valuable ligands useful in serological assays (10, 11) . Relative chemical stability of short peptides and the relative ease with which they can be synthesized and manipulated (12, 13) .According to the epidemiological surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia, the epidemic peak could have occurred between August and September 2020, and at this moment timely case detection, strategies for the prevention of new infections, and the evaluation of the true impact of the COVID-19 disease in Colombia are needed. Taking all this into consideration, this study aimed to develop an ""in-house"" ELISA test using rational designed synthetic peptides as an antigen for the detection of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera from humans being infected with SARS-CoV-2. The achieved test is ELIPSE-COL, a valuable tool for the study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Colombia.Worldwide and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were retrieved from GISAID and NCBI databases (https://www.gisaid.org/, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/). Substitution matrices of nucleotides and amino acids of structural proteins were generated from a multiple sequence alignment with the SARS-CoV-2 genomes using the Muscle Algorithm (14) in MEGA X (15) . In silico analyses were performed to identify the presence of LB epitopes, including the presence of proteasome cleavage sequence sites, HLA-I and HLA-II different length binding epitope sequences regarding endosomal and phagosome-lysosome protease cleavage sites in each ORF coded sequence using LBtope (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/lbtope/), ABCpred main page http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/abcpred/ and BEpiPred-2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/) bearing a threshold: 0,5. Aminoacid sequences containing antigenic regions being exposed in a non-conformational configuration were selected for peptide design.Optimization of peptide designs was performed using the peptide analyzing tool of ThermoFisher (https://www.thermofisher.com/co/en/home/life-science/proteinbiology/peptides-proteins/custom-peptide-synthesis-services/peptide-analyzing-tool.html) to calculate the peptide physical-chemical properties, including the charge-pH map, isoelectric point (pI), hydrophobicity, and mass and predict the ease of peptide synthesis and purification.The peptides designed were synthesized from two sources: the first one was a commercial ThermoFisher platform Peptide Synthesis Services, and the second one was produced in collaboration of two research groups (National Health Insitute of Colombia and National University of Colombia). Therefore, the selected peptides were synthesized manually using a solid-phase synthesis by 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy. Solvents and soluble reagents were removed by filtration. Washings between deprotection, couplings, and subsequent deprotection steps were carried-out with N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) (5 x 1min), dichloromethane (DCM) (4 x 1min), Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (2 x 1min) and DCM (2 x 1min) using 1.5 mL of solvent/50mg of resin each time. The Fmoc group was removed from the resin by two treatments of 15 min with piperidine-DMF (25:75 v/v). Couplings were performed at 20°C and monitored using standard Kaiser tests for solid-phase synthesis. after Fmoc removal of the commercially available Rink amide resin (50 mg, 0.46 mmol/g), a first Fmoc-amino-acid (0.115mmol, 5.0 equiv.) was added with 1-hydroxy benzotriazole (HOBt) (18.2 mg, 0.115 mmol; 5.0 equiv.) and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (23.7 mg; 5.0 equiv.) as coupling reagents dissolved in DMF/DCM (7:3, v/v) and the coupling reaction was stirred for 2 hours. Next, the Fmoc group was removed, and a second Fmoc-amino-acid was incorporated in the resin using the same conditions. The Fmoc removal and the coupling reactions of the rest of the Fmoc-amino-acids were carried out under the same conditions using 5 equiv./coupling. Finally, monomer peptide was Fmoc deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid-water-triisopropylsilane (TFA/H2O/TIS) (95.0:2.5:2.5) for 6 hours followed by filtration and precipitation with cold diethyl ether (Et2O). Crude products were then triturated 3 times with cold Et2O, dissolved in the system water-acetonitrile (H2O:CH3CN) (9:1 v/v), and then lyophilized (9) . Protocols adapted from published data were also used (16) .Polystyrene 96-flat bottom plates (Inmulon IB) were immobilized overnight with a ""Pool"" of 7 proteins peptides: 2 of Spike protein peptides, 3 Nucleocapsid proteins peptides from different antigenic regions, 1 Membrane protein-peptide, and 1 Envelope protein-peptide all of them derived from antigenic regions of SARS-CoV-2. The ""Pool"" of proteins peptides (antigen) was adsorbed to the polystyrene plates in concentrations ranging from 5 µg/ mL to 40 ug/ mL in a carbonate/bicarbonate buffer at a pH of 9.6 at 4 o C. Followed three washes with PBS using a Well Washing 4MK2 machine (Thermo Scientific).Non-specific binding was blocked with a solution of 1-5% of skimmed-milk in 0,15M (phosphate-buffered solution) PBS-0.05% (v/v) tween-20. Followed three washes with PBS using a Well Washing 4MK2 machine (Thermo Scientific).Different dilutions from 1:25 to 1:200 of human sera samples were poured onto peptide adsorbed-ELISA plate wells and incubated for 3 hours at 37 o C. Followed three washes with PBS using a Well Washing 4MK2 machine (Thermo Scientific). Then a goat alkaline phosphatase anti-human-Ig-conjugate was poured at 1:500 of dilution on PBS-Tween-20 and incubated for one hour at 37 o C to bind specific human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. After performing standard washings, the test was developed with a 1 mg/mL pnitrophenylphosphate solution in 0,1M diethanolamine, pH 9.8 to reveal those antibodies specifically binding to designed virus epitopes by a yellow color appearance which was detected on a microplate reader (Multiscan EX®, ThermoFisher scientific,) at 405 nm. When necessary enzyme activity was stopped by adding a 3N NaOH solution before absorbance reading.The cut-off value was determined taking into account the absorbance value that differentiated between positive and negative samples. This value was calculated by adding two standard deviations to the mean value of the negative samples, which offers 95% reliability. (17, 18) .The coefficient of variation (CV) was obtained by intra-plate repeatability and inter-plate repeatability. To evaluate intra-plate repeatability, four replicates of 24 samples were tested. Inter-plate repeatability was evaluated by using the same samples in four different plates. CV was calculated as CV = (standard deviation/mean) × 100% Agreement within CIEP and peptide ELISA data was obtained by analysis of the same serum (19).The average value of the absorbance values (three absorbance values obtained per sample) was calculated for both positive and negative samples. As well as the dispersion means of the mean absorbance values (Standard Deviation). A comparison of mean ranges between the groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test as required. All statistical tests were performed with a 5% level of significance. Graphs were constructed in GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.A representative antigenic peptides were pooled and used as the antigen for ELIPSE-COL and following named ""Pool"". Such selective mix antigenic peptide representative for SARS-CoV-2 was achieved by combining the most representative synthesized peptide epitopes containing antigenic regions of the structural proteins: ThermoFisher platform Peptide Synthesis Services (1 antigenic region of the Spike protein, 2 antigenic regions of the nucleocapsid protein) and those designed by the research groups, including antigenic regions correspond to a region of the Spike protein, 1 region of the nucleocapsid protein, 1 region of the envelope protein, and 1 region of the membrane protein.After the standardization process, it was found that the optimal test conditions corresponded to 25 µg/ml of the peptide pool, serum dilution of 1:25 with incubation of 3 hours, and dilution of 1: 500 of the peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Fig. 1) .The coefficient of variation of the test in intra-plate repeatability and inter-plate repeatability experiments had a dispersion from 5.4% to 19.25%, with an average variation of 13%. It has been reported that the CV for this parameter should not exceed 20%, being optimal those below 5% and 10% respectively.The ELIPSE-COL test based in synthetic peptides shows a differential serological reaction to the COVID-19 positives and negatives sera. The variation in the amplitude of the standard deviation bars in the group of sera from positive patients (with COVID-19) (Fig. 2) can be attributed to the inclusion of sera from convalescent patients (Hospitalized) for which values of absorbance up to 1.7 were registered, unlike the values observed in the group of sera from patients without COVID-19. Statistically significant values were found between the median absorbances of sera from patients with COVID-19 versus sera from patients without COVID-19.The absorbance cut-off value was estimated at 0.278 and it was applied to differentiate between positive and negative samples. Diagnostic classification of the study groups for the ELIPSE-COL test is shown in table 1, 31/34 positive sera, and 62/68 negative sera were properly classified by the ""in-house"" test.The diagnostic classification by positive/negative groups obtained for the test was used to calculate the parameters of diagnostic accuracy and operational performance of the ELIPSE-COL immunodiagnostic test, which showed the following values for each of the indicators ( Table 2) :The ""pool"" of synthetic peptides were designed based on the genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus) circulating in Colombia integrate the most important antigenic regions of the structural proteins of the coronavirus, which is a guarantee to detect antibodies targeted against different parts of the virus, which favors detection thus, non-synonymous substitutions occur in the virus genome. In fact, in the design of the peptides, it was taken into account that 12 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulate in Colombia, which present changes in the sequences concerning the coronavirus initially characterized in Wuhan (27) .One of the most studied amino acid changes in SARS-CoV-2 is the substitution of aspartic acid for glycine at position 614 of the S1 subunit of the Spike protein (28) and it is known that this substitution interrupts an antigenic region in this protein (29) . Given the above, if this were to happen at one point in time and which could occur, it would not drastically affect the performance of the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies due to the presence in the peptide pool of the other proteins that comprise it and that were developed conserving 2 different peptides of the Spike protein, 3 different peptides of the Nucelocapsid, 1 peptide of the Envelope and 1 peptide of the Membrane that is also antigenic and are used in ELIPSE-COL developed in the present study Several of the immunoassays developed for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies tend to focus exclusively on the Spike protein and particularly on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the protein as an antigen to detect neutralizing antibodies given the SARS-COV-2 pathway via ACE2 receptor (30, 31) . However, this is beyond the scope of an ELISA test and the presence of this type of antibody must be verified with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (7, 32) , therefore, this guidance may limit the performance of an ELISA test that is designed to detect whether the person is or has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, some studies have been suggested that epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be correlated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients (33, 34) or with the disease severity (35) .One of the disadvantages of using peptides is their non-renewable after synthesis, unlike recombinant antigens that can be produced in cell lines at different times. However, As in the case of this study, the production of peptides can be obtained individually at a scale of 100 milligrams, and in the immunodiagnostic test developed (ELIPSE-Col) only 6 micrograms of the ""peptide pool"" are used per test. Given the above, a production of 100 milligrams with an approximate time of eight days allows the testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 16,600 people, which is not a critical disadvantage given its scale of production obtained in the study. Furthermore, if a substitution in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence were to occur, the immunodiagnostic test developed with them could be adaptable in a week and this would have a positive impact on preserving the performance and functionality of ELIPSE-Col. An advantage of synthetic peptides could be to produce them to same or bigger scale to describe before at the time the SARS-CoV-2 change.As far as the scientific literature allows, immunodiagnostic tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using synthetic peptides as performed. Meng and co-workers used a ""pool"" of peptides from the Spike protein to detect immunodominant regions of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (33) and the ELIPSE-COL used a ""Pool"" of peptides from different regions of SARS-CoV-2 but with the purpose of detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient serum.The use of peptides for immunodiagnosis in the case of SARS and MERS is known when Woo, et. al., in 2005 developed an ELISA test to detect anti-SARS-CoV IgG and IgM antibodies using peptide pool as antigen independently of the Spike and Nuclocapsid proteins with sensitivities of 74.7% and 94.75%, respectively (38) . The presence of both targets (Spike and Nucleocapsid) and other structural peptides of SARS-CoV-2 in the ELIPSE-Col ""Pool"" favor its performance with a sensitivity of 91%.In the current SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic, various immunodetection tests for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM have been suggested. In the systematic review carried out by Lisboa-Bastos and co-workers compared nine ELISA studies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, they report that the sensitivity of the ELISA on average was 84.3% with a confidence interval (CI 95%) between 75.6% and 90.9% (6) . The ELIPSE-Col test has a sensitivity of 91%, which places it in the upper limit to that reported in the systematic review. In this same review, the average specificity was 97.6%, ranging between 93.2% and 99.4%, values higher than the 91% found in the present study, but which do not prevent its use in immunodiagnosis, considering the inclusion of negative sera from patients from endemic areas for arboviruses and other circulating coronaviruses in Colombia.",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-16,11

Introduction 1 To date, as there is no world-wide accepted vaccine that can provide full immunity to the human body 2 against COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies are the realistic and eective solutions to 3 control second wave of the pandemic. However, around 40 dierent coronavirus vaccines are experiencing 4 critical clinical trials and nine already in the nal stage of testing on thousands of people. Importantly, a 5 leading vaccine candidate developed by the University of Oxford is already in an advanced stage of testing and 6 it has been found in trials that it can trigger an immune response [1] . Generally, an eective vaccine would 7 take years, if not decades, to develop. As research in this eld is happening at a breakneck speed, scientists 8 believe that an eective vaccine is likely to become widely available by mid-2021. Lack of transparency 9 could be a vital issue in upcoming days and a false sense of security could evolve among general people if 10 the vaccine doesn't work eectively. 11 Mathematical models can always provide considerable insights of the transmission dynamics and complex-12 ities of any infectious diseases, which eventually help government ocials design overall epidemic planning. 13 Importantly, mathematical analysis always plays a notable role in making vital public health decisions, 14 resource allocation and implementation of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical inter- 15 ventions. From the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, mathematicians and researchers are working 16 relentlessly and have already done tremendous contributions in limiting the spread of the coronavirus in 17 dierent parts of the world [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . In an early contribution, Ferguson et al. [2] showed the impact of 18 dierent non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies on COVID-19 mortality by developing an agent-based 19 model. In another study, Ngonghala et al. showed that eective and comprehensive usage of face coverings 20 can signicantly limit the spread of the virus and reduce the COVID-induced mortality in dierent states of 21 the USA in general in the absence of community lockdown measures and stringent social distancing practice. 22 On the other hand, Nabi [5] projected the future dynamics of COVID-19 for various COVID-19 hotspots by 23 proposing a compartmental mathematical model and concluded that early relaxation of lockdown measures 24 and social distancing could bring a second wave in no time. As a matter of reality, inhabitants in several 25 countries compelled to violate containment measures due to prolonged lockdown measures and severe eco-26 nomic recession [4] . Netherlands having one of the best health care systems in the world, is grappling with 27 continuous spikes in daily cases due to aversion to masks. 28 In this study, in the absence of a safe, eective and world-wide approved vaccine, a new compartmental 29 mathematical COVID-19 model has been designed incorporating all possible non-pharmaceutical intervention 30 strategies such as wearing face coverings, social distancing, home or self-quarantine and self or institutional 31 isolation. In addition, the impacts of dierent interventions scenarios have been analysed rigorously. The 32 aim of this work is to project the future dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in ve countries namely Argentina, be described by the following system of nonlinear ordinary dierential equations.where the forces of infection are dened belowThe parameters are described in Table 1 . 63 We set x = (S, E 1 , E 2 , I, A, Q, L, R, D) the vector of state variable, Let f : R 9 → R 9 the the right hand side 64 of system (1) , which is a continuously dierentiable function on R 9 .

In this context, we claim the following result. 101 Theorem 3. if R c < 1, then the manifold, W, of disease-free equilibrium points of the model (1) is GAS in 102 D.In the absence of use of face coverings, i.e. m = 0, R c converges to the basic reproduction number, R 0 . Now, we will study the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium whenever the basic reproduction number is less than one (R c < 1). For this, we use the following Lyapunov functionWe choose a i , i = 1, 2, ..., 6, such that coecients of E 1 , I, A, Q, and L become zero.

616d423c0d278f38fc053086d9551a082e0da3eb,Background immunity: How important is it for SARS-CoV-2?,"Dear Editor, While waiting for a safe and effective vaccine against Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), much has been speculated about the relationship between pre-existing immunity and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In line with this concern, here we discuss the importance and potential implications of background immunity, specifically the hygiene hypothesis, innate immunity training and cross-immunity, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and/or severity of COVID-19.Briefly, the hygiene hypothesis suggests that children raised in poor hygiene conditions, with frequent exposure to environmental antigens and targets of continuous infections (mainly by helminths), would be less susceptible to diseases resulting from immunity imbalance, such as allergic and autoimmune diseases. 1 Since the clinical course of COVID-19 seems to be somehow related to an imbalance of the immune response, it would be conceivable that hygiene (within the above perspective), could influence the severity of SARS-CoV-2infections. In addition, massive exposure to numerous antigens during childhood could contribute to the development of immunity, especially proinflammatory responses, which would be useful in a nonspecific control of various infectious agents, including SARS-CoV-2. This idea overlaps that of innate immunity training, discussed later.Although the relationship between the hygiene hypothesis and protection against COVID-19 seems theoretically plausible, this association has not yet been clearly demonstrated. A preprint study performed with economic and socio-demographic determinants found weak evidence for the hygiene hypothesis as a protection factor for COVID-19. 2 On the other hand, an ecological study conducted with all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil until May 6, 2020, reported a positive association between the incidence rate of COVID-19 and the Social Vulnerability Index, which includes deficiency in water supply, sewage, and garbage collection. 3 Innate immunity training, which corresponds to long-term epigenetic changes in innate immune cells after exposure to infectionrelated antigens, such as those delivered by live vaccines (e.g., Bacillus Calmette-Guérin [BCG] and measles vaccines), has also been considered a potential tool against SARS-CoV-2, at least until effective and specific vaccines are available. These epigenetic changes result in an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, which are not antigen-specific and, thus, may contribute to protection against heterologous infections. 4 Although the role of trained immunity in protecting against nonrelated infections has been reported by systematic review 5 and experimental studies 6 , its influence on COVID-19 remains uncertain.Several studies have suggested an association between BCG immunization and reduced transmission, severity, and/or deaths from COVID-19. 7 This association could explain the difference in incidence and severity of COVID-19 among different age groups and among countries with different BCG vaccination policies. Other studies, however, have not found a significant relationship between positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 and BCG vaccination, 8 or between BCG and the outcome of COVID-19. 9 Although apparently conflicting, these findings were obtained from epidemiological-based studies and, thus, perhaps reflect the multifactorial nature of the virus-host relationship, as well as the different variables and analytical methods adopted.To clarify this issue, there are at least 17 clinical trials, at different stages, aiming to assess the protection of BCG immunization against SARS-CoV-2. 10 These studies will certainly provide considerable insights in the near future. Experimental studies carried out with suitable animal models, which could reveal which (and how) the immunological mechanisms stimulated by BCG vaccine could be useful against SARS-CoV-2, would also be timely. Interestingly, in silico analyzes have found some homology between BCG and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which could have possible implications for the induction of memory B-cells. 11 In addition to the above, Grifoni et al. 12 reported a probable background immunity against SARS-CoV-2: TCD4 cells from about 40%-60% individuals not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can crossreact to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Additional studies capable of evaluating the influence of this pre-existing cross-immunity on SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or on the severity of COVID-19 would be interesting. In addition to providing information on population immunity, these studies may generate insights regarding the virus-host interaction, as well as being useful for the development of effective vaccine strategies. Importantly, even if future studies prove that hygienic conditions, innate immunity training and the cross-response of T cells to other human coronaviruses may contribute to the prevention and/or outcome of COVID-19, these issues should be considered beyond the immunological perspective, paying attention to the combined influence of the several aspects of the host, the virus, and the environment. In other words, the importance of these mechanisms, alone or combined, must be considered according to the history and en- ",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-01,11

Although most patients will have mild limited symptoms, 5% of them will develop severe acute distress syndrome and need advanced care [2] . In addition to respiratory involvement, thrombotic complications are well described after infection [3] . A possible explanation include the activation of cytokines, ultimately leading to vascular damage and activation of the coagulation cascade [4] .Conversely, there are few cases of hemolysis described in the medical literature.A seven patient case-series reported both warm and cold anti-erythrocyte antibodies mediated hemolysis in COVID-19 infected patients [5] . Methemoglobinemia, also uncommon, has been described mostly after hydroxychloroquine administration [6] .Only one case-report has shown both hemolysis and methemoglobinemia without any known eliciting drug in a COVID-19 infected patient with a G6PD deficiency [7] . Here we report a second case of both concurrent conditions following infection.A 35-year old man presented to the emergency department with a 5 day history of abdominal pain and nausea, and a 2 day history of subjective fevers and diarrhea. He denied any upper or lower respiratory symptoms. His initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 110/90mmHg, heart rate of 78, temperature of 36 degrees Celsius and respiratory rate of 20. His peripheral oximetry showed a 93% saturation on room air.Physical exam was unremarkable, white any signs of respiratory distress. Initial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f laboratory exams showed a slight elevation in hepatic transaminases, lymphopenia and altered c-reactive protein (Table 1) . A chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates and chest tomography demonstrated multiple ground glass opacities involving 50% of lung fields.Although the patient denied any suspicious COVID-19 contact, a rt-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab was ordered and confirmed the infection. He was then sent to the inpatient unit and started on antibiotics according to hospital protocol (seven and fiveday administration of ceftriaxone and azithromycin respectively).Seven days later, the patient desaturated to 78% on room air, still without any signs of respiratory distress or dyspnea complaints. He was pale (2+/4+), icteric (+/4+) and with brown-colored urine at physical examination. He was then placed on a nonrebreather mask (7 liters/minute) but remained hypoxemic -82%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) while in oxygen therapy showed pH of 7.42, pCO2 of 46mmHg, pO2 of 167mmHg and oxygen saturation of 100%. Methemoglobin ordered the next day was found to be at 10.5%. In addition, blood count revealed new anemia with 8. The patient progressed with worsening anemia and renal dysfunction in the following days but without need for renal replacement therapy. He had a minimum hemoglobin of 5 g/dL and a maximum creatinine of 6.8 g/dL during hospitalization. His peripheral oxygen saturation continued to be lower than observed at the ABG over the next 3 days. He received two packed red blood cells while in UCI. After three days, laboratory evidence of hemolysis diminished and the patient clinically improved. He is sent back to the inpatient unit on the 14th day of hospitalization and is discharged home 7 days later. His pre-discharge medical exams showed a hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL and creatinine of 3.9 g/dL. At the 2 month follow-up in the outpatient clinic, he did not have any complaints and his laboratory panel revealed hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and improved renal function with a creatinine of 1.5 g/dL. A new G6PD dosage ordered after 5 months revealed decreased levels (3.78 U/g/Hb) and therefore confirmed the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency.Methemoglobinemia is an uncommon condition characterized by tissue hypoxia with normal partial pressure of oxygen in the blood [8] . Patients typically present with cyanosis and dyspnea that, in rare cases, progress to coma, shock or severe respiratory failure due to hypoxia [9] . This is caused by the oxidation of hemoglobin's iron to its ferric state, which leads to a failure of oxygen carriage by the hemoglobin. In its acquired form, toxins and medications are the major triggers of the oxidation burst. Because of its pathophysiology, patients with anti-oxidation genetic defects are more prone to this condition [8] .The concurrence of methemoglobinemia and non-immune hemolytic anemia has been well-documented in patients with an inherited G6PD defect and/or the overdose of a known oxidative medication. The proposed mechanism involves the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to both iron oxidation and hemolysis. If G6PD is low, reduced glutathione is rapidly depleted, and even small oxidative insults can cause irreversible damage [10] . Conversely, when G6PD levels are normal, the insult must be high enough to saturate cell oxidation reduction capacity and damage red blood cells. This is commonly observed after an overdose of highly oxidative medications such as dapsone [11] .Oxidative stress damage plays also an important role in infections. For instance, influenza perhaps promotes most lung cell injury through excessive production of ROS derivatives [12] . However, whether infection-related ROS insults are enough to promote both methemoglobin and hemolysis is still unknown. Researchers reported the above co-occurrence after campylobacter enteritis [13] and hepatitis E virus infection [14] . With respect to COVID-19, there is increasing evidence that oxidative stress worsens lung J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f injury during infection: an imbalance of high ROS production and weak anti-oxidation system is thought to explain disease progression and severity in preclinical studies [15] .A recent report described the concurrence of hemolysis and methemoglobinemia in a COVID-19 infected patient with a G6PD deficiency [7] . Here we report a second case of both conditions in a patient with the same inherited defect. Interestingly, G6PD was within normal ranges in the first dosage. A plausible explanation is the effect of reticulocytosis on plasma levels [16] . Importantly, in both reports, no medication trigger was found. Whether the COVID-19 infection alone is responsible for this chain of events remains a challenging question. Our case expands on this topic by presenting the second case of hemolysis and methemoglobinemia co-occurrence in a patient with G6PD deficiency without previous use of a clear eliciting drug.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.DVL collected the data.

The first case of COVID-19 in Latin America was confirmed on 26 February 2020, in the São Paulo metropolis, the most populous city in the Southern hemisphere (~12 million people) (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, 2020). Travel reports and subsequent genetic analyses confirmed that the first detected infection was acquired via importation of the virus from Northern Italy Jesus et al., 2020) .Since then, Brazil has reported the largest number of cases in Latin America (4, 238, 446 reported cases and 129,522 deaths as of 11 September 2020) (Ministério da Saúde do Brasil, 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly within Brazil , often associated with urban centers with social deprivation and has now been detected in the majority of the 27 federal states of Brazil. Using transmission pairs of SARS-CoV-2 reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the mean and standard deviation for the serial interval was estimated to be 2.97 and 3.29 days respectively (Prete et al., 2020) .Social distancing, stay-at-home policies and discontinuation of mass gatherings up to complete lockdowns are important tenets of public health measures to mitigate the explosive growth of COVID-19 (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020) . However, the most effective public health measures include liberal testing, prompt isolation of all test J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f positive persons, contact tracing of all test positive cases and enforced quarantining of all contacts (Hellewell et al., 2020; Salathe et al., 2020) .Here we set out to model the number of infections and deaths depending on the timing and extent of testing and contact tracing in the State of Sao Paulo, the most populous state of Brazil with 44,639,899 inhabitants (Biblioteca Virtual do Estado de São Paulo, 2020).The model is a modified version of the classical SEIR type of models (Massad et al., 2020) and considers that the population is divided into several compartments, vii) We assumed that the population birth rate ) (t Λ is equal to the natural mortality of the population, not taking into account the disease-induced mortality.viii) The fractions E p , I p , A p , H p , and G p of exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic, The model's dynamics is described by the following set of differential equations:The Basic Reproduction Number of system (1) is given by:where:The incidence of infection is given by:The total number of reported cases is obtained by multiplying the number of infected individuals by a notification ratio ) (t K :The total number of COVID-19-related deaths is given by:Finally, the total number of tested individuals is given by:Data on the cumulative number of reported cases and deaths were obtained from Seade (Fundação Sistema Estadual de Análise de Dados do Estado de São Paulo). Data on the number of ICU patients were obtained from SIMI (Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente do Estado de São Paulo). A fitting procedure based on the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least-squares algorithm was used to fit the model's parameters simultaneously to the data on cases, deaths and ICU patients. We used the R package minpack.lm (Elzhov et al., 2016) .We assumed that the potentially infective contact rate, the notification ratio, and the ICU admission rate change every 10 days. (As it will be explained in another paper this simulates the propagation of the disease and compliance with social distancing rules). The parameter values used are shown in Table 1 .Model projections for future dates were obtained by keeping fixed the fitted values of the parameters from the last date observed in the data.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The cost of the strategy was calculated assuming the cost of the test, assumed the price tag of US$48.00 per sample and the cost of the agenst salary, assumed to be US$1,128.00 per month. The total cost of each simulated strategy would depend on the rate and of the total number of testing, as well as the duration of each strategy.We fitted the model's parameters simultaneously to the data of cumulative number of reported cases and deaths (Figures 2(a) and 2(b), respectively), and the number of ICU patients for the state of São Paulo until July 18, 2020. To estimate a 95% probability interval (shaded area in Figure 2 ), we assumed a normal distribution for the contact rate with a standard deviation of 1.5%. The fitted parameters are shown in Table 1 .The results for the strategy that considers testing susceptible and infected The results for the strategy that considers testing infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic) individuals are shown in Figure 4 . The testing strategy efficacies as a function of the total number of tests and corresponding costs in US dollars are shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b) , respectively, for different dates of start.In Figures 3 and 4 , each dot corresponds to a different daily testing rate and the dot size is proportional to the testing rate. Dot sizes and corresponding testing rates can be observed in Figure 5 , in which we observe that higher testing rates and earlier start dates are more efficacious.In Figure 4 (a), dots in the upper part of the graph correspond to higher testing rates. For each date of start, we noticed that dots corresponding to different testing rates are displayed in a concave shape. Thus, depending on the testing rate, similar total number of tests may result in different efficacies. Let us consider the specific case of the testing rates 0.5% and 2.1% per day for the start date of April 1 st (Figure 6 ). We noticed in Figure 4 When only (suspected) infected individuals are tested, the total cost is higher for earlier start dates (Figure 4(b) ), because operational costs are substantionally higher than the costs related to the diagnostic tests. We modelled and simulated a test-trace-and-quarantine strategy to control the Our model has the following limitations. The model assumes a perfect test with 100% sensitiviy and specificity; we also assumed that tracing the contacts of the positive cases would be perfect, which is obviously a practical impossibility. Another important limitation of the model is that it does not consider any delay in the results of the test, an important factor that has been limiting this strategy in many places of the world (Kretzschmar et al., 2020) . Although the current tests have a delay of many days to present the results, many rapid-molecular point of care tests for detecting positive patients to SARS-CoV-2 are in development (Ahmad et al., 2020) , so the delay in test results can be overcome. However, our model does not take into account social inequity in accessing testing Martins-Filho et al., 2020) .Some strategies could be considered to reduce the testing costs like pooling samples for testing (Abid et al., 2020) or concentrating the tests in neighborhood where sewege systems were tested positive (Foladori et al., 2020) .Had the State of São Paulo decided to adopt this strategy on April the 1 st , it would have been possible to reduce the total number of cases in 90% at a cost of 2.25 billion US dollars for the indiscriminate strategy but at a much smaller cost of 125 million US dollars for the selective testing of symptomatic cases and their contacts. We conclude that a selective test, trace and quarantine strategy is the most cost effective strategy that could be applied in situations where social distancing is difficult to implement.Authors contributions.

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) pandemic is a global public health crisis posing numerous increasing health and economic challenges. At the time of this writing, October 2020, the epicenter of the pandemic lies in the Americas. Across continents, the response to the epidemic has varied from country to country [1] . In Argentina, the rst case was diagnosed in March 2020 [3] , and the government declared an enforced COVID-19 lockdown on March 20, 2020 [4] , when there were 158 con rmed cases [5] . The lockdown extended over four months and resulted in slowing the progression of the epidemic in the country, with 903,730 total cases on October 12, 2020 [1, 3] . Conversely, the USA by March 2020 had already faced an exponential increase in laboratory-con rmed cases of COVID-19 and related deaths [6] . This surge led to many states and localities to issue stay-at-home orders, including orders for many nonessential businesses to close [7] . Today, after months of the initial outbreaks the epidemic continues to advance in both countries, placing them among the most affected nations by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Americas [1] .The rst descriptions of the disease established that the infection could cause severe respiratory distress and illness [8, 9] . High-risk population for severe forms included people 60 years and older and those of any age with underlying medical conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease, asthma, heart conditions, etc) [10] [11] [12] . As such, people living with HIV infection (PLWH) are considered to be at greater risk for adverse outcomes due to COVID-19 [13] [14] [15] . Although recent retrospective analysis of hospitalized PLWH with Page 3/13 COVID-19 do not appear to show higher rates of infection or severity among PLWH, the literature is scarce and lacks longitudinal follow up [16] [17] [18] .The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents an unprecedented public health threat, and mitigation strategies such as enforced lockdown and physical distancing combined with anxiety about potential infection, recently dubbed 'coronaphobia,' can have a profound impact on mental health [19] . In Argentina, adherence to restrictions has decreased lately, primarily due to its signi cant nancial impact in a country with a fragile economy where more than 35% of the population are living under the poverty line [20] . In the US, the economy has suffered its most severe contraction since the Great Depression with more than 26 million people led for unemployment and in March 2020. As a result, the US government approved a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill to reactivate the economy. However, uncertainty regarding the eventual impact of the pandemic remains.The long-term consequences of lockdown and economic disruption on mental health among PLWH around the world are unknown. Mental health, social support, and substance use are predictors of HIVrelated health outcomes, including treatment adherence [21] , and having a psychiatric diagnosis has been associated with increased mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [22] . National surveys have described the mental health of the population during pandemics [23, 24] , including the COVID-19 pandemic [25] . However, there is limited information on the use of strategies that could mitigate the impact of the pandemic on PLWH such as resilience coping, social support, and there have been no comparisons between nations affected by the pandemic in the Americas. Thus, this study examines the experiences of PLWH living in Argentina and the USA during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and explores the role of social support and resilient coping on mitigating the pandemic's mental health impact.Data collection for this cross-sectional study of PLWH in Argentina and the US was conducted during the rst six months of mitigation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (April -May 2020 in Argentina and April -September 2020 in the US). Following approval from the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at the study sites, candidates were contacted regarding the study, provided with information on the study, and consented, before being administered or completing an adapted version of the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) [26] COVID-19 survey in English or Spanish. At the Argentinian site, the questionnaire was also adapted to Argentine Spanish prior to administration. Individual study site procedures are described below.Data from adults (>18 years) PLWH receiving HIV care at the participating sites, were collected from collaborative studies located in Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Miami (USA).Argentina: PLWH candidates were identi ed using the Helios Salud database, derived from information obtained as nongovernmental providers of HIV outpatient healthcare services for more than 10,000 PLWH residing mostly in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. Study staff contacted potential candidates via WhatsApp or email and noti ed candidates they could decline participation with no interference to their clinical services. The survey was self-administered and accessed through a web link using the REDCap© (Research Electronic Data Capture) [27] data capture platform.USA: PLWH candidates were identi ed through the Miami Center for HIV Research in Mental Health (CHARM)/Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) patient database and enrolled in the ACTION study (A Comprehensive Translational Initiative on Novel Coronavirus Cohort) which was approved by the University of Miami (UM) IRB prior to study start. Participants resided in Miami, Florida, one of the cities with higher number of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US [28] . The survey was administered by phone by study personnel or self-administered via web link if participants preferred Variables / Measures: The COVID Survey was developed by the MWCCS team to address the experience of individuals living with, or at risk for, HIV infection. The survey included sociodemographics (age, gender, living arrangements), COVID-19 preventive behaviors and disruptions, mental health and psychosocial factors, including depression, perceived stress, loneliness, resilient coping, and social support [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .Psychosocial factors: Depression symptomatology measurements were retrieved from the questions, ""I felt lonely"" and ""I felt depressed"", using responses on a 4-point Likert-type ordinal scale from 1 = Never to 4 = Always [29] .Perceived Stress was assessed using an adapted measure of the Perceived Stress Scale [30] and by the items: the ""Di culties were piling up so high that I could not overcome them?"" and, ""…unable to control the important things in life?"". These items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale 1 = Never to 5 = Very often.Loneliness [29] was measured using a 3-point Likert-type scale from 1 = Hardly Ever to 3 = Often. Items included, ""How often do you feel that you lack companionship?"", ""How often do you feel isolated from others?"", and ""How often do you feel left out?"". The sum of three items was used to calculate this score. Resilient Coping was measured by an adaptation of the Brief Resilient Coping Scale [34] . Items included ""I look for creative ways to alter di cult situations"", ""regardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it"", and ""I believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with di cult situations"". A 5-point Likert scale was used for item responses (1 = Does not describe me at all to 5 = Describes me very well). The sum of four items was used to calculate this score.Social support [33] was measured using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = Very Dissatis ed to 5 = Very Satis ed (""In the last month, how satis ed are you with the social support that you have received from others?"").Descriptive analyses included mean and standard deviation for key study variables. Comparisons by Argentina and USA were performed using t-tests, chi-square tests, or non-parametric alternatives. A threeway interaction of social support resilient coping study site predicting depressive symptoms was tested using the Model 2 PROCESS macro by Hayes for SPSS [35] . To prevent multicollinearity between variables, mean centering was performed on all variables. To establish statistical signi cance, a threshold cutoff value of p< .05 was applied. All statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26.Demographic, COVID-19, Depression, and Psychosocial Variables A total of 1,554 participants were included in the study, n=1,336 from Argentina and n=218 from the US. With regards to COVID-19 preventive behaviors and disruption, there was high social distancing compliance reported but a greater proportion of participants reported practicing social distancing in Argentina (99%) than in the USA (95%) (p<0.001). Rates of participants who quarantined due to having symptoms or an exposure were low. A greater proportion of participants in the USA reported being quarantined due to COVID-19 symptoms (13% versus 2%, respectively), contact with someone with COVID-19 (12% versus 1%), or due uncertainty about whether they were positive for COVID-19 (12% versus 4%). There was a greater proportion of participants who had lost a job or worked less hours due to COVID-19 in Argentina (62%) than in the USA (42%), but a greater proportion of participants in the USA had di culty paying for basic needs (66%) than in Argentina (59%).Participants in the USA reported higher levels of depressive symptoms (M = 13.38 (SD = 5.98) versus M = 12.78 (SD = 4.26)), but higher levels of resilient coping (M = 11.88 (SD = 2.32) versus M = 11.32 (SD = 2.88)) (p<0.05 for depressive symptoms and resilient coping). Details on demographic, COVID-19, mental health, and psychosocial variables is described in Table 1 .A test of three-way interaction of social support resilient coping study site was shown to be signi cant, (b = -0.63, p = .043, 95% CI [-1.24, -0.02]). In Argentina, but not in the US, at high levels of social support and resilient coping, depressive symptoms were the lowest. At low levels of social support and resilient coping, depressive symptoms were the highest. The three-way interaction is plotted in Figure  1 . Full details of the model are in Table 2 .This study evaluated mental health and social support factors among PLWH in Argentina and the USA during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and examined the interaction among depression, social support, and resilient coping. Results reveal that PLWH in the USA had higher levels of depression and resilient coping than those in Argentina. In Argentina, not in the US, social support and resilient coping contributed to lower levels of depression.Directives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, such as national lockdowns and social distancing, pose signi cant wide-ranging effects on population mental health -particularly among vulnerable populations who may be more likely to comply. Previous studies have found that pandemics, including COVID-19, are associated with an increased risk of developing stress, depression, anxiety and loneliness [19, 36, 37] , with up to 31% of people reporting at least one episode of depression related to the COVID-19 pandemic [23] . In addition, having mental health diagnosis is more common among PLWH [19] , and has been associated with increased mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [22] . This study found that PLWH have high levels of depression, loneliness, and low levels of social support, which may negatively impact their overall health and HIV outcomes. Thus, this could shed light on the effect of the regional pandemic among the vulnerable population of PLWH. However, the longer-term consequences on mental health are largely unknown and will need to be evaluated among PLWH and vulnerable populations.Social support, an important predictor of resilient coping, may play an important role in buffering the impact of major life challenges on emotional distress and behavior, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It has been previously reported that among PLWH in Argentina, resilient copying strategies mitigated emotional distress and was hypothesized that strategies to developed resilience skills could facilitate coping with the effect of the coronavirus pandemic in this population [38] . However, this effect was not identi ed among the PLWH in the US population in this study. A better understanding of how coping and social support relate to depression among PLWH in different regions may help to facilitate the implementation of regionally speci c appropriate mental health treatment and support services.The nancial impact of the pandemic can be a risk factor for psychological disorders and poor health outcomes. [39, 40] Yet, Argentine PLWH in this study were able to cope and develop resilience in spite of widespread nancial stress. It is conceivable that the severe economic crisis in Argentina in recent years has stimulated a greater adaptive response to job insecurity and nancial hardship [41] , or that nancial assistance from the government during the pandemic has alleviated the stress due to nancial burden [42] . In contrast, while PLWH in the US received nancial assistance, many had higher levels of stress and depression. A previous study of people quarantined due to Ebola in Senegal found that, although participants received nancial aid, some felt that the amount was inadequate, or it arrived too late; others felt that the help they received did not cover their continuing expenses [43] . As such, vulnerable individuals in the USA who were quarantined and had low household income or income loss may need other support to manage pandemic-related stress and depression in addition to nancial assistance.As hypothesized, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and this effect was strengthened by resilient coping, which differed by region. In Argentina, depressive symptoms were the lowest when having high levels of social support and resilient coping, whereas in the US, though the association between depressive symptoms and social support was present, it was not strengthened by resilient coping. Cultural differences might have in uenced the perception of stress and the bene t of resilience coping skills in each region. Social support and adaptive coping that be regarded differently in different cultural contexts [40] . Previous studies have found that Hispanics tend to have better resilient coping mechanisms than non-Hispanic due to a trajectory of overcoming stress through character traits, cultural values, and larger social support [44] . Exploring cultural factors that promote resilience may enable a better understanding of the coping process, and with it, comprehensive interventions that maximize protective factors among the most vulnerable populations could be developed.The primary limitations of this study include its cross-sectional design, which prevents causal inference. In addition, surveys were both online and self-reported and there is the potential of respondent bias. Finally, participants were primarily drawn from two regions in each country. As the severity of the pandemic and the availability of medical services varies in each country, these ndings may not represent the impact of the pandemic in other settings. Future research is needed to address the longitudinal effect of resilience and long-term outcomes.This early study in the USA and Argentina suggests that resilient coping may act as a protective factor against the array of challenges and adversities associated with SARS-CoV-2 among PLWH. Previous studies have shown that resilience needs to be fostered early to prevent the development of depressive symptoms. [40] As PLWH are a vulnerable population already at higher risk of mental health burden and of severe COVID-19, understanding the drivers of COVID-19 infection in this population is pivotal for developing timely and effective public health interventions and mitigate risks.The psychological impact of a pandemic for PLWH can be extensive and long lasting. Understanding the aspects of support that promote positive coping among vulnerable individuals living with HIV is important to supporting mental health and optimizing health outcomes. Initiatives are needed now to promote health and to empower PLWH with strategies to cope with stress and adversity.Con icts of interest: MLA is currently receiving a grant (#P30AI073961) from the Miami Center for AIDS Research (CFAR).

03ecfd543bd8da5e882df82454cedcb0ac5b7fb8,COVID-19 SOCIAL ISOLATION IN BRAZIL: EFFECTS ON THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ROUTINE OF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN Distanciamento social COVID-19 no Brasil: efeitos sobre a rotina de atividade física de famílias com crianças,"In December, 2019, a series of inexplicable cases of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China. 1 In January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified this epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern 2 , and, in February, as the Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID- 19) , which was named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the coronavirus study group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. 3 In the beginning of April, there were 1,500,830 confirmed cases and 87,706 deaths around the world. 4 On the same date, Brazil accounted for 15,927 confirmed cases and 800 dead by the new coronavirus. 5 With the advance of the transmission in several countries, and the occurrence of community transmission, social containment measures have been proposed around the world, including Brazil. The WHO, in the absence of efficient treatments, recommends isolation of suspected cases and social isolation, essential strategies to contain the exponential growth of cases and the overload in health services. 6 With these measures, the school system has been shut down in several countries, as well as non-essential public and private services; companies have shifted their employees to the home-office system, and millions of families were asked to stay at home.In Brazil, despite the presence of differences regarding social isolation in the five regions of the country, face-to-face school activity was 100% suspended since the second week of March. 7 Therefore, the children are staying at home, starting what apparently will be a long period of movement restriction, without any organized physical activity (PA) or possibility to play outdoors, thus making children more prone to harmful behavior, such as excessive sedentary behaviors. 8 We have never experienced a situation like that, in which millions of children all around the world are confined in their households, and separated from their peers, for a long period of time. Therefore, we do not know how these children and their families will act during this period of time, nor which adaptations will be made, as well as options as possibilities to use the time in confinement. Therefore, identifying the household routines of children in social isolation to understand the behavior of families, understanding how the motor variables change and adjust every day and, afterwards, intervening with specific strategies, are essential actions to minimize the negative effects of a prolonged period of confinement.This study aims at verifying how Brazilian families with children aged less than 13 years face this problematic period, regarding time spent on PA, intellectual activity, games, outdoor activities and screen time.This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study, which is part of an international analysis hosted by Universidade de Lisboa (UL), to understand the behavior of children aged less than 13 years during the period of confinement resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.To assess how families with children aged from zero to 12 years are dealing with the confinement caused by COVID-19, we created a questionnaire based on LimeSurvey, free software to apply online questionnaires that can use databases for data persistence, housed in Faculdade de Motricidade Humana at UL. This questionnaire was elaborated by a committee of experts in the field, and tested in 15 families (pre-test). After adjustments in the presentation of the responses regarding the number of hours of activities performed by children, it was publicized.The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) (Certificate of Ethical Appreciation] 30930120.2.000.5505 n. 0413/2020). In Brazil, the questionnaire was launched online on March 24, and publicized in the social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) and by e-mail, according to the snowball technique. The questionnaire is anonymous, takes five minutes to be filled out and includes four sections:• Family: family composition, number of children and adults who are at home, and how many are practicing their professional activity or working from the household. • Household characteristics: type and characteristics of the house, existence or not of an indoor and an outdoor space for PA. • Household routines: level of concern regarding the COVID-19 situation and way in which family routines are being adjusted (time of PA, screen time, sleep, family activities). • Children's routine: characterization of each child (age, sex, health status) and hours spent on different activities on the previous day.The questionnaires answered by the parents/tutors of all children aged less than 13 years in the same household, during the period of social isolation, from March 25 to April 24, 2020, were included in this study, reaching 1,352 responses. All participants read the information about the investigation and agreed with the conditions by clicking to continue on the first page of the poll. Participants can give up at any time, by not continuing with the questionnaire or not sending the information. After cleaning the database, the responses related to 816 children aged from zero to 12 years (410 boys and 403 girls, and three with no identification) were included here; the answers regarding 536 children (39.6% of the children reported initially) were excluded because of missing or wrong information (for instance, more than 24 hours reported in one day, or no time of sleep reported for children).The children were divided in four age groups: • G1: 0-2 years old (n=187). • G2: 3-5 years old (n=206).• G3: 6-9 years old (n=285).• G4: 10-12 years old (n=138).Descriptive statistics and frequency analysis were used to describe the environment and the routines of the families and children during this period. Five activity categories were analyzed:• Intellectual activity: school activities and online classes. The three first categories (intellectual activity, playful screen time and playing without PA) were included to calculate the general sedentary time, and the two last categories (playing with PA and PA), to calculate the general PA time. Separated two-way ANOVA tests (age group per gender) were performed to investigate how the different activities and routines of children who are confined, and their families, are being organized according to age and sex of the children.Most of the children live in an apartment (56%), and do not have a place dedicated to physical exercises (86.6%), like gym or gymnastics room, in their households. Regarding the outdoors: 27.7% does not have daily access to an outdoor area; 54.4% has an external area of up to 12m 2 ; and 17.9% has access to an area bigger than 12 m 2 . It is worth to mention that 52.9% of the families reported it was not easy to maintain social isolation among the children, and 27.7% reports otherwise.Before isolation, 67.8% of the children practiced PA at least twice a week. Figure 1 shows changes in the family routine regarding the organization of time during social isolation. Most parents pointed to reduction in the levels of PA among their children: 46.1% reports that children are doing much less PA, and 37% says that PA is less frequent than that performed during the school period. Screen time, sleep and family activities increased. Most parents state that screen time increased: 38% reports it is higher than in regular school hours, and 36.9% says it is much higher. There was an increase in the performance of family activities: 52.1% claims to be having more family activities than before isolation, and 19.1% reports that these activities are more frequent (Figure 1 ). The results referring to the effect of age and sex on the time spent by the children in the different groups of activities carried out during the day are demonstrated in Table 1 and Figure 2 . The intellectual activity increases with the age groups ( Figure 2) . We observed there is no difference between genders, but the effect of age is significant (Table 1) , being this activity less frequent in G1 (p<0.001) and p=0.014 between G3 and G4.Considering playful screen time, we observed the effect of age and sex, but there is no interaction between age group and sex (Table 1 ). This playful screen time increases significantly with age (p<0.003), and boys present higher numbers than girls (Figure 2 ).For the category playing without PA, there was a significant difference between age groups, sex and interaction between age and sex ( Table 1) . G2 is the group that is most involved in playing without PA (p<0.001 in comparison to G1 and p=0.002 in relation to G3 and G4). There was a difference between G3 and G4 (p<0.001): G3 plays without PA more than G4 (Figure 2 ). Regarding gender, there is a difference between boys and girls: girls play without PA more than boys ( Figure 2 ). These differences are significant in G1 (p=0.001) and G4 (p=0.001) ( Figure 2 ).As to the category playing with PA, the analysis revealed there is no difference between genders, but significant reduction with age (Table 1) . This expressive reduction occurs between the two youngest and the two oldest groups (significance values higher than 0.001), however, not between G1 and G2 (p=0.681) nor between G3 and G4 (p=0.234) (Figure 2 ).In the PA category, we observed there was little time dedicated to that activity, without differences between age groups and sex (Table 1) .To better understand the relative importance of each category of activities in the day of the children in the different age groups, the time spent in each activity was converted in percentage, considering the total time reported by parents for all categories. The general PA time and general sedentary time were calculated (Figure 3) . Figure 3 shows that the mean percentage of intellectual activity and playful screen time increase between age groups, whereas the opposite tends to occur between the other categories. It is possible to notice that playing without PA is prevalent in the two youngest groups. We also highlight that the mean percentage of the sedentary time is high in all age groups. *post hoc test indicating difference between G1 (0 to 2 years old) and the other groups: G2 (3 to 5 years old), G3 (6 to 9 years old), and G4 (10 to 12 years old) (p<0.001); **post hoc test indicating difference between G2 (3 to 5 years old) and the two oldest groups (6 to 9 years old), and G4 (10 to 12 years old) (p<0.001).By grouping the categories in total PA time and total sedentary time, the results indicate reduction in the percentage of total PA time (F 3,798 =37.228; p<0.001) and increase in total sedentary time (F 3,798 =37.228; p<0.001) with age.This study identified the behavior of Brazilian children aged less than 13 years during the first month of social isolation. Our results suggest that time of PA can be compromised in this situation.The condition of life of these children leads them to more sedentary behaviors than in days with normal school activities, especially while they develop. Our results show much higher numbers of total sedentary time in relation to studies that assessed this time on school days, showing that more than 60% of the time is spent on sedentary activities. 9, 10 Studies point that Brazilian children aged more than three years, regardless of social isolation, have spent around 2.5 hours on screen activity, 11 which is above the recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics (SBP). 12 This contributes with a sedentary behavior, reducing the opportunity for the children to be physically active, and is related with: parental concern about safety, preventing the kids from performing outdoor activities; high demand of activities related to the parents jobs; unfavorable structural conditions in specific neighborhoods, decreasing the changes of a more active lifestyle; great availability of computer games and TV shows, which encourage sedentary activities. 13 Our findings indicate that social isolation led to higher playful screen time, therefore leading to increased sedentary time and reduced total PA time, as reported by the parents.During the school period, the routine of the children is more structured, and can generate healthier behaviors regarding the practice of PA, sleep and diet. 14 A more structured routine provides opportunities both in school and in extracurricular sports activities, so that the children can practice PA and obtain the recommendation for moderate or vigorous PA. The literature suggests reduction in moderate or vigorous PA and increase in sedentary behavior while children grow up. 14, 15 Our results did not demonstrate this unfavorable tendency, probably because the times of PA were very low for all ages. No tendency was found to show that girls are more sedentary than boys, 14, 15 possibly because the children are in social isolation due to the pandemic.Based on the information that some of these children are attending online classes, and, in this sense, there is a variety of strategies adopted by the schools, in the beginning of the isolation period we observed increased screen time not only for studying, but also for leisure purposes, therefore surpassing the daily limits of screen time recommended by the SBP 12 (for children younger than two years, screen exposure should be prevented, without the need for it; from two to five years of age, one hour a day at most, always with supervision; from six to ten years of age, the limit should be from to two hours a day, with supervision; and after the age of 11, from two to three hours a day).Screen time can be very much influenced by the use of social media, which is the only way to keep in touch with family and friends during the isolation period, and it is also related to games or watching TV. The increase in this type of sedentary activity may contribute with weight gain for these children 16 and favor the early onset of chronic diseases. 17 Studies show that children who watch TV for more than three hours a day have 65% more chances of being obsess when compared to shoe who watch less than hour a day. 18 Having a computer, videos or game devices in the bedroom also increases the chances of sedentary behavior among the children. 12, 19 Intellectual activities are the prevalent type of activity reported by the parents after the age of three years. The percentage of these activities in the routine of the children in comparison to the other reported activities increases with age, and in groups of children aged from six to nine, and ten to 12, the children spend four hours a day, in average, on organized intellectual activities or playful screen activities. Such a result was expected, because children aged from six to 12 years attend Elementary School, and often have many school chores to be executed during the confinement period. Besides the school activities, the time spent on activities involving playing without PA was higher than one hours, regardless of the age group.After the age of six, the children present reduced playing time, if compared to those aged less than five. Inversely to intellectual activities, playing activities reduce while children grow up. In this sense, until the age of five, the activities organized in school are based on the field of experience, reinforcing the idea that the child learns through concrete, interactive, playful and integrative activities of several fields of knowledge, 20 which is based on the stages of neuropsychomotor development. 21, 22 From the age of six on, the children experience major changes in development, which reflect on their relationship with themselves, others, and the world. The school organization changes and is based on the progression of knowledge, with the consolidation of the previous learning process and the amplification of language practices and the aesthetic and intercultural experience of the children. 20 The focus on cognitive and social skills is a priority. 23 Even though social isolation is necessary and efficient to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 6 our results suggest that the strategy is harmful for the levels of PA of the children, as demonstrated in previous studies. 24, 25 We verified that the prolonged permanence in the household leads to increasing sedentary behaviors, such as spending too much time sitting or lying down for activities such as playing, watching TV< using mobile devices, besides the reduction of regular PA and involvement in activities that favor the early onset of chronic diseases. 21, 22 Staying at home is a fundamental security step that can limit the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, but it can contribute with anxiety and depression, which, on the other hand, can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and result in a series of chronic health conditions. 25 It is possible that stress factors, such as prolonged confinement, fear of infection, frustration and boredom, inadequate information, lack of personal contact with classmates, friends and teachers, lack of personal space at home and financial losses in the family, may cause more problems and longterm effects on children and adolescents. [26] [27] [28] The parents reported that family activities increased in this period. Confinement in the household can provide opportunities to improve the interaction between parents and children, to involve the children in family activities and to improve their self-sufficiency skills. 24 Children are vulnerable to environmental risks. Their physical and mental health, and their behavior throughout life, are deeply rooted in the early years. 29 Based on these results, there are implications to be considered by the professionals involved in public health, researchers and parents, focusing on the fight against physical inactivity, with the possibility to build preventive strategies against sedentary lifestyles, able to be implemented in the household environment and minimize the impact of this isolation on health.The consequences of this forced lifestyle resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be experienced much later, after the end of isolation; but a better understanding of these effects will be possible if a complete description of this period is carried out. 30 We hope to contribute with the characterization of the routines of the social isolation period and be able to create strategies addressed to the specific motivation of each age group, associated with the strategies of the families, in order to reduce the sedentary time among the children. The study will continue throughout the entire isolation period, offering a complete image of the routines in the families.This study's limitation is the lack of information about the social and economic status of the families and the region of the country where they live. It provides a first approach on the household routines of Brazilian families and their impact on the time of PA of the children who are living in social isolation.

4bbe2ec0865e3a3cb0bd10889a4685b1b1226bbb,molecules In Silico Discovery of Antimicrobial Peptides as an Alternative to Control SARS-CoV-2,"Coronaviridae is an enveloped virus family containing positive single-stranded RNA that includes the human coronaviruses (HCoV), identified as causative agents of a wide array of illnesses, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases [1] [2] [3] . Recently, outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by Betacoronaviruses (βCoV), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV, respectively, emerged and caused outbreaks of severe human respiratory diseases [1] [2] [3] . In December 2019, a novel HCoV, designated as SARS-CoV-2, was first reported as an atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China, called COVID-19 [4, 5] . Because of its person-to-person transmission and the rapidly increasing number of infected patients worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic to promote the implementation of comprehensive strategies for treating and protecting patients [6] .Several clinical trials with agents that demonstrated in vitro preliminary efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing [7] [8] [9] [10] , but no drugs or vaccines are currently available for treatment and prevention of infection caused specifically by this virus [5, [11] [12] [13] [14] . Hence, searching for effective therapeutic treatments for severe illness caused by CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2 [14] , is imperative; and protein-peptide interactions of AMPs against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, showed significant interactions with the Sgp [27, 39, 40] .In this study, we investigated the in silico interaction between AMPs and structural glycoproteins of SASR-CoV-2. In particular, we explored the virus-associated protein-peptides docking by focusing on S glyocoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and a subset of AMPs with particular physicochemical properties. These computational findings are thought to identify new potentially effective molecules with antiviral properties for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, protein-peptides dockings between the host cell receptor ACE2 and AMPs were performed to evaluate the selectivity of the peptides for viral proteins.A total of five AMPs clusters, according to their physicochemical characteristics, including net charge, sequence length, percentage of hydrophobicity, and secondary structure, were initially obtained via the K-Means algorithm with a K = 5 ( Table 1 ). All AMPs included in these clusters showed specific physicochemical characteristics and experimental antiviral activity according to APD3 database [18] . Given their physicochemical properties, AMPs included in the cluster four were selected to perform the peptide-protein interaction in order to determine their accuracy in binding with Sgp of SARS-CoV-2, and the host cell receptor ACE2 (Table 1) . This cluster included a total of 36 antiviral peptides, which showed three types of secondary structures, including, random coil, α-helix, and beta sheet, net charges that ranged between −3 to 6, and hydrophobicity between 45% and 100% (Table 1) .Additionally, for these AMPs no experimental hemolytic effect and no anti-SARS-Cov-2 activity have been previously reported [18] . Most of peptides included in this cluster belong to a group of naturally occurring AMPs in amphibians, followed by bacteria and mammal ( Figure 1A ,B). The phylogenetic analysis showed that the 36 peptides analyzed were clustered into two main clades ( Figure 1C ), and one of them included 15 peptides that belong to amphibian Hylidae family ( Table 2) . AMPs are naturally occurring peptides produced as a first line of defense against pathogenic infections by frogs [41] [42] [43] . Aureins, alyteserins, caerins, citropins, and frenatins are the most abundant AMPs families in frogs of Hylidae family and present high diversity in length and antimicrobial spectras [41, 42] . In particular, caerins, aurein, uperin, and maculatin are families of AMPs that have shown in vitro activity against bacteria, virus, fungal and parasites, in addition to anticancer effects [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . However, their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 have not been previously evaluated. From these 15 peptides (Table 2) , ten belong to caerins family, which are characterized to be α-helix cationic peptides with net charges between +1 and +3, hydrophobicity range 53%-56% and lengths ranging 24-25 residues [44-47] .The structural models of these 15 AMPs (Table 2 ) obtained using the I-TASSER platform, were initially validated using RAMPAGE. A total of four AMPs could be validated, including aurein 1.2, caerin 1.3, caerin 1.5, and uperin 7.1, which showed >98% residues outside the favorable region. Remaining 11 AMPs were then optimized using MODELLER to improve their structure (Table 3 ). The coordinates of the target proteins Sgp protein (6VYB) and host cell receptor ACE2 (1RL4) were obtained with CB-DOCK, as shown in Figure 2 [50] . In this study, we investigated the interactions between AMPs and target proteins SARS-CoV-2 Sgp protein and host cell receptor ACE2. We studied the inhibitory mechanism of a set of AMPs with particular physicochemical characteristics, through peptide-target protein interactions to determine their accuracy in binding with Sgp protein of SARS-CoV-2 and their low affinity for host cell protein ACE2. The binding energies (∆G) for interactions between each peptide and target proteins are summarized in Table 4 for Sgp and receptor ACE2, respectively. All peptides here evaluated interacted with Sgp (Table 4 ).In particular for Sgp, the best interactions were observed for caerin 1.6 and caerin 1.10, with a ∆G of −7.5 kcal/mol and −7.7 kcal/mol respectively (Table 4 ). For caerin 1.6 the residues VAL17, VAL18, and LYS24 interacted mainly with the residues TYR756, ARG995, and THR998 from viral Sgp. Meanwhile, VAL5, PRO19, GLU23, and LEU25 residues from caerin 1.10 interacted with HIS49, THR51, ASN969, and ARG995 residues of Sgp. The ARG995 was the common residue of Sgp for binding of caerins. In Figure 3 you can see how the SARS-CoV-HR2P control peptides ( Figure 3A ) and EK1 ( Figure 3B ) in the binding site present a folding on themselves, which is not observed in the 1.6 ( Figure 3C ) and 1.10 ( Figure 3D ) falls. This is because in the control peptides more intramolecular interactions are generated than caerins.The main type of interaction of the peptides presented in Table 5 was the formation of hydrogen bridges with Sgp, followed by hydrophobic bonds and finally electrostatic interactions. Table 5 shows a low binding affinity between control peptides and Sgp. On the contrary, caerin 1.6 and 1.10 present better affinity with Sgp, among these caerin 1.10 stands out for with a binding energy of −7.7 kcal/mol. In particular, VAL17 and VAL18 of caerin 1.6, and VAL5 and GLY7 of caerin 1.10 had significant binding with ARG995 in A, B and C chains of Sgp through hydrogen bonds ( Figure 4 ). These peptides blocked in particular the S2 subunit, which together with S1 subunit play an essential role in viral fusion, binding and entry into the cell host due to the cleavage of furin proteases [32, 51, 52] . In fact, the S1/S2 cleavage site contains several arginine residues which indicates high cleavability [53] . These caerins had a low affinity with ACE2 of −5.4 kcal/mol and −5.2 kcal/mol respectively. Regarding the cell host receptor ACE2, Maculatin 1.3 and Uperin 7.1 showed the best interactions with this target protein, with ∆G of −6.4 and −7.1 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 4) .Molecules 2020, 25, x 9 of 21 and cell host receptor ACE2 by AMPs, and the controlling of viral infection by interrupting the viral fusion, cell entry, and viral replication into human cells [3, 32, 34, 52] . Regarding the interaction of control peptides and caerins with ACE2 protein, Figure 5 presents a folding over itself of the control peptides ( Figure 5A ,B), this may be attributed to the formation of more intramolecular interactions with respect to caerins. Also, the presence of negatively charged amino acids in the binding site could cause the formation of intramolecular interactions since the control peptides present a net negative charge. Table 6 compares the binding energy and interactions between peptides with the ACE2 protein. Increased formation of hydrogen bridges is observed, followed by hydrophobic bonds and electrostatic interactions. With respect to the previous, the caerin 1.10 presented increased formation of hydrophobic bonds than hydrogen bonds. The main ACE2 protein residues that interact with the peptides are ARG482 (forming saline bridges with the glutamic acid or glutamine residues of the peptides), ASP494, TRP163, LYS174, and TYR613. From the interaction of arginine residues from the Sgp with residues of caerin 1.6 and caerin 1.10, a probable relationship could be inferred between the blocking of interaction between the Sgp and cell host receptor ACE2 by AMPs, and the controlling of viral infection by interrupting the viral fusion, cell entry, and viral replication into human cells [3, 32, 34, 52] .Regarding the interaction of control peptides and caerins with ACE2 protein, Figure 5 presents a folding over itself of the control peptides ( Figure 5A ,B), this may be attributed to the formation of more intramolecular interactions with respect to caerins. Also, the presence of negatively charged amino acids in the binding site could cause the formation of intramolecular interactions since the control peptides present a net negative charge. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have shown the in silico and in vitro effectiveness of existing antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, including chloroquine, remdesivir, ivermectins and even antiretrovirals for HIV therapy such as saquinavir [7, 8, 12, 38, [54] [55] [56] . However, no previous studies have reported the interaction of AMPs with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. In this respect, some studies have previously evaluated the activity of natural and synthetic peptides, including defensins, plectasins, temporins and cathelicidins, against multiple respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus H5N1, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV [27] [28] [29] 39, 40, 57] . Similar to this study, in silico analyses showed the potent antiviral effects of AMPs against Betacoronavirus [27, 39] . According to our results, the AMPs are attractive candidates as alternative to conventional antiviral drugs to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, because they offer several potential advantages, including specific anti-CoV effects, high selectivity, and do not be associated with severe adverse effects according to in vitro and in vivo assays [58] [59] [60] . Table 6 compares the binding energy and interactions between peptides with the ACE2 protein.Increased formation of hydrogen bridges is observed, followed by hydrophobic bonds and electrostatic interactions. With respect to the previous, the caerin 1.10 presented increased formation of hydrophobic bonds than hydrogen bonds. The main ACE2 protein residues that interact with the peptides are ARG482 (forming saline bridges with the glutamic acid or glutamine residues of the peptides), ASP494, TRP163, LYS174, and TYR613. Table 6 . Comparison of binding energy and interactions between control peptides and caerins to the ACE 2 protein. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have shown the in silico and in vitro effectiveness of existing antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, including chloroquine, remdesivir, ivermectins and even antiretrovirals for HIV therapy such as saquinavir [7, 8, 12, 38, [54] [55] [56] . However, no previous studies have reported the interaction of AMPs with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. In this respect, some studies have previously evaluated the activity of natural and synthetic peptides, including defensins, plectasins, temporins and cathelicidins, against multiple respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus H5N1, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV [27] [28] [29] 39, 40, 57] . Similar to this study, in silico analyses showed the potent antiviral effects of AMPs against Betacoronavirus [27, 39] . According to our results, the AMPs are attractive candidates as alternative to conventional antiviral drugs to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, because they offer several potential advantages, including specific anti-CoV effects, high selectivity, and do not be associated with severe adverse effects according to in vitro and in vivo assays [58] [59] [60] .Two peptides, EK1 and SARS-HR2P fusion peptide, with experimentally proven activity against SARS-CoV-2 [61] [62] [63] , were used as control to evaluate and compare the interaction of AMPs (caerin 1.6 and caerin 1.10) with Sgp. Both EK1 and the SARS-CoV-HR2P binding to the HR1 domain present in the Sgp S2 subunit [61] [62] [63] . Table 6 summarizes the comparison of binding energies between both control peptides and Sgp from SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-HR2P peptide has a binding energy of −5.5 kcal/mol and the EK1 peptide was −5.3 kcal/mol. The negative net charge of the control peptides summarized in Table 7 , appears to be present in their glutamic and aspartic residues, these peptides are the ones that interact more with the residues of the pocket located in the S2 subunit, for example, the GLU21 and GLU28 in the case of SARS-CoV-HR2P peptide and the residues GLU15 and GLU35 in the EK1 peptide. Nevertheless, the high presence of these residues in these peptides did not have the best binding energy when compared with the results presented in the docking of the 1.6 and 1.10 caerin with values of −7.5 kcal/mol and −7.7 kcal/mol respectively, this could be attributed to the fact that the pocket has a greater presence of negatively charged residues such as ASP428 and ASP994, allowing residues such as lysine and histidine from the caerins to achieve better results.Hydrophobic interactions were more common in the caerins compared to the control peptides. The electrostatic interactions marked the difference between caerin 1.6 and 1.10, with the latter with three more interactions which could have marked the difference shown by the binding energies to Sgp. It is also observed a similarity of interactions between the caerins with the control peptide EK1, for example, the ARG995, ASP994, and the ARG44 are residues of the Sgp that present electrostatic interactions with these peptides. The ARG995 also plays an important role not only in the electrostatic interactions of Sgp with these peptides but also participates in the formation of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Threonines of Sgp are frequently involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds, most frequently THR51 and THR998. Alternatively, in the hydrophobic interactions VAL991 is frequently found interacting with residues of the caerins and EK1 peptide. In Table 5 we noticed how almost all the residues of the caerin 1.10 interact with Sgp in the subunit S2 except for S4 and S8, therefore, we decided to modify these serine residues by positive polar residues such as arginine, lysine, and histidine, this because in the pocket of the docking we observed negatively charged residues, all the previous to understand the role of these residues in the peptide. In this way we obtained the synthetic peptide A with ARG4 and ARG8 residues, the synthetic peptide B with H4 and H8 residues, the synthetic peptide C with K4 and K8 residues (Table 7) . These residues modified the net charge of the original caerin by increasing it, considering this we modified the original serines of the caerin 1.10 by glycines in such a way that the net charge was not changed in a new synthetic peptide D.The results of the docking of these synthetic peptides with the Sgp subunit S2 are shown in Table 8 , showing that the most notorious change was SR4 and SR8 obtaining a binding energy of −5.0 kcal/mol with the synthetic peptide A that compared to the other synthetic peptides tends to form less hydrogen bridges with Sgp but increases the intramolecular interaction, giving 32 interactions of this type which surpasses the two presented by caerin 1.10. These interactions occur mainly between ARG4 with GLY1 and ARG8 with VAL20, GLU23, GLY7, and ALA22. The above is seen more clearly in Figure 6A where the caerin 1.10 is deployed in the pocket while Figure 6B shows us how the synthetic peptide A is compacted by intramolecular interactions. Similarly, the synthetic peptides B, C, and D present a greater number of intramolecular interactions than caerin 1.10 with 9, 23, and 16 interactions respectively. In Figure 6 it is shown how these peptides roll up on themselves diminishing the interaction with the pocket residues, showing that the serine residues S4 and S8 of the caerin 1.10 present a smaller intramolecular interaction which favors a smaller binding energy. The computational approach performed in this study involved database screening of AMPs from APD3 antimicrobial database for retrieving their amino acid sequence [18] . Additionally, the The computational approach performed in this study involved database screening of AMPs from APD3 antimicrobial database for retrieving their amino acid sequence [18] . Additionally, the crystallographic coordinates for structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S Sgp in the prefusion conformation, and the host cell receptor ACE2 were retrieved from the protein structure database RCSB Protein Data Bank, with PDB ID 6VYB [52] and 1R4L [64] , respectively.The set of AMPs here investigated were retrieved from the APD3 database. This database contains a total of 3178 AMPs from six kingdoms, including bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi, plants, and animals [18] . According to their in vitro antibacterial, antiparasitic, antiviral, and antifungal activity, a total of 800 AMPs were selected from this database. Predicting the molecular bond between the ligand and the target allows a very efficient virtual examination of the key points of the interaction [43, 44] . Deep learning techniques are being used more frequently, which have established a new era of large-scale virtual projection with high efficiency and reliability in in-silico drug design [65] . In in silico molecular binding prediction studies using deep neuronal learning, the multitasking approach is more reliable and the use of target sets with high similarity is preferred [43, 44] . Moreover, high similarity sequences also allow the identification of key residues in the ligand-receptor interaction, giving the possibility of applying mutagenesis and improving in this case the affinity of the ligand [66, 67] .From this set, we selected a list of AMPs according to their physicochemical properties, such as net charge, percentage of hydrophobicity, length, and secondary structure [27, 68, 69] , using a clustering strategy by integration of the K-Means method and algorithm elbow test with R-Project software Version 1.1.463 [70, 71] . When the AMPs did not have available information for their secondary structures, these were predicted using the MLRC method of NPS@: network protein sequence analysis (https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/secpred_mlr.pl) [72, 73] . We selected a cluster according to these criteria: experimental antiviral activity but unknown anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, non-toxic to mammalian cells, and non-hemolytic effects. Finally, for a subset of 15 peptides from the cluster, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on AMPs sequences by Maximum likelihood using the MEGA X software, and its reliability was evaluated by bootstrap with 1000 replicates.First, structural models of the AMPs were obtained using the I-TASSER platform [74] . Here, the 3D atomic models of the peptides were obtained using multiple threading alignments against the protein structure database RCSB PDB [74] . Models with higher confidence according to their C-score was selected [74] . From these structural predictions, a total of 100 molecular models were built for each peptide with MODELLER 9.14 using default parameters. Based on the discrete optimized protein energy score (DOPE score), the best probable structures were selected [75] . Additionally, the stereochemical quality of the best models was verified using Ramachandran plots in PROSA web server [76] and RAMPAGE [77] . All selected models had more than 90% amino acid residues in the favored and additional regions allowed. All the structures analyzed in this study were visualized with PyMOL (https://pymol.org/2/).The binding modes of AMPs with Sgp, and the host cell receptor ACE2 were determined. To this end, the proteins preparation, the peptides preparation, the grid generation, and the peptide-protein docking were performed using Autodock vina software [78] . For the protein preparation, the target proteins were initially pre-processed by removal of water molecules, addition of Kollman charges, optimization of the Hydrogen bond (H-bond), and addition of Gasteiger charges. The coordinates of grid were obtained by CB-DOCK online tool using the prepared ligand and protein. CB-DOCK is a protein-ligand docking method that identifies the binding sites, calculates the center and size, and customizes the docking box size according to the query ligands [50] . The results obtained were analyzed manually by Discovery Studio Visualizer version 2020 [79] . Two peptides with reported activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-HR2P, and EK1 were used as positive controls, both of synthetic origin and targeting Sgp [61] [62] [63] . Their 3D structures were created with I-TASSER.In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that two AMPs (caerin 1.6 and caerin 1.10) have a very high potential to interact with Sgp, but low affinity for ACE2 protein, which suggested the selectivity of these peptides for viral proteins. These AMPs may potentially block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S and cell host receptor ACE2, during viral binding, fusion, and entry to host cells, but they need experimental validation for their therapeutic effectiveness.

f7c3d11f1a0dceddc231f4e1d93fd78021602a35,Secuenciación del SARS-CoV-2: la iniciativa tecnológica para fortalecer los sistemas de alerta temprana ante emergencias de salud pública en Latinoamérica y el Caribe,"El mundo enfrenta la devastadora pandemia de COVID-19 causada por el betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, reportado por primera vez en la ciudad de Wuhan en China en diciembre de 2019. Al final de septiembre de 2020 el virus se había dispersado a más de 180 países, con más de 33 millones de casos y un millón de muertes en todo el mundo (1) . Mientras el SARS-CoV-2 se dispersaba por el Viejo Mundo, los países latinoamericanos se preparaban para disminuir la exposición y el impacto en la población.El entrenamiento de profesionales de la salud y la adquisición de insumos y equipos para el diagnóstico y la caracterización genética de SARS-CoV-2 resultó esencial para la toma de decisiones enfocadas en la contención y la posterior mitigación de la enfermedad (2) . No obstante, casi un mes después de detectarse el primer caso latinoamericano de COVID-19 en Brasil, se confirmaron por miles los casos de la enfermedad en la mayoría de los países de Latinoamérica y el Caribe (3) . Para septiembre de 2020, países como Brasil, México, Perú, Chile y Colombia habían superado las cifras de casos reportados de la mayoría de países del Viejo Mundo (1), convirtiéndose en el nuevo foco de la pandemia, por lo que se espera un incremento de los casos y, consecuentemente, un mayor impacto de la COVID-19 en Latinoamérica.Además del impacto en la salud, las medidas de aislamiento preventivo llevaron a una recesión económica que ha exacerbado la desigualdad social en regiones en desarrollo, incluida Latinoamérica, donde se estima que la cifra de personas pobres y en pobreza extrema aumentará de 185 a 230 millones y de 68 a 96 millones, respectivamente, en lo que constituye la peor recesión económica en un siglo en la región (4).En este sentido, la pandemia de COVID-19 representa un obstáculo significativo para el cumplimiento de algunos de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible como el de poner fin a la pobreza en todas sus formas en todo el mundo, garantizar una vida sana y promover el bienestar para todos en todas las edades. Además, dejó en evidencia la necesidad de aumentar la inversión en investigación científica, así como de mejorar la capacidad tecnológica en los sistemas de alerta temprana y gestión de riesgos frente a epidemias en Latinoamérica.En este contexto, los gobiernos se enfrentan a uno de los mayores retos ante la necesidad de minimizar las muertes por COVID-19 y, al mismo tiempo, reducir el impacto económico de la propagación del virus en los territorios (5) . Entre las estrategias para el manejo de la pandemia se han implementado medidas como el aumento del número de pruebas de diagnóstico molecular y de unidades de cuidados intensivos.Por último, la acumulación de información genómica sobre el SARS-CoV-2 circulante en diferentes países de Latinoamérica y el Caribe, en su mayoría producto de esfuerzos locales de implementación de tecnologías de secuenciación de próxima generación, representa una herramienta de gran utilidad para fortalecer la vigilancia epidemiológica y la adopción acertada de decisiones en salud pública para controlar este virus y los demás agentes infecciosos que circulan en la región. Sin embargo, la aplicación de este enfoque en nuestra región implica enfrentar retos importantes que van desde el establecimiento de políticas regionales en salud pública para fortalecer la cooperación entre los laboratorios de salud pública y facilitar la transferencia de tecnología y entrenamiento, además de una inversión de recursos económicos importantes para la adquisición de insumos, infraestructura y mejoramiento de la capacidad instalada en el laboratorio.Secuenciación del SARS-CoV-2 y su papel en la adopción de decisiones en salud pública Las tecnologías de secuenciación de próxima generación implementadas de rutina para la vigilancia de agentes patógenos en agencias de salud pública en Europa (Public Health England) y Norteamérica (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Agency of Canada), han permitido la identificación específica de focos de transmisión, que aportan información crucial para la adopción de decisiones basadas en la evidencia para prevenir la dispersión de enfermedades como la tuberculosis (6) . Además, la vigilancia genómica permitió la identificación del SARS-CoV-2 como una nueva especie viral pocas semanas después del primer brote en China -algo que tradicionalmente tomaba varios meses-, lo que encendió las alarmas que llevaron al inicio de cuarentenas en todo el mundo (7).La implementación de las tecnologías de secuenciación de próxima generación en la vigilancia de agentes patógenos posibilita el desarrollo de análisis basados en la epidemiología genómica que, en el marco de la presente pandemia de COVID-19, busca caracterizar el componente genético de las cepas de SARS-CoV-2 circulantes y su correlación con datos epidemiológicos registrados a partir del seguimiento de casos y contactos. En este sentido, la iniciativa global de compartir todos los datos de influenza (GISAID) (1), brinda la oportunidad de mejorar significativamente los sistemas de alerta temprana de cualquier país interesado en implementar la epidemiología genómica como parte de sus políticas de salud pública. Además, es importante resaltar el aporte técnico de iniciativas disponibles en la web que permiten acceder a protocolos estandarizados para la secuenciación masiva del SARS-CoV-2 (8).Con este enfoque, a medida que el virus se diseminaba por el mundo fue posible evidenciar rápidamente la acumulación de cambios en su genoma, lo que tuvo un impacto directo en el desarrollo y el refinamiento de métodos de diagnóstico molecular y serológico, además de convertirse en el principal insumo para el diseño racional de candidatos a vacunas y tratamientos. Los primeros datos de vigilancia genómica provenientes de países suramericanos como Argentina, Brasil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador y Uruguay, han aportado evidencia útil para la selección de métodos de diagnóstico molecular y serológico, así como para la formulación de vacunas (9,10), en la que la variabilidad genética de las cepas del SARS-CoV-2 circulantes en la región ha sido determinante (figura 1).En Latinoamérica, la circulación simultánea de varios virus transmitidos por mosquitos (Arbovirus), entre ellos los relacionados con las recientes epidemias de dengue, Zika y chikungunya, representa una amenaza para la salud pública con implicaciones sociales y económicas de enorme importancia (11, 12) , lo que se suma a la presencia de otros virus emergentes, como el Mayaro y el Oropuche, cuyo impacto todavía no se ha estimado. Algunos países latinoamericanos han aportado muy buenos ejemplos sobre la utilidad de los datos genómicos de los arbovirus en la comprensión de fenómenos epidemiológicos de importancia en salud pública; entre ellos cabe destacar la posibilidad de determinar el retraso entre el momento de la aparición de un arbovirus y la primera detección en un área geográfica, la distribución espacial de las cepas de mayor virulencia, la transmisibilidad de vectores y el mayor riesgo de fracaso de eventuales vacunas (13) . En Colombia, la vigilancia genómica de arbovirus permitió identificar los genotipos del dengue, chikungunya y Zika, así como la diversificación regional de linajes de estos virus en el país (14) (15) (16) .Brasil ha sido pionero en la generación de datos, así como en el acceso a la infraestructura y el personal capacitado en la producción de datos genómicos, algo que quedó evidenciado por el hecho de haber reportado el 40 % de los genomas de SARS-CoV-2 en Latinoamérica. Sin embargo, con la pandemia de COVID-19 en la región, varios países de Latinoamérica demostraron capacidad técnica para contribuir a la vigilancia genómica del SARS-CoV-2, pese a que la cantidad de genomas reportados fue limitada (figura 2). El primer genoma de SARS-CoV-2 se reportó el 13 de enero de 2020 y hacia finales de septiembre del 2020 se habían reportado en la base de datos GISAID más de 126.000 genomas a nivel mundial, de los cuales más de 2.200 provienen de Latinoamérica y el Caribe. La abundancia y la velocidad de la producción de datos genómicos en el contexto de la epidemia es un hecho sin precedentes en la historia de la humanidad y ha permitido el monitoreo en tiempo real del avance de la pandemia, el estudio de las introducción del virus en diferentes territorios (17), la vigilancia de la utilidad y aplicabilidad de los métodos diagnósticos y el desarrollo de las posibles vacunas (9, 18) .Además, la información temprana aportada por países como Brasil, Panamá, Chile y Colombia, sobre la composición genética de las cepas de SARS-CoV-2 que llegaron durante los primeros meses (figura 3) fue crucial para monitorear la diversificación regional, la fijación de linajes y la importación entre países vecinos a la región (17, 19) .Por otro lado, el estudio genómico del SARS-CoV-2 permitió identificar los cambios acumulados en el genoma del virus desde su origen en China, su dispersión por el mundo y la llegada a Latinoamérica. Entre los cambios más frecuentes, la mutación D614G en la proteína S del SARS-CoV-2 ha sido de particular interés, dado que su presencia está asociada con el linaje B.1, dominante en la pandemia, el cual virtualmente reemplazó al linaje A.1, su predecesor. Dicha observación orientó los estudios sobre la asociación de esta mutación con una mayor dispersión e infectividad del virus (20,21) y una antigenicidad reducida, lo que ha llevado a considerar la posibilidad de adaptar las vacunas y las pruebas serológicas (22) . 3. Distribución temporal de los reportes de genomas de SARS-CoV-2 en países de Latinoamériva y el Caribe utilizando la fecha de recolección de la muestra asociada con la secuencia reportada en GISAID En Suramérica, la secuenciación del SARS-CoV-2 permitió establecer que más del 80 % de los genomas reportados para la región presentaban la sustitución D614G (10), información valiosa sobre la historia natural del virus que puede orientar a los responsables de las decisiones en salud pública para la selección, implementación o refinamiento de métodos de diagnóstico, vacunas y tratamientos (cuadro 1). Esto evidencia la necesidad de generar políticas públicas para aumentar los recursos estatales dedicados a implementar la secuenciación genómica como una herramienta de vigilancia temprana de rutina ante eventos de interés en salud pública en Latinoamérica y el Caribe.Las primeras diez secuencias del SARS-CoV-2 en Colombia se obtuvieron de muestras captadas en ocho ciudades del país (Cartagena, Santa Marta, Ibagué, Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Palmira y Popayán), donde se confirmaron los primeros casos de COVID-19 importados desde Europa, como parte de la vigilancia virológica de rutina liderada por el Instituto Nacional de Salud de Colombia.La disponibilidad de protocolos en la web específicos para la secuenciación del SARS-CoV-2 basada en amplicones de PCR (8) permitió que los investigadores del Instituto Nacional de Salud, en cooperación con investigadores del Instituto Alexander von Humboldt y la Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, los aplicaran en la secuenciación del nuevo coronavirus e implementaran la tecnología de secuenciación de Oxford Nanopore -MinION en tan solo tres semanas a partir del primer caso confirmado de COVID-19 en el país, con lo cual las primeras secuencias del SARS-CoV-2 quedaron disponibles en el repositorio de secuencias genómicas del nuevo coronavirus, GISAID. Simultáneamente, investigadores de la Universidad del Valle y del Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical demostraron la capacidad instalada para secuenciar el SARS-CoV-2 a partir de muestras captadas localmente (26) .Así, las primeras secuencias del SARS-CoV-2 en Colombia evidenciaron la variabilidad genética en diferentes posiciones nucleotídicas de los sitios genómicos del virus, usados en las pruebas moleculares (rRT-PCR) para el diagnóstico de la COVID-19 y disponibles en el sitio web de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS). Ello demostró que la acumulación de mutaciones en el genoma viral es relativamente frecuente y, en consecuencia, es importante evaluar periódicamente los sitios blanco para el diagnóstico molecular usando la información de las secuencias disponibles para verificar mediante simulación por computador su potencial efecto en el desempeño de las pruebas (9) .En los meses siguientes otros estudios corroboraron esta información a la luz de nuevas secuencias del SARS-CoV-2 reportadas en GISAID por investigadores colombianos, las cuales se sumaron a las reportadas por otros países de la región, incluidos Brasil, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Perú y Argentina, lo que demuestra el alcance de estos hallazgos en el territorio suramericano (18) , así como en las pruebas de inmunodiagnóstico basadas en anticuerpos contra las proteínas N y S del SARS-CoV-2 (10).Además, la capacidad de secuenciación instalada del Instituto Nacional de Salud permitió clasificar el primer aislamiento del SARS-CoV-2 colombiano (obtenido por investigadores de la Universidad de Antioquia) en el linaje B.1.5, uno de los más prevalentes en el país. Esta información resulta crucial para determinar las cepas del virus que se emplearán en pruebas in vitro para la evaluación de compuestos terapéuticos o desinfectantes (37) . Por último, las secuencias del SARS-CoV-2 identificadas durante la fase temprana de la pandemia de COVID-19 en Colombia aportaron datos moleculares para respaldar la información epidemiológica relativa a la proporción de casos importados de Europa y América y la reconstrucción de cadenas de transmisión viral, así como para estimar la variabilidad genética de SARS-CoV-2 en el país, traducida en la identificación de 12 sublinajes del SARS-CoV-2 importados en un transcurso de dos meses desde la confirmación del primer caso (17) .",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-15,11
da0cdab91a5358373607fd44fe8cacd1914714e7,"From dermatological conditions to COVID-19: Reasoning for anticoagulation, suppression of inflammation, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy","The pathogenesis of LV is yet to be understood, with the main mechanism being hypercoagulability and inflammation playing a secondary role 3 , as opposed to the sequence observed in COVID-19 during the early phases within the lungs. Both diseases may benefit from corticosteroids and could be treated by the combined therapy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and anticoagulation.The histopathology of LV is characterized by intraluminal thrombosis, proliferation of the endothelium, and segmental hyalinization of dermal vessels, often only in the lower limbs. 3 Nevertheless, lymphocyte infiltrate can be present and perpetuate thrombotic phenomena, leading to skin necrosis ( Figure 1 ).Similarly, pulmonary endothelial damage with microthrombi ( Figure 1A ) and hemorrhagic lung infarction by septal necrosis ( Figure 2B ) were observed. In addition, the inflammatory process is accompanied by fibrinoid plugs ( Figure 2C ) and lymphocytic interstitial infiltration ( Figure 2D ).In this article, we present a rationale for the efficacy of anticoagulation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in both disorders.In 2003, Yang et al 4 described two patients with an intractable LV whose ulcers were successfully treated with HBOT. After this, other authors published case reports with similarly satisfactory results in LV patients. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] In February 2020, Zhong et al 12 pneumonia who had been treated under HBOT. These five patients were 24 to 69 (mean 47.6) years old and received three to eight (mean 4.6) sessions of HBOT in addition to routine therapies. 13 These patients' daily average oxygen saturation levels (SpO 2 ) were restored to above 95% after one to eight HBOT treatments. Following HBOT, patients' PaO 2 and SaO 2 levels had significantly increased (P < .05) and their lactate levels had declined. The patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes were obviously elevated after HBOT treatments (P < .05) and their fibrinogen and D-dimer serum levels had decreased.Chest computerized tomography (CT) scans obtained during or after HBOT showed significantly improved imaging status of lung lesions in each patient. 13 The HBOT methods applied by Chen et al 13 Regarding the safety of disease control and the prevention of airborne contagion, a hyperbaric chamber and oxygen inhalation system are perfect gas management systems for disease control due to their properties of closed, one-way gas flow, all-fresh-air, and relatively independent gas lines for medical staff and patients, which suggest that the risk of infection for medical staff in the chamber is not higher than in the ward.Rigorous measures of disease control and prevention were applied for HBOT. 13 For the treatment of COVID-19 patients, the measures for disease control outside the chamber were the same as in the infection wards, such as implementation of separate paths for medical staff and patients and the distinction of infectious areas. 13 Disinfection measures in the chamber were further strengthened to similar levels as in infectious ward areas. 13 In regards to the treatment procedure, patients respired with built-in breathing apparatus immediately upon entering the chamber. 13 The chamber maintained continuous ventilation with a high volume of fresh air. 13 Guo et al 14 reported the same success in two other male COVID-19 patients, each of whom met at least one of the following criteria:shortness of breath; a respiratory rate (RR) of ≥30 breaths per minute; finger pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of ≤93% at rest; and an oxygen index with a P/F ratio of PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 300 mm Hg. Patients were treated with HBOT of 1.5 atm with an oxygen concentration of more than 95% for 60 minutes per treatment once a day for 1 week. No patient became critically ill; they demonstrated a decreasing trend of SO 2 and their P/F ratios were immediately reversed and increased daily. In addition, their lymphocyte counts and ratios reflecting F I G U R E 1 Livedoid vasculopathy in the skin: dermal necrosis with hemorrhagic, lymphocyte infiltrate, and endothelial damage with fibrin microthrombi (HE 400×) immune function gradually recovered, their D-dimer corresponding to peripheral circulation disorders and serum cholinesterase (reflecting liver function) improved. Subsequent chest CTs showed that patients' pulmonary inflammation had clearly subsided.A single-center prospective study was also conducted on HBOT as an adjunct to standard therapy for a pilot cohort of 40 COVID-Winthrop Hospital (registered at clinicaltrial.gov under the identifier NCT04332081). 15 The initial result of this study was that following infection by SARS-CoV-2, morbidity and mortality from this condition are due to the incidence of ARDS, which is defined as a condition of extremely low arterial oxygen concentration or hypoxia with a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen and a fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/ FiO2 ratio) of ≤300, as well as bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules identified by chest radiography or CT. 16 ARDS as seen in severe COVID-19 is characterized by difficulty in breathing and low blood oxygen levels. 17, 18 As a result, some patients may experience complications with secondary bacterial and fungal infections. ARDS may lead directly to respiratory failure, which is the cause of death in 70% of fatal COVID-19 cases. 17 The development of ARDS is likely the product of inflammation mounted by the patient's response to the virus and secondary bacterial infections. 18 Harch PG 19 analyzed the outcomes of the first two Chinese with COVID-19 for whom HBOT was applied 12, 13 and reinforced the application of HBOT in this clinical scenario based on sound physiology and Henry's law. Named after the English physician William Henry, this law defines the relationship between the partial pressure of gases overlying a solution and the gases' ability to dissolve in that solution. 20 Henry's law states that when a gaseous mixture (eg, the atmosphere) is in contact with a solution, the amount of any gas in that mixture that dissolves in the solution is directly proportionate to the partial pressure of that gas. 20 The partial pressure of a gas is the amount of pressure that the gas contributes to the total pressure of that gas mixture. 20 According to Henry's law, if the pressure of a gas over liquid increases, the amount of gas dissolved in the liquid will increase proportionally. As the gas pressure decreases, the amount of gas dissolved in the solution drops. 20 In COVID-19 lung injury, the alveolar-capillary barrier is damaged by an inflammatory exudate with edema and a lymphocytic infiltrate, leading to reduced gas exchange in the distal airway spaces. 19 Additionally, there is associated microvascular thrombosis in the perialveolar blood vessels ( Figure 2 ). Dr. Richard Levitan, an emergency physician at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, made some striking patient observations regarding blood O 2 levels that he shared in a New York Times opinion piece (April 20, 2020). 18 He noted that the initial stage of COVID-19 is only now being understood as ""silent hypoxia,"" alluding to its ""insidious, hard-to-detect nature."" 18 In Levitan's observations, SpO 2 fell from the normal range of 94-100% to as low as 50%, but patients did not experience any dyspnea until the depleted levels reached critical values.This was most likely due to the fact that CO 2 continued to be released. By the time CO 2 started to accumulate, a feeling of breathlessness developed and many COVID-19 patients declined quickly into respiratory failure. 18 According to Henry's law, the HBOT acts by (a) dissolving oxygen in the inflamed alveolar-capillary barrier, (b) increasing the diffusion rate of oxygen, (c) the diffusion distance of oxygen, (d) increasing the dissolution of oxygen in blood plasma, (e) achieving more oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the red blood cells, and (f) achieving the best delivery of oxygen to the microcirculation and tissue. 19 The next result is a reversal of the downward spiral of COVID-19 patients. 19 Elevated systemic levels of oxygen secondary to HBOT has been tra- The main side effects of HBOT are limited to the pulmonary and neurological (eg, visual impairment, tinnitus, nausea, facial spasms, dizziness, and disorientation) systems. 22 Pulmonary toxicity usually manifests with tracheobronchial irritation. Oxygen toxicity has also been previously reported. 22 However, the adverse effects of HBOT seem of relatively small concern in COVID-19 cases considering the rather limited number of patients in whom such therapy could be considered and applied. 22 Several of HBOT's effects in reducing patients' inflammatory state have been described, 22 Hyperbaric exposition and decompression induce activation of fibrinolysis, even in the absence of detectable gas bubbles. 23 Fibrinolytic activity increases mainly due to decreases in concentration and activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). 23 Other HBOT effects under coagulation/fibrinolytic pathways include (a) increasing red blood cell (RBC) deformation (erythrocyte rheology), allowing RBCs to perfuse areas that they otherwise could not due to capillary and small arteriolar damage from purpura fulminans or duet to impaired RBC deformability, contributing to sludging and oxygen offload inability. 24 Endothelial cells represent one-third of the total lung cells. 24 Baseline endothelial damage may be chronically caused by increased adiponectin in diabetic and obese patients; this effect is related to activation of inflammasome NLRP3 and autocrine production of IL-1β. 24 Additional damage to pulmonary endothelial dysfunctional cells is acutely provoked by infections and, in turn, causes excess thrombin generation and reduced fibrinolysis. 26 Additionally, hypoxia may lead to increased expression and hypercoagulability of HIF-1α. 26 Therefore, a high rate of thrombotic episodes is reported in patients with COVID-19, while increased vascular permeability seems to be strongly related to increased thrombosis (inflammatory mediated). 26 In lymphopenia with organ failure, increased vascular permeability has been strongly correlated with severe lymphopenia. 26 Figure 3 summarizes the possible mechanisms by which HBOT may act in both LV and COVID-19 patients to repair inflammation, coagulation, and tissue damage. Histopathology of the lungs revealed diffuse alveolar damage consistent with early ARDS in eight cases. Predominant findings were hyaline membranes, activated pneumocytes, microvascular thrombi, capillary congestion, and protein-enriched interstitial edema. 31 Microthrombi were found within small lung arteries and occasionally within the prostate but not in other organs. 32 COVID-19 may predispose patients to venous thromboembolism in several ways. 32 The coagulation system may be activated by many Heparin has two different mechanisms of inhibition on the NF-κB signaling pathway: one focuses on inhibiting translocation of the transcription factor into the nucleus 33 and the other one has been explained as the ability of heparin to interfere non-specifically with the binding of NF-κB to DNA in the nucleus. 33 Hence, leukocyte adhesion and activation, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine production, are downregulated as a result of the inhibitory effect of heparin on the NF-κB signaling. 34 Administering heparin to patients will not only activate their antithrombins but may also affect the functional state of a variety of other proteins. 35 By competing with cell-surface heparan sulfate (HS) for protein binding, heparin will displace proteins from their HSmediated anchoring and thus disrupt associated function. 35 The effects of potential value in COVID-19 treatment include the prevention of viral adhesion as well as promotion of antiinflammatory activity based on inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and leukocyte migration. 35 The recurrent involvement of proteins bound to cell-surface HS is striking. 35 Binding of a viral protein to cell-surface HS is often the first step in a cascade of interactions that are required for viral entry and initiation of the infection. 35 Heparin interacts with the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein and heparin use may have the potential to prevent viral adhesion. 35 A retrospective clinical study found that use of LMWH in the treatment of COVID-19 patients resulted in significantly lower plasma levels of IL-6, a key player in the ""cytokine storm"" associated with the severe outcomes of this viral disease. 35, 36 This review aim to contribute with additional information that may be applied in the futures randomized-controlled trails (RCT) on HBOT and LMWH is necessary as a proof of concept in the efficacy and safety of this approach for moderate to severe COVID-19 until an effective antiviral drug becomes available.The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.Paulo Ricardo Criado: article conception, article writing, Figure 1 Thais Prota Hussein Pincelli: article writing, final article organization, English review.

4ce60827f4e709447e354ae5214e3e495aad31d6,Ethical Considerations for Restrictive and Physical Distancing Measures in Brazil During COVID-19: Facilitators and Barriers,"Only a few months after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic was already exerting great pressure on countries' health systems. To slow down transmission and allow health systems some time to prepare for a surge in cases that would quickly overwhelm them, countries adopted prevention strategies. In March 2020, Brazilian states started implementing physical isolation measures, which, in general, included school closures and suspension of commercial activities except for those related to food and health. Movement was limited to essential activities. A month later, 60 per cent of the Brazilian population was in physical isolation, with variability across the states (InLoco 2020).In this paper we discuss ethical aspects of implementing physical distancing in Brazil, as well as potential barriers and facilitators, in light of political, socio-economic, and scientific dimensions.Adherence to public health measures largely relies on the public's trust in health systems. Brazil's public health system, the Sistema Único de Saúde or Unified Health System (SUS), guarantees universal access to healthcare. Primary care, routine immunization, and the HIV comprehensive care programmes are some of its success stories (Castro et al. 2019) . Research has shown that utilization of healthcare services, including for prevention, even if unequally across the regions, has increased overall in the past thirty years (Viacava et al. 2018) . Nevertheless, there has been a decline in the previously very high immunization coverage across the country (Fujita et al. 2018) . Austerity measures and underfunding of SUS in the past years may help explain less vaccinepreventable diseases campaigns and the observed lower vaccination rates (Fujita et al. 2018; Massuda et al. 2018; Paim 2018) . The resurgence of dengue in the country in the 1980s revealed the decreased efforts in improving sanitation in poorer settings, and the focus for dengue control has since been put largely on individuals and their ability to implement their own prevention methods, instead of placing the responsibility on governments to address underlying infrastructure problems (Löwy 2017) . In the 2010s new viruses entered the country producing Chikungunya outbreaks and also laying the grounds for the Zika global health emergency in 2015-2016 (Matta et al. 2019) . The arbovirus control strategy set the stage for the current COVID-19 response in which the governments ask societies to play their part and stay home to tackle COVID-19, without providing them with the necessary support. Along with cuts in funding, the public's trust in the system may also have diminished, interfering with adherence to implemented public health measures to prevent COVID-19 spread. In April, 54 per cent of Brazilian adults interviewed thought physical distancing would not help contain the advancement of the pandemic (Ipsos 2020) .We have witnessed a political polarization of COVID-19 response and a lack of clear federal public health measures to tackle the pandemic, undermining the potential positive effects of a harmonized response. Inconsistent prevention messages from government leaders, instability of health leadership at federal level, and lack of coordination of response across the administrative levels may have led to the public's distrust, thus affecting their response. Furthermore, the failure of political coordination between federal and state governments is a critical moral issue and a source of misinformation. The moral face of the state institutional component, not only in Brazil, is unfortunately immersed in misuse of political power and opportunism, at high costs for populations and the planet.Adherence to prevention measures largely depends on social, cultural, and economic factors such as job security, housing, means of transportation, childcare options, and tensions between individual rights and collective protection, among others. Crises such as pandemics will inevitably hit the most vulnerable harder. In particular, if people are deprived of their freedom of movement in a situation of physical isolation, those under no financial security will be most at risk for further impoverishment. This concern has been raised during the COVID-19 pandemic (Ahmed et al. 2020 ) and is of utmost relevance for Brazil, where more than thirteen million people live in extreme poverty, defined as living below U.S. $2 per day (IBGE 2019). Recent estimates for Brazil reveal an unemployment rate of 12 per cent, with over 40 per cent of the working population in informal employment (PNAD/IBGE 2020). This unemployment rate does not include the so-called disillusioned-that is, those who are available to work and would like to but have no expectation of finding work (IBGE 2020). Reasons why people give up looking for work include not finding work in the region, not finding adequate work, and not getting a job due to being considered too young or too old or because of no professional experience or qualifications. Additionally, about 11.5 million Brazilians live in houses with more than three people per bedroom (PNAD/IBGE 2020).The federal government has put in place social incentives to support families during the COVID-19 crisis, with several limitations to access them. Furthermore, these incentives had their implementation delayed and are planned to be paid for three months only, when financial constraints are expected to last for longer (Folha de São Paulo 2020). Even among those eligible to receive the incentive, many have reported difficulties accessing the benefit. As a result, many people are lining up at the banks-in contravention of physical distancing guidance (G1 2020). As previously mentioned, the federal government started implementing economic constraints in 2019 based on an ultra-neoliberal agenda, radically reducing social protection investments like health, education, social security, science, and technology. There are critical ethical issues related to facing and responding to the socioeconomic repercussions of physical distancing in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Brazil. In a society embodying immense structural inequities, the scope and density of social and sanitarian justice could be the edge between life and death to the most vulnerable.Large-scale physical distancing measures were put in place early in Wuhan, at the start of the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak. At that point, little was known about the effectiveness of such measures, and ethical issues were raised concerning curbing people's right to move freely. Months later, there is at least preliminary evidence that such measures have been successful in decreasing COVID-19 transmission (Prem et al. 2020; Nussbaumer-Streit et al. 2020) . To be ethically sound, the implementation of these physical distancing measures needs to be evidence-based, and evaluated and updated as we build collective knowledge on the pandemic (WHO 2020a).Guidance from World Health Organization (WHO) highlights the role of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the control of the pandemic. The response should be based on identifying and caring for COVID-19 patients and quickly identifying their contacts, who can then monitor themselves for symptoms and self-isolate (WHO 2020b). In Brazil there has not been a harmonized testing strategy, and testing overall has been very limited. At the end of April 2020, there had been 0.63 tests/1000 inhabitants, as compared to 12.0/ 1000 in the United States and 25.0/1000 in Germany (BBC News Brasil 2020). Improving testing capacity, coupled with ensuring adequate care for COVID-19 patients, would potentially facilitate the assessment of the pandemic impact in the various communities and redirect public health measures accordingly.Finally, during a sanitary emergency, decisions need to be made according to scientific knowledge. The president, unfortunately, who does not express confidence in science, has made fighting the pandemic more challenging, as he has been acting against physical isolation guidance.Measures to restrict the individual right to freely move are supported by an argument that collective interests should precede individual interests. This statement, however, is not equally accepted in different societies as well as in different historical contexts. Discourse ethics (Habermas 1990 ) provides an excellent framework for this analysis, as it assigns the task of defining what is right or wrong, what is just or unjust, to those who are affected by the norm. On this basis, the stringent standards that apply would be those that find acceptance by all those affected by it. In other words, the validity of the norm should not be conditioned by the interests of the most powerful or the most numerous but potentially by the interests of all. Thus, we intend to defend a theory of ethics of mutual respect that would justify the possibility of accepting as correct, in principle, the hypothesis of establishing limitation of the individual right to freely move, as long as equal conditions are established for everyone affected by the norm. In principle, this condition is fulfilled when there is no exception for the physical distancing measures put in place based on who is affected.The difficulties in achieving physical distancing in the poorest Brazilian communities reflect the conditions to which these population segments are subjected: overcrowded housing, inadequate sanitation, and little or no financial leverage. Hence, to respect the ethics of reciprocity, we must offer conditions so that the most vulnerable receive additional resources to help them comply with such measures. Considering that the social involvement of members of these communities is also desirable, it is necessary to listen to them and meet their needs. Favelas (slums) have demonstrated excellent organization and action capacity during COVID-19. However, governments rarely see their organizations as valid interlocutors, undermining communities' chances of having their voices heard.Trust in health authorities and scientists has a major role in public acceptance of public health measures, as noted during the H1N1 pandemic by Freimuth et al. (2013) . Trust is established through relationships built over time and should not be merely expected based merely on government or public health institutions' exercise of authority (Dawson et al. 2020) . Trustworthiness is not established by decree. Quite the opposite, trustworthiness develops when authorities' commitment, honesty, and concern are perceived by the public (Freimuth et al. 2013) . O'Neill has argued that rather than invest in increasing trust per se, we should aim at enhancing trustworthiness in our societies (O'Neill 2002) . In particular during this sanitary emergency, when the trustworthiness of governments and public health agencies are the same time being challenged and heightened in relevance, we've witnessed authorities fail to achieve and stimulate the public's trust. Unfortunately, sometimes, they are doing the opposite, spreading misinformation and distrust.Each country will have its own challenges and social and cultural specificities when implementing public health measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We support an inclusive and equitable approach to public health measures that respects most vulnerable populations and attempts to minimize the disproportionate burden on them, as previously proposed (Berger et al. 2020) . There is an ethical duty to protect the most vulnerable in particular during a pandemic. Hence, understanding long-standing vulnerabilities (and how they are modified when facing the pandemic) as well as new ones generated by COVID-19 will define how well we are able to protect them during physical distancing times.In particular, during an outbreak of this size, there is a need for transparent and inclusive communication with the public, which may require various strategies to reach different populations (WHO 2016). In Brazil, open TV channels are the most used source of information on the pandemic, independent of social class (Ipsos 2020) . Communicating reliable information in dialogue with the public enables a true co-construction of understandings and practices-a pandemic narrative that produces public confidence and efficient responses to social and health needs and avoids misinformation and rumours.From a financial security perspective, WHO advocates for support to mitigate the financial and social impact of restriction of movement (WHO 2016) as part of an ethical response to infectious diseases outbreaks such as the one we're living with. Although social support measures have been put in place in Brazil, these need to be revisited and continuously adapted in light of people's real needs.All efforts should be put in place so that the population is well informed during the COVID-19 pandemic and understands the reasons behind physical isolation along with other strategies and feels supported and included in the response. If such measures are accompanied by continuous public dialogue and participative evaluation that assesses both acceptability from the public as well as effectiveness, there is a higher chance the population will trust the health systems implementing them. Trust in health systems is likely to produce a sense of social solidarity and a belief that we are in fact all fighting this pandemic together, despite different conditions and beliefs, and we will have a better chance to succeed.Funding This work was partially supported by the Wellcome Trust -Grant n. 218750/Z/19/Z.",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-09,11
7442f66bc492fa0d6b6d6aff01a2996659f8f823,,"Depression is one of the main factors that generates disability in populations in modern societies (Dong et al., 2020; Nuggerud-Galeas et al., 2020) . Having experienced epidemics or natural disasters increases long-term levels of depression in populations (Mak et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2018; Morganstein and Ursano, 2020) and may also increase their future suicide rates (Cheung et al., 2008) . Experiencing more upsetting events in life and finding it difficult to cope with them are also predictors of anxiety, stress, and depression (Zou et al., 2018) .At present, the world is facing a critical situation caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus, and this has contributed hugely toward increasing levels of depression in the population in different countries. The situation of the population in some countries which have been severely affected by the epidemic and have little ability to cope, as is occurring in several Latin American countries, is particularly alarming. In the current epidemic crisis, studying the causes of depression in vulnerable contexts can be of great strategic value to help alleviate this illness now and prevent it in the future.In Latin American countries, the first case was reported in Brazil on February 25, 2020 (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020) , and after that, the disease expanded rapidly throughout this vast region. In Ecuador, there are now over 65,000 people infected, and this country has become one of the worst affected in all Latin America (Muñoz, 2020) . Like other countries with limited financial resources and deficient healthcare facilities, Ecuador has had serious difficulties in identifying possible cases of infection, stopping its spread, and treating patients (Hoffman and Silverberg, 2018; Kapata et al., 2020) . This critical situation, set in a context of great vulnerability, can lead to a feeling of extreme helplessness among the population, which particularly affects mental health (Llibre-Guerra et al., 2020) . Thus, recent studies in Latin American countries have found that health care workers have symptoms of anxiety and distress (Chen et al., 2020b; Yáñez et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) ; while, in other studies, almost half reported symptoms of depression (Guiroy et al., 2020) . However, despite the fact that some studies have reported that these symptoms occur to a greater extent in the population between 18 and 28 years of age (Cortés-Álvarez et al., 2020) , hardly any studies have been carried out in university students.The SARS-CoV-2 virus particularly affects the respiratory system and is highly infectious, with a long incubation period. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the disease Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19; Wu et al., 2020) . It was first discovered in the city of Wuhan (China) in 2019, but its remarkable ability to spread and its rapid expansion around the world has led the WHO to consider it a pandemic (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020) . This pathogen has now become one of the worst health, social, and economic problems worldwide in recent years (Nicola et al., 2020) . A number of studies have shown the impact that COVID-19 can have and its effects on people's well-being, due to its ability to produce a full-scale mental health crisis, especially in countries with a large number of people affected by the disease (Fiorillo and Gorwood, 2020) . A number of studies have already begun to look at psychological disorders such as depression in populations affected by COVID-19 (e.g., Duan and Zhu, 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Huang and Zhao, 2020) . Depression is a disorder made up of symptoms associated with low morale-despair, sadness, self-depreciation, and worthlessness-leading to reduced self-esteem and lack of interest in life. The disorder is closely linked to a lower probability of achieving significant life goals for those who suffer from it, with worsening health and with suicide attempts (Antúnez and Vinet, 2012; Roh et al., 2020; Siegrist and Wege, 2020; Zhuo et al., 2020) . In order to prevent and alleviate depression during the current crisis and in the post-COVID-19 world, we need to look into the factors associated with this disorder.The pandemic has forced many governments to bring in strict laws to stop it from spreading (Adhikari et al., 2020) . The governments of the worst affected countries, in terms of number of infections, patients, and mortality levels, such as China, Italy, Spain, and Ecuador, have decreed long periods of self-isolation and/or lockdown, in which citizens have had to stay home. This has seriously affected the living conditions of their populations, and it has been especially detrimental in countries with fewer resources, such as those in the Latin American region. Certain aspects of the disease, such as the uncertainty about how it is spread, its evolution or about the immunity of patients who have been infected, or the absence of a vaccine to counter the disease, have led to an increased feeling of fear among the population (Orellana and Orellana, 2020; Ornell et al., 2020; Rodríguez-Rey et al., 2020) .These fears, generated by the perception of threatening stimuli, have already been seen in previous epidemics, such as those caused by SARS (Reynolds et al., 2008) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV; Bukhari et al., 2016) . Given the severe global threat and impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has produced on different aspects of human survival, health, well-being, and development, Ahorsu et al. (2020) designed a scale to measure the fear of this pathogen based on the existing scientific literature: the Fear of COVID-19 Scale . This scale has been used in a wide range of countries, such as Iran (Alyami et al., 2020) , Bangladesh (Sakib et al., 2020) , Italy (Soraci et al., 2020) , Turkey (Satici et al., 2020) , Russia and Belarus (Reznik et al., 2020) , Israel (Tzur Bitan et al., 2020) , Peru (Huarcaya-Victoria et al., 2020) , and Paraguay (Barrios et al., 2020) .Most of these studies also detected a link between fear of COVID-19 and anxiety (Mertens et al., 2020 ) and, to a lesser extent, depression, using both the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Ahorsu et al., 2020; Alyami et al., 2020) and the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). It has recently been observed that fear of COVID-19 is associated more with anxiety and stress and to a lesser extent with depression (Tzur Bitan et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, despite the fact that there seems to be a lesser association between fear and depression, cases of suicide have been reported in the population due to fear of COVID-19 (Mamun and Griffiths, 2020) .In addition, the high daily rates of new cases and deaths together with the bombardment of information to which citizens are submitted through the media can influence the development Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 November 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 591797 of mood disorders (Duan and Zhu, 2020; Gao et al., 2020) . Thus, from the early stages of the pandemic, Chinese researchers found moderate and severe symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression in the Chinese population (Huang and Zhao, 2020) . The relationships between stress, anxiety, and depression have long been documented in the scientific literature. The theoretical models, supported by scientific evidence, link socioenvironmental stress with internal biological processes that drive the pathogenesis of depression (e.g., Slavich and Irwin, 2014; Park et al., 2019) . Longitudinal studies in young people also suggest that stress predicts depression (e.g., Agoston and Rudolph, 2011) . We know that in highly stressful situations, there is a close link between anxiety and depression (Díaz et al., 2012) , for instance, in people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, who often show high levels of fear and anxiety (Forbes et al., 2010) . Anxiety and depression are also known to be positively related (Jansson-Fröjmark and Lindblom, 2008) and both function as predictors of each other (Jacobson and Newman, 2017; Hovenkamp-Hermelink et al., 2019) .In the current crisis caused by the pandemic, the emerging literature is beginning to reveal certain differences based on gender and age. Women and younger people show higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and fear of COVID-19 (Huang and Zhao, 2020; Sandín et al., 2020) . However, most of these studies were carried out in samples of health workers (Pappa et al., 2020) , and much less is known about young people. Undergraduate students at university have been observed to be more fearful of COVID-19 than graduates (Reznik et al., 2020) . In addition, according to some studies, the symptoms of anxiety and depression among these students are increasing due to social distancing and lockdown laws (Chen et al., 2020a; Mazza et al., 2020; Santini et al., 2020) .After reviewing the emerging literature on the critical situation of global pandemic caused by COVID-19, it is clear that more research is needed on the possible predictors of depression. The focus of this study is university undergraduate students, who, in particular, seem to be a highly vulnerable population. We conducted the research in Ecuador, in order to learn more about the relationship between these psycho-social factors in a country potentially affected by high levels of stress and fear, with extremely restrictive measures of social distancing and lockdown in force, with high rates of new cases and deaths, and where the authorities face severe difficulties in meeting the health needs of its citizens.This study aims to (a) measure the levels of fear of COVID-19, anxiety, stress, and depression of university students and any possible differences depending on gender and (b) test a model of structural equations with the possible variables related to depression, such as fear of COVID-19, stress, and anxiety. The hypotheses we studied were that: (1) women will show higher levels of fear of COVID-19, stress, anxiety, and depression than men; (2) fear of COVID-19 will have a positive relationship with depression, mediated through anxiety; and (3) stress will be positively and directly related to depression, also mediated through anxiety.The population consisted of 78,059 students from four universities from the province of Manabí (Ecuador): Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabí, Universidad Técnica del Litoral, Universidad Técnica de Manabí, and Universidad Estatal del Sur de Manabí. The sampling was incidental, due to the accessibility. A total of 640 undergraduates took part in the research. Of the full sample, 72% were women (n = 461) and 28% men (n = 179). The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 47 years (M = 21.69; S.D = 4.093).We applied the Spanish version (Huarcaya-Victoria et al., 2020) of the FCV-19S (Ahorsu et al., 2020) , which features a Likerttype scale made up of seven items [e.g., My hands become clammy when I think about Coronavirus ]. The instrument presented high reliability for the study sample (α = 0.904).We also used the Spanish version (Fonseca-Pedrero et al., 2010) of the DASS-21 (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) , which reports on stress levels (irritability, edginess, and/or inability to relax), anxiety (nervousness or physiological tension), and depression (feeling a loss of interest in daily activities, in life or in oneself) in the university population. This instrument is composed of three subscales, each containing seven items: (a) F1 = Stress (e.g., I found it difficult to relax), (b) F2 = Anxiety (e.g., I was aware of dryness of my mouth), and (c) F3 = Depression (e.g., I could not seem to experience any positive feeling at all). The instrument showed good reliability for the study sample (α TOTAL = 0.954; α STRESS = 0.907; α ANXIETY = 0.861; and α DEPRESSION = 0.875).Before data collection, we first contacted the lecturers at several Ecuadorian universities who, under normal conditions, gave face-to-face lectures, but due to the COVID-19 lockdown, were currently teaching online. We organized a day on which the lecturers could respond to the online questionnaires. We also conferred with them via videoconferencing about how to complete the questionnaires and answered their queries.On the day the questionnaires were collected, in Ecuador, 39,098 cases of sickness and 3,358 deaths from COVID-19 were recorded. At the end of the period for collecting the questionnaires, the number of patients was 84,370 and the number of deaths was 5,657 (Ministerio de Salud Pública del Ecuador, 2020; Servicio Nacional de Gestión de Riesgos y Emergencias, 2020).Before the data were collected, all the participants, who were all over 18, gave their written informed consent. During the procedure, they were informed that no individual results, or any information that could identify them as study participants, would be published. Likewise, they were explicitly informed of the voluntary, anonymous, and confidential nature of the data provided and of the possibility of withdrawing at any time, without having to give any explanation or being penalized in any way. The questionnaires were completed individually and took approximately 15 min to complete.The study was carried out in line with the ethical criteria established in the Declaration of Helsinki. The procedure was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Directorate for Research and Social and Technological Innovation of the University Laica Eloy Alfaro of Manabí (Ecuador), code II-COVID-19ULEAM2020.Descriptive analyses with cut-off points were performed to analyze the mean scores on the DASS-21, and we took into account the cut-off points for the DASS-21 instrument given by other authors in order to obtain homologous samples of age, population, and culture. According to these authors, values of over 6 for stress and depression and 5 for anxiety showed the existence of mood disorders.Comparative analyses were also conducted to establish differences between the scores for fear of COVID-19, stress, anxiety, and depression according to gender, for which the Mann-Whitney U test of independent samples was used. These analyses were carried out using the statistical program SPSS v.20. The confidence level applied in all the analyses was 95% (p < 0.05) or 99% (p < 0.01), depending on the case. The effect size was calculated with Cohen's d.A Structural Equation Model was performed to find out which variables are related to depression in undergraduate university students, using the EQS 6.2 program. Taking into account the ordinal nature of the data and the absence of normality, we decided to generate a polychoric correlation matrix (Flora and Curran, 2004) and use the robust estimation method (Bentler, 2006) .To evaluate the fit of the model, we took into account the values of the Satorra-Bentler chi-square (x 2 S-B), the Satorra-Bentler chi-square divided by degrees of freedom (x 2 S-B/df; values ≤2 were considered as optimal) and other indices which are not affected by the sample size: Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Incremental Fit Index (IFI). As a criterion for assuming an adequate fit of the model, values of ≥0.95 in the above indices (Bentler, 1992) were established. For the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), values between 0.05 and 0.08 were considered suitable to indicate an acceptable fit and ≤0.05 to indicate a good fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999) .The results of the Mann-Whitney U test of independent samples showed the existence of significant differences between men and women in the fear of COVID-19 scores (see Table 1 ). The scores obtained from the FCV-19S were higher for women than for men. However, no statistically significant differences were detected for the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression between men and women studying in Ecuador.The results obtained for the model of depression in university undergraduates during lockdown showed optimal goodnessof-fit indices: χ 2 S-B(341) = 894.2207, p < 0.001; χ 2 S-B/df stood at a value of ≤3, which is considered as optimal (Hu and Bentler, 1999) Figure 1 shows the Structural Equation Model for the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and stress in depression, with anxiety taken as a mediator of these variables. The relationship between fear of COVID-19 and depression is not shown in the figure as it is not significant. Due to the absence of normality, the robust maximum likelihood estimation method was used for the model (Mardia coefficient = 250.8931).The model showed that the variables of fear of COVID-19 (β = −0.04; p < 0.05) and stress responses (β = 0.76; p < 0.05) have direct effects on anxiety during lockdown. The relationship between these variables accounts for 60.3% of the variance in anxiety.The model also revealed that the variables for stress (β = 0.37; p < 0.05) and anxiety (β = 0.57; p < 0.05) reveal direct effects on depression during lockdown. The relationship between these model variables accounts for 79.8% of the variance in depression.The standardized indirect effect values were: (a) for fear of COVID-19 > Anxiety > Depression = 0.023 and (b) for Stress > Anxiety > Depression = 0.43.High, direct correlation values were observed in the polychoric matrix between the fear scale and the DASS-21 subscales (see Table 2 ). Similarly, the scores obtained show the existence of affective states of stress (M = 6.89), anxiety (M = 5.53), and depression (M = 5.93), as high scores were found in our study. The primary objective of this research was to measure the levels of fear of COVID-19, anxiety, stress, and depression and their possible differences by gender among university students in Ecuador. It is clear that the participants, as a group, show high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, and the levels recorded are above the cut-off points described in the scientific literature for each of these phenomena in similar populations of young undergraduates (e.g., Román et al., 2016) . This shows that major psychological health problems exist among university students in the context of the COVID-19 lockdown, which is consistent with the moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression observed in the Chinese population in the early stages of the pandemic (Huang and Zhao, 2020) .Our first hypothesis has been partially corroborated. Female undergraduates suffer higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than their male counterparts, as observed in the few similar studies carried out in other countries (Huang and Zhao, 2020; Sandín et al., 2020) . However, no significant gender differences were found for levels of anxiety, stress, and depression, which does not concur with the observations of some studies carried out during the pandemic which show women to be more vulnerable to these disorders (e.g., Huang and Zhao, 2020; Sandín et al., 2020) .These findings provide new knowledge, since in most of the emergent scientific literature on this topic, these levels have been studied in health workers rather than undergraduates (Pappa et al., 2020) . We suggest that the academic demands of university studies and the uncertain outlook take its toll on their learning and evaluation processes, leading to emotions of anxiety, stress, and depression in both female and male students, regardless of their gender.The second main aim of the research was oriented toward studying how the influence of fear of COVID-19, stress, and anxiety relate to depression. We designed a model based on a review of the previous scientific literature and contrasted it with the collected data. The results obtained in the structural equations showed an excellent fit to the model. The model showed a good fit in both men and women. The second and third hypotheses of the study were, therefore, corroborated. The model shows how depression was directly and positively related by stress levels and indirectly through fear of COVID-19 and stress, mediated by the level of anxiety.The relationship we observed for fear of COVID-19 with depression is consistent with some of the previous studies (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Alyami et al., 2020; Tzur Bitan et al., 2020) . The relationships between fear of COVID-19 and anxiety (Mertens et al., 2020) and between anxiety and depression (Jansson-Fröjmark and Lindblom, 2008; Jacobson and Newman, 2017; Hovenkamp-Hermelink et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020a) have also been documented separately. However, the relationship of fear of COVID-19 with depression, mediated by anxiety, has not been described before, making this a novel contribution. In addition, the relationship of stress with depression we observed concurs with some of the previous studies (Agoston and Rudolph, 2011; Slavich and Irwin, 2014; Park et al., 2019) . The relationships between stress and anxiety and between anxiety and depression have been described previously (Díaz et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2020a) . However, the influence of stress on depression, mediated by anxiety, during the social isolation caused by the pandemic, has not been described before in the literature. Furthermore, the indirect effect of FCV-19 on anxiety and depression was less than the indirect effect of stress on anxiety and depression. The conditions in which people in Ecuador have to cope with the pandemic are extremely adverse in many ways. The rapid spread of the disease, the large number of people affected, the mounting number of deaths, a mistrust of the health system, ignorance, and disinformation may have all contributed significantly to the fact that young university students experience fear of COVID-19. This fear has been revealed as a factor that influences depression, and the effect of this fear on depression could be worsened by the existence of anxiety.Undergraduate students tend to feel more fear when they feel they are in a more vulnerable situation and in greater danger, since many of them live away from the family home, and are unable to return and/or live in poor conditions where it is difficult to stay healthy and make ends meet.Young female and male undergraduates are at a stage in their lives when they are planning their future, trying to find work, and trying to set up the conditions to become independent from their parents and fend for themselves. In the case of university students in Ecuador, most of them, even in normal conditions before the pandemic, were already making great sacrifices, together with their families, to meet the economic and academic requirements needed to be admitted to, follow, and make the most of a university education. Ecuador is a source country for emigration, due to the lack of job opportunities and its low standard of living and poor living conditions, which, due to the epidemic, are most likely to get worse.The learning and assessment processes in university studies have been changed, in most cases, from face-to-face classes to distance and/or online learning, which has led to greater difficulties among students to access learning and adapt to the new methods. Many undergraduates formerly worked to earn some extra money but have been unable to continue, due to lockdown. All of these issues may well have increased stress levels, influencing depression. The stress produced by these long-lasting, dramatic changes faced by young university students can directly lead to symptoms of depression or initially result in a state of anxiety that could later lead to depression.According to the results of this study, the uncertainty and the danger perceived by the undergraduates can become a fertile breeding ground for fear, stress, anxiety, and, as a result, depression. Knowing how complex the interactions are between these factors and worsening symptoms of depression, we urgently need to design intervention plans in universities to help these young people cope better with this type of situation.The contributions of this study reinforce the observations made in a previous study that the university undergraduate population is more vulnerable, in a psycho-social sense, in the situation of pandemic and lockdown, than that of university graduates (Reznik et al., 2020) . They also reinforce the conclusions drawn in some studies, which state that the lockdown measures have increased anxiety and depression among university undergraduates (Mazza et al., 2020; Santini et al., 2020) . Our findings show that women, within this group, need preferential attention as regards strategies or measures to alleviate and prevent fear of COVID-19.This study has certain limitations. The cross-sectional design, despite being suitable for the type of objectives we proposed, does not allow us to draw cause-effect conclusions. Future studies should be longitudinal to enable us to learn how the different factors affect the evolution of depression. The use of self-reports also has some limitations. The study was carried out in university students and the results cannot be generalized to the rest of the population. The sample is not balanced as regards gender, because it was incidental, which means that our interpretation of this variable is limited. The measurements used are all of the self-report type and subject to method variance effects and response biases, such as socially desirable responding. In future studies, this information-gathering technique should be supported by personal interviews. On the other hand, we consider that the instruments making up the self-report battery -which were previously validated and had good psychometric properties -were a success. In addition, another line of future research could study the relationship between the variables treated in this research and anxiety. Longitudinal studies could also be carried out to predict anxiety.This study has allowed us to study in depth the complexity of depression in a situation of lockdown due to the pandemic. To continue progressing in future studies on the subject, it would be better to take into account registration measurements for other subject variables related to economic, employment status, housing conditions, goods and/or resources, among others. These sociodemographic aspects could shed more light on other factors which may be protectors or precursors of depression in a complex system which seems to be interwoven with fear, stress, and anxiety. It could also serve as a better to guide possible prevention and mitigation measures and optimize resources for the most vulnerable people within the overall group of university undergraduates. Based on the model tested of depression in a pandemic, we propose different measures to prevent and alleviate this disorder. To reduce fear of COVID-19, it would be advisable to run convincing information campaigns about the disease, with training provided for its prevention and for effective coping strategies. Improving the health response could also help reduce fear, as there would be greater expectations of response in case of illness. Especially in the case of the university undergraduate population, the fear of COVID-19 could be increased by a feeling of inadequacy to face the difficult situation of the pandemic, by the lack of resources, to tackle a potential situation of disease and by poor or limited housing conditions, especially for undergraduate students living away from the family home.Many of these university undergraduates have become ill and some have seen relatives become ill or die from COVID-19. Support plans with effective measures are needed to improve the undergraduates' standard of living, eating habits, and living conditions. Many of them live in rooms or halls of residence in poor and/or overcrowded conditions. They should also be provided with internet access with sufficient bandwidth and the right hardware to be able to take part in distance learning. These steps could contribute to improving their ability to cope and/or to cushion the impact of these hardships.The role of anxiety as a mediator between fear and stress and depression could lead to one innovative recommendation based on what we have observed in the present study. A program of attention and/or psychological training for undergraduates could be introduced, especially geared toward controlling and overcoming anxiety. Reducing anxiety could go a long way to alleviating the possible impact of fear and stress on depression. It would be advisable for the educational authorities, private bodies, and universities to urgently design and implement measures to alleviate these effects which harm the psychological health of their students. A society which does not protect and promote its young people's health and development in the present puts its immediate future in jeopardy.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Ethical Committee of the Directorate for Research and Social and Technological Innovation of the University Laica Eloy Alfaro of Manabí (Ecuador).

1b7d9f1b232d7fb58cddb7f0608711f2f02a0e3c,Journal Pre-proof What we need to know about PPE associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the marine environment What we need to know about PPE associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the marine environment,"Plastic pollution is one of the most challenging issues of transboundary scale with millions of plastic items of multiple sizes, from nano to macro, being discharged into the oceans daily (Everaert et al., 2020) . The threats that plastic pollution poses to marine environments have been investigated for a long time and are well understood (Browne et al., 2011; Cole et al., 2011; Derraik, 2002; Kiessling et al., 2015) . However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the use of single-use plastics worldwide, being most of them in the form of personal protective equipment (PPE) (Patrício Silva et al., 2021; Prata et al., 2020) . This event issued new challenges to conventional waste management in order to face the massive production, use, and disposal of PPEs (Rhee, 2020; Saadat et al., 2020; Vanapalli et al., 2021) . Recent reports have evidenced the occurrence of PPEs in the marine environment (Stokes, 2020) , which will continue to exacerbate over time. This is an alarming, yet poorly understood, form of plastic pollution that have raised major concerns. In this short focus, we described the potential sources and fate of PPEs along with the suspected effects on the marine environment. Considering this, we suggested five research needs that will fill the current knowledge gaps regarding COVID-19associated PPE pollution and lay groundwork for better waste management and legislation.During the COVID-19 pandemic, countless single-use plastics materials and disposable PPE are needed as an essential measure to prevent the spread of the infection. Because of the magnitude of the emergency, medical care workers, as well as the general public, have been demanding PPEs, especially face masks, face shields, and gloves with no clear instructions and disposing mechanisms, and the production of face masks has increased more than 10 times in the last . The need for disposable and single-use plastic items during the global COVID-19 pandemic should be considered to minimize the non-envisioned consequences soon. Shim et al., 2018) . Regarding gloves, the most commercially available materials are PVC (1.16-1.58), latex, and nitrile. Lastly, face shields are also manufactured by applying a wide range of materials, including polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), PC, acetate, and PVC (Roberge, 2016) . Owing to the multiple materials that constitute common PPE, along with their nondegradability and persistence in the environment, it is deductible that their fate will vary depending on these characteristics (Fig. 1 ). As observed of other types of plastic pollutants, some PPE items are expected to remain in the environment for long periods of time, probably subject to surface oceanic currents, while others may become buried in the sediments, ultimately becoming part of the geological record (De-la-Torre et al., 2021). Like any other marine plastic litter, PPEs are expected to interact with the environment. It is safe to say that PPEs are likely to become a source of secondary microplastics in the marine environment (Aragaw, 2020; Fadare and Okoffo, 2020) . Since many surgical masks are produced by nanofiber electrospinning (Zafar et al., 2016) , micro-and nanofibers are most likely to be released under degradation conditions. Aragaw (2020) and Fadare and Okoffo (2020) analyzed face masks collected from Lake Tana in Ethiopia and a highway in Nigeria, respectively, by Fourier transformer infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Polymer identification by either library comparison or peak analysis revealed that the outer layer of the masks was composed of PP, while the inner layer by HDPE. Thus, the analyzed face masks are prone to release microplastic of these polymer types to the environment. Microplastics are widely known for their ubiquitous presence in the environment, bioavailability to organisms of all taxa, and detrimental effects (De-la-Torre, 2020a; Garcés-Ordóñez et al., 2020; Santillán et al., 2020) , like complications in the reproduction of aquatic organisms, consequently reducing their growth rate (de Souza Machado et al., 2018) . However, PPE items may also be ingested entirely by marine megafauna and apex predators, such as whales, sharks, turtles, mammals, or seabirds (Fernández Previous studies have determined the suitability of plastic litter as a habitat and vector of invasive species and microbial pathogens (Mantelatto et al., 2020; Rech et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019) . Under this context, PPE based on low-density polymers could serve as artificial substrates for rafting non-native or invasive species. It is unknown, however, whether PPEs are regarded as a litter of high rafting risk and the potential sinks. During their voyage, PPEs may be colonized by microbial consortia developing natural biofilms on the surfaces, which could become a reservoir for pathogenic microbes (Wingender and Flemming, 2011) . Additionally, biofilms can cause plastic items to lose buoyancy and sink, thus altering their fate in the environment (X. With the increasing production, use, and disposal of PPEs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that a great environmental challenge lays ahead. The occurrence of PPEs has already been evidenced in coastal areas in surveys carried out by the authors (Fig. 2, unpublished data). Despite this, there is still very little understanding of their true impact and the potential effects previously described. Although previous works with typical marine litter and microplastics may give some knowledge to the potential effects, fate, and interactions of COVID-19 PPE in the marine environment, it is unsure whether these new contaminants may follow the same behavior as typical marine litter (e.g., plastic bags, bottles, PS materials, textiles, Previous works have reported the occurrence of COVID-19 PPE in urban areas (Fadare and Okoffo, 2020; Prata et al., 2020; Ryan et al., 2020) , and some photos of PPE in the marine environment have been circulating on social media. Despite this, the magnitude of PPE pollution remains unknown. It is necessary to include this category of marine litter in monitoring plans, understand if the occurrence of PPE is increasing or decreasing over time, and how is the recent legislation that prevents the COVID-19 spread influences the abundance.Question 2: What are the main sources and drivers of PPEs to the marine environment? What is the fate of PPEs in the marine environment?It is clear that with the COVID-19 pandemic, the production, use, and disposal of PPE have increased tremendously. In order to take action against PPE entering the marine environment, research must first understand what the main sources and drivers are (e.g., beachgoers, fishing activity, poor waste management, river flow, oceanic currents, among others). Additionally, researchers must track PPE after entering the marine environment and understand their potential fate.Question 3: What is the abundance and types of microplastics, in terms of polymer, morphology, and size, generated by the degradation of PPE?It has been widely investigated that plastic material of any kind will degrade into smaller pieces, namely microplastics. Plastic materials will degrade at different rates depending on their physical and chemical properties (Min et al., 2020) . The most common PPEs, face masks, are mostly prepared by nanofiber electrospinning, which suggests that this PPE could be a source of microfibers. It is necessary to investigate if PPEs are an important source of microplastics and their main characteristics. Floating marine debris is a well-known driver of AIS. Various PPEs are composed of lowdensity polymers that may allow them to drift and become subject to oceanic currents.However, the likeliness of several species to colonize an artificial substrate depends on its specific characteristics (Chase et al., 2016; Pinochet et al., 2020) . Most PPEs are unique J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof compared to the typical marine litter in terms of surface morphology. Thus, their suitability as AIS drivers must be investigated.Question 5: Are PPEs a potential source of chemical pollutants in the marine environment? Are PPEs and the microplastics generated by them a potential vector of chemical pollutants in the marine environment?Plastic marine litter and microplastics are regarded as a source and vector of chemical contaminants (Q. Fred-Ahmadu et al., 2020) . The sorption behavior of chemicals on PPEs or PPE-derived microplastics will vary depending on several factors.Likewise, the leaching of harmful chemicals from PPE depends on the additives that are included in their production. It is necessary to investigate these two drivers of marine pollution with associated contaminants.The COVID-19 pandemic brought extra pressure to conventional solid waste management practices. Massive quantities of PPE plastic wastes have been generated worldwide with inappropriate disposal, landfilling, and/or incineration techniques that end up polluting the aquatic ecosystems. As a result, the amount of PPE wastes that reach the marine environment is exacerbating and will continue to do so. Here, we have discussed several issues that revolve around the pollution of the marine environment with COVID-19-related PPEs, including their source and fate in the environment, and the potential threats to the ecosystems. In light of the current lack of scientific knowledge regarding the impact of PPEs, we have proposed several research questions that need to be urgently addressed in order to elucidate the plastic-associated environmental burden of the pandemic. We believe that answering these questions may not pose a methodological barrier, as previous studies focusing on typical marine litter (other than PPE) are widespread in these lines of research. However, PPEs are potentially infectious objects and may require special handling and use of PPE by researchers themselves. Additionally, logistical constraints may surge during sampling campaigns or analytical procedures driven by unexpected lockdowns enforced by governments. Hence, contributing to filling these knowledge gaps will require significant efforts on behalf of researchers.",Peru,first author,2020-11-28,11

El riesgo de contagio por aerosoles y las incertidumbres clínicas sobre la eficacia, las potenciales secuelas y las circunstancias que podrían justificar la limitación del procedimiento durante la pandemia, han multiplicado las dudas éticas sobre cómo proceder en estos casos. Con base en fundamentos éticos y jurídicos, en el presente artículo se ofrece una guía práctica sobre cómo proceder en los casos de paro cardiopulmonar en el contexto de la pandemia. Los criterios de justicia, beneficio, no daño, respeto a la autonomía, precaución, integridad y transparencia, se presentan de forma organizada y práctica para la adopción de decisiones en materia de reanimación cardiopulmonar.Palabras clave: infecciones por coronavirus; reanimación cardiopulmonar; códigos de ética; guía de práctica clínica.The pandemic caused by COVID19 is associated with an increase in the number of cases of cardiorespiratory arrest, which has resulted in ethical concerns regarding the enforceability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, as well as the conditions to carry it out. The risk of aerosol transmission and the clinical uncertainties about the efficacy, the potential sequelae, and the circumstances that could justify limiting this procedure during the pandemic have multiplied the ethical doubts on how to proceed in these cases. Based on ethical and legal grounds, this paper offers a practical guide on how to proceed in the clinical setting in cases of cardiopulmonary arrest during the pandemic. The criteria of justice, benefit, no harm, respect for autonomy, precaution, integrity, and transparency are asserted in an organized and practical framework for decision-making regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Keywords: Coronavirus infections; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; codes of ethics; practice guideline.El incremento progresivo de casos de COVID-19 en Colombia conlleva el aumento paralelo en el número de casos de personas con paro cardiopulmonar que llegan a los servicios de urgencias o que ocurren durante las hospitalizaciones. Esta situación, sumada a la carencia de suficientes y adecuados elementos de protección personal en muchos de los hospitales y clínicas del país, suscita inquietudes en los equipos clínicos en torno a los criterios éticos y técnicos para decidir si se realizan o no maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar en casos específicos. Estas inquietudes responden al riesgo de contagio que los aerosoles y gotas producidas por los pacientes en paro durante el procedimiento de la reanimación cardiopulmonar representan para el personal clínico y para otros pacientes (1) . En este contexto surgen varias preguntas: ¿es éticamente aceptable que, aunque no exista certeza científica sobre la capacidad de los aerosoles de producir el contagio de COVID 19, se modifiquen las pautas ya establecidas para las maniobras de la reanimación cardiopulmonar? ¿Es éticamente obligatorio hacer la reanimación cardiopulmonar a todo paciente con paro cardiopulmonar en el marco de la pandemia de COVID-19? ¿Es éticamente aceptable que los equipos clínicos se nieguen a realizar maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar si no cuentan con suficientes y adecuados elementos de protección personal? La Organización Mundial de Salud (OMS) ha difundido evidencia sobre la elevada producción de aerosoles durante las maniobras de la reanimación cardiopulmonar, especialmente en la intubación (2) . Se desconoce aún si estos siempre portan virus o si su potencial para producir contagios aumenta o disminuye dependiendo del clima, la presión atmosférica o la ventilación local (3, 4) . A pesar de estas incertidumbres, en los casos en que la infección de COVID-19 amenace la vida de quienes la padecen, se justifica toda medida que proteja al personal clínico contra el riesgo de contagio por el virus, como bien lo ha señalado la OMS.Las dudas en cuanto a la pertinencia de las maniobras de la reanimación cardiopulmonar en el marco de la pandemia han revivido, por otra parte, discusiones en torno a las circunstancias clínicas en las que se justificaría realizar o no dichas maniobras. Efectivamente, en el contexto de estos debates se han determinado diversas circunstancias en las que la reanimación cardiopulmonar no se justificaría clínicamente, y se han discutido las formas de informar a los pacientes y a sus familias y comunidades, sobre la eficacia clínica y los resultados asociados con el procedimiento.Con base en principios éticos y constitucionales sólidamente establecidos, en este artículo se presentan pautas y recomendaciones para asegurar una práctica éticamente rigurosa de la reanimación cardiopulmonar en el marco de la pandemia de COVID-19.Las posibles respuestas a las preguntas éticas que se plantean sobre la reanimación cardiopulmonar en el marco de la pandemia de COVID-19 deben ajustarse a los siguientes principios ampliamente reconocidos en las sociedades democráticas.Este principio obliga a acatar la expresión de voluntad de los pacientes en relación con los cursos de acción que, en el ámbito clínico, les proponga el equipo de salud (5) . En el caso de la reanimación cardiopulmonar, este principio indica que esta es admisible solo si no se opone a la voluntad manifiesta del paciente, expresada mediante un documento de voluntad anticipada. Los pacientes pueden tomar decisiones bien sopesadas en esta materia solo si se les da información oportuna, suficiente y clara.Este principio exige que la atención médica esté justificada por el potencial beneficio del paciente. En el marco de las decisiones sobre la reanimación cardiopulmonar, este principio indica que estas se justifican únicamente cuando la reanimación cardiopulmonar suponga un beneficio real para el paciente según la lex artis (6) .Este principio ordena que a toda persona se le proteja de cualquier daño que pueda sobrevenir por causa de la atención médica. En el contexto que nos ocupa, este principio obliga a hacer la reanimación cardiopulmonar solo en aquellos casos en que esta no constituya una futilidad o una forma de encarnizamiento terapéutico (6, 7) . Su aplicación debe garantizar la protección del derecho a la integridad del paciente, que es conexo con el derecho a la salud.Este principio obliga a hacer la reanimación cardiopulmonar solo en aquellos casos en que no se exponga a los pacientes y al personal clínico y administrativo de las instituciones de salud a graves riesgos de salud (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . En el marco de este principio, deben garantizarse todas las medidas y equipos de protección personal al personal de salud antes de cualquier procedimiento que suponga riesgo de contagio para ellos, incluso cuando no exista certeza completa sobre la magnitud y el alcance de dicho riesgo (principio de precaución) (5, 8, 10) .Este principio obliga a garantizar a las personas las mejores condiciones de cuidado clínico disponibles, sin discriminación alguna. Cuando los recursos son limitados este principio implica priorizar a quienes los recibirán considerando el mayor potencial de beneficio clínico a corto y largo plazo y la equidad de oportunidades entre los ciudadanos para vivir un ciclo de vida completo. En el contexto que nos ocupa, este principio justifica limitar la reanimación cardiopulmonar cuando de su práctica se derive la demanda de recursos escasos, como camas en las unidades de cuidados intensivos, respiradores, etc., que deberían ser asignados a otras personas según los mencionados principios (11) .Este principio establece la obligación de proveer los cuidados hospitalarios con base en los más altos estándares de profesionalismo, procurando siempre el mejor cuidado posible para los pacientes (9) . En el caso que nos ocupa, este principio obliga a disponer de procedimientos y grupos adecuadamente entrenados (equipos de código azul o respuesta rápida) para una debida reanimación cardiopulmonar.Este principio exige que los criterios para la toma de decisiones sobre la reanimación cardiopulmonar sean pública y abiertamente conocidos por todos los involucrados a lo largo del proceso de atención hospitalaria, a saber, el equipo clínico, los pacientes, los familiares y las autoridades de salud (7, 8) .Como cualquier procedimiento hospitalario, la reanimación cardiopulmonar tiene sus indicaciones específicas. La eficacia clínica de ella, según lo reporta la American Heart Association (12), es muy baja. En los casos de paro cardiopulmonar dentro de los hospitales la tasa general de éxito, definida como la supervivencia de los pacientes al salir del hospital, oscila entre el 6,5 (en los casos de paro cardíaco no presenciado) y el 24 % (en el paro presenciado) (12, 13) . Por otra parte, en los estudios se ha evidenciado que solo entre el 1 y el 3 % de los pacientes con paro cardiopulmonar que reciben reanimación cardiopulmonar alcanza un nivel cognitivo cercano al que tenía antes (14, 15) . En el marco de la pandemia de COVID-19, la eficacia clínica de la reanimación cardiopulmonar podría ser aún más baja. En el estudio de Shao, et al., en Wuhan, solo el 13,2 % de los pacientes con COVID-19 recuperaron la actividad cardíaca espontánea; el 2,9 % sobrevivió un mes, y solo un paciente de 136 sobrevivió sin mayores secuelas neurológicas (16) . Además, como lo demuestran las estadísticas, en estos pacientes la mayoría de los paros no se asoció con la fibrilación ventricular sino con los ritmos no desfibrilables, que son de peor pronóstico (7).Sin embargo, los pacientes y la comunidad no suelen saber de la poca eficacia clínica de la reanimación cardiopulmonar y la alta probabilidad de secuelas neurocognitivas en los supervivientes. A menudo, las ideas del público sobre la eficacia de la reanimación cardiopulmonar provienen de las películas, en las que los porcentajes de eficacia clínica sin secuelas superan el 70 %, o de información inexacta difundida por los medios o las redes sociales (17) . Incluso entre los médicos, el pleno conocimiento sobre los niveles de eficacia clínica y las potenciales secuelas asociadas con la reanimación cardiopulmonar es poco común.En este contexto, y con base en las obligaciones indicadas por los principios de autonomía, beneficio y no daño, es necesario que los pacientes cuenten con información clara sobre la eficacia clínica de la reanimación cardiopulmonar, las secuelas que puede tener y las circunstancias en las que se justificaría abstenerse de realizar el procedimiento (7) . Solo así estarían en condiciones de decidir anticipadamente su voluntad ante estas situaciones (18, 19) . La educación pública sobre estas materias resulta, por lo tanto, crucial. La tarea de informar debe estar a cargo de los equipos tratantes con el apoyo de los comités clínicos de priorización (11) responsables de la asignación de recursos escasos, o de los comités de ética asistencial.La recomendación internacional estándar frente a la reanimación cardiopulmonar es la conformación de equipos de código azul o de respuesta rápida, los cuales deben incluir, idealmente, un anestesiólogo, un intensivista, un internista y una o dos enfermeras jefes, o una enfermera jefe y una auxiliar de enfermería, todos ellos con amplia experiencia (18) . En el marco de la pandemia de COVID-19 resulta especialmente crucial seguir esta recomendación sobre el número de integrantes y las características de los equipos de respuesta rápida para asegurar la calidad del procedimiento de la reanimación cardiopulmonar, pues se sabe que los equipos de protección personal aumentan la carga física y los niveles de cansancio del personal clínico.Los principios éticos explicados en el segundo apartado se traducen en mandatos específicos frente a las decisiones en torno a la reanimación cardiopulmonar y deben acatarse para el manejo clínico de todos los pacientes, es decir, tanto los afectados por la COVID-19 como los no infectados. Según estos principios, la reanimación cardiopulmonar es éticamente aceptable mientras: a. no menoscabe las pautas de asignación justa de recursos sanitarios escasos, b. no contravenga las decisiones autónomas de los pacientes, c. no se lleve a cabo sin que los equipos de respuesta rápida cuenten con todos los equipos de protección personal necesarios para protegerse del contagio por el virus, y d. no suponga un modo de encarnizamiento terapéutico.Estos mandatos deberán aplicarse en estricto orden.Cuando haya escasez de respiradores no deben realizarse maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar en aquellos pacientes que no hayan sido priorizados con base en las reglas de asignación éticamente justificadas, pues eventualmente requerirían de respiradores que pueden no estar disponibles (11) . A los pacientes que no tengan prioridad se les deben garantizar todas las medidas de cuidado paliativo y confort físico, emocional y espiritual que requieran durante el final de su vida (6).A todo paciente que ingrese al hospital se le debe preguntar si cuenta con una declaración escrita de voluntad anticipada sobre la reanimación cardiopulmonar. Si ese es el caso, debe dejarse constancia de ella en la historia clínica (5, 19) . Si dicha declaración no se ha hecho, tras confirmar que el paciente no quedará exceptuado de la asignación de respiradores en caso de ser escasos y después de informarle sobre la eficacia y las secuelas potenciales, se le debe preguntar si, llegado el caso, aceptaría que se le practiquen maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar. Su decisión debe quedar consignada en la historia clínica, con su firma y la de un testigo. Si los pacientes están en situación de incompetencia, se les debe preguntar a sus familias si el paciente ha dejado por escrito su voluntad anticipada sobre la reanimación cardiopulmonar. Si no se cuenta con ella, se presumirá que el paciente consiente con el procedimiento de reanimación cardiopulmonar siempre que no existan razones para limitarlo (5, 19) . Esta misma presunción aplicará a todo paciente que ingrese al hospital en paro cardiopulmonar y que no disponga de una declaración de voluntad anticipada escrita. Se trata, así, de garantizar que no se practique la reanimación cardiopulmonar de un modo que deshonre el principio de dignidad y autonomía de los pacientes.Antes de llevar a cabo maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar es mandatorio que el equipo a cargo cuente con los elementos de protección personal necesarios para realizarlas bajo condiciones adecuadas de bioseguridad (1, 6, 9) . Si no se dispone de estos, llevar a cabo maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar resultaría pugnante con el principio de no daño y los derechos a la vida y a la integridad física del equipo clínico y de otros pacientes, principios estos conexos con el de este apartado (10, 18) . Por las mismas razones, se impone restringir y limitar estrictamente al acceso del equipo de respuesta rápida a la zona destinada a la reanimación cardiopulmonar (5, 7, 8) , así como garantizar adecuados sistemas de respiración asistida en dichas áreas.Por último, es fundamental que no se realice la reanimación cardiopulmonar cuando entrañe un modo de encarnizamiento terapéutico, es decir, cuando resulte fútil (incluso si ello contraviene la voluntad de la familia) (6) , lo cual sucedería en los siguientes casos de paro cardiopulmonar.i. Cuando los pacientes tengan comorbilidades asociadas con una supervivencia menor a un año o en situaciones de grave fragilidad. Para determinar los casos de grave fragilidad puede emplearse la Clinical Frailty Scale (puntuación igual o mayor de 6) (18). ii. Si el paciente con COVID-19 se encuentra en una unidad de cuidados intensivos en proceso de deterioro por incrementos de los parámetros contemplados en la escala de Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) o en la Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD2). iii. Si el paciente es mayor de 85 años. iv. Si el paciente llega en paro cardiopulmonar, se le hayan hecho maniobras previas de reanimación cardiopulmonar o no, y tras más de 20 minutos de haberse presentado el paro. v. Si no se dispone de los equipos de respiración asistida y cuidado intensivo requeridos para darle continuidad al tratamiento, es decir, lo que se conoce como ""cadena de supervivencia"" .Con el fin de evitar la futilidad del procedimiento, varios autores recomiendan también que, cuando se hayan completado 20 minutos de maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar o cinco desfibrilaciones sin resultado, se detenga el procedimiento (18) .Debido a que en el momento de la reanimación cardiopulmonar se generan aerosoles, es necesario que el equipo de reanimación cuente con los equipos de protección personal adecuados para así reducir el riesgo de exposición (4, 6, 8) . Estos equipos son diferentes a los usados en la atención rutinaria (tapabocas convencionales), tal como lo establecen los lineamientos del Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social y el Consenso ACIN-IETS de mayo de 2020 (20) , además, siempre son de uso individual y por ningún motivo podrán compartirse (2) .Los decretos 488 (21) y 500 (22) de 2020 de la Presidencia de la República han establecido, por otra parte, que es obligación de las administradoras de riesgos laborales (ARL) suministrar estos equipos de forma correcta, suficiente y oportuna. Corresponderá al empleador exigir a las ARL, mediante las medidas pertinentes, el suministro pleno de los equipos de protección personal al equipo de salud.En el marco de la pandemia de COVID-19 es necesario adoptar pautas éticas sólidas para orientar en cada caso la decisión de recurrir a las maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar o no. En este documento el propósito ha sido presentarlas de manera sistemática. Las situaciones específicas y la disponibilidad de recursos en cada lugar obligan, sin embargo, a que estas pautas sean discutidas por los equipos clínicos a cargo de las maniobras de ella y adaptadas a su realidad particular. Este proceso de apropiación habrá de acompañarse de planes locales que incluyan un completo alistamiento de los equipos de respuesta rápida y la delimitación de zonas confinadas para la reanimación cardiopulmonar en los servicios de urgencias, así como la actualización de los equipos tratantes en las buenas prácticas de comunicación con los pacientes y familiares, la implementación de programas de información a la comunidad en materia de reanimación cardiopulmonar y, especialmente, la provisión suficiente y adecuada de elementos de protección personal a los equipos clínicos a cargo de los pacientes (7, 8) .Como se ha indicado, existen razones éticas sólidas para condicionar la reanimación cardiopulmonar a la disponibilidad suficiente y adecuada de estos elementos para los equipos de respuesta rápida en todos los hospitales públicos y privados del país. Esperamos que esta compilación contribuya a que las autoridades sanitarias cobren plena conciencia de la obligación ética de dar la protección debida a todo el personal clínico hospitalario.",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-15,11

Therefore, the use of platforms that provide increased similarity to the in vivo physiology and pathology can contribute to advances in the treatments of COVID-19.In the past years, the three-dimensional (3D) approach has been widely used in cell culture studies, due to their increased capacity of simulating with greater fidelity the cellular microenvironment, as compared to the 2D cell culture, leading to improved cell responses regarding morphology, proliferation capacity, and gene expression profiles [8] . With the advances of tissue engineering, novel technologies have emerged and been used as more realistic in vitro models, allowing the construction of complex cytoarchitecture, with better representation of cell heterogeneity, extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, and functionality of native tissues [9] . 3D in vitro models consist of scaffold-free (spheroids and organoids) or scaffold-based (3D scaffolding and 3D bioprinting) systems used to study infectivity, replication kinetics, and host-viral interactions of many types of viruses, such as influenza [10, 11] , syncytial [12] , adenovirus [13] , norovirus [14] , Zika [15] , and more recently, SARS-CoV-2 [16] , showing increased physiological relevance as compared to 2D models.Due to the severity and the speed of spread of the pandemic, strategies that contribute to the development of vaccines and drugs, as well as repositioning of currently used drugs, are urgently needed. In this work, we aimed to review the engineered 3D models used as in vitro platforms to study infections, host-virus interactions, and drug screening. We believe that these engineered models have great potential to shed light on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to aid development of vaccines and screen antivirals to treat COVID- 19. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV-2, such as the heart, causing myocarditis [24] , and the central nervous system, causing headache, anosmia, ageusia, encephalitis and vascular events [25, 26] .Although the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung and other organs have not been fully elucidated, the literature reports that the virus likely has tropism for different cell types and, therefore, multiple infection routes. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was described as the key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections by fusion glycoprotein spike (S) binding and entering the host cell via endocytosis [3, 27] . As ACE2 is highly expressed in mammalian organs, it may lead to high invasiveness and multiple tissue damage [28] . It was reported that ACE2 presents a higher affinity with the new coronavirus than with SARS-CoV, which may explain the increased infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the previous virus [29] . It is important to highlight the role of the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a cellular protease which cleaves SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein protein enabling rapid viral internalization and accelerating SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics in TMPRSS2expressing cells [30] . More recently, a new route of infection was described by Wang and collaborators, where S protein binds the transmembrane glycoprotein CD147, allowing the virus to enter into the host cell [31] . We emphasize that the work still needs peer review and should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, CD147-S route may represent a potential alternative for the development of specific antiviral drugs [32] .Due to the rapid spread and contamination, severity of symptoms, mortality rate, and the unknown long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the scientific community joined efforts to understand the mechanisms involved in COVID-19 pathogenicity, transmission, and viral infection of multiple organs, while working on the development of vaccines and new drugs. For these reasons, in vitro models using different cell lines J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f became a very useful and powerful tool to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 studies and discoveries. These models are proven to efficiently mimic the physiology of native tissues, contributing to the studies of several types of diseases, including viral infections in a more physiologic manner [33, 34] .Due to the seriousness of the pandemic situation caused by COVID-19, the rapid development of in vitro models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection was necessary in order to assist clinical approaches and treatments through the knowledge acquired in basic research, almost in real time. For these purposes, 2D monolayers have been extensively used to study SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and pathogenesis analysis, drug screening and preclinical evaluation of antiviral potential, and cytopathic effect of candidate molecules [35] .Vero cells E6 cells, isolated from African green monkeys kidneys, are susceptible to many types of viruses, including the SARS-CoV [36] and SARS-CoV-2 [37] . They produce high viral titers, probably due to the expressive presence of ACE-2 in their apical region, and because these cells do not produce type I interferons (IFN) when infected by several viruses. This phenomenon is due to a deletion of ~ 9 Mbp deletion on chromosome 12, which when in homozygosis, results in a more permissive phenotype for viruses. Thus, the IFN deficiency allows SARS-CoV-2 to replicate sustainably in Vero cells [38] . This cell line was used in some important studies involving SARS-Cov-2, such as for identifying the ACE2 as the functional receptor of SARS-CoV, for demonstrating that anti-ACE2 acted as an inhibitor of viral replication J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in these cells [5] , for identifying other potential routes of infection [31] , and for testing the inhibition potential of antiviral candidates [6] . However, the highly permissive phenotype Vero cells have some limitations, as it does not accurately represent the pathogenesis of COVID-19, as its initial target organs are the air and pulmonary epithelia and the venous endothelium. Therefore, other cell types seem to serve as in vitro models that may better recapitulate the real physiology of the disease.Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cells (HAE) are now commercially available and have been of great utility in studies involving coronaviruses. Besides being efficient for SARS-CoV-2 (and other similar viruses) isolation, these cells mimic infected human lung cells, and it is clearly possible to observe cytopathic effects about 96 hours after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, an important disadvantage is that these cells have limited replication capacity, requiring constantly acquisition of new stocks [20, 39] .Besides HAE, it was reported that primary human nasal epithelial, large airway epithelial (bronchi and large airway epithelial), lower airway epithelial (bronchiolar and small airway epithelial) [40] , type I and type II pneumocytes (AT1 and AT2) [41] , and primary enterocytes [42, 43] supports SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, as well as primary neurons and neural stem cells (NSCs) [44, 45] . However, obtaining all these cell types is difficult and limited, besides the high costs.To circumvent this problem, many studies have used the most diverse types of proliferating cells lineages, usually derived from tissue-specific carcinomas. Among them, we can highlight other cell lines recently used in studies involving SARS-CoV-2, such as the pulmonary cell lines BEAS-2B (human bronchial epithelium) and A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells). BEAS-2B, appears to have an accelerated viral replication kinetics, in addition to produce higher viral loads than A549, probably due to its higher ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels [30] . Calu-3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cells, another human pulmonary cell lineage, isolated from non-small cell lung cancer, has shown to have great permissiveness and increased viral load when infected with SARS-CoV-2, becoming a promising cell line to be used in COVID-19 in vitro studies [46] . Other cell lineages, mainly Caco-2 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma) andHEK293T (human embryonic kidney (HEK) grown in tissue culture) are rising as alternative models for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection to study the viral tropism of human non-pulmonary cells [47, 48] . However, both cell lines present low levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication in culture.Although these cell lineages are mainly used in 2D cell culture approach, they are promising elements for the biofabrication of in vitro 3D models, which can better represent the hosts' physiological environment where SARS-CoV-2 infection naturally occurs.Conventional 2D cell cultures have greatly contributed to the understanding of host cell-virus interactions, mechanisms of virus transmission, replication, and adaptation, as well as screening of antiviral drugs [6, 37] . However, this model have some limitations that rely on the difficulty of reconstituting the accurate and complex microenvironment found in living organisms. Cell-cell junctions, apical-basal polarity, and cell communication through gradients of endogenous growth factors, chemokines, and nutrients may be inadequate to guarantee the similarity with an in vivo system [7] .These limitations exemplify the necessity to develop new platforms for in vitro modeling [7, 49] . A 3D cell culture approach represents a more realistic environment for cells, contributing to the cell adhesion, maintenance of cytoarchitecture, perception of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the mechanical stimulus, and cell signaling, which in turn, regulate functional responses that differ from traditional 2D cultures [50] .Many works in the literature reported comparative studies of monolayer cells and 3D cultures infected with different types of viruses, such as poxviruses [51, 52] , adenovirus [53] , hepatitis B and C [53, 54] , Zika [15, 55] and influenza [10] . These works showed that different approaches of 3D cell culture, such as spheroids, organoids, 3D scaffolds and bioprinted structures were able to mimic many types of tissues using different cell lines, presenting higher sensitivity in virus isolation and specificity of several antiviral compounds than conventional 2D models. Therefore, scaffold-free or scaffold-based 3D cell culture may serve as better in vitro models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms, replication, pathophysiology of injured organs, and tissues, and to provide high-throughput drug screening strategies ( Figure 1 ). Spheroids are cellular aggregates that self-assemble when cultured on nonadhesive surfaces, preserving cell-cell interactions and tissue-specific phenotype [33] .This cell culture method is widely used in studies of virus infection [12, 13, [55] [56] [57] , being fabricated by culturing cells in non-adherent cell culture flasks and wells [58] , non-adherent spheroid molds [59] , bioreactors [60] or by the hanging drop method [53] .cells, among other cell lines, aiming to study the sensitivity and isolation of cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus [53] . Results showed that 3D spheroids, infected by the three viruses, were more sensitive to infection than 2D monolayers of the same cell lines, in addition to express viral proteins faster, probably due to the increased number of viral receptors in the spheroids. Recently, Saleh et al.fabricated A549 spheroids by seeding the cells in an ultra-low attachment 96-well plate to mimic the alveolar tissue and study respiratory syncytial virus pathogenesis [12] .Results showed that the 3D model was permissive to the virus, leading to syncytia spread towards the nucleus and fast cell death at the core of the spheroids, suggesting the model is promising for studies of infections in vitro. Neurospheres, fabricated using neural stem cells cultured in a non-adherent surface, were used to study molecular mechanisms implicated in brain malformation due to Zika virus infection [15, 61] . In these studies, it was observed that the viral Although spheroids have shown an increased capacity to respond to virus infection over 2D monolayers, they still lack the biological complexity that may be found in other 3D models that possess increased complexity, such as organoids.Organoids are self-organizing structures established from organ-specific cell types [iPSCs or multipotent adult tissue stem cells (ASCs)] that retain multicellular diversity, cytoarchitecture at early development, and functional hallmarks to their counterpart organs and tissues in vivo [63] . These complex 3D culture systems have been used to mimic multiple types of tissues, such as brain, lung, intestine, and liver to study host-virus interactions for important viruses, such as the Zika [15, 64] , influenza viruses [11] , noroviruses [14] , hepatitis C [65] , and MERS-CoV [66] . In all cases, results showed that the organoids simulated the native tissues morphologically and functionally, indicating they are suitable to be used as in vitro models to study infectivity.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, many studies involving SARS-CoV-2-host interactions using organoids have been reported, with results indicating their potential to contribute to the development of treatments and drug candidates [67] .The respiratory tract is the first target for SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory symptoms correspond to the main clinical presentation of COVID-19. In a preliminary study, human bronchial organoids fabricated using commercial human bronchial epithelial cells presented high expression of ACE2 and were successfully infected by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV-2, which was also replicated in this model [68] . In addition, camostat, a therapeutic candidate against COVID-19 acting through transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibition, was tested and results showed that, after the treatment of infected organoids, SARS-CoV-2 viral genome reduced to 2%. Lung organoids were also used to high throughput screen the FDA-approved drugs imatinib, mycophenolic acid, quinacrine dihydrochloride, and chloroquine, and evaluate their capacity to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry [69] . Reproduced with permission from AAAS [42] .Liver abnormalities have become a common hallmark in COVID-19 patients [73, 74] . Recently, it was reported that cholangiocytes, epithelial cells of the bile ducts that express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are subject to the SARS-CoV-2 infection [30, 75] . Brain organoids have also been biofabricate using human iPSCs to study brain cells behavior in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. For instance, Jacob et al. studied SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism using human iPSC-derived brain organoids as an in vitro infection platform [77] . In this study, organoids of specific brain regions, such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and midibrain were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 for 8 h.Results showed an increased number of neurons infected in all organoids, as compared to other neural cell types, and a stabilization of the number of infected cells, indicating that the virus may not spread among neurons. Another preliminary study reported the fabrication of human iPSCs-derived brain organoids to study the neurodegenerative effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central nervous system [78] . In this work, the virus also preferably targeted human cortical neurons instead of neural stem cells within the brain Moreover, they demonstrated that the in vitro infection was able to induce metabolic changes in these cells [45] .As aerosol transmission is the main mechanism of spreading the virus, Makovoz et al. aimed to study the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for ocular cell types in eye organoids, as a potential entry route [79] . The organoid produced from human pluripotent stem cell enabled the researchers to observe SARS-CoV-2 RNA present in several eye regions, such as cornea, sclera, limbus iris, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid, with low replication in the central cornea. In addition, due to the high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, ocular surface ectoderm was also permissive to virus infection, suggesting the risk of contamination by SARS-CoV-2 regardless wearing facemasks.Some of the challenges in culturing organoids are related to the lack of vascularization, neuronal circuit, immune system, reproducibility, and preclinical validation [80] [81] [82] . However, the results discussed above indicate that organoids not only are capable of recapitulate the native tissue morphology, physiology, and functionality, but also may substantially contribute to studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms, drug screening and disease research.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fIn tissue engineering, 3D scaffold-based models present some advantages over spheroids and organoids, especially due to the presence of biomaterials that simulate the ECM microenvironment. This system can be fabricated using many types of biocompatible materials, naturally present in the ECM or not, providing mechanical strength, physical stability, and biological features that stimulate cell behavior, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation [83] . In SARS-CoV-2 infection studies, the presence of an ECM may have important effects on cellular responses, as coronaviruses bind to ECM components, such as heparan sulfate, to assist its infection in the host [84] [85] [86] .Aiming the fabrication of a more realistic model of lung tissue to study influenza A infections, Bhowmick et al. used airway epithelial cells mixed to a collagen-chitosan polymeric blend, simulating the alveolar barrier structure [10] . Cells cultured in the 3D matrix presented increased resemblance to the native tissue concerning cell morphology, specific markers expression, and differentiation, as compared to a 2Dculture. In addition, the 3D model showed immune responses that better resembled that of the native system when infected with H1N1 and H3N2 strains. Reproduced with permission from Elsevier [52] .The 3D bioprinting is an emerging technology that has been widely employed in the tissue engineering field aiming to optimize the conventional 3D cell culture. Due to its capacity to deposit layer-by-layer cells and biomaterials in an organized and automatized manner, through a computer-aided process, the fabrication of complex architectures that mimic the structure of organs and tissues became possible [87, 88] .Several bioprinting methods have been employed to construct mimetic tissues, each presenting advantages and limitations. For instance, extrusion-based bioprinting, inkjet/drop-on-demand, laser-assisted, stereolithography, and electronspinning-based are some methods used in biofabrication, being the extrusion-based bioprinting technique the most commonly used, due to its easy of handling and low cost [89, 90] .Therefore, the construction of more realistic models in terms of cell heterogeneity, ECM presence, and the complex organization has greatly improved the physiological and pathological cell microenvironment, contributing significantly to cell response and prediction of results of in vitro studies [91] , including those involving viral infections [92] [93] [94] .To study the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung, the alveolar tissue can be mimicked using a 3D bioprinted airway epithelium [95, 96] . Horvath et al.reported the 3D bioprinting of an alveolar barrier by using a micro-extrusion bioprinter [95] . The biofabricated structure was morphologically similar to the native tissue, being highly organized in a thin layer. On the other hand, cells manually mixed to Matrigel TM J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f formed multi-layered clusters with tick ECM between the epithelial and endothelial cells, which can affect the permeability of biomolecules. This work showed that 3Dbioprinting technology offers relevant advantages over conventional 3D scaffolding, with potential to be used for testing drug candidates that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The effects of influenza A infection was modeled using an engineered respiratory tract [94] . For this, human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells were embedded in a polymeric blend composed of gelatin (to assure printability), alginate (for structural stability), and Matrigel TM (to assure biocompatibility), being extruded using microextrusion bioprinting technology ( Figure 5A ). Results showed that the virus was homogeneously distributed throughout the bioprinted construct, which reflects the natural condition of infection ( Figure 5B) As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to affect thousands of people around the world, it is urgent the development of strategies that lead to effective treatments and vaccines. Although 2D conventional cell culture has shown to be an important tool in virology studies, this model fails in replicating the cellular microenvironment in terms of architecture, composition, physiological function, and mechanical stimulus, which may lead to low prediction of results [7] . The establishment of 3D cell culture and the biofabrication of tissue-like structures can mimic the complex microenvironment found in the many organs affected by SARS-CoV-2 with higher accuracy, providing robust data to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms of virus infection, replication kinetics, and host-virus interaction.In this work, we reviewed the strategies offered by the tissue engineering field to biofabricate useful in vitro 3D models to understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spheroids have been an important tool to study the effects of Zika virus in neurogenesis during brain development [15, 55] , and have shown cytopathic effects in lung and brain spheroids in response to SARS-CoV infection [60] . Given the numerous evidences of neurological disorders in COVID-19, neurospheres can elucidate the mechanisms of neural injury. Although spheroids lack in biological function and structure complexity, they can be fabricated by using simple methodologies. Organoids, in contrast, are more complex and organized in terms of structure and composition, resembling the natural environment of the target organ [80] . Due to their J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cytoarchitecture, organoids have been widely used to construct mimetic organs to study SARS-CoV-2 and its subsequent effects after infection. Although this model face some limitations [82, 97] , similarities to native tissues morphology, physiology, and functionality are leading to reliable results, which can accelerate the process of developing new drugs and consequent control of the disease.Regarding scaffold-based strategies, these 3D models have been used to study the infectivity of different types of viruses, indicating they can greatly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. By using 3D bioprinting technology, it is possible to fabricate complex architectures that resembles native tissues in a reproducible manner, providing molecular and cellular machinery to effectively replicate SARS-CoV-2, holding promises to future drug tests [95] .Based on results of previous studies, in vitro 3D models are attractive alternatives to be used in virology, and this review hopes to shed light on different strategies to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in human organs. We believe that the 3D cell culture approach can greatly contribute to the development of faster diagnostics and therapeutics, due to its capacity to mimic with greater fidelity the in vivo system, providing increased prediction of results and faster translational applications to treat patients affected by SARS-CoV-2.The authors declare no conflict of interest.",Brazil,first author,2020-11-21,11
4e142fa47a6f87241c3fa7d624adaf3d6d34ae57,Epidemiology and Infection Dynamic quarantine: a comparative analysis of the Chilean public health response to COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic that began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] has rapidly spread to the rest of the globe during 2020, reaching unprecedented proportions. As of 15 May 2020, 4 338 658 cases have been confirmed, with 297 119 deaths [2] . Contending with this novel threat is a challenge that every country with confirmed cases must face. Given the broad spectrum of diverse public health strategies and initiatives taken by each country, it is worth addressing the effectiveness and efficiency of such measures.Some countries have managed to control the pandemic through specific strategies [3] that have significantly decreased the daily transmission rate (DTR), defined as the daily percentage of growth of the cumulative confirmed cases, to values close to 0.2%. Of course, a nominal zero is very hard to achieve, since there is still no vaccine or treatment that would allow the complete eradication of the disease. However, it is worth mentioning that great efforts are being made by the scientific community to find an effective treatment for COVID-19 [4, 5] . In this context, three countries have reached a 0.2% DTR, South Korea, Germany and New Zealand [6] , as of the 15 May when this analysis was being performed. All of them have very different but equally effective policies, and they will be taken as a reference for our analysis.The implementation of control measures disrupts the normal functioning of a country in terms of the health, economic, social and psychological conditions of their population [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . At this time, controlling the spread of the virus is a state priority in every country with confirmed cases. Indeed, low-and middle-income countries cannot adopt some of the measures that high-income countries have because resource availability and country preparedness vary dramatically [12] . Therefore, in this paper, the response of a developing country, Chile, is analysed. This country has adopted a mixed control strategy, using relatively massive testing and dynamic quarantines [13, 14] . Herein, dynamic quarantine is defined as the Chilean strategy of locking down specific neighbourhoods of certain cities based on the number of active cases in the territory. This lockdown is then weekly reassessed and lifted, prolonged or expanded as a function of these active cases. However, specific cutoff points for such measures are not clearly established, and decision-taking relies heavily on the Ministry of Health.With this being said, this paper focuses on the Chilean public health response, to detect the advantages and shortcomings of the strategy in improving disease control and to compare Chile's experience to that of countries that have already relatively controlled the progression of the disease. This analysis could guide other countries in implementing a particular dynamic quarantine strategy, leaving the groundwork for the various stages of the pandemic's spread at the country level and then set parameters for international success. The objective is to calculate the degree of efficiency of the dynamic quarantine strategy applied in Chile. The primary indicator to determine this is the DTR, measured as a percentage, together with the cumulative number of confirmed cases, among other indicators.The paper is organised as follows: 'Methods' section provides a description of the viral spreading stages. 'Dynamic quarantine strategy' section analyses the case of Chile in detail. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the results are presented in the section 'Final remarks'.Through the analysis of the available country-level data, four stages in the evolution of the pandemic can be identified. These stages are established to facilitate the understanding of the behaviour of the outbreak based on the DTR. For this measure, an empirical approach was taken, and countries with successful experiences fighting the pandemic, such as South Korea, Germany and New Zealand, were chosen as the leading example. From these, some patterns on the behaviour of the outbreak that consistently repeats across countries were identified, as shown in Figure 1 . Based on these observations, we propose the following stages: the stochastic uptake stage, exponential growth phase, intervention phase and finally a new growth regime. (I) The first stage has been defined as the stochastic uptake, in which few cases appear and can be seen like an incipient stage. This is the period at which the virus is just arriving in a particular country and where cases are emerging slowly, sometimes parcelled out over time. This process can be assumed to be a problem of misinformation and a lack of established control, where there is likely to be an underestimation of the real cases. (II) The second stage is the exponential growth phase. Here, the disease settles in the country, cases start to rise exponentially fast and at the same time, initial control measures begin to be established as part of the state policy. However, there is not yet an established or ongoing response strategy, and a rapid advance of the virus is detected, with DTRs above 20%. (III) Then comes the strategic phase, which is called intervention. In this stage, the states implement their control strategies and begin to flatten the infection curve to some extent. Normally, if the strategies are correctly implemented, after a relatively short to medium length of time, a drastic decrease in the rate of infection should be observed. The beginning of this stage is marked by the last significant peak in the DTR before it starts a consistent and gradual decrease. (IV) When the strategies have been well established, a new growth regime appears in the confirmed cases, in which a relative control can be reached. At this point, the DTR drops below 2% and can be as low as 0.1%. This threshold was set empirically. In the leading examples mentioned above, once the country reached this 2% DTR, it did not surpass it again during the time considered in this analysis. In stage IV, the disease has been successfully contained. However, in the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment, it does not disappear, and there will always be a remnant. Therefore, it should be expected that COVID-19 will be a new constant pathology that will be present in the healthcare setting in the medium to long term [5] . Of course, it should be noted that if countries' strategies change, possible re-emerging outbreaks and increased rates of contagion may occur. A more detailed analysis of the countries is available in the Supplementary material. It is important to remark that Chile has not achieved the relative control stage Gonzalo Grebe et al.because, as can be observed in Figure 1 , the strategies implemented have not been able to decrease the DTR below the limit of 2% DTR, and it has remained above this mark.In Latin America, there was more time and information available to set up a response. The first case was reported in Brazil on 26 February 2020 [15] , 57 days after the WHO was first notified [16] . However, Brazil has a lower hospital capacity and nationwide preparedness compared to developed countries [17] , making timely containment of the pandemic even more necessary. With the information available at the time, different strategies were implemented. In the cases of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, total quarantine was established when the total number of confirmed cases was still low. Some of these countries have been more successful compared to others in containing the DTR using this classic method. However, this will be left out of the analysis of this paper.A unique case among the responses in Latin American countries was Chile. This country took partially timely actions, with a mixed strategy. Chile implemented mass testing, which resulted in a continuous increase in its testing capacity. This grew from 0.2 tests per 1000 individuals on the 8th of April to 0.6 on the 15th of May, making it the country in Latin America with the highest testing capacity per individual [18] . However, it is crucial to highlight that this testing capacity was not as massive as the testing capacity in higher-income countries. Public, private and university laboratories were in charge of the testing effort. The distribution of testing was concentrated in the most populated urban areas, and the Metropolitan Region (MR) was the region with the most tests performed [19] . In fact, the MR holds 65% of the total tests performed at the national level between 9 April and 15 May. Unfortunately, it is not possible to accurately track the tests performed by region, since some samples were processed at a different region from where the sample was originally from. From this, if a case is confirmed, then the case is counted as confirmed case in the region from which the sample was originally from; however, if the test is negative, then it is counted as a test performed at the region where the sample was processed. Let us also remark that the average daily testing was 39 tests per 100 000 persons in the aforementioned time window [19] . In the present study period, a confirmed case is defined as a person with symptoms and a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction result, and testing policy allows only individuals with symptoms to access such tests [20] . On the other hand, part of the strategy was to close educational establishments early, to close all nonessential business and to quickly declare a state of emergency, with curfew declared between 10 pm and 5 am [21, 22] . This partially restricted the mobility of people for several focused hours at night and prevented large gatherings during that period. In addition, in the capital, Santiago, the government implemented a strategy of quarantine divided into sectors delimited by administrative boundaries or communes, which are the fundamental administrative units, and even further dividing those communes into sectors and isolating a specific geographic location. However, entire cities or territorial regions were not quarantined, with the exception of Easter Island. The MR corresponds to one of the 16 regions that divide Chile. It is located at the centre of the country and includes the city of Santiago, the capital city of Chile and the surrounding areas, limited by the Andes Mountains. The dynamic quarantine was mostly implemented in MR which holds 8 125 072 people, accounting for approximately 42% of the country's population [23] . This makes the MR the main focus of confirmed cases in the country, as of 15 May, accounting for 74% of the confirmed cases [23] . Its high population density of 527.5 people per km 2 [23] makes for a great challenge in containing the spread and might be a risk factor for a faster progression than other regions of the country with a lower population density have had. Panel d of Figure 1 shows the progression of the outbreak in Chile. It shows a very short stochastic uptake stage from the first reported case on 3 March to 17 confirmed cases on 10 March. From 11 March to 27 March, an exponential growth stage is established with 1610 cases in 16 days. The stage where the effect of the control strategies started to show begins on 27 March, and more than a month later, Chile had only reached an 8% DTR, without being able to reach a stage of the new growth regime with relative control (under the 2% mark that the successful countries show). In fact, the DTR shows many fluctuations.Let us note that the number of cases was not significantly high at the time of implementation of control measures. The dynamic quarantine effectively began on 27 March, when the number of cases was already at the peak of 1610. However, when compared to the case of New Zealand, this can be considered late, as the measures in that country were applied at 283 cases. The Chilean strategy began only 1 day after New Zealand's (26 March), but while in New Zealand the DTR reached 1% in 15 days, Chile's only reached 5.2% in the same 15 days. The lowest ever reached has been 3.1%, and from there, it has increased to 8%. In fact, the DTR has the possibility of further increasing.When analysing the state of the pandemic in Chile, it can be clearly seen that the effect of the strategies has shown a prolonged intervention phase, without giving way to a new growth regime with relative control, which is defined as a DTR under 2%. Panel a in Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the DTR between 3 March and 15 May 2020 for the country and for the MR, the region that accounts for the great majority of confirmed cases. It can be seen that the country's trend is the same as for the capital, since they are highly correlated. In fact, Pearson's correlation coefficient of both time series, discarding the data before the strategy, is 0.978. It is noted that on average, the MR has 74.8% of the country's confirmed cases. From panel b of Figure 2 , it can be seen that the MR owns considerable blame for the spread in the last month, representing 82% of the new confirmed cases at the national level as of 15 May. Clearly, it can be inferred that the MR is the main focus of infection in the country. Table 1 presents the Chilean statistics separated by region of the country, ordered from north to south. It is evident that in the northern and southern regions, the virus has spread differently than in the central regions of the country. It is important to highlight that the southernmost region, Magallanes, has the highest percentages of confirmed cases per population and deaths per population. This ratio clearly differs from the numbers of the other regions of Chile. Further developing on this, the southern areas besides Magallanes have had a much lower percentage of cases per population than the Central and Northern regions. The Northern regions present somewhat similar situation of cases per population, except for Atacama and Coquimbo, which show substantially lower percentages. On the other hand, as noted above, the Central region has the majority of the country's cases. However, the Central region does not differ as dramatically Epidemiology and Infection from the rest of the country in deaths per population as it does in the number of confirmed cases. Chile has a unique geography, being more than 4200 km long and separated by the Andes Mountains from its neighbouring countries. Land connectivity is relatively poor, with long distances between cities. Therefore, the country is relatively isolated by land: from other countries by the Andes mountain range and within the country by large separations between regions. This might account for the dramatic differences in confirmed cases between the different regions of the country. Let us remark that there is a highly unequal distribution of hospital capacity, critical beds and physicians across the different regions of the country, being the central regions, specifically the MR, that holds the majority of the health resources of the country [24] [25] [26] . In fact, physicians' availability per 100 000 in the MR is almost double the availability of physicians per 100 000 in the northern and southern regions [27] . This might account for the considerable differences observed between the MR and other regions of the country regarding deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases. However, further studies on the subject are required to draw such conclusions. The maps of Chile seen in Table 1 represent in a colour code the number of accumulated cases as well as the number of deaths. From them, we can clearly observe the distribution of the pandemic in Chile. Since MR holds the most critical responsibility for the country's propagation of the virus, let us study its strategy.Health authorities, along with the Ministry of Health (MINSAL), quickly discarded the idea of total quarantine and opted to apply a strategy of partial quarantines in the capital starting 27 March [21]. Dynamic quarantine follows weekly reevaluation and patterns, where the quarantine is established, prolonged, or lifted, depending on the relative number of cases in each commune. The MR has 52 administrative subdivisions called communes, 18 of which are rural. The vast majority of the communes are concentrated in the capital city, usually called Great Santiago. It hosts 32 of the densely populated communes, including the commune of Santiago, which is essentially the downtown, usually called Santiago Centro. In the following, when we refer to Santiago, it will be the Great Santiago, whereas when we refer to Santiago Centro will be the commune of Santiago. Since Santiago is a large city, its quarantine plan was divided geographically according to these communes and by the proportion of infected inhabitants. It is important to note that the divisions used in the government's strategy were based mainly on fundamental administrative divisions, not on territorial or macro-level divisions. Only on a long holiday or during the weekends, where the high flow of vehicles was anticipated, were sanitation cordons established between one region and another, in order to prevent a massive outflow of people from the capital to the surrounding central regions. Figure 3 shows the spatiotemporal evolution of the communes through the dynamic quarantine approach. We can observe that in the beginning, some of the communes entered quarantine in the central and northwest areas of MR, from the geographical point of view, which include Santiago Centro. The northwest part is the wealthy area in Chile, which was the first area with positive cases. One week later, only one commune was left of the quarantine. Then, some of them entered quarantine, and others went out for 5 weeks. Finally, the whole MR was put under quarantine in the 8th week. More precisely, the first communes that entered quarantine did it as a function of the proportion of confirmed cases per population, with Vitacura, Las Gonzalo Grebe et al.Independencia being the first quarantined. Initially, before the government took any quarantine measures, these had a proportion of confirmed cases per population of 0.044% on average, while the communes that did not enter quarantine had a proportion of 0.008%. However, in the particular case of Independencia, this proportion was 0.011%, which is close to the average of the communes without quarantine. It is important to note that the data provided by MINSAL [23] with detail at the commune level are from 30 March. Epidemiological reports with detailed data are not published on a daily basis but rather every 2 to 5 days. For this reason, the following analysis uses the dates of the epidemiological reports available. Let us analyse the temporal evolution of the DTR in the MR. In panel a of Figure 4 , one observes that the set of communes without quarantine has a higher DTR, reaching levels of 18% at the peak. However, as days pass, it decreases until, during mid-April, it has relatively similar DTRs to those of communes under quarantine. In turn, in the communes that were under quarantine at that time, it can be observed that on 1 April, after 4 days of applying the restrictive measure (starting 27 March), the DTR drops to 8% and further decreases to its nadir of 3% on 8 April. However, it soon increases to 9% to 15 May. From 24 April to 15 May, it can be seen that the curves are correlated and that the trends are somewhat similar. Therefore, it is worth asking whether the dynamic quarantines had any effect at all compared to no quarantine. In view of this result, it is necessary to separate the quarantined communes from those that left the quarantine at some point and not to compare the latter with the communes that were never quarantined. As mentioned above, the strategy is called dynamic quarantine because MINSAL lifted the quarantine in communes where it observed a decrease in the number of cases. Therefore, it becomes necessary to isolate these communes in the comparative analysis, since adding them to the communes that were never quarantined alters their DTR value. Now, let us separate the communes into those that were never quarantined, those under quarantine in the week at which the measure was taken and those where the quarantine was lifted at that time. The communes that enter quarantine as time progresses are represented by the week, they first entered quarantine. As can be observed in panel b of Figure 4 , it is essential to highlight the trends observed in the communes that never entered quarantine (squares), the communes that entered quarantine in week 1 and whose quarantine was not lifted (circles) and finally, the communes that entered quarantine but later left it (top triangles). They are also marked as No, Out and w.1, respectively. The set of communes that entered quarantine in week 1 (w.1) had a relative DTR difference of 10% from the set without quarantine. The w.1 group reached a 3% daily infection rate on 13 April. Therefore, the effect of quarantine was positive. However, on that date, the authorities decided to lift the quarantine in some communes (Out). It can be observed that they reached the lowest DTR overall, achieving 2% at some point, although they did not manage to continue with this trend. The w.1 communes that stayed on quarantine on 17 April are further divided into geographical areas from North to South, in which quarantine is lifted in some and prolonged in others, thus making the administrative barrier even weaker. For this reason, a consistent increase in the DTR of these communes can be observed since the day they were further separated, arriving at DTRs fairly similar to those of communes that were never under quarantine on 15 May. It is important to note that although Epidemiology and Infection 5 some geographical area of the commune was not under quarantine, the commune as a unit is still considered under quarantine. The communes without quarantine ('No'squares) show an initial decrease in the DTR, from 18% to 11% on 8 April. At that moment, the authorities decided to establish quarantines in new communes. These communes are represented by w.3. This further decreases the DTR of communes without quarantine, reaching nearly a 5% DTR on 20 April. However, after this, it goes back up to 11% on 15 May. As time progresses, other communes enter and leave quarantine. However, in the overall picture, it can be observed that the implemented strategy was not useful in reaching a relative control with a new growth regime, emphasising that restrictive measures with permeable borders do not work. This may be due to multiple factors, such as movement for work, noncompliance with regulations, the lack of clear demarcation of administrative borders and many other possible factors, that prevented this dynamic strategy from achieving the desired relative control. For example, there was no strict restrictions on movement between communes, in the sense that with a permit issued by the police, it was possible to carry out shopping groceries, personal administrative procedures and even visit other communes (regardless if the commune was under quarantine or not). This permit could be obtained online up to five times a week, with a duration of 4 h. Besides, there were collective work permits. There was no restriction for workers from communes without quarantine to go to work to communes with quarantine and vice versa, every day, for any essential service such as supermarkets, gas stations, delivery and public transportation and hospitals. Figure 5 shows the average DTR as a function of the number of confirmed cases from 27 April to 15 May. The graph shows the details by commune. Each circle represents a commune in the MR, such that the area represents the number of inhabitants in Fig. 3 . Spatiotemporal evolution of the quarantine in MR within the week as a time scale and starting on 31 March. Red (dark) colour represents communes with quarantine. Green (light) colour represents communes that whose quarantine has been lifted. White colour represents communes without quarantine. 6 Gonzalo Grebe et al. Finally, Figure 6 shows the average DTR on 15 May as a function of the population. The size of each circle indicates the corresponding number of confirmed cases. From the graph, it can be observed that the communes without quarantine (in blue) show high DTRs, averaging 10%, but with a much higher potential of influencing the overall picture, since they represent close to 2.2 million inhabitants. This makes them an essential focus of confirmed cases, and considering the rapid spread of the disease and how these communes are in close contact with a larger world, they could potentially influence the trends observed both regionally and nationally.From the overall results, it can be established that a dynamic quarantine strategy works partially, stabilising the DTRs between 4% and 11%. For this reason, it does not succeed in achieving relative control of the pandemic at a national level. It is also essential to note that communes that did not enter quarantine maintained high levels of DTRs, which fluctuated from 5% to 18%. On the other hand, a total quarantine of single communes was initially effective at the communal level, reaching levels of relative control in four of the seven communes under quarantine by that time. This was observed in the communes of Vitacura, Las Condes, Lo Barnechea and Providencia. However, as discussed above, when the quarantine in these communes was lifted, they quickly escalated to similar DTRs as their fellow communes that were never on quarantine. It is important to add that communes under partial quarantine experienced a decrease in the DTR. Nonetheless, they have not reached the level of relative control, showing DTRs that fluctuate between 4% and 10%, as seen in Ñuñoa, Santiago Centro, Puente Alto, San Bernardo and El Bosque. It is also important to note that communes that quickly are drawn out of quarantine without consolidated low DTRs can quickly revert to high DTRs, as was seen in Independencia and Lo Barnechea, both of which reached the 2% mark for only 1 day and then climbed back up to high DTRs; as of 15 May, their DTRs are 5%. The results show the insufficient effectiveness of the dynamic quarantine strategy at the aggregate regional level since, while the DTRs of some communes decreased, others continued to rise. Consequently, it is prudent to conclude that the DTR stagnates due to the combined result of the previously exposed points: there are many communes without quarantine, communes with partial quarantine and communes that leave quarantine too early and relapse soon after. It is also crucial to the point that only three communes (Vitacura, Las Condes and Providencia) maintained consolidated low DTRs. Nevertheless, they also relapsed in the long term. Finally, when the decrease in the DTR stagnated in the MR, it also was correlated with the situation at the country level to stagnate. Therefore, the dynamic quarantines in the MR could explain why it has not been possible to control the pandemic in Chile so far, exposing the inefficacy of the dynamic quarantine strategy.Supplementary material.

The disease is caused by a new humaninfecting virus, SARS-CoV-2 Sironi et al., 2020) . Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the natural host of this virus is likely bats, and that a possible wild animal sold at the Wuhan food market might be an intermediate host that helped transmission to humans . This is a classic example of an emerging infectious diseases (EID) -infections recognized in a host population for the first time (Morens and Fauci, 2013) . The causes of the emergence of novel diseases are pointed out as due to multiple factors, which may involve socio-economic, environmental, and ecological components (Jones et al., 2008) .As in the case of COVID-19, a common cause of EID is the cross-species transmission of pathogens, which can lead to sustained onwards transmission. This successful pathogen emergence may occur through two different processes that vary in the level of pathogen adaptation following the colonization: host range expansion and host shift. Expansion of host range occurs when the jump increases the number of host species that the pathogen is able to infect without changing pathogen's original gene pool (Thines, 2019) . In turn, host shift takes place when the jump increases genetic differentiation in the pathogen, leading to specialization on the novel host Choi and Thines, 2015; Thines, 2019) . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the recognition of the virus receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2) is a feature shared with its relative viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV and the bat virus SL-CoV WIV16) that allowed the jump to humans (Yang et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, an amino acid residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increases binding affinity to human ACE2 , what may indicate specialization on human host. Pathogen host shifts are often observed in humans, in which 60.3% of EID are zoonoses, changing mainly from wild animal reservoirs (Jones et al., 2008) . Some examples include the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which jumped into humans from non-human primates (Sharp and Hahn, 2011; Faria et al., 2014) , and Ebola, whose virus shifted from fruit bats to humans (Leroy et al., 2005) .One of the biggest current challenges to epidemiologists is to address the factors that guarantee the success of crossspecies transmissions, leading to host shifts. By addressing the mechanisms of host shift, it would be possible to understand what causes spillover infections (i.e. events with no or short onward transmission) and what leads to sustained infections, when the pathogen enters, replicates itself within and is transmitted between members of the new host species Engelstädter and Fortuna, 2019) .This would allow scientists to anticipate potential epidemics places, reducing the economic, environmental and social burden. Predicting the spatiotemporal occurrence of a host shift is still challenging, as it may be linked to a multitude of variables ranging from host and pathogen geographic dispersion to changes in host phenotype and genetics (Woolhouse et al., 2005) . Assessing the factors favoring host shifts and identifying potential susceptible taxa is crucial to novel emerging pathogen research as well as to mitigate their impacts (Woolhouse et al., 2005; Burbrink et al., 2017) .Here we discuss how experimental approaches can help our comprehension of mechanisms favoring host shifts. We highlight the usefulness of the interactions between Drosophila species and viruses as a study model and review recent advances and current methods being pursued. We claim that understanding the basic biology of host shifts is essential to prevent and deal with infectious diseases such as COVID-19.Studied for more than a century, Drosophila melanogaster has become the most studied organism in many fields of biology. Most of its success as a model organism is due to its rapid generation time, small size, easy stock maintenance, and unrivaled availability of genetic and genomic tools (Powell, 1997) . Another advantage of this model in many fields, including studies of host-virus interactions, is its high degree of evolutionary conservation with other animals (Hoffmann, 2003; Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007; Panayidou et al., 2014; Xu and Cherry, 2014) . Many defense mechanisms against viruses in Drosophila are conserved in vertebrates, such as Toll, Imd, and Jak-Stat pathways (Lemaitre et al., 1996; Merkling and Van Rij, 2015; Marques and Imler, 2016) . However, a disadvantage of this system is that some immune pathways are restricted to some taxa and are not directly comparable to Drosophila. For example, Drosophila lacks an adaptive immune system, an important response to several pathogens that ensures immunological memory in vertebrates (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) .There are well established protocols for experimental work on Drosophila-virus interactions (Merkling and Van Rij, 2015; Yang et al., 2019) and recent research has covered diverse aspects of host-virus biology. Studies have looked at the genetic architecture of resistance to virus infection, including the identification of many major effect genes that affect resistance and their mechanisms of antiviral action (Magwire et al., 2012; Cogni et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2017) . Some works have performed experimental tests of host-shifts in a controlled phylogenetic design (Longdon et al., 2011 . Drosophila has also been used as a model to understand the replication mechanisms of human viruses such as SARS-CoV (Hughes et al., 2012) . Additionally, research on the diversity of insect viruses, and the mechanisms that control virus infections, have the potential to discover new adaptations that can inspire the development of novel antiviral strategies by the pharmaceutical industry (Olmo et al., 2019) .Cross-infection experiments -when pathogens from a natural reservoir are intentionally injected into new host species -are used to simulate host shifts and have been described as fruitful practices to understand mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interactions (Figure 1 ). Although the enormous theoretical efforts done to uncover which factors lead to sustained or to short chain infections (Chabas et al., 2018; Bonneaud et al., 2019; Dallas et al., 2019; Engelstädter and Fortuna, 2019 ), we lack system-related information not observable in nature, such as the frequency of cross-species pathogen transmissions, and the likelihood of infection given the exposure of the host (Mollentze et al., 2020) . Data of this nature are only obtained through experimental studies. In order to better evaluate the array of possible data resulting from cross-infection experiments, it is important to categorize the components of the interaction. Infection dynamics depends on host effects (e.g. susceptibility and defense mechanisms), pathogen effects (e.g. replication ability and virulence), and interaction effects, which is related to the synergy between host and pathogen inherent features (Mollentze et al., 2020) .Host susceptibility can be dismantled in a set of attributes specific to the species and/or the individual, such as genetics, immunity, microbiome, age and sex (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2017) . Conversely, during an infection, hosts may use a combination of two different mechanisms to defend against pathogens, resistance and tolerance (Ayres and Schneider, 2012) . Resistance is when there is an activation of host's immune system to control pathogen's replication, and tolerance, when the host is able to avoid a decrease in its own fitness without necessarily altering the parasite load (Schneider and Ayres, 2008; Ayres and Schneider, 2012; Medzhitov et al., 2012; Vale et al., 2016) .The susceptibility of potential hosts varies greatly within and between taxa, and a key factor predicting it is the phylogenetic relatedness among potential hosts (De Vienne et al., 2013; Longdon et al., 2014; Engelstädter and Fortuna, 2019) . This phylogenetic influence may occur through phylogenetic distance effect or phylogenetic clade effect ( Figure 1 ; Longdon et al., 2014 Longdon et al., , 2015 . Phylogenetic distance effects suggest that a pathogen infection success decreases as the phylogenetic distance from the natural host increases . In such case, taxa phylogenetically closer to the natural host are more likely to be infected (Corey and Waite, 2007; De Vienne et al., 2009) . For instance, Longdon et al. (2011) examined the variation in persistence and replication of three sigma viruses, isolated from different species of Drosophila, in 51 Drosophilidae novel hosts. They demonstrated that the viruses' replication ability was negatively related to the phylogenetic distance from the donor host. Considering that in novel infections the virus requires adaptations to use the cellular machinery of the new host, and supposing such structural changes increase with evolutionary divergence time, shifts to phylogenetically more distant hosts will demand more adaptations. Hence, being less able to replicate themselves, those three sigma viruses presented lower viral titers in species phylogenetically distant from their natural host (Longdon et al., 2011) .Phylogenetic clade effects predict that pathogen infection success varies between different host clades, but is similar within them -i.e. a particular clade of hosts may have related susceptibility to the pathogen, independent of its Experiments on host-shifts 3 phylogenetic distance from the natural host . This occurs when particular clades share some features that made them particularly resistant or susceptible to the pathogen . For example, in a cross infection experiment using Drosophila C virus (DCV) and 48 species of Drosophila, Longdon et al. (2015) did not observe distance effect on viral load, but a pattern in which titers were clustering together across the host phylogeny. They hypothesized that physiological, immunity or molecular host features driving the virus infection success could be distributed heterogeneously among clades, generating ""patches"" of hosts with high susceptibility throughout the phylogeny.Regarding the pathogen, virulence is a crucial trait to consider in host shift studies. Virulence is the cost in fitness a pathogen causes to its host due to infection (Read, 1994; Vale et al., 2016 Vale et al., , 2018 , and it may vary following a host shift, presenting high levels in particular species and leading to outbreaks and epidemics (Woolhouse et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2008) . Initially, virulence was thought to be a direct consequence of parasite replication, being linked to the idea that the host-parasite interaction evolves towards avirulence, i.e. the pathogen does not cause a cost in fitness for the host anymore (Alizon et al., 2009) . However, host susceptibility features, e.g. resistance or tolerance, may affect how virulent a pathogen could be, decoupling virulence and pathogen load measures (Gandon and Michalakis, 2000; Gandon, 2002) .Recent studies have looked at the interaction between host susceptibility and pathogen virulence. An elucidative example is the meta-analysis of cross-species tests that was developed by Mollentze et al. (2020) . They analyzed the progression of rabies virus inoculations from bats and carnivores in other mammal species. This research showed that virus incubation period was longer in receptive hosts with higher body temperature. Interestingly, host body temperature for those groups analyzed were not correlated with phylogenetic distance, but tended to cluster across the phylogeny. They argue that mismatches between hosts physiological features and their evolutionary history may be influencing the infection progression and the success of cross-species transmissions.As each host-pathogen association has its specificities and particular interaction results, it is imperative to compare, in a systematic manner, the effects of different infections on the fitness of both host and pathogen. This approach contributes to unravel factors driving the variation of host susceptibility, and pathogen's virulence and replication capacity. We are using this approach by isolating common viruses in field populations that vary in virulence, and manually injecting them into new hosts (as in Longdon et al., 2011 Longdon et al., , 2015 . In the mid-and long-terms (hyphen and plural), such empirical data are useful to generate parameter distributions to model factors favoring host shifts, and to identify general rules promoting the emergence of infection diseases.Viruses do not occur in isolation inside their hosts. After the cross-species transmission, the virus needs to interact with the natural viral community already present in the novel host. Prevalence of viruses in insects is far from negligible, and can reach more than 80% for a given virus, depending on the sampled locality (Webster et al., 2015) . In a host-shift context, high prevalence of an endemic virus in the new host can directly affect the fitness of the virus that switched hosts (Figure 2) . The co-occurrence of viruses may result in three Nova-Ocampo, 2015) . Second, if the presence of one virus compromises the host immune systems, the replication of the other virus may be favored (Kuwata et al., 2015) . Third, there may be an apparent absence of fitness consequences (viral accommodation) (Salas-Benito and De Nova-Ocampo, 2015). Considering the specificities of the natural viral community inside potential hosts, it is essential to understand how the dynamics between different viruses affects the occurrence of host shifts.The presence of a given virus can negatively affect a second infection if both depend on the same host resources, i.e. endemic viruses restrict cellular resources availability for the novel infecting virus. For instance, cell experiments with dual infections had shown that insect-specific viruses can inhibit the growth of Zika, dengue and La Crosse virus (Schultz et al., 2018) . In Aedes aegypti mosquitos co-infected with two dengue viruses strains -DENV-1 and DENV-4 -, there was a competitive displacement of DENV1 by DENV-4, and only DENV-4 was detected in mosquito salivary gland, improving its transmission potential in a cooccurring event (Vazeille et al., 2016) . This can have consequences on virus strains displacement in dengue epidemics (L'Azou et al., 2014) . Therefore, this coinfection approach also provides insights for the arbovirus's transmission and prevalence, which currently impacts human health.Regarding human respiratory viruses, there are epidemiological data supporting viral interference (e.g. Linde et al., 2009) . A well-documented example is the interference between influenza viruses. Infection with influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 prevents subsequent infection with a different influenza type, causing temporary immunity following the first infection (Kelly et al., 2010; Laurie et al., 2015) . Even though COVID data are preliminary, an equivalent viral interference may occurs, since SARS-CoV-2 patients are infrequently coinfected with other respiratory viruses (Blasco et al., 2020; Nowak et al., 2020) .An alternative scenario to competition is when a virus can benefit from natural infections. For example, when Culex tritaeniorhynchus cell line is previously infected by Culex flavivirus, subsequent infection with dengue virus enhances dengue viral titer in late stages of infection (Kuwata et al., 2015) . This outcome is probably due to Culex flavivirus action on host antiviral defense. By expressing viral suppressor of RNAi, the virus decreases immune response and favors new infections or higher replication rates (Berry et al., 2009; Palmer et al., 2018) . A third scenario is when virus fitness is not affected by cooccurring viruses. For instance, coinfection of A. aegypti cells with Zika and chikungunya viruses did not affect replication of the two viruses (Goertz et al., 2017) . This lack of interference between both viruses may be explained by the different subcellular fractions occupied by these viruses during their replication (Goertz et al., 2017) . Overall, interactions between viruses can lead to different outcomes in fitness of the new infecting virus, affecting the chances of a host-shift.Surprisingly, these possible interaction effects of cooccurring viruses have not been tested in Drosophila melanogaster (Palmer et al., 2018) . We propose an experimental approach with laboratory-controlled superinfections, in which individual flies are previously infected with a sub lethal dose of a virus, and afterwards infected with a second virus. The replication rate and virulence of the second virus indicate what would be expected in a host-shift in which the host has a high natural prevalence of a virus.Not only can virus co-occurrence affect the result of a host-shift, but interactions with other organisms can also do so (Figure 2) . A classic example is the presence of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia which plays a multitude of effects on host fitness, such as protection against viral infection. Wolbachia is an alphaproteobacterium that lives within the cytoplasm of arthropod cells, and is maternally transmitted to the offspring. Until the recent past, it was viewed primarily as a parasite that manipulates host reproduction, most commonly by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (Bourtzis et al., 1996) . Cytoplasmic incompatibility allows Wolbachia to invade populations by causing embryonic mortality when uninfected females mate with infected males, thus conferring a selective advantage to infected females (Turelli and Hoffmann, 1991; Werren et al., 2008) .More recently, basic research on Drosophila-virus interactions has discovered that Wolbachia can protect Drosophila species against infection by RNA viruses (Hedges et al., 2008; Teixeira et al., 2008) . The applied potential of this finding to control arboviruses was soon noticed in the scientific community. Combined with Wolbachia's ability to invade populations due to cytoplasmic incompatibility, this provides a way to modify natural mosquito populations, turning them resistant to viral infections. Wolbachia has been transferred from Drosophila to the mosquito Aedes aegypti, where it limits the replication of arboviruses (Moreira et al., 2009) . When Wolbachia infected mosquitoes were released into the wild, the bacterium spread through the mosquito populations by cytoplasmic incompatibility (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Walker et al., 2011) . Large field trials have shown that this approach can decrease dengue prevalence in human populations (Indriani et al., 2020; Ryan et al., 2020) . A great advantage of this method to control arboviruses is that Wolbachia can block the replication of not only dengue virus, but also chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika and West Nile viruses (Moreira et al., 2009; Glaser and Meola, 2010; van den Hurk et al., 2012; Aliota et al., 2016) . The long-term success of this strategy depends on the knowledge of basic ecological and evolutionary aspects of virus blocking by Wolbachia. For example, there is great variation among Wolbachia lineages isolated from different Drosophila species in their ability to control virus infection (Martinez et al., 2014) . We are expanding this study by investigating virus protection ability on a diverse set of Wolbachia lineages and testing if protection works with different viruses. Another important aspect that has not been completely understood yet is if Wolbachia protects against virus infection in wild populations of Drosophila. There is some evidence that this may not be the case. It seems that there was no association between virus incidence and Wolbachia presence in natural D. melanogaster populations (Webster et al., 2016; Experiments on host-shifts 5 2018), but these studies may have low statistical power due to limited sample size. We plan to investigate this further to test if virus blocking in the natural Drosophila host occurs in wild populations or if it is only a laboratory phenomenon. If virus protection occurs in natural populations, it may have important ecological and evolutionary implications, such as changing the selective pressure on host resistance genes (Martinez et al., 2016; Faria et al., 2018) . Finally, phylogenetic experiments on host-shift as described above, can be repeated with species that naturally host Wolbachia, to test how the presence of this endosymbiont may affect replication of the new virus on different host species (Figure 2 ).Another essential piece of information to understand host shifts is the knowledge of virus natural host range and frequency of cross-species transmissions in wild populations. This can be obtained by comprehensive surveys of virus diversity in related hosts ( Figure 3 ). Historically, virus diversity was only studied on disease-causing viruses in human and economically important species. Recently, however, the use of metagenomics in diverse taxonomic groups has revolutionized our view of the RNA virosphere as much more phylogenetically and genomically diverse than previously though (Shi et al., 2016; Obbard, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018 Zhang et al., , 2019 . These new studies have uncovered the relative importance of virus-host codivergence versus host-shifts, and showed that host-shifts are common and most of the times not associated with diseases in the new host (Zhang et al., 2019) .In Drosophila, a seminal paper in 2015 (Webster et al., 2015) used metagenomics in wild D. melanogaster populations and identified more than 20 new viruses. They also used the presence of virus-derived 21 nucleotide (nt) small RNAs, a characteristic response of the RNAi antiviral defenses in Drosophila (Wang et al., 2006) , to confirm that the virus sequences found were active virus infections. They found that viruses are common in wild populations, and also in laboratory stock lines and cell culture (by using publicly available RNA datasets). Webster et al. (2016) used a similar approach in six Drosophila species common in the UK and found 25 novel viruses. Interestingly, they found that few viruses are generalists, being able to infect different host species, and that many viruses shared among closely related species within the D. obscura group were less likely shared among more distantly related hosts. These results indicate a high diversity and incidence of viruses in natural populations and that most viruses are host specialists.We are studying virus diversity in native drosophilid communities collected in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. By using metagenomics in wild collected flies, we plan to discover new viruses and compare the virus diversity with the few previously studied Drosophila species (Webster et al., 2015 (Webster et al., , 2016 . The Atlantic Forest drosophilid communities are highly diverse and contain species from different radiations forming a mix of common species that are close or distant related phylogenetically (Döge et al., 2008) . This is the ideal situation to investigate host range and level of specialization of the different viruses and to contrast scenarios of codivergence or host shifts. This survey will likely give interesting virus candidates to be isolated and subsequently used in the experimental approaches described above.Host shifts are complex phenomena affected by a multitude of factors and are the main cause of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Therefore, making predictions about the emergence of novel infections is extremely hard once factors driving this process are not entirely understood. In addition, we lack specific data essential for such forecast. We are applying diverse approaches using the interaction between Drosophila species and viruses, including cross-infection experiments in a phylogenetic controlled context, experiments testing the effects of virus cooccurrence and virus blocking by the bacteria Wolbachia, and surveys of virus diversity in natural populations using next-generation sequencing technologies. We argue that these practices provide a better understanding of the basic biology of host shifts, contributing to the identification of general rules favoring the emergence of infectious diseases in the long term.",Brazil,first author,2020-11-23,11

El 30 de enero, la Organización Mundial de la Salud En Europa, el uso de medicinas alternativas y complementarias ha aumentado en las últimas décadas, pese a la ausencia de una definición global y claridad sobre cuáles prácticas medicinales pertenecen a ella. La más reportada son las hierbas medicinales, seguida de la homeopatía, la quiropráctica, la acupuntura y la reflexología 13 . En España se reporta un uso de estas medicinas del 15 al 47% de la población 13 .En la actualidad se desconoce la eficacia y seguridad de la MTC en la prevención o tratamiento de la COVID-19, como tratamiento exclusivo o como coadyuvante terapéutico de la medicina moderna [14] [15] [16] . También, se han reportado casos de interacciones farmacológicas o reacciones adversas atribuidas al consumo de hierbas medicinales chinas 17, 18 . Por lo anterior, una adecuada y rápida diseminación de la información 19 sobre la eficacia y seguridad de la MTC en la COVID-19 es necesaria para orientar a tomadores de decisiones, investigadores y profesionales de la salud que utilizan la MTC en su práctica cotidiana. En la siguiente revisión sistemática exploratoria se recopila y describe la información disponible sobre la eficacia y seguridad de la MTC en la prevención o el manejo de la COVID-19 hasta el 17 de mayo de 2020.Se realizó una revisión sistemática exploratoria siguiendo los pasos propuestos por Arksey y O'Malley 20 y revisados por Levac et al 21 : a) identificar la pregunta de investigación; b) buscar estudios relevantes; c) seleccionar estudios; d) extraer los datos, y e) resumir y reportar los resultados.

Para escribir este artículo, se siguió la extensión PRISMA para reportar revisiones sistemáticas exploratorias (PRISMA-ScR) 22 . La lista de chequeo está disponible en la tabla 3 del material suplementario. Entre los documentos incluidos se encuentran revisiones narrativas (n = 9), cartas al editor (n = 6), editoriales (n = 3), revisiones sistemáticas (n = 4), estudios in silico (n = 4), comentarios (n = 2), serie de casos (n = 2), recomendaciones de práctica clínica (n = 2) guías de práctica clínica (n = 1), estudios in vitro (n = 1) y artículo de opinión (n = 1). Todos los documentos fueron escritos en inglés, salvo uno en español. El país de origen de los autores en su mayoría es China (n = 30), seguido de India (n = 1), Italia (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Malasia (n = 1) y colaboración entre China y Estados Unidos (n = 1). Los hallazgos principales de cada uno de estos documentos se describen en la tabla 2.El 6 de febrero de 2020, en la revista Military Medical Research se publicó un artículo de reflexión a modo de guía de práctica clínica siguiendo la metodología de la OMS para consejos rápidos de práctica clínica 26,27 . El documento también reportó algunos datos clínicos de pacientes con COVID-19 internados en el Hospital Zhongnan de la Universidad de Wuhan. En el documento se incluyeron las características epidemiológicas de los pacientes, así como recomendaciones de Page 9 of 34 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f detección, prevención, diagnóstico y tratamiento para la COVID-19, incluyendo la MTC. Los autores consideraron la MTC sobre la base de la experiencia previa acumulada en el tratamiento del SARS, MERS e influenza, y teniendo en cuenta la carencia de evidencia en el manejo del nuevo coronavirus 28 . En cuanto a prevención, el documento recomienda fumigación con moxa (hojas secas pulverizadas de Artemisia abrotanum) en la habitación, el uso de bolsas con hierbas chinas perfumadas como Syzygium aromaticum, Schizonepeta de hoja fina, Perilla frutescens y Cinnamomum zeylanicum, entre otras. Se recomienda también la prescripción de hierbas chinas para baño de pies (Artemisia vulgaris, Carthamus y Zingiber officinale seco), té medicinal y medicina china patentada como cápsulas de Huo Xiang Zheng Qi o Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Shui. En cuanto al tratamiento, se sugiere dividirlo en etapas clínicas de la siguiente manera: período de observación clínica y período de tratamiento clínico. En el período de observación clínica se describen 2 tipos de sintomatología, en el primero, que se caracteriza por hipodinamia y malestar gastrointestinal, se recomiendan cápsulas de Huo Xiang Zheng Qi; en el segundo, que se caracteriza por hipodinamia y fiebre, se recomiendan gránulos de Jinhua Qinggan y cápsulas de Lianhua Qingwen, entre otras. El período de tratamiento clínico se divide en 7 etapas, cada una con características clínicas particulares, dentro de las recomendaciones de tratamiento están el polvo de Huo Xiang Zheng Qi, la inyección de Xiyanping, la píldora de costus y amomum, la pildora Shengmaiyin y numerosas decocciones.El 9 de febrero, Wang et al 29 publicaron un estudio descriptivo retrospectivo, en el que se describen las características clínicas y el tratamiento combinado de la medicina china y la occidental en 4 pacientes con neumonía por COVID-19. Los pacientes recibieron una combinación de lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol y la cápsula Shufeng Jiedu (MTC utilizada en el tratamiento de la gripe). Dos pacientes presentaron un cuadro de neumonía leve y el resto un cuadro de neumonía grave.Tras recibir el tratamiento combinado, 3 pacientes tuvieron una mejoría significativa en los síntomas. El paciente restante, el cual presentaba neumonía grave, mostró signos de mejoría en la fecha límite de la recolección de los datos.Los autores resaltaron la potencial eficacia de este tratamiento combinado, aunque no mencionaron datos acerca de su seguridad. China es uno de los países con mayor experiencia y éxito en el control de la COVID-19 39 , por lo que resulta relevante conocer sus estrategias de contingencia, incluyendo la MTC. En este estudio se encontraron 93 registros de ensayos clínicos y 35 documentos que investigan el rol de la MTC en la COVID-19. La mayoría de los ensayos clínicos son aleatorizados y la totalidad se desarrollan en China. Se encontró un tamaño de muestra acumulado de más de 38.000 pacientes. Los estudios evalúan, principalmente, los efectos de agentes herbarios 7 en combinación con manejo occidental recomendado para COVID-19. El tratamiento occidental también se utiliza en el grupo control de la mayoría de los ensayos, aunque los autores no describen los componentes del tratamiento convencional.Las ocurrencias evalúan principalmente tiempo de mejoría clínica y conversión viral negativa.Page 12 of 34 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Únicamente se encontraron 2 estudios clínicos (serie de casos), que incluían un total de 10 pacientes. Dos pacientes presentaron neumonía leve y 8 neumonía grave. Ambos estudios reportaron resultados favorables en pacientes con COVID-19 que recibieron Qufeidu No. 1, que mejoró la evolución de la enfermedad con recuperación total de todos los pacientes. En uno de estos estudios 29 se incluyó tratamiento occidental con lopinavir/ritonavir y arbidol, además de la MTC. Los autores recomendaron la necesidad de mayor investigación dado el reducido tamaño de muestra, debilidad del diseño de estudio y ausencia de datos sobre su seguridad 29,30 .Las revisiones narrativas y sistémicas, cartas al editor, editoriales y guías de práctica clínica comprenden la gran mayoría de documentos teóricos. Existe evidencia que respalda el uso de MTC en infecciones por el SARS-CoV 9 y se ha reportado similitud filogenética y receptores de entrada celular similares entre el SARS-CoV-2 y el SARS-CoV 2 . Por lo anterior, los investigadores recomiendan realizar más estudios para probar compuestos de MTC en pacientes con la COVID-Ante la ausencia de evidencia que soporte el uso de la MTC en COVID-19, es imprescindible contar con estudios clínicos, idealmente ensayos aleatorizados y controlados, para determinar la eficacia y seguridad de estas prácticas tradicionales en la pandemia emergente. De los 93 ensayos clínicos en curso que arrojó nuestra búsqueda, 78 son ensayos clínicos aleatorizados, lo que permite concluir que pronto se contará con datos que permitan conocer la eficacia y la seguridad de la MTC en el manejo de pacientes con COVID-19. Se deberá prestar atención al efecto de la MTC en conjunto con medicina occidental, interacciones farmacológicas, reacciones adversas y comorbilidades que puedan modificar la eficacia y seguridad de la MTC.

Introduction N ursing goes through periods of change in the global scenario with the coping of the pandemic of COVID-19. Unexpectedly, there are changes in the routine of health services, organizational structures and professional relationships. At this moment, health teams, particularly nursing, are moving in the change and adaptation process, as well as their relationship with light technologies. (1, 2) Conceptually, these are relationship technologies, such as welcoming, bonding, independence, accountability, and management as a way of managing work processes. (3) The nurse, as a manager of the nursing team, has the autonomy to occupy all the spaces within their range, whether involving users or professionals, consciously and targeting the subjects' specific needs, aiming for the humanization of health care processes. (4) From the perspective of the organization of health care actions, the health authorities, surveillance entities and the scientific society established flows in intermediate-complexity care for people experiencing health problems due to COVID-19 to use health services, including Emergency Care Services (UPA). Within this logic, the UPA is important in this process because it is a secondarylevel health institution that acts as a gateway, attends to the population in emergency situations, identifying patients with symptoms of COVID-19, and uses care protocols to provide care in the prevention, maintenance and recovery of users seeking the health system. (5) Thus, light technologies such as communication are fundamental in confronting the pandemic, in performing humanized practices at times of social and health crisis, focused on the desires and needs of the population. Therefore, the relationship between the professional and the user will be a benevolent relationship. The usability of light technologies and humanized care are important in this process. (6) Understanding communication as a light technology that modifies the work processes in the UPA within the pandemic context can represent a model of health team organization and cooperation to improve the quality of care for patients. Therefore, there is a need for studies focusing on the perspective of communication in health work, especially in teams that work in a situation of constant pressure, such as emergency care.In a critical context such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the study contributes to discuss the interaction of the health team and work models in an emergency, clinical and surgical environment in which communication and listening is a key element to achieve quality goals in health and reduce risks and mortality. In that sense, the objective of this study is to report on communication and qualified listening in nursing work in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.This is a descriptive, theoretical and reflexive experience report. These reports favor the production of new knowledge through the construction process, turns experience into a theoretical interpretative object of study and promotes the recovery of phenomena in an orderly manner. (7) The proposal is to discuss the activities developed by two emergency nursing professionals working in UPAs located in Fortaleza, Ceará, during the COVID-19 pandemic, carried out by the authors with a determined and known research objective and justifications for the development of the study. The state was one of the main epicenters in the Northeast during the pandemic peak, with 188,451 confirmed cases and 8,010 deaths by August 8, 2020. (8) The UPAs are dynamic spaces of pre-hospital emergency care, located in targeted regions of the city where the study was carried out. As parts of the Brazilian Emergency Care Network (RUE), they are places of organization and operation of complex secondary healthcare flows. (9) The care processes to compose this experience report took place between March 20 and May 25, 2020. The choice of the UPA as the place of study for the main research objective was intentional. To define the themes in the report, an adaptation of Minayo's thematic analysis was applied, using the most relevant words, expressions, and themes, built with the reporters' experience, based on the material of the results transcribed in Microsoft Word. (10) The Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) were used to develop the research: 32-item checklist for methodological consistency and quality of the article. (11) In this context, the experience described was discussed from the perspective of the Interprofessional communication process, interpreting this instrument in health work as a phenomenon with complex influences in the interprofessional relationships of the health team.It involves one of the aspects of interprofessional practice to overcome fragmentation in care and achieve problem-solving ability with quality and integrality. (12) In the analysis of the reports during the period, two main thematic categories were highlighted: resignifications of communication in the work relationships of the health team and the guided listening to users by nurses from the UPAs during the pandemic.Initially, the care flows of the UPA were defined to identify symptomatic users with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, such as cough, fever, muscle pain, headache, respiratory distress and other components of the flu syndrome and/ or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which guided the lines of care. Patients with suspicion and mild symptoms (oxygen saturation -SatO2 >92%) were evaluated by the physician in the office, instruction was provided and the patients were released for social distancing at home. Cases considered severe with hyposaturation (SatO2<92%) were hospitalized to start oxygen therapy, receive confirmatory tests, receive medication, and cases with severe pulmonary impairment and risk of respiratory arrest were submitted to orotracheal intubation and protective mechanical ventilation.Developing nursing care activities in this dynamic represented restructuring and resignifying communication between health team professionals to achieve effective and quality care. The communication process in these professional relationships suffered from the precarious work imposed by the pandemic though, and therefore had to be modified. Seeking to resolve communication deficits that could culminate in quality losses in guided care, meetings and training were held to align the health team's care actions. In this period, the dynamics of the emergency area increased significantly and measures had to be aligned through communication, mainly between nurses and physicians during the visits due to the demand, the risks of mortality in severe cases, and the overcrowding of the sectors due to the delay in transfers.The communication process contributes, however, for the cooperation and collaboration to culminate in the development of integrated intra-team practices, in decision making on the applicability of care to achieve the patient's wellbeing. In addition, this tool improves the relationship between nurse and physician, promoting interrelations and harmony in health work processes.In this context, communication turned into an essential tool to maintain interprofessional relationships and culminate in collaborative actions in the team. The difference that allows quality communication processes in the health team and the noises that disrupt these relationships proved to be tenuous. One example is rapid orotracheal intubation and its systematization as a health procedure. This involves sedoanalgesia, introduction of the tube with a guidewire, removal of the wire while maintaining the plunger, clamping of the tube with tweezers, installation of the ventilator, and initiation of mechanical ventilation, being considered a complex procedure in which any failure in the communication of the medical team with the nursing team culminates in risks for the patient.In this premise, communication was also the basis for decision making and for the development of integrated practices among health team professionals in the care and treatment processes directed to contaminated patients. Deciding on the correct time to, for example, change the nasal catheter to a non-rebreather mask and subsequently orotracheal intubation based on X-ray findings, gasometrical and clinical results literally meant the life and death of patients. These are complex decisions driven by evidence that was and is still under construction in the scientific literature. In most cases, the users' wellbeing was achieved successfully, either in restoring health or, in cases in which this was not possible, providing measures of comfort in terminal cases. It is important to emphasize that achieving harmony in communication processes and relationships among all health team professionals is not always satisfactory but proved to be the best route to quality care during the pandemic.The nursing team represents the health professionals who spend most of the time together with patients in all care processes. In the pandemic context, this was even more present due to the greater risks of complications, stabilization and care, especially enhanced by the non-permission of companions due to the infectious-contagious risk. Listening to health demands in patients suspected of COVID-19 involved dialogue, understanding and interpretation of the reports, reflection and decision. Countless patients arrived with mild and severe respiratory symptoms and being able to identify signs indicating infection by the novel coronavirus in the reports was one of the main steps in the flows of care and guidance.Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that qualified listening is also something instinctive, subjective, inherent to the human being, which refers to the humanization of care processes. It demands comprehensiveness in care, makes it possible to achieve health goals and reduce dissatisfaction, disrespect and negative perspectives with health care. The suffering the pandemic imposed further required listening to patients and promoting reflexive health dialogue that culminates in care. In addition to guiding care by listening to health demands, it was also possible to act in the perspective of providing psychological and family comfort through professional contact with family members and patients.The use of telephone calls and videoconferencing to have contact with family members showed that listening not only involves care through technical-medical procedures, but also promotes psychological comfort measures. Moreover, the perspective of listening represents a resource to promote mental wellbeing, relaxation, comfort, satisfaction.In short, conducting guiding listening involves both solving basic health demands and priority and complex care. This complexity in each case, such as stabilization and clinical preservation of the patient and the promotion of physical and psychological well-being can be determined through appropriate listening to the user suspected of COVID-19, as a participant in the care process.Thus, guided listening to the patient as an aspect that optimizes the care processes was considered to initially prioritize health care in the preservation of life and hemodynamic stabilization. These ranged from oxygen therapy to reduce hyposaturation to critical care in severe cases. In the listening processes by the team, interaction was essential, in which the presence of nurses, physicians and social assistants was necessary, whether in basic and complex care or in social and family relationship procedures and demands. It is challenging to achieve the structuring of the health team in the face of the pandemic, but intensifying the professional relationships and strengthening the health team work proved to be satisfactory to achieve positive results and reduce the impacts of the pandemic.Coping with COVID-19 represents one of the greatest challenges in public health worldwide due to its high rates of illness and mortality, especially in socio-economically unfavorable contexts, such as Brazil, as well as in health work processes and relationships. (13, 14) From the perspective of nursing, it is no different, being one of the most affected professions and with higher rates of morbidity, mortality, and absence from work during the pandemic. (15) In this context, the UPAs, together with other emergency care network equipment, represent the gateway for patients suspected of COVID-19 and complex relationships between health team professionals are developed in emergency care practices. (9) In this premise, communication is an important element for integrated health practices to take place. (16) The disruption promoted by the need for distancing and the isolation the coronavirus imposes strengthens the construction of new forms of relationship, the realignment of care lines and practices. (17) As a member of the health team, the nurse represents one of the main carerelated professionals involved in the dynamics of health work. Characteristically, the humanization models of health, the expanded clinic, changes in management and decision-making processes are theoretical and practical mechanisms addressed in the National Humanization Policy, in which light technologies such as communication are one of its main components. (18) In this context, Merhy reflects in his studies the modes of health production within the work organization through the use of light, light-hard, and hard technologies in the development of living work. (19) In this perspective, hard technologies represent equipment and machines in which work is integrated; light-hard technologies are the professional knowledge, own knowledge and personal experiences that structure and organize work. (18) Differently, light technologies emphasize the professional and patient relationship, addressing subject-centered listening and the satisfaction of the needs of well-being, care, and health, affecting the care practices and the qualification of health work. They involve speaking, listening, interpreting, welcoming, bonding, representing, new knowledge, among others. (18, 19) In the pandemic, the communication mechanism represented a factor intrinsically related to the interaction processes, of cooperation between the health team involved, to improve the care developed, guaranteeing constitutional rights and integral and universal health services. First, the skills of proper listening to symptoms, screening, and determination of the severity and complexity of suspected cases determined the first line of care measures. (2) Communication, through qualified listening, is a vital health work instrument for interaction and cooperation of the intra-health team, with patients and family. It constitutes a tool to humanize the work processes and insert the subjective factor into the organizational dynamics as a catalyst for changes in health care. (20) It is important to emphasize, however, that the communication built with patients, family, and health team in the face of the pandemic is different.The fear of infection by COVID-19 and its consequences determined different modes of communication defined by distancing and isolation. (17) Contacts made by telephone or videoconferencing with family members for patients with mild cases were strategies implemented to reduce fear, promote psychological well-being, and humanize care processes. Studies have been developed that emphasize digital tools such as videoconferencing for support during the COVID-19 pandemic. (21, 22) A study on treatment for adolescents with eating disorders with family support found in videoconferencing an essential tool during the pandemic, although telehealth remains a challenge in access and resolutions. (22) The use of digital technologies to reach family members, guide conducts, and improve patient well-being demonstrate a positive role during the pandemic, and investing in this perspective as an allied instrument in health care processes represents improvements in the subjective aspects of health work. Challenges are shown daily in the provision of care during the pandemic period and light technologies are revealed as mechanisms that can resolve difficulties during the development of the work and promote communication and listening aimed at solving problems and achieving interprofessional goals.The use of communication in the Interprofessional team contributes to dynamic, engaging relationships, with effective and high-quality results. They involve cooperation, collaboration, leadership, and decision-making. (23, 24) A study on interprofessional communication in the emergency sector between residents, physicians, and other members of the health team showed barriers to achieving effective communication, such as personal factors (fear, self-confidence), clinical environment (work overload, rapid changes in health teams), and lack of training. (24) In this context, the use of communicative processes to achieve better practices and care, in the interprofessional relationships of the team and in the quality of health care during the pandemic, is an undeniable tool in reporting, although its implementation, development, and qualification still needs improvements in the health system for the sake of better efficacy. (25) The contributions are found in the identification of health team communication as a resource for improving interprofessional interactions, as well as assistance and care to patients in the pandemic context in emergency care institutions. The experience revealed an excerpt of what is found under the conditions of the current situation resulting from COVID-19. Communication has become an essential tool to maintain professional relationships and culminate in the team's collaboration and cooperation in order to provide a close relationship with the user. In addition, communicative processes such as guided listening to users and intra-team communication contribute to promote the quality of care and health care processes.The main limitation identified in the report is the specific regional character of the health service and its specificities in the local context, but its results, such as communication to improve the relationship of the health team, can be replicated in countless contexts in the pandemic, thus becoming its main potential as well.Nursing as a health profession, with its work processes directly affected by the pandemic, finds in light technologies such as communication and qualified and guided listening, strategies to improve care and relationships established with the health team, family and patient. This can solve risks, dissatisfaction, adverse events and morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 in emergency care services.",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-11,11
cd3376a820797dce03bff6426dc6b0bfa7ff32d2,Coinfección por SARS-CoV-2 y rinovirus-enterovirus en una paciente adulta joven críticamente enferma en Colombia,"Infección concomitante por SARS-CoV-2 y rinovirus-enterovirus de fiebre (89 %), tos (67 %), fatiga (38 %), diarrea (3,8 %) , mialgias y artralgias (15 %) y disnea (19 %) (1) . Asimismo, se han caracterizado factores de predicción de la gravedad y la mortalidad como la edad avanzada, las comorbilidades, la disnea, la taquipnea, y la elevación en los valores de la troponina, la ferritina, la lactato deshidrogenasa (LDH) y el dímero D (4) .En el contexto del desconocimiento actual de varios aspectos del curso clínico de la infección por SARS-CoV-2, teniendo presente que los reportes de caso han aportado valiosa información clínica y científica, y del hecho de que los factores de riesgo pueden diferir entre los países de altos ingresos y aquellos de bajos y medianos ingresos, se describe el caso de una paciente adulta joven que presentó un cuadro crítico por infección concomitante de SARS-CoV-2 y rinovirus-enterovirus, con obesidad, neumonía multilobar y resultado negativo inicial en la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa en tiempo real (PCR-RT), que posteriormente dio positivo para SARS-CoV-2.Además, se destaca la importancia de una aproximación basada en la clínica, los antecedentes y los factores de riesgo del paciente, teniendo presente la limitación de las pruebas diagnósticas, la posibilidad de síntomas gastrointestinales y la infección con otros agentes patógenos respiratorios. Asimismo, se describen los hallazgos en las imágenes diagnósticas, los exámenes de laboratorio y el tratamiento aplicado a partir de la escasa evidencia actual.El 12 de marzo de 2020, una paciente de 41 años consultó al servicio de urgencias de una clínica de Cartago (Colombia) con un cuadro clínico de seis días de tos seca, congestión nasal, fiebre, odinofagia, fatiga, náuseas, diarrea e hiporexia. No presentaba anosmia, ageusia u otros síntomas. La paciente había tomado azitromicina automedicada durante tres días (500 mg por día) sin resultados. Refirió que había llegado de Nueva York (Estados Unidos) el 10 de marzo con su hermano, quien había tenido diagnóstico confirmado de SARS-CoV-2; el único antecedente médico relevante de la paciente era la obesidad. Se le tomó una muestra con hisopado nasofaríngeo en el día 6 de la enfermedad, la cual fue negativa para SARS-CoV-2, por lo que se ordenó su egreso con indicaciones de aislamiento domiciliario, acetaminofén y loratadina.La paciente presentó un deterioro clínico con disnea, lo que la llevó a consultar de nuevo el 14 de marzo (día 8 de la enfermedad) y fue hospitalizada; se le hicieron estudios de laboratorio y se le tomó una radiografía inicial que evidenció la presencia de opacidades multilobares con patrón de vidrio esmerilado. Se inició el tratamiento con 500 mg de cloroquina, 400 mg de lopinavir y 100 mg de ritonavir cada 24 horas por vía oral.El 17 de marzo (día 11 de la enfermedad) se tomó una segunda muestra de hisopado nasofaríngeo, pues había una clara sospecha clínica de infección por el nuevo coronavirus. La paciente permaneció hospitalizada en Cartago hasta el 18 de marzo, pero dada el agravamiento de su cuadro clínico respiratorio (necesidad de oxigenoterapia de alto flujo), fue remitida a una institución de mayor complejidad (figura 1).En el momento de ingreso a la clínica en Pereira la paciente pesaba 84 kg, la talla era de 1,60 m, su índice de masa corporal era de 32,8 (kg/m 2 ), y tenía tensión arterial de 102/65 mm Hg, frecuencia respiratoria de 26 respiraciones por minuto, frecuencia cardiaca de 110 latidos por minuto, saturación de oxígeno (SaO 2 ) al 96 % con 3 L/min por cánula nasal y temperatura axilar de 36,4 °C. Su condición era aceptable, estaba consciente y orientada, pero con taquipnea y polipnea.Los resultados de laboratorio de su primera hospitalización en Cartago indicaban un aumento de la LDH, la proteína C reactiva, leucocitosis elevada con neutrofilia y un panel respiratorio viral negativo para todos los virus evaluados, incluidos los de influenza A y B, parainfluenza, virus respiratorio sincitial, rinovirus, adenovirus y los cuatro coronavirus comunes en el medio (HKU1, NL63, 229E y OC43) (cuadro 1). Con base en estos hallazgos y con la sospecha de una neumonía grave de origen viral, se le hicieron nuevos estudios de laboratorio y se inició la administración de 600 mg de n-acetilcisteína cada 8 horas, 4,5 g de piperacilina-tazobactam cada 6 horas, aumento de las dosis de cloroquina, lopinavir y ritonavir a 500, 400 y 100 mg, respectivamente, cada 12 horas por vía oral (día 11 de la enfermedad).El mismo día de su ingreso, la paciente tuvo un rápido deterioro respiratorio y presentó un trastorno grave de la oxigenación, con PaFi de 99 (PaO 2 de 49,7 mm Hg y FiO 2 de 50 %); en la radiografía de tórax se observaron opacidades con patrón de vidrio esmerilado, por lo que se hizo la intubación endotraqueal y se la trasladó a la unidad de cuidados intensivos donde se le suministraron líquidos endovenosos (60 ml/hora de lactato de Ringer), protección gastrointestinal, tromboprofilaxis y respiración mecánica invasiva en posición de pronación en modo asistido controlado con elevada presión positiva al final de la espiración (PEEP) de 10 cm de H 2 O y volumen corriente de 6 ml/kg (figura 2).En los días 1 a 6 en la unidad de cuidados intensivos, la paciente se encontraba estable, con permanente y estricto aislamiento por contacto y por gotas; no presentaba dificultad respiratoria ni fiebre, pero sí taquicardia; el hemograma no registraba alteraciones y hubo mejoría en la gasometría, con un leve trastorno de la oxigenación, y radiografías con evidencia de opacidades multifocales (figuras 3 y 4).El día 20 de marzo (día 14 de la enfermedad y 3 en la unidad de cuidados intensivos) se recibió el resultado positivo para SARS-CoV-2. La paciente se mantuvo en relajación neuromuscular con cisatracurio hasta el día 5 de su estancia en la unidad de cuidados intensivos, cuando esta fue suspendida, pero el trastorno respiratorio empeoró, con disminución de la PaFi (218 a 152) en un día, por lo que en el día 6 (día 17 de la enfermedad) se reinició este tratamiento y la paciente tuvo mejoría clínica. Se tomó una nueva radiografía de control (figura 5) en la que se observó mejoría radiológica. En el día 7 en la unidad de cuidados intensivos, la paciente continuaba en el mismo estado: elevación de transaminasas, tiempos de coagulación y persistencia de LDH, hemograma con leucocitosis y gases con trastorno leve a moderado de oxigenación, leve acidosis respiratoria e hipercapnia (cuadro 1), por lo que se suspendió el lopinavir y el ritonavir, y se continuó con los demás tratamientos descritos, incluida la respiración mecánica invasiva con presión positiva al final de la espiración de 11 cm de H 2 O, volumen corriente de 6 ml/kg y posición en pronación con ciclos cortos de supinación.Entre los días 8 y 13 la paciente presentó una significativa mejoría respiratoria (PaFi de 267) y de la gasometría, por lo que en el día 8 se suspendieron los antibióticos y los relajantes musculares.En el día 14 de su estancia en la unidad de cuidados intensivos (día 24 de la enfermedad) se reportó en el panel viral el aislamiento de rinovirus y enterovirus humanos.La condición clínica de la paciente siguió mejorando, despertaba sin dificultades y se retiró exitosamente la intubación endotraqueal, por lo que salió de la unidad de cuidados intensivos, permaneciendo otro día en el hospital, cuando se decidió darle el egreso ante su clara mejoría clínica.El tiempo de estancia en la unidad de cuidados intensivos fue de 14 días. El 29 de marzo se le tomó un nuevo hisopado nasofaríngeo para la detección del coronavirus, el cual fue negativo. La paciente presentó un delirio hiperactivo que se resolvió, por lo que se ordenó su egreso con seguimiento ambulatorio durante el cual no tuvo nuevos síntomas.El reporte de caso fue aprobado por el Comité de Ética de la Clínica Comfamiliar y fue clasificado como un estudio ""sin riesgo"" . La paciente firmó el consentimiento informado.Este reporte de caso es un aporte importante al manejo de la infección por SARS-CoV-2 surgida en Wuhan (China), que luego se diseminó alrededor del mundo, incluido Colombia, convirtiéndose en pandemia (1,3,6). La paciente Figura 5. Radiografía antero-posterior de tórax, 24 de marzo de 2020 (día 18 de la enfermedad). Se observa mejoría con respecto a las imágenes previas. de este caso provenía de Estados Unidos, país que actualmente registra el mayor número de casos a nivel mundial (7), donde ella y su hermano se infectaron. Todavía se desconocen varios aspectos del curso clínico de esta enfermedad, principalmente en cuanto a complicaciones y probables secuelas a largo plazo.Entre los aspectos analizados en este caso se encuentran los síntomas respiratorios iniciales de la paciente, descritos previamente en estudios observacionales (1,3,4,6), pero también otros poco descritos como los gastrointestinales (diarrea, hiporexia y náuseas).Los síntomas gastrointestinales en la infección por SARS-CoV-2 inicialmente descritos en Wuhan tenían una baja prevalencia, de solo 3,8 %, probablemente debido a su subregistro por la mayor atención dada a los síntomas respiratorios (1). Tian, et al. (8) , revisaron los datos de 2.023 pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2 y evaluaron la presencia o ausencia de síntomas gastrointestinales. En su revisión establecieron que entre el 3 y el 79 % de los pacientes había presentado síntomas gastrointestinales, siendo la anorexia o hiporexia (39,9-50 %), la diarrea (2-49,5 %) y las náuseas (1-29,4 %) los más frecuentes, los que también presentó la paciente de este caso.La paciente tampoco presentó anosmia y ageusia, síntomas descritos solo en algunos escasos reportes (9) . Los síntomas respiratorios y gastrointestinales se deben a la invasión del virus en los neumocitos de tipo 2 y en los enterocitos de colon e íleon, lo que produce malabsorción. En estudios de bioinformática y transcriptómica se ha descrito que expresan el receptor de la enzima convertidora de angiotensina 2 (ECA2), lo cual se ha confirmado con los hallazgos en biopsias y muestras fecales de pacientes con el virus (10) .Es importante resaltar el rápido deterioro clínico de la paciente, cuyos síntomas iniciales fueron leves, pero posteriormente progresaron a una neumonía multilobar con síndrome de dificultad respiratoria del adulto similar a lo descrito en otros reportes (1, 11) .En la evolución de los pacientes con formas graves de SARS-CoV-2 se ha descrito la presencia de un componente inflamatorio bautizado como ""tormenta de citocinas"" , que incluye síntomas como fiebre constante, citopenias e hiperferritinemia, progresión al síndrome de dificultad respiratoria del adulto y un perfil de citocinas caracterizado por un aumento de interleucina (IL)-2, IL-7, del factor estimulante de colonias del granulocito, el interferón y el factor de necrosis tumoral-α, todos incluidos entre los factores de predicción de la mortalidad descritos en el estudio retrospectivo multicéntrico de 150 casos confirmados de SARS-CoV-2 en Wuhan, China, y asociados con la elevación de la ferritina y el IL-6 (p<0,001), lo que sugiere que la mortalidad puede deberse a una hiperinflamación promovida por el virus (12) .Este fenómeno inflamatorio generalmente ocurre alrededor del día 7, cuando los cuadros clínicos empeoran, lo que coincide con lo sucedido en el presente caso, pues fue en el día 8 que la paciente tuvo que volver a consultar y se le detectaron signos de alarma.Asimismo, se debe hacer énfasis en los factores de predicción de la gravedad y la mortalidad hasta ahora descritos: la edad avanzada, las comorbilidades, la disnea, la taquipnea (definida como una frecuencia respiratoria mayor o igual a 24), la linfopenia, la elevación de los niveles de troponina, ferritina, lactato deshidrogenasa (LDH) y dímero D (1, 4, 13, 14) .En cuanto a la paciente de este caso, se determinaron como factores de riesgo de gravedad, la edad y su antecedente de obesidad, aspecto que no ha sido analizado en los estudios de Italia o Wuhan (1,3,4) y que podría asociarse con la inflamación intrínseca en esta enfermedad (15) . Además, la paciente presentó disnea, taquipnea, elevación de la LDH y la proteína C reactiva, que se han descrito como factores de predicción de la gravedad. Asimismo, se destaca la coagulopatia que presentó el día 18 de su enfermedad, hallazgo descrito previamente como una complicación (1).Cabe mencionar la limitación de la PCR-RT para el diagnóstico de SARS-CoV-2, cuya sensibilidad se ha reportado como modesta, probablemente por su vulnerabilidad a las inadecuadas condiciones previas al análisis (16) . En este caso la paciente tuvo una primera prueba negativa realizada el día 6 de la enfermedad, lo que pudo deberse, en parte, al día de evolución de la enfermedad, ya que la recomendación actual del Instituto Nacional de Salud es realizarla a partir del día 7 (2). En este sentido, en un estudio reciente se estableció que la PCR-RT puede ser positiva incluso después de dos pruebas negativas en el 21,4 % de los casos, lo que sugiere que estos falsos negativos podrían explicarse por un prolongado aclaramiento viral o por la conversión de ácidos nucleicos (17) .En cuanto a la infección concomitante de SARS-CoV-2 y rinovirusenterovirus en esta paciente, en el estudio de Kim, et al. (18) , se evidenció que el 116 (9,5 %) de los 1.217 pacientes con sintomatología respiratoria dio positivo para SARS-CoV-2 y 318 (26,1 %) para otro microorganismo diferente. Del grupo positivo para SARS-CoV-2, 24 (20,7 %) también lo fue para uno o más agentes patógenos adicionales, siendo los más frecuentes los rinovirus y los enterovirus (n=8; 6,9 %), el virus sincitial respiratorio (n=6; 5,2 %) y otros coronavirus (n=5; 4,3 %) (18) . En otro estudio de 115 pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2, 5 (4,35 %) también tenían infección por influenza (19) . Khodamoradi, et al., reportaron una serie de cuatro casos que cursaron con neumonía grave y presentaban infección concomitante por SARS-CoV-2 e influenza de tipo A (20) .Por lo tanto, se recomienda que el panel respiratorio de PCR múltiple (PR-FilmArray) se haga solo para pacientes graves y aquellos en quienes el resultado positivo obligue a modificar el tratamiento para prevenir la progresión de la enfermedad e, incluso, la muerte (18) .En la actualidad, hay varios tratamientos en fase de experimentación, pero la información confirmada todavía es poca para recomendarlos en las guías de práctica clínica, en tanto que el desarrollo de las vacunas se encuentra en diferentes etapas (21, 22) . El uso de la cloroquina y la hidroxicloroquina tiene el mayor respaldo hasta el momento como tratamiento benéfico para pacientes con SARS-CoV-2 (23), aunque debe tenerse presente que se recomiendan a partir de estudios con importantes sesgos de selección e información que han recurrido a resultados surrogados y tamaños de muestra reducidos; además, deben considerarse los posibles riesgos adversos, como la prolongación del intervalo QT y la muerte súbita.También se ha evaluado la azitromicina administrada conjuntamente con hidroxicloroquina en un estudio no aleatorizado de 36 pacientes en Francia, utilizando un resultado surrogado (carga viral) y descartando otros de importancia clínica y para el paciente (24) . En el estudio de Gautret, et al., de diseño observacional no controlado, se evaluó la evolución de 80 pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2 leve, tratados con azitromicina e hidroxicloroquina, lo que disminuyó la carga viral y el tiempo de estancia en la unidad de infecciones (25) . A pesar de la escasa evidencia, estos resultados son alentadores.El uso de lopinavir y ritonavir en un reciente ensayo clínico no aleatorizado no demostró un beneficio evidente (26) .En este caso, se utilizaron varios medicamentos en estudio, incluidos antibióticos de amplio espectro, sin que pudiera determinarse la eficacia individual de cada uno en la mejoría clínica de la paciente puesto que se administraron simultáneamente. El único medicamento utilizado de forma individual y automedicado al inicio de la enfermedad fue la azitromicina, que no tuvo eficacia.Se utilizaron las recomendaciones para la respiración mecánica invasiva actuales, como el uso de una elevada presión positiva al final de la espiración, la respiración en pronación por ciclos y un volumen corriente entre 4 y 8 ml/kg, lo que fue relevante en la mejoría clínica observada (27) .Por último, el delirio posterior al retiro de la intubación de la paciente pudo responder a diversos factores, pero se sugiere la posibilidad de una complicación del tipo de una encefalitis viral por SARS-CoV-2 ya descrita en la literatura especializada. Se ha evidenciado el neurotropismo y la neurovirulencia del virus, el cual tiene una vía de ingreso neuronal a través del epitelio y del bulbo olfatorio, y dada la alta expresión de la ECA2 en las neuronas y las células gliales (28) .En este caso se destacan varios aspectos relevantes para el diagnóstico y el manejo de los pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2:1. el diagnóstico debe basarse en la sospecha clínica (historia, resultados de laboratorio e imágenes) y los antecedentes de viajes o contactos;2. se recomienda indagar sobre los factores de riesgo descritos en la literatura, y se propone incluir la obesidad como uno de ellos;3. se deben tener presentes los síntomas no respiratorios del SARS-CoV-2 para el diagnóstico, como son los gastrointestinales y los neurológicos;4. se resaltan las limitaciones de las pruebas diagnósticas, por lo que una primera PCR-RT negativa no debe descartar el diagnóstico cuando la sospecha clínica lo indique, ya que puede haber falsos negativos;5. debe evaluarse la posibilidad de infección concomitante con otros agentes patógenos respiratorios que pueden generar duda en el diagnóstico y se recomienda utilizar PR-FilmArray en casos graves o en aquellos en que el resultado positivo pueda modificar el tratamiento a favor del pronóstico del paciente;6. debe mantenerse un estricto aislamiento por gotas y por contacto del paciente con sospecha o confirmación de SARS-CoV-2 utilizando siempre los elementos de protección personal y el lavado de manos, y 7. se debe tener presente la terapéutica y sus posibles efectos adversos dada la escasa evidencia actual, siendo la terapia respiratoria con posición en pronación ajustada a las recomendaciones del consenso nacional (29) y la guía internacional (27) , un pilar fundamental en el tratamiento.",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-12,11

20f5d3cd66ba7dfe24bedb51dcdb7e9b71de13be,"Physical inactivity and elevated TV-viewing reported changes during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with mental health: a survey with 43,995 Brazilian adults","The new coronavirus (COVID-19) presented a fast spread worldwide, with an increasing number of cases and deaths. Since 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemy as a pandemic and social distancing has been recommended as a strategy to reduce the rate of new cases and was adopted by several countries [1] . Considering previous experiences with quarantines due other epidemics and pandemics as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola and H1N1 influenza, there are several stressors during the social distancing period, including the length of the quarantine, fears of infection, frustration, lack of supplies, lack of information and financial problems, which can be associated with lower mental health [2] . Within the context of social distancing measures, alexithymia can also be closely associated with mental health problems during the quarantine [3] , also related with loneliness feelings. Before the COVID-19 pandemic period, alexithymia already had a role in suicide risk among people with psychiatric disorders [4] . In this sense, there is a call for action for mental health science during the COVID-19 pandemics [5] .Studies reported that the COVID-19 pandemic affected mental health [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Indicators as social support, education, type of occupation, COVID-19 relative diagnosis, and psychological factors as loneliness feelings, discrimination, and well-being were associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms [6, 7] . Unhealthy behaviors, such as physical inactivity (<150 min/week of moderate intensity physical activity) and mentally-passive sedentary behaviors (i.e. TV viewing) are highlighted as contributor for adverse mental health outcomes [12] [13] [14] [15] . In this sense, it is noted that the increases in physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors during the social distancing period can be associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof A previous study conducted during COVID-19 pandemic found that higher physical inactivity and sedentary behavior were associated with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms [16] . However, the association between negative reported changes in these behaviors during the quarantine and mental health is not clear. In this sense, a recent editorial highlighted the need for investigations on how changing health behaviors can be associated with psychological and mental health in the context of COVID-19 quarantine [17] Also, considering that people with affective disorders as depression present difficulties in the sensory input processing and consequently, have higher psychological vulnerability for stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic [18, 19] , the association of changes in healthy behaviors can be different among people with or without previous diagnoses of depression [20] . Therefore, our aim was to analyze the associations of physical activity and TV-viewing reported patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine with mental health among Brazilian adults with and without depression. Having in mind the benefits of physical activity practice and lower sedentary behavior as well as the risk of high TV-viewing for mental health, we hypothesize that participants that reported physical inactivity and/or high TVviewing were more likely to present worst mental health indicators, especially those with previous depression diagnosis.h ""Br z b h v r r s r h ur th COV D-19 p "" was a cross-sectional nationwide health survey, using a virtual questionnaire to assess the lifestyle characteristics in the lives of Brazilians after the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic in the country, related to social restriction initiatives for the protection of people, including quarantine. Data collection was conducted between April J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 24 th and May 24 th , 2020. The collection of data was virtual due to the faster application process and the impossibility of face-to-face interviews due to the COVID-19 social distancing measures.The invitation of participants was through a chain sampling procedure. In the first stage, the 15 researchers involved in the study chose a total of 200 other researchers from different states in Brazil. Also, each researcher in the study chose 20 people from their social network, making a total of 400 people chosen. The people chosen in the first stage were called as influencers. These sent the survey link to at least 12 people from their social networks, obeying a stratification by sex, age range (18-39; 40-59; 60+) and education level (incomplete high school or less; education complete medium or more). In addition, information about the study was disseminated through press releases, social communications from participating research institutions, state health departments, and social media. The survey link was also available at the influencers' research institutions. All procedures were approved by the National Research Ethics Commission (CONEP) (process: 30598320.1.0000.5241) and participants provided consent before answering the questionnaire.Initially, 45,160 participants completed the questionnaire. The sample was weighted according to characteristics from the National Household Sample Survey (conducted annually), considering the population in each state, education, age, sex, and prevalence of chronic diseases, aiming to let the sample nationally representative.As mental health indicators, we adopted three questions regarding feelings of loneliness, sadness and anxiety. For loneliness, participants were asked: ""During the pandemic period, how often did you feel isolated or alone?"", for sadness was asked: ""During the pandemic period, how often did you feel sad, crestfallen or depressed?"" and for anxiety, participants were asked ""In the period of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof pandemic, how often did you feel worried, anxious or nervous?"". Possible answers for each question were: 1) ""Never"", 2) ""Few times"", 3)""Often"" or 4) ""Always"". We classified participants as positive for loneliness, sadness and anxiety th s wh sw r "" t "" r "" w ys"".These questions were previously used in the World Health Survey -Brazil (2003) [21] and we adopted in our study because of its short format and content that addressed issues that can be directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic problem for mental health, such as social isolation, sadness and anxiety.For physical activity before COVID-19 pandemic, participants were asked ""Before the COVID-19 pandemic, how many days a week did you practice any type of physical exercise or sport? (do not consider physical therapy)"". Possible answers were: 1) less than 1 day/week; 2) 1-2 days/week; 3) 3-4 days/week or 4) 5 or more days/week. For those reporting physical activity practice, we also asked: ""How long did this activity last?"". Possible answers were: 1) less than 30 min; 2) 30-45 minutes; 3) 46-60 minutes or 4) more than one hour. Also, for physical activity during the COVID-19 p w s sk : ""During the COVID-19 pandemic how many days a week did you practice any type of physical exercise or sport? (do not consider physical therapy)"". Possible answers were: 1) less than 1 day/week; 2) 1-2 days/week;3) 3-4 days/week or 4) 5 or more days/week. For those reporting physical activity practice, we also asked: ""How long did this activity last?"". Possible answers were: 1) less than 30 min; 2) 30-45 minutes; 3) 46-60 minutes or 4) more than one hour. We classified activities using the recommendation of 150 min/week [22] , which was calculated using the median point of frequency and duration in each category. According the World Health Organization cut-off points, we created physical activity practice patterns using four patterns: 1)Consistently active; 2) Become active (inactive to active); 3) Become inactive (active to inactive) or 4) Consistently inactive.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fFor TV-viewing, participants were asked: ""Usually, before the pandemic, how many hours a day did you used to spend watching television?"" and ""During the pandemic, how many hours a day have you been watching television?"". Possible answers for both 1) none; 2) less than 1h/day; 3) between 1 and less than 2 h/day; 4) between 2 and less than 3 h/day; 5) between 3 and less than 4 h/day; 6) between 4 and less than 5 h/day; 7) between 5 and less than 6 h/day; 8) 6 h/day or more. TV-viewing was classified using the cut-off point of 4h/day [23] in both moments for high TV-viewing. TV-viewing patterns were created using four patterns: 1) Consistently low;2) Become low (High to low); 3) Become high (Low to high) or 4) Consistently high.Previous diagnosis of depression was assessed through a question regarding the lifetime diagnosis of depression by a physician. The response options were either yes or no. This question was previously used in different national health studies, including the last Brazilian National Health Survey [24] .We used sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during the pandemic, skin color, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, diagnoses of COVID-19 on a close friend, co-worker or relative and adherence to the quarantine as covariates. The highest academic achievement was classified as no academic achievement or elementary school, high school and higher education or more. Working status during the quarantine was classified as currently not working, working on a normal routine and home office. Skin color was classified as white or other.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Weighted frequencies and 95% confidence intervals were used to describe the sample. After this, crude and adjusted models (for sex, age group, working status during the quarantine, skin color, diagnoses of COVID-19 on a relative or close friend and quarantine adherence) were created to analyze the associations of physical activity and TV-viewing patterns with mental health among people with and without diagnoses of depression. Also, we inserted an interaction term of behavior reported changes and previous diagnoses of depression to investigate whether previous diagnoses of depression can change the association between patterns of behaviors and mental health indicators. All analyzes were conducted using the software Stata 15.1.Journal Pre-proofFrom the initial sample (n=45,160), 1,165 presented missing data in at least one variable and were excluded from the present analyses.Therefore, the final sample was composed by 43,995 adults with a mean age of 43.0 (95%CI: 42.5 to 43.5 years). Characteristics of the sample are presented in Table 1 . The prevalence of frequent loneliness feelings was 57.1%, frequent sadness was 40.3% and frequent anxiety was 53.1%. 21.3% of the participants become inactive and 28.0% passed to present elevated TV-viewing during the quarantine period. Table 2 presents the associations of physical activity and TV-viewing reported change patterns with mental health indicators.After the adjustments, participants that become inactive during quarantine presented higher odds for loneliness, sadness and anxiety when compared with consistently active participants, regardless previous diagnoses of depression. Higher odds for all three mental health outcomes (with previous depression) and for sadness and anxiety (without previous depression) were observed among consistently inactive participants (compared to consistently active group). Among participants with previous depression, only those who become with high TV-viewing during quarantine presented higher odds for sadness and anxiety. While among participants without previous depression, higher odds for negative mental health were observed among those who passed to present high TV viewing (all three outcomes). Both compared to consistently low TV viewing group. People with previous diagnoses of depression that were consistently inactive presented higher odds of loneliness and sadness when compared with consistently active and without depression participants.Our main findings were that reported incidence of physical inactivity and TV viewing were associated with higher odds for negative mental health outcomes, regardless of previous diagnoses of depression. In addition, consistently inactivity was associated to higher negative mental health outcomes during the pandemic specially among participants with previous diagnosis of depression. We highlight that the analyses were adjusted for important potential confounders, including the adherence to the quarantine and diagnoses of COVID-19 on a relative or close friend.The social distancing during quarantine period can be associated with several indicators of mental health [2, 9, 10] . In our study, we found an elevated prevalence of loneliness, sadness and anxiety, which are higher than normally found. For example, it was estimated that the prevalence of loneliness is about 10% to 20% [25, 26] . Considering the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) about sadness from the last Brazilian National Health Survey, the prevalence was about 8%, consistently lower than the present prevalence [27] . Our findings are in line with previous studies that found elevated levels of adverse mental health indicators on other countries during COVID-19 pandemic [7, [9] [10] [11] .Also, the social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic can reduce health behaviors that are associated with mental health indicators such as physical activity and low sedentary behavior [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, participants that become physically inactive were at similar risk of participants consistently inactive, which can indicate that the actual physical activity was the most associated with poorer mental health and not necessarily the reported change itself. The association between reduced physical activity with sadness and anxiety can be through different mechanisms, including an increase of inflammation, changes in the regulation of neuroendocrine responses and lower neuroplasticity [28] . Also, physical activity practice (especially through the practice of group physical activity) can be associated with psychological and social mechanisms, including a higher social inclusion, self-efficacy and self-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f esteem [28, 29] . The findings of a higher odds for negative mental health outcomes among participants with consistently physical inactivity and with previous diagnosis of depression also points for the higher vulnerability of people with mental disorders during the pandemics, which already present a higher number of unhealthy behaviors [3, 18, 20] .On the other hand, only participants that passed to present elevated TV-viewing presented higher odds for loneliness, sadness and anxiety, indicating that the potential change during the quarantine of COVID-19 pandemic was determinant for the higher odds. Our findings considering the elevated TV-viewing during the COVID-19 quarantine are in line with previous clinical studies which found that experimentally induced sedentary behavior was associated with higher anxiety, anxiety and poorer mood [30, 31] . Potential mechanisms linking TV-viewing and mental health can also be through the lower social contact [32] , poorer sleep quality [33] and also blood markers as reduced insulin sensitivity and inflammation [34, 35] , which could be associated directly and indirectly associated with sadness and anxiety.Our findings highlight that policies on the promotion of health behaviors should also be stimulated during the quarantine period aiming to protect mental health. During the COVID-19 social distancing periods, exercise at home or outdoor individual activities should be stimulated [36] . Also, groups that most increased physical inactivity and high sedentary behavior levels (e.g. young adults and people that reduced or lost their income) should be prioritized [37] . In another perspective, the post COVID-19 scenario is also challenging to return to pre-pandemic physical activity and sedentary behavior levels, which highlights the role of institutional policies, including the national health system (""Sistema Único de Saúde"", in portuguese) to achieve this goal.Our findings should be inferred in the light of potential limitations. The research had a low representativity of individuals with low socioeconomic status and without access to internet and electronic devices as a computer or cellphone. In addition, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f retrospective design is prone to recall bias. Similarly, all questions were self-reported and prone to recall bias and the causality inference is not possible. We also presented only one question for each indicator (sadness, anxiety and loneliness). We highlight that data was collection before the peak of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. This timing should be considered to the interpretation of these results, as well as further studies are needed in order to surveillance mental health with increases cases and measures of COVID-19 in the country. On the other hand, we presented data of more than 44,000 Brazilian adults, weighted for nationally representative population distribution, during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on the association of movement behaviors with mental health.Thus, both reported physical inactivity and TV-viewing during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine were associated with poorer mental health indicators, regardless previous diagnoses of depression. Consistently physical inactivity (before and during the COVID-19pandemic) was also associated with negative mental health outcomes, especially among participants with previous diagnosis of depression. Interventions for physical activity promotion and sedentary behavior reduction should be stimulated during the COVID-19 social distancing period.This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

The United Nations highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with the profound socioeconomic inequalities in South America, will push over 45 million people into poor conditions and 28 million in extremely poor conditions (3) . Compounded with the fragmented and ill-prepared public health systems of South American countries, COVID-19 could have a comparatively harsher effect in the Region, relative to countries with robust health systems (2) .Although the first case of COVID-19 in South America was detected on March 26 in Brazil (4) , few modeling studies from this Region have emerged since (5) . Given the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in this Region, understanding the dynamics of disease transmission is key to guiding the implementation of necessary prevention and control measures. One parameter, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), aids to fulfill this purpose by estimating the number of secondary cases arising from exposure to an infected person in the absence of epidemic or pandemic containment measures (6) . Another metric, the time-varying reproduction number (R t ), is useful in monitoring the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 over time and to assess the adequacy of current control efforts. R t estimates the expected number of secondary infections from an infected individual at time t (7, 8) . The serial interval is another key variable to estimate R 0 and R t ; it measures the time elapsed between symptomatic cases in a chain of transmission. Determining the probability distribution of the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 and using that distribution to estimate R 0 and R t is crucial in assessing the rate at which the COVID-19 pandemic expands. Knowing the person-to-person transmission rate helps policymakers understand whether mitigation and suppression measures are effective and when to adopt more or less stringent measures (9, 10) .Given the importance of assessing the public health interventions to monitor their effectiveness, we estimated both reproduction numbers (R 0 and R t ) to identify the impact of the early-stage public health interventions in South America.We used the COVID-19 database from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (11) . The database is publicly available and contains the worldwide geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases. The database is updated daily and provides counts for new cases and deaths by date and country. We extracted the data from the ECDC database for the following ten South American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Early-stage containment and mitigation decrees issued by each country against COVID-19 were found in the corresponding official government webpages.The following binary variables were recorded for each country for qualitative analysis: isolation, separation of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in a healthcare facility or their home; quarantine, social restriction and home containment of persons with suspected or known contact with a patient with COVID-19, or individuals with a travel history to Europe or Asia; physical distancing, group of measures related to the prevention of mass gatherings, closure of academic institutions, and cancellation of social and public events; community-wide containment, mandatory isolation of every citizen of the country in their home, with permission only to acquire life supplies (i.e. food or water) in restricted hours of the day (12) .We estimated R 0 using data for the first two weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in each country. Since R 0 is the reproductive rate sans intervention measures, it should be estimated during the exponential phase of the pandemic; otherwise, R 0 would be underestimated. Thus, the two-week estimation time frame was selected for two reasons: (i) 14 days is regarded as the maximum time after exposure for symptoms to develop, and (ii) it is sensible to assume that the pandemic will be in its exponential phase for the first two weeks after the first case is detected. We specified the SARS-CoV-2 serial interval as a gamma-distributed random variable with a mean serial time of 3.96 days and a standard deviation of 4.75 days, based on a contact tracing study conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (13) . R 0 was estimated with the maximum likelihood method described by White and Pagano (14) .We estimated R t from the time series of daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in each country, using the novel methods described by Thompson et al. and setting the same gamma distribution specification for the serial interval as we did for R 0 (15) . We chose a five-day moving window to elucidate the time trend exhibited by R t . A previous study in China used a tenday moving window to report R t (16); however, they specified a mean serial time of 7.5 days, a mean higher by a factor of two with respect to the CDC contact tracing study. We selected a narrower window to account for the faster spreading dynamics we specify in our models and estimate R t after 90 days for each country. The mean difference between R 0 and R t were estimated to describe the change of both numbers. Sensitivity analysis included the estimation of R 0 up to the first week of the first reported case in each country, based on a follow-up study of 1 000 COVID-19 cases (17).The statistical analysis was conducted using the R version 3.6.2 software. First, we describe the public health measures taken by South American countries and calculated the cumulative number of cases according to the two periods. Thereafter, the ""R0"" package was used to compute the basic reproductive number. To estimate both R 0 and R t , we employed a gamma-distributed serial interval with a mean serial interval of 3.96 ± (standard deviation) 4.75 days. Estimation of R 0 was carried out via the maximum likelihood method, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed for the R 0 value of each country. We used the ""EpiEstim"" package to compute the time-varying reproductive number. Country-wise time series for R t , with 95% credible intervals (95% CrI), were plotted. The code is freely available at https://github.com/ jlavileze/covid_sa.The project was revised by the Investigation Review Board of the Scientific University of the South. Given that the investigation is a secondary analysis of a database, it received an exempt category and was approved for its development. Table 1 shows the public health measures adopted by SA governments against COVID-19. All South American countries adopted isolation, quarantine, and physical distancing measures. However, the period between the first laboratoryconfirmed case and the implementation of public health measures differed across South American countries. Seven countries, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela enacted their control policies in ≤7 days after their first case detection. Uruguay enacted the public health measures on the day they detected their first case. In Brazil, 19 days elapsed between detection and implementation of control measures.The time to implement a community-wide containment strategy also varied between the countries. Two countries, Bolivia and Venezuela, issued their mitigation policies in ≤7 days after detecting their first COVID-19 cases; Paraguay and Peru did so between 7-14 days after detection; and Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador all took over 14 days (Table 1) . Moreover, Colombia (12 days) and Argentina (10 days) had the longest period between their first measures (isolation, physical distancing, and quarantine) and community-wide containment efforts. Chile implemented a stepwise selective community containment, moving one province at a time. Table 2 shows R 0 and R t estimates for each country and the corresponding cumulative number of cases. During the early phase of the pandemic, R 0 ranged from 1.52 to 3.83. An R 0 of 3.83 means that, on average, each infected person will transmit the virus to roughly 4 different individuals. Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador had the highest R 0 ; these three countries enacted their first mitigation measures ≥14 days from the initial detection of COVID-19 patients in their territory. For the countries that implemented mitigation measures 5-7 days after detection, the R 0 ranged from 1.60 to 2.95, while for the countries that acted within 3 days, it ranged from 1.52 to 1.74. The sensitivity analysis showed similar results; Brazil was the country with the highest R 0 after seven days of the first case detection. Moreover, the seven-day R 0 estimation ranged from 1.39 to 3.48 for countries with mitigation measures between 5-7 days and from 1.17 to 2.29 in nations that enacted measures in <3 days after their first COVID-19 case. Furthermore, all countries decreased their R t over time, with a mean difference ranging from 0.61 in Bolivia to 2.80 in Ecuador (Table 2 and Figure 1 ). At the latest assessment, R t ranged from 0.99 to 1.13 in all the countries studied. Although the point estimates for R t were below one in Bolivia and Uruguay, their 95% credible intervals are compatible with a still-growing pandemic ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ).We used two measures to estimate the spread of SARS-CoV-2: R 0 during the early phase of the outbreak, and R t to measure the changes of transmissibility over time to identify the effectiveness of public health policies in SA countries. The main results identified that R 0 varied across nations, and R t decreased over time in all countries. The latter seems to be associated with the timing of implementation of mitigation measures.Our results differ from previous estimations of R 0 and R t . A study from the CDC identified a lower mean serial interval for SARS-Cov-2-3.96 ± 4.75 days-and proposed a gamma distribution as a plausible model for the serial interval; we adjusted our analysis to this prior.R t values from the studied South American countries were lower than those of European countries: R t estimates by Yuan et al. (20) for Italy, France, Germany and Spain ranged from 3.10 to 6.56 in an overall 20-day period. In contrast, our study estimated R t over 90 days after the first case identification; therefore, we stress that the main difference of these outcomes relies on the chosen time interval to estimate R t . SARS-Cov-2 might have been spreading rapidly during the first 20 days after case detection in Europe, which is reflected in higher R t values. Another possibility is the longer period that European countries took to implement control measures than South American countries. For example, Italy took over one month to make its first mitigation came into effect (21) , which led the virus to spread freely for a longer time in the population.The reproduction number-R 0 or R t -is a measure that depends on the population mixing (6) . Human behavior play a critical role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as person-to-person contact exposes a susceptible person through respiratory droplets from an infected individual (22) . Therefore, mitigation measures, such as social distancing or case isolation, are necessary to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Ideal policies should be country-specific, and the overall objective is to reduce R 0 (mitigation) or to reach an R 0 <1 (suppression). Regardless of the aim, a combination of mitigation and suppression measures is the best strategy to staunch the COVID-19 pandemic (10).Three countries, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay opted for a mitigation strategy. Ferguson et al. suggested that the best mitigation strategy is a combination of physical distancing of high-risk groups (elders and patients at risk of severe disease), case isolation, and quarantine (10) . Uruguay implemented these three measures. Brazil and Chile added a stepwise selective population containment, which allows intermittent circulation of SARS-CoV-2, congruent with a mitigation purpose. The remaining studied South American countries opted for suppression actions. For example, Peru issued a decree to increase the period of the community-wide containment intervention and to fine citizens if they left their home after a specified hour of the day (23) . As a result, all nations managed a reduction of R t .Here we highlight several explanations for the change between R 0 and R t . First, the implementation of public health measures by some countries within the first week of the outbreak could have lowered R 0 . These laws aimed to reduce human contact, which, in turn, reduced the spread of the virus in the community. In contrast, the three countries with the highest R 0 in the early phase issued their first mitigation laws ≥14 days from their first cases, which gave SARS-CoV-2 a higher chance of transmissibility among the population. Second, the reproduction number is sensitive to the ability of each country to detect COVID-19 cases (24) . A shortage of testing impairs the identification of cases within a community and provides limited data to estimate R 0 or R t , generating unclear information to analyze the effect of mitigation or suppression interventions in a community. In our view, despite international donations of test kits to identify and isolate cases (25, 26) , the fragmented healthcare systems and questionable government management of South American countries deter proper development of testing strategy and test distribution for case detection.Our study has some limitations. Although we used national reports of COVID-19 cases, underreporting is likely, and difficult to quantify. True case identification depends on the testing capacity to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which is difficult in any country and likely impaired in South American countries. For instance, Venezuela has been under political, socioeconomic, and public health instability before the COVID-19 pandemic, shown through the cessation of publishing of public health statistics since 2016 from their Ministry of Health (27) . Moreover, Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro downplayed COVID-19 regarding it as a benign disease and through avoiding prompt action to address the pandemic (28) . These instances may have impaired proper case detection and led to a suppression of information as previous reports suggest (28, 29) . Second, we did not calculate the case-fatality ratio. During the current course of the pandemic in South American countries, the estimation of this metric is biased for underreporting of cases and time lag between the notification of cases and deaths; this analysis is better suited for a post-pandemic period (30, 31) . Third, there are issues arising from the model specification for serial interval. For instance, we assumed the same serial interval distribution for all countries at all points in time, even though these should be space-and time-dependent, as serial interval distributions vary throughout an epidemic or pandemic (24) . Also, the CDC serial interval model only considers positive serial times, and hence censors all serial interval observations in which a secondary case manifests symptoms before the primary case does. Per their findings, about 12.6% of secondary cases exhibit clinical symptoms before a primary case (e.g. an infected person presenting symptoms before the infector); given how sensitive R 0 estimates are to the serial interval distribution, our results should be updated as better model specifications of this variable are elucidated.Our findings suggest a positive, yet insufficient, impact of the mitigation and suppression measures in South American nations to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Despite the fragmented health system of most of these countries, the different combination of control measures adopted managed to reduce R t , albeit to different levels. The difference of R 0 in the early phase of the outbreak is probably due to a combination of a shortage of testing and the idiosyncrasies of each country's public health system. However, R t values above one during the study period suggest that South America is still far from containing the spread of COVID-19.Authors´contributions.

The rapid global spread of COVID-19 made the World Organization of Health (WHO) declare it a public health emergency of international concern (1). Up to and including July 20th 2020, 14 ,530,563 cases and 606,741 deaths have been reported in 188 countries (2) .Approximately 80% of COVID-19 confirmed cases reported mild to moderate disease, and the average case fatality rate is 4.6%, with a wide variation across countries (3) .Efforts to determine modifiable factors that could increase transmission, exacerbate symptoms, and increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality remain essential to guide public policies. Individual conditions such as age above 65 years and underlying chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, kidney failure, and cancer, have shown to increase the risk of mortality (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) .Environmental factors have also been explored with evidence of COVID-19 airborne transmission (9-11).Short-term air pollutant concentrations, specifically particular matter (PM), might contribute to the spread of the pandemic by transporting viruses in aerosols (airborne transmission) to longer distances than the usual involved in close contacts transmitted through droplets (12) . In China, Zhu et al. (13) conducted a time-series study with data of 120 cities during January and February of 2020. They found a positive association between the daily count of confirmed cases and concentrations of fine and coarse PM (PM 2.5 and PM 10 , respectively), ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and sulfur dioxide J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (SO 2 ) the two weeks before (lag 0-14). Similar findings for PM 2.5 and O 3 were reported in Italy by Borro et al. (14) and Zoran et al. (15) in studies analyzing data from 110 Italian provinces between February and March and data from Milan comparing correlations before and beyond lockdown. In the United States, Adhikari et al. (16) also found positive short-term associations between air pollutants and confirmed cases in New York.These studies suggest a significant relationship between air pollution and COVID -19 infection and PM's potential effect in airborne transmission. The role of PM as a potential carrier of the SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed for the pandemic in Italy. The authors compared PM10 concentrations and events in Lombardy (the region with a higher number of cases and deaths) and Piedemont (located near Lombardy with less affectation) before and during the first peak of the pandemic. The results showed that the cities in the Piedemont region had even more PM10 pollution events than the cities in the Lombardy region, suggesting that short-term concentrations of PM10 do not fully explain the spread and severity of the pandemic (17).Long-term exposure to atmospheric pollution has been hypothesized as a contributing factor for explaining mortality related to COVID-19. This hypothesis is based on the evidence that chronic exposure to air pollutants is associated with chronic inflammatory response and overexpression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (18) and with the development of chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (19, 20) . These factors might increase infected people's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore, might mediate the pathway between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality (See Supplementary material Figure S1 ).Italy was the first country affected by the pandemic in Europe, with an outbreak and mortality larger than the one observed in the city of Wuhan. The regions in Northern Italy exhibited the higher mortality rates for COVID-19 coinciding with the regions with higher air pollutant concentrations, suggesting that chronic exposure to air pollution might contribute to SARS-Cov-2 lethality (21) . Fattorini and Regoli (22) assessed the correlation between chronicity of exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality by using a regional distribution of the mean concentration NO 2 , PM 10 , PM 2.5, and O 3 from 2016 to 2019, the number of days per year in which the regulatory limits of PM 10 and O3were exceeded, and the number of years during the last decade (2010-2019) in which limit value of PM 10 was exceeded for at least 35 days. They found significant correlations between all three measurements, supporting early and preliminary evidence on the role of chronic exposure to air pollution on COVID-19 mortality. These studies provided meaningful results; however, they did not control for potential confounding factors involved in the relationship between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality. Ecological studies conducted in China and United States controlling for a variety of sociodemographic and health conditions showed that chronic air pollution exposure, mainly to NO 2 , PM 2.5 SO 2 , increase the COVID-19 mortality risk by 11.2% (CI95%: 3.4%-19.5%), 15% (CI95%:5% -25%) and 17.2% (CI95%:0.5%-36.9%), respectively (23) (24) (25) . (28) . Despite the known effect of chronic exposure to air pollution on the burden of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (29, 30) , its potential effect on COVID-19 mortality has not been fully elucidated, particularly in low-and-middleincome countries. This study aimed to determine the association between chronic exposure to PM 2.5 , and COVID-19 mortality in Colombia, South America, using an ecological approach and controlling for potential socioeconomic and health conditions confounders. The purpose of this study is to provide results to assess the hypothesis of the long-term effect of PM 2.5 on COVID-19 mortality in countries with different socioeconomic contexts and pollution levels.Colombia is a country located in the extreme north of South America, consisting of 32 departments, 1,122 municipalities. According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE, for its initials in Spanish), the population of Colombia in 2020 is Ninety-two out of 1122 municipalities measure air quality regularly in Colombia (33).Large cities such as Bogota, Medellin, Bucaramanga, Cali, and Barranquilla have air quality monitoring networks. Medium-size and smaller cities perform periodic manual measurements that are not readily available. Because of the scarcity of surface measurements in the country, we retrieved PM 2.5 surface concentrations from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service CAMS Reanalysis (CAMSRA) and CAMS Near Real-Time (CAMSNRT) for this study. CAMSRA uses four-dimensional variational data assimilation techniques, combining satellite observations with a global scale atmospheric model to produce aerosol concentrations and mixing ratios of several gases at the surface and vertical gridded data (34, 35) . CAMSNRT is evaluated every quarter, and evaluation reports are available at the COPERNICUS website (36) . We downloaded surface CAMSRA concentrations over Colombia for PM 2.5 using the ECMWF WebAPI and the Python script provided at this platform. We retrieved monthly average gridded data at a 0.125-degree resolution from January 2014 to December 2018.We estimated PM 2.5 concentrations at the centroid of each municipality by using a mathematical interpolation from the nearest four retrieved CAMSRA concentrations.Additionally, in order to evaluate the responsiveness of CAMS-based estimation of PM 2.5 concentrations, as a support for data validation, we evaluated exposure data for the quarantine period (between March 1 and August 31, 2020) using CAMSNRT.Total population, population by age groups, and area of residence (urban/rural) were retrieved at the municipality level from the estimation of population 2020 based on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Colombian census DANE 2018. We obtained cartographic information and maps from the DANE Geoportal public website (37) , and the spatial data were created in ArcGIS 10.6.1® using the projection of Colombia in mode Custom Azimuth Equidistant and Datum WGS 1984. We used the Multidimensional Poverty Index as a socioeconomic ecologic measure at the municipality level. The poverty index ranges from 0 to 100 with higher percentages meaning privation of more indicators and dimensions. The higher the index, the higher the socioeconomic deprivation (38).We obtained data related to the number of confirmed cases and deaths for COVID-19 and the number of RT-PCR tests to confirm positive cases of infected people from the National Institute of Health (INS) website (www.ins.gov.co). The database includes caseby-case information of report date, diagnosis date, date of first symptoms, department and municipality of origin, age, sex, clinical condition, and death date for fatality cases.Information about the number of tests was available at the department level. We used the crude period prevalence of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease data from the High-Cost Account created by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection; we calculated prevalences for the period between July 1st, 2018 and June 30th, 2019 for the 1,122 municipalities of Colombia. Hospital beds capacity was measured as intermediate and intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants for each municipality, as a surrogate of the health system capacity. We obtained the data from the publicly available national registry of healthcare providers (Registro Especial de J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Prestadores de Servicios de Salud -REPS https://prestadores.minsalud.gov.co/habilitacion/).The Colombian municipalities with at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 constituted the analytic sample. We calculated population-time at risk as the total population multiplied by the number of days since the first symptom for the first confirmed case at each municipality. We computed the mortality rate using the population-time at risk as a denominator. We described the geographic distribution of the deaths counts, and explored its fit to a Poisson distribution, using the variance test (VT) and the O 2 test. Based on the mean and variance of the death counts we rejected the null hypothesis in both tests (p>0.01) finding evidence of overdispersion (range: 0-1402) and the presence of inflated zeros (58.5%).Considering the high number of zeros and that from an epidemiological point of view, the first death of COVID-19 represents a phase of the pandemic for one specific municipality; we decided to fit a hurdle model regression for the death counts. We interpreted Hurdle models as a two-part model integrated into one model. The first part is typically a binary response model (logit), and the second part is usually a truncated-atzero count model (39) . We fit a logit-negative binomial hurdle model and use the population-time at risk as the ""offset"" variable in the regression models. We used the continuous long-term average of PM 2.5 as the primary independent variable in the hurdle model. We performed a sensitivity analysis, running models using the PM 2.5 average as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f categorized variable and as a modeled variable with restricted cubic splines using three knots. We used the Akaike criterion to compare the models. We adjusted the effect of long-term PM 2.5 using the following confounding variables identified in the directed acyclic diagram (DAG, see supplementary material Figure S1 ): percentage of population 65 years or older, percentage of the urban population, population density, poverty index, hospital beds capacity, number of COVID-19 tests at the department level, and prevalence (percentage) of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic renal failure. These variables were used as covariates. We ran the analysis clustered by department to account for potential correlation in municipalities within the same department. We conducted secondary analyses excluding the capital district of Bogotá, which holds the highest count of deaths, excluding Medellin, the city among three capitals for which CAMSRA underestimates land-based concentrations (see supplementary material Figure S3a ), and excluding municipalities with less than ten confirmed cases. Furthermore, to validate CAMS-based estimations, we analyzed their correlation with surface measurements of PM 2.5 during the study period as well as their responsiveness to the quarantine period (between March and August) in Bogota, Barranquilla, and Medellin. We ran all the analyses using STATA 15.There were 182,140 confirmed cases and 6,288 confirmed deaths for COVID-19 in Figure 2 shows the visual inspection of the relation between the estimated longterm mean of PM 2.5 and the COVID-19 mortality rate logarithm. The patterns did not follow a linear trend, and increased log of mortality rates for COVID-19 are present at the lowest levels of mean PM 2.5 . Using a binomial approach (having or no having deaths), the relation with mean PM 2.5 did not follow a linear trend but a line with different inflection points (See Supplementary material Figure S2 ). Restricted cubic splines of PM 2.5 with three knots identified those points to be 12.6, 19.3, and 26.6 μg/m 3 .We present the results of our primary analysis using hurdle models in Table 2 . is the other main factor associated with the death rate at the municipality level (RR=1.32; 95% CI 1.03-1.68). On the other hand, having a higher percentage of urban population and higher hospital beds capacity are negatively correlated to mortality ( Table 2) . Once the municipality reaches at least one COVID-19 death, the main factors associated with the mortality rate are the percentage of urban population and the poverty index, which increases the mortality rate in 2% and 3%, respectively (Table 2) . Also, a significant cluster (department) effect was identified in the data (p<0.01).We found that secondary analysis exhibits similar results to our primary analysis in terms of no evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 mortality rate associated with an increased long-term average of PM 2.5 at the municipality level (Table 3) . Results similar to our primary analysis were also consistent in our sensitivity analysis using different approaches to model PM 2.5 long-term average exposure (See supplementary material Table S1 ).We present a comparison between the estimated monthly average PM 2. Figure S3b presents the daily average concentrations of CAMSNRT and surface concentrations during the quarantine period, supporting that CAMSNRT responsiveness to changes in surface levels is adequate, with a tendency to underestimate surface levels at higher PM 2.5 surface concentrations.Our research presents the first ecologic nationwide study conducted in a developing country assessing the association between COVID-19 mortality and long-term exposure to PM 2.5 . Our results did not find evidence of an association between higher There was no evidence of an association between the long-term average of PM 2.5 and the mortality rate for COVID-19 in crude or adjusted models. Our results contrast with the reports of correlational studies conducted in Italy (21, 22) and ecological studies in China (24) and the United States (23), which found positive associations between PM 2.5 and COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for four and 20 potential confounders, respectively.These studies supported the hypothesis that the effect of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 on COVID-19 mortality is largely mediated by comorbidities linked to chronic PM-related inflammation (21, 40) . In this regard, it has been proposed that chronic exposure to PM 2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression, which may increase viral load in patients exposed to pollutants (41) . Our findings revealed a significant effect of aging and poverty Another possible explanation for our findings is that long-term exposure to PM 2.5 has less impact on biological susceptibility to COVID-19 complications and deaths compared to the effect of other air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). Multipollutant models in Colombia have identified a stronger short-term effect of NO 2 on respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity compared to other pollutants (42) . A country-wide crosssectional study in the United States using multipollutant models for the effect of PM 2.5 , NO 2, and O 3 found a solid positive association between NO 2 and COVID-19 fatality and mortality but did not find significant associations with PM 2.5 and O 3 (25) . The authors discussed that divergent results with the previous US nationwide study (23) are probably due to the use of multi-pollutant models and the adjustment for spatial trends, which might have confounded the findings. Unfortunately, we did not count on reliable NO 2 and O 3 long-term exposure estimations, so we did not assess this effect in multi-pollutant models.We found an independent and significant effect of the older age, the poverty index, and the prevalence of hypertension (over 6%) associated with the COVID-19 mortality rate.Several studies reported similar findings related to age and chronic diseases (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . In Italy Conticini et al. (21) discussed that factors such as the age structure of the affected population, the great differences between the Italian regional health systems, the capacity of intensive care units in the region, and prevention policies adopted by the government had played a major role in the spread of and mortality for SARS-CoV-2, presumably more than long-term air pollution itself. The effect of poverty on COVID-19 mortality is less described in the literature, but it represents a major risk condition in developing countries, probably related to unstable employment and income, lower health literacy, and limited access to preventive health services (43, 44) . A few recent ecological studies in the US at the county level have reported a correlation between COVID-19 mortality rate and some social disparities such as poverty status and non-English speaking households and other ethnic minorities (45, 46) .The strengths of this study include the use of nationwide public government data at the municipality level and the adjustment for nine sociodemographic and health conditions using a hurdle model. The main limitation of this study is the lack of empirical data for the long-term estimation of PM 2.5 exposure. The estimation of PM 2.5 concentration in this study comes from the CAMSRA model, which has been evaluated using independent measurements available in different world regions at the surface level and in the tropospheric column. These evaluations show that CAMSRA successfully reproduces levels and trends of aerosols and gases (47) . A recent research conducted to evaluate the performance of CAMSRA over the cities of Bogota, Medellin, and Barranquilla for PM 2.5 , CO, and NO 2 concentrations comparing measurements from the air quality J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f monitoring networks with retrieved CAMSRA concentrations showed that CAMSRA is able to reproduce PM 2.5 levels and trends in these three cities ( Figure S3a) . However, the model largely underestimates NO 2 and CO concentrations (48) . Additionally, we compared the daily average concentrations of CAMSNRT with surface concentrations in the same cities during the quarantine period ( Figure S3b) , and the results also indicate that CAMSNRT adequately reproduces the trends and levels of surface PM 2.5 , with a tendency to underestimate surface levels at higher PM 2.5 concentrations during the dry season.Although elevated levels of PM 2.5 are observed in urban areas, PM 2.5 distribution in Colombia shows that even medium-size and small municipalities have similar or even higher concentrations of PM 2.5 . This behavior coincides with aerosols' geographical distribution reported in previous studies for Colombia (30, 49) . These studies indicate that biomass burning is a critical source of PM 2.5 in Colombia and that both large and Our study has other limitations. First, the ecological study's nature precludes the extrapolation of inferences from the empirical evaluation of hypotheses based on clusters (i.e., municipalities) to the individual level. Therefore, the absence of a relationship between long-term exposure to PM 2.5 and mortality among patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 should at best be regarded as provisional. Second, in the absence of reliable NO 2 and O 3 long-term exposure estimations, we could not incorporate them into the analysis or evaluate the independent association of PM 2.5 and mortality in the context of multi-pollutant models. Third, mortality data reflect fatal cases among patients with a confirmatory diagnosis of the infection, excluding deaths among undiagnosed individuals (due to low testing rates or unreliable test results) and those occurring outside of hospitals. Systematic differences in municipalities' capability to comprehensively and correctly identify and register deaths attributable to the infection could have biased our estimate of effect. Although this issue could not be directly addressed in the analysis, adjusting for testing rates and hospital beds capacity should have partially corrected for differential readiness of municipal health systems to cope with the epidemic.There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM 2.5 and mortality rate for COVID-19 at the municipality level in Colombia. Demographics, health system capacity, and social conditions did show an ecological effect on COVID-19 mortality. The use of model-based data to estimate the long-term PM 2.5 exposure is an ",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-26,11

About a case,"Lung abscess is one of the most common lung infectious diseases in the world and is characterized by purulent collection in the cavity secondary to necrosis of the lung parenchyma. Generally the treatment is based on antibiotic therapy; however, when the lung abscess becomes chronic or presents complications such a hemoptysis, the lung surgery is the most pertinent option. The lobectomy is the surgery of choice for chronic lung abscess; however, postoperative complications are the main cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality; for example, pneumonia has an incidence in the Abbreviations: SARS-COV-2, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19, Coronavirus disease -19; RT PCR, Real time polymerase chain reaction; IgM/IgG, Immunoglobulins M and G; AARB, Acid alcohol resistant bacillus; C-RP, Creactive protein; LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase; SatO2, Oxyhemoglobin saturation; PaO2, Oxygen blood pressure; FiO2, Inspired fraction oxygen; WHO, world health organization .* Corresponding author.E-mail address: ricardoluis222@hotmail.com (R. Taipe).remaining lung that varies from 2 to 22 %. In mid-December 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out in Wuhan Hubei province, China. Currently the number of confirmed cases continues to increase rapidly in many countries around the world, especially in Latin America. Although the general mortality rate for this viral infection is around 2-3 % in certain population groups (diabetes mellitus, patients undergoing surgery for other indications) it can increase to 50 %. [1] In the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, two scenarios should be considered: the first surgical trauma and stress responses can lead to weakened immune systems that also makes patients susceptible to SARS-COV-2 infection and have a higher risk of death after becoming infected, so we must delve into the preoperative diagnosis of this infection to offer timely treatment. The second, pulmonary pathology can coexist with COVID 19 infection and in this case the risk-benefit of the surgical intervention should be assessed, especially if the patient has low surgical risk and the surgery is considered urgent. Here we report a case that provides experience and lessons for clinical and pathological diagnosis; as well as its timely treatment in the context of SARS-COV-2 pandemic. The data consigned in this case report were extracted from the clinical history, pathological report and operative report of the patient, who underwent pulmonary surgery for lung abscess complicated with hemoptysis and presented severe form of COVID-19 in the postoperative period. Likewise, the patient authorized and consented to the publication of this case. Likewise, this case report is in accordance with the SCARE 2018 criteria.Male patient, 36 years old, from Cañete -Peru. Presents illness time of 1 month, associated with symptoms such as general malaise, productive cough and fever. In the chest X-ray: it presents homogeneous radiopacity, defined edges 8 × 7 cm in diameter in the lower third of the left hemithorax. At the beginning, he was treated with ciprofloxacin + cephalosporins, without remitting symptoms, so he underwent a chest tomography in the third week of illness, which revealed a ""cystic"" image with heterogeneous content in the left lower lobe, suggestive of lung abscess versus Complicated pulmonary hydatid cyst (see Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, it is treated with vancomycin and intravenous meropenem. Despite antibiotic treatment, symptoms of fever persist and chest pain and hemoptysis of 50−100cc in volume were added, 1 week before surgery. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru, 6 serological tests were performed to discard SARS-COV-2 and 1 real time PCR at Cañete Hospital, which were non-reactive. Patient is referred from Cañete hospital to a clinic in Lima for surgical intervention; in this establishment, a novo serological test to discard COVID-19 was performed, the result was non-reactive. Therefore, the surgery is performed under strict biosecurity measures: N95 masks, personal protective equipment for all participants. The approach was performed by left vertical axillary thoracotomy, general anesthesia, and one-lung ventilation. The surgery performed: lower left lung lobectomy; the findings were: pleuroparenchymal adhesions and the lower lobe of the left lung was ""hepatized"" (see Figs. 3 and 4); bleeding approximately 100cc so it was not necessary transfusion of blood components. During the surgical procedure, the patient proceeds without intercurrences, tolerates surgery without com- plications, goes to recovery room with oxygen therapy: 3 L/min by binasal cannula. On the first postoperative day, he presented tachycardia and tachypnea. In addition, chest radiograph shows atelectasis of the left upper lobe (see Fig. 5 ); therefore, it is intensified in respiratory physiotherapy. Regarding chest drainage: the first day: 150 cc of serohematic fluid. On the second postoperative day, he persisted with fever of 38.5 • C, tachycardia and tachypnea, therefore we started vancomycin 1 g every 12 h and meropenem 1 g every 8 h, in addition, he continued with oxygen therapy by binasal cannula 2 L/min (SatO2 = 96 %). On the third postoperative day, he presents 2 fever peaks of 39 • C, for which the dose of meropenem is increased to 2 g every 8 h. Likewise, the oxygen requirement increases since he presents sudden desaturation (Sat O2 = 82 %), for which we change to high-flow oxygen therapy by reservoir mask at 10 L/min. Despite supplemental oxygen, oximetry ranged from 94 to 95%. Thoracic drains in 200 cc serous fluid. No air leak. Hemogram: leukocytes 11, 200 and hemoglobin: 10 g/dl.On the fourth postoperative day, the fever partially subsided, but persisted with an oxygen requirement of up to 15 L/min per mask with a reservoir. The oximetry ranged between 89-90 % with this therapy. Patient presents poor general condition, tachycardia and polypneic. Due to a torpid evolution, we requested a chest CT scan with contrast. In this examination, the right lung presents ä ground glassïmage in the three lobes associated with areas of multiple consolidation compatible with the Crazy Paving pattern of SARS-COV-2 (see Figs. 6 and 7). In the mediastinal view there are no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism. Left upper lobe is shown with almost complete expansion and minimal left pleural effusion. Consequently, a serological test for COVID-19 is repeated, which has a reactive result (IgM / IgG).During the fifth to seventh postoperative day, the patient presented polypnea, fever, sweatiness and tachycardia despite pain management with ketorolac and tramadol. He was evaluated by infectiology who suggested blood cultures due to the suspicion of added bacterial infection and search for AARB (acidalcohol resistant bacillus). Patient persists with poor evolution, severe hypoxemia despite supplemental high-flow oxygen therapy (reservoir mask). Consequently, due to the severe SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, it is proposed to refer the patient to a center with a mechanical ventilator and an intensive care unit. However, despite the efforts to refer him to a more complex center, there was no success due to the spread of the coronavirus infection in our country. Therefore, it was decided to maintain high-flow oxygen therapy, respiratory physiotherapy, conscious pronation, and absolute rest. The blood counts, C-reactive protein, LDH, D-dimer, serum ferritin are requested and antibiotic coverage is changed to meropenem 2 g intravenously every 8 h. NSAIDs and nebulizations are suspended while enoxaparin is started at a dose of 60 mg subcutaneous every 12 h, likewise, Ivermectin 6 mg / dL is administered at a dose of 60 drops per day, for two consecutive days.During the eighth to the twelfth postoperative day, the patient presents elevated acute phase reactants, associated with a torpid evolution and poor ventilatory dynamics despite oxygen support and the indicated therapy, within the framework of the so-called ""cytokine storm"" of SARS-COV -2. Consequently, at this stage it is decided to start pulses of hydrocortisone; in addition, the oxygen flow as administered at 100 % and the oxygen saturation ranged between 88-90 %. On the other hand, the pathological anatomy results of the surgical specimen showed: left lower lobe, findings compatible with chronic lung abscess associated with bronchiectasis, surrounding lung parenchyma with signs of acute infection.From the third week after surgery, the patient begins to show clinical improvement; that is, the fever resolved and the flow of oxygen decreased to 50 % (FiO2 = 0.50). Also we continue with respiratory physiotherapy antibiotic coverage. Likewise, acute phase reactants began to decrease and ventilatory and hemodynamic parameters began to improve. During the fourth week, the patient improved oximetry to 94-95 % with FiO2 = 0.30 and improved general condition, as well as his appetite.Consequently, at the end of the third to fourth week after surgery, our patient was discharged from the hospital, spontaneously ventilating with antibiotic coverage, low-dose corticosteroids, and a high-protein diet; in addition, he continued with his respiratory rehabilitation therapy and incentive inspirometry.The disease caused by the new coronavirus -19 (COVID-19) appeared in December 2019 in China and spread to the entire world in two months, causing a pandemic and thousands of deaths from severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2). This coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus and is highly infectious (subgenus sarbecvirus, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae). The main mode of transmission through droplets of the respiratory tract (aerosols) and also by direct contact. The incubation period for this virus is generally 4-8 days and the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough and some cases dyspnea. On the other hand, pneumonia is known to be the most common complication after surgical lung resection. However, there are several studies in the literature that report on the perioperative clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients who underwent lung resection for lung cancer, such as lobectomy or pneumonectomy (1) . Most patients present with the asymptomatic or mild form of the disease, but approximately 15-20 % fall into the severity group, which means that they require oxygen support as part of the treatment. This group has a high mortality rate and is associated with advanced age, underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, or medical procedures (surgical intervention for other indications), as in our case [2] . The patient presented persistent fever from the first post-operative day, accompanied by cough, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Although these symptoms are typical of COVID-19, they are also common symptoms in postoperative lung surgery patients. Therefore, it was a great challenge for us to distinguish between COVID-19 and nonspecific pneumonia in the context of lung surgery, especially because the patient had 7 serological tests (so-called rapid) for detection of anti-COVID-19 antibodies: negative. In this case, the computed tomography of the chest was decisive for the diagnosis of this disease, since it showed an image of bronchopneumonia with a wide distribution, acrazy pavingpattern, both in the operated lung and the non-operated lung; however the right lung (not operated) was the most affected [3] (See Table 1 ).Bacterial and fungal superinfections have been described after COVID-19 pneumonia; There are even reported cases of lung abscess post-infection by COVID 19, up to 1 month after the viral infection. Likewise, the reports presented in the medical literature do not specify whether this complication is a direct consequence of the specific toxicity related to COVID-19 [4] . The remarkable thing about this case is that the lung abscess had already been present since 1 month before the symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia, so the possibility that the abscess is directly due to COVID-19 is unknown. In addition, this case teaches us that we must be aware of the complications of COVID-19 and that serological tests to detect anti-COVID-19 antibodies have many false negatives. The case reported accidentally represents a COVID-19 lung sample, since the surgery performed was due to a chronic lung abscess complicated with hemoptysis.However, the literature reports that the incubation period until the appearance of symptoms after exposure to SARS-COV-2 is on average 4-5 days and this period can be extended up to 14 days, so our patient probably already the infection was present before the scheduled surgery but it was in an early phase not detected by serological tests (incubation period). Likewise, the initial symptoms, which appeared after 2 days, such as fever, cough and dyspnea could have been confused with postoperative complications of chest surgery. However, dyspnea and the high flow oxygen requirement, together with the tomographic findings, were key for the diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia; Since according to clinical, radiological and laboratory criteria, the patient had to enter the intensive care room; However, it was not achieved because at that time the hospitals and clinics in our country were collapsed (See Table 2 ).The biomedical literature refers that a critical factor is early diagnosis, since late diagnosis is associated with high mortality. Likewise, some authors refer that lymphopenia is due to the redistribution of lymphocytes to the tissues of the affected target organ, another possibility is that the SARS-COV-2 virus produces myelosuppression [7] . Consequently, due to a timely diagnosis, our patient was managed with strict monitoring and high-flow oxygen therapy, associated with full anticoagulation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Other authors have reported that the degree of decrease in the number of lymphocytes after lung surgery is closely related to the progression of COVID-19 [8] , in the case of our patient there was a progressive decrease in the initial lymphocyte count (value absolute) and remained so during 2 weeks of treatment (See Table 3 ). Likewise, typical COVID-19 chest tomography images are characterized by:ground glasspattern (indicator of the early exudative phase), reticular pattern and consolidation (indicator of progressive disease) [5, 9] ; in our case, the patient developed a severe ""ground glass"" pattern calledcrazy pavingpattern that affected 70 % of the right lung (not operated) and 20 % of the remaining lung lobe. The involvement of the left upper lobe (remnant) was minor and was probably due to the surgery performed (lobectomy). It is worth mentioning that our patient was requested a chest tomography 5 days before surgery, where the lungs did not show radiological signs of COVID-19. On the other hand, our patient has over-aggregated bacterial infection, either due to colonization, atelectasis or bacteremia, so the COVID-19 pneumonia that the patient developed was aggressive with marked elevation of ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), protein C-reactive (PCR), among others (see Table 3 ).Therefore, during the pandemic, even in asymptomatic patients, we recommend being evaluated with at least one chest X-ray before surgery to reduce the risk of infection. The main pathological result of the surgical specimen was lung abscess; however, non-typical abscess signs and patterns are observed in the periphery of the lung parenchyma; thus, they are thought to be histopathological signs of an early COVID-19 infection (see Figs. 8 and 9 ). There are not many pathological studies performed on the basis of autopsies or biopsies in COVID-19. This is due to the aggressiveness of the epidemic, hospital collapse due to the volume of hospitalized patients, as in the case of Peru, and the high rate of transmission, which makes invasive diagnostic procedures not a clinical priority [6] .According to our review, there are reports of patients who underwent pulmonary lobectomy for adenocarcinoma and COVID-19 infection was found retrospectively at the time of surgery. The results of the histopathological study showed: edema and proteina-ceous exudate associated with focal hyperplasia of pneumocytes II and irregular inflammatory infiltration of multinucleated giant cells [7, 9] . In other pathological studies published in China, in addition to these findings, epithelial hyperplasia and fibroblastic proliferation (fibroblast plugs) were reported [10] . The results of the pathological anatomy of the case in question showed: edema and proteinaceous exudate, vascular congestion (see Figs. 10 and 11), fibrinoid material, multinucleated giant cells, prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltration (see Figs. 12 and 13). It should be noted that the histopathological findings found in our case preceded the development of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and probably represent an early phase of the disease (see Figs. 14 and 15 ).Regarding the treatment for COVID-19, the biomedical literature mentions that there is no antiviral therapy or specific vaccine, therefore the treatment is symptomatic. In severe cases, oxygen therapy is used, and when supplemental oxygen fails, mechanical ventilation may be chosen. WHO recommends high-flow oxygen therapy by binasal cannula or reservoir mask; In addition, it defines severe disease as: respiratory rate> 30/min, blood oxygen saturation (SatO2) <93 %, PaO2 / FiO2 ratio <300, and pulmonary infiltrates> 50 % in 24-48 h [11] . In the case of our patient, on the third and fourth days he began to present symptoms and signs of severity due to the SARS-COV-2 infection, for which he received high-flow oxygen therapy by reservoir mask.On the seventh postoperative day he required a mechanical ventilator; since high-flow oxygen therapy was insufficient and PaO2 / FiO2 decreased to less than 100. Despite efforts in the search for a mechanical ventilator, we could not get it because we were facing a collapse of hospitals and clinics throughout our country due to the pandemic. However, the timely use of systemic corticosteroid associated with oxygen therapy and respiratory physiotherapy gave support to our patient, so it was possible to maintain oximetry at around 90 %. For a cost issue, we do not use antivirals, such as remdesivir or IgG1 monoclonal antibodies such as tocilizumab. Instead, we use broad-spectrum antibiotics such as high-dose meropenem to treat secondary bacterial infection; in addition, ivermectin 200mug / kg for two days from the onset of symptoms.Fortunately, our patient begins to improve between on the tenth and fourteenth days, respiratory physiotherapy was intensified at this stage. At the time of preparing this article there are not many reports on pulmonary rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients during the acute stage; therefore, we believe that under strict biosafety measures, this type of treatment can be offered, especially in postoperative lung surgery patients.This case teaches us that patients with non-COVID-19 lung pathology who have an indication for lung resection, despite the risks posed by SARS-COV-2, should undergo surgery to reduce the risk of death and even when the infection appears in perioperative period. For this reason, we recommend considering for the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection, in addition to PCR in RT or serological tests, to consider performing a chest tomography before surgery to investigate lung infiltration or other radiological changes that precede the onset of symptoms so that the patient receives early treatment and health personnel have the appropriate biosafety equipment. We recommend employing early treatment with the medications and therapies (respiratory physiotherapy) available at that time for the management of COVID-19 pneumonia. Likewise, we consider that COVID-19 serological tests are of no use in early diagnosis and, on the contrary, confuse decision-making, therefore we do not recommend their use in the preoperative period of patients who require lung surgery.The authors of this case report declare have not conflict of interests with any entity or medical laboratory.Our case report has not sponsors.

b3dd45ce1e036ca9a34fefe2848260394cea47d3,An Intervention to Increase Situational Awareness and the Culture of Mutual Care (Foco) and Its Effects During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial and Qualitative Analysis,"Situational awareness (SA) ""describes the ability of an individual to maintain an adequate internal representation of the status of the environment in complex and dynamic domains where time constants are short and conditions may change within seconds and minutes"" (1) . It was initially studied in the context of aviation as a crucial factor for decision making. The failures in SA were classified in three levels: (I) -failure to correctly perceive the information, (II)-failure to comprehend the situation-, or (III) failure to project the situation into the future. In Level I, relevant data is not available; difficult to detect or discriminate; information is misperceived, or a memory problem happens. Level II involves mainly the use of an incorrect mental model, lack of or incomplete mental model, overreliance on default values. Level III involves, for example, an over projection of current trends (2) . SA is especially important to decision-making in health care. Comprehending the situation to provide a mental model is crucial for anticipating any change in the environment and delivering optimal care (3).It is known that stress is associated with health problems such as mental and cardiovascular disorders, also being a cause of absenteeism and reduced productivity in companies (4, 5) . An increase in the risk of injuries and illnesses at work has been associated with fatigue, stress, haste, distraction, emergency situations, excessive noise, complex procedures and anger, among other factors (6) . A large part of these factors decreases attention from work in progress and may affect SA. This situation can be improved by training workers' attention and awareness during daily activities, since it would encourage a return to focus on the task at hand and the possible risks associated with it. Participants in a mindfulness training group significantly improved the aspect of attention known as orienting when compared to participants in a control group (7) . In a review of brain regions and mindfulness training, the authors proposed the involvement of the anterior cingulate and striatum (attention control), prefrontal and limbic regions and striatum (emotional regulation), insula, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (self-awareness) (8) . In other words, mindfulness training presents repercussions not only in cognitive, but also in emotional control, and can be one of the factors which improves SA.In the health care area, studies conducted with nursing teams suggest that mindfulness can be an effective and inexpensive way to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, psychological distress and burnout, improve well-being, increase quality of life and a provide a higher level of satisfaction with life (9) (10) (11) .SA is important for the safety of patient and health care team with improved clinical outcomes. The environment is complex and dynamic especially when high technology is involved, and complex human interactions change from moment to moment. Human factors are core in SA, therefore any team member should challenge another without fear. Mutual care demands that the team fell free to speak up if they notice anything which may compromise the quality of care or safety of team members (3) .On 25th May 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 5,370,375 confirmed cases in 216 countries and 344,454 confirmed deaths. Consequently, health care professionals are facing the most challenging situation in this century (12) . In a meta-analysis about the mental health of health care workers (HCW), anxiety presented a prevalence of 23.2%, insomnia 38.9% and depression 22.8%. Female HCW and nurses showed higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff. Training SA abilities became vital to ensure the safety and quality of care of HCW.In 2019, before any sign of COVID-19 pandemic, an intervention to increase SA and mutual care (Focus con Consciousness-FoCo) was developed and tested in two units, an Emergency Care Unit and a Residential Facility for the Elderly in Sao Paulo, Brazil. As far as we know, after a search in PubMed, there were no other studies with similar interventions for health care professionals evaluated before and during an epidemic or pandemic. We hypothesized that FoCo would increase mindfulness, self-compassion, positive affect, sleep quality, and reduce stress perception, negative affect, and symptoms of mental diseases.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a training to increase situational awareness and mutual care designed for HCW in their working hours. We also investigated the perception of the FoCo training for the COVID-19 pandemic moment, in May 2020, almost 6 months after we finished the data collection at the Emergency Care Unit, which became a COVID-19 treatment reference for the care of a population depending on the public health system, in Sao Paulo, Brazil.Health care professionals (nurses, nursing technicians, physical therapists and caregivers of the elderly) of both genders, ages from 18 to 60 years old, working in two units, 41 from an Emergency Care Unit (ECU) and 29 from a Residential Facility for the Elderly (RE), participated in the study. All 74 professionals from the ECU and RE working during daytime where invited to participate in the study (Figure 1 ).Inclusion criteria: being available to participate in the training and carry out evaluations before and after it.Exclusion criteria: being away or on vacation in the research project period, or under psychiatric treatment.This study is registered in clinicaltrials.gov NCT04362397 and has the Ethical Committee approval number 14788419.1.0000.0071.a) Socio-demographic and clinical data: data that characterize the participants in the socioeconomic, educational, mental and physical health status. b) Mindful Awareness Attention Scale (MAAS): Using scales from 1 to 6, the individual classifies how he/she experiences everyday situations, answering 15 questions about their level of attention or awareness (13) . c) Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). This is a 26-item scale that measures how someone typically acts toward themselves in difficult times. The subject has to choose from 1 to 6 points on a Likert scale (14) . d) Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS): scale composed of a list of 20 affects (10 positive and 10 negative) in which the participants respond on five-point Likert scales (15) . e) Self-Report Questionnaire (SQR-20): An inventory for the detection of psychiatric symptoms with 20 questions about mental health (16) . f) Perceived stress scale (PSS) This scale measures the degree to which individuals perceive situations as stressful. The items were designed to assess how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overburdened the people evaluated consider their lives. PSS is a general scale and can be used in different age groups, as it does not contain specific contextual issues. It is composed of 10 items related to sensations (17) . g) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): this scale with 19 questions assesses the sleep quality of the interviewee in the last 30 days, through objective questions (18) . In T0, 74 participants were invited to the study and 70 agree to participate. The professionals were randomized in groups A and B in the second semester of 2019. From T0 to T1, 7 participants did not come to T1 evaluation (four on vacation, one license, one moved to another unit, one dismissed); five participants absent in T1 were back to T2 and four from T1 did not come to T2 (three on vacation and one dismissed) (more details in Figure 1 -flow chart). The researcher responsible for the statistical analysis randomized the participants inside each professional category (i.e., nurses, nursing technicians, physical therapists and caregivers of the elderly) generating a list of random numbers in excel and were blind to the intervention and control groups. Group A received training in the FoCo program and group B comprised a waiting list group. After a month, group B received the training and group A was encouraged to continue the intervention. Participants were assessed before intervention and 1 month thereafter therefore, it was not possible to blind participants to the groups. A follow-up was scheduled during the COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate its effects.During all the study the safety department of the hospital were monitoring the participants to investigate possible harms or adverse effects.Initially the leaders of the health care departments attended a 1-h training and started to practice the intervention. The health care professionals, under the guidance of their leaders, were invited to participate in the study. They were categorized according to their profession and randomized to group A or B within their category. After signing the informed consent and filling the questionnaires, group A received the training, which lasted only 10-15 min.The content of the training is based on the three pillars of FoCo:-Becoming Aware (BA): everyday, before starting the routine, the participants in small groups closed their eyes and payed attention to their breathing; performed a relaxation exercise; remembered the main tasks of the day, that is, to be gentle with themselves and others; to speak clearly to the colleagues and patients, and to cultivate the inner and outer well-being. Additionally, they could practice Becoming Aware at any time of the day, including at home with their families. -License to Care (LC): if the participant noticed that a colleague had forgotten to put on any equipment of personal protection, or perform an important procedure, he or she was to advise immediately; if the participant met someone during the routine who did not look well, whether a patient or a colleague, he or she was expected to ask if the person needed any help. -Observation and Behavioral Approach (OBA): an observer who is trained in OBA would approach a professional and tell him or her if they agreed to be observed during their routine tasks. If they agreed, the observer would stay there for a while and after that would give constructive feedback about their behavior, especially focused in safety. This approach was already implemented in the institution before the entire FoCo intervention.The data collected were analyzed using the JASP program. Categorical data were expressed as percentage and the frequency distributions between groups were analyzed using Chi-square tests. For numerical data, analyses were carried out regarding the distribution of data, whereas for data with parametric distribution, the t-test was used, and for those with nonparametric distribution, the Wilcoxon test. Subsequently, Analysis of Variance for repeated measures were used to evaluate the effects of the intervention over time between groups. Pearson correlation and Linear Regression analyses were also performed.Thirteen participants of different professional categories (nurses, nursing technicians, physical therapists, and caregivers of the elderly) from the ECU and RE, representative of the sample recruited to the study, with a good narrative, were invited for interviews. Participants of both groups, A and B, were included in these interviews 1 month after receiving the FoCo training. For the 1 month interview, at least one representative of each professional category was selected, those who had a good narrative and communication skills to enrich the qualitative assessment. The interviews ended when finding theoretical data saturation by through the identification of the absence of new elements in each thematic group. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and submitted to content analysis as described by Bardin (19) . The most emblematic speeches of each category were presented in the results. The full content analysis report is presented as Supplementary Materials 1, 2.-What is your perception of the training in Becoming Aware? -What is your perception of the License to Care? How do you feel about undergoing Behavioral Observation and Approach training? -How do you perceive your attention and awareness regarding your work activities in the last month?For the 6 months interviews, during the COVID-19 pandemics all the 27 professionals who were at the Emergency Care Unit on the day of the interviewer's visit participated in the evaluation.We would like to have included the questionnaires and scales in this evaluation, however, due to the pandemic, the ICU professionals had a short time to answer questions and were dressed with all personal protective equipment's, therefore the interviewer were allowed only to record the interviews. Questions asked to the Emergency Care Unit health care professionals during COVID-19 (almost 6 months after we finished the FoCo study in 2019): There were no differences between ECU and RE in the questionnaires at baseline them, therefore we decided to perform the statistical analysis grouping the units. Groups A and B there showed no differences in gender, age, years of education, socioeconomic status and mental health, neither regarding psychiatric symptoms, selfcompassion, mindfulness, perceived stress, positive and negative affect and sleep quality at baseline ( Table 1) .The safety department of the hospital which was monitoring the participants during all months of the study did not detect any harm or adverse effect due to the FoCo intervention.In the comparison of both groups before and after 1 month of intervention in group A, both groups improved concerning psychiatric symptoms, self-compassion, and perceived stress ( Table 2) . After 1-month evaluation, group B also received the intervention. Since both groups improved from baseline to 1 month similarly, we decided to cluster A and B in one group in the comparison of the training from baseline to 2 months, when we found improvements in perceived stress and quality of sleep ( Table 3) .As PSS showed significant differences from baseline to 1 month and 2 months, we decided to explore a correlation analysis. PSS is correlated with all variables at baseline (p < 0.05), except PANASP. Therefore, to evaluate the effect of MAAS, SCS, SRQ, PANAS-N, and PSQI on PSS, multiple linear regression models were built using the stepwise method. The linear regression model was significant for the variables MAAS, SRQ and PANAS-N (p < 0.001), with the SRQ (ß = 0.676; p < 0.001). PANAS-N (ß = 0.560; p = 0.007) proved to be positive predictors for PSS, while MAAS (ß = −0.124; p = 0.033) was a negative predictor for PSS ( Table 4) . -I wanted to say that I liked it a lot, it's very good, whoever has the opportunity to do it, has to do it, because it helped me, and I'm sure it helped many colleagues who did it from the beginning, (UPA25) -Ah! I found it super interesting, because that training gave us an awareness of how we get centralized, of how you get back to the axis, (UPA37) -I believe that nothing is in vain, you know, that everything is to improve, it is if this was proposed to us, growth, you know, individual growth, of the group and finally, of the department. (UPA08) Almost 6 months after receiving FoCo training, 27 participants of the study belonging to the Emergency Care Unit, which became a COVID-19 treatment reference, taking care of a population that depends on the public health system, were interviewed again, for us to investigate their perception of the FoCo training for the COVID-19 pandemic moment. They had to change their working schedule from daily 6 h (their original one) to 12-h shifts (1 day at work, 1 day off) when the pandemic started, and the unit was full of patients. During one of the shifts, which concentrated most of the participants of last year's study, we performed the interviews. One of the participants received COVID-19 treatment and presented post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and was not able to answer the questions. Another one we had to exclude from the study because she reported that she had answered the questionnaires but had not received the training directly from the instructor. Therefore, we had 25 valid interviewees (detailed reports are in Supplementary Material 2) . The following categories were identified:1) The Impact of Covid-19-I was leaving my house with tachycardia... arriving here sincerely with a pain in the belly, you know, just thinking that I was going to a place, . . . where everything was going to be COVID (UCL08) -it's a lot of intubation, the whole routine has changed (UCL24) -there are many moments when we feel exhausted... there are many moments that we don't seem to be able to. . . that will not work. So at this moment, especially at this moment, it's being really cool for us to use... we need to stop to repeat breathing and come back, right at a point that we can start again, but more peaceful..., that's where you stop, breathe, think, get a grip of yourself and come back! That is exactly what I have been doing many times. I have needed to make the ""Becoming Aware.""(UCL16) Sometimes we faced situations, then you remember ""Becoming Aware"" and you take a step away, breathe, . . . wait, be calm (UCL07).-. . . because I often perceive a sad colleague, crying, crestfallen and then I usually try to get him, get him out of the sector a bit, go up to the kitchen to have water, have coffee... so I think that in addition to taking care of myself I'm looking at the next one too (UCL29)I particularly wear all the PPE that is available and I try to wear it in the best possible way because apart from the patients I care for here, I have a family that I have to care for at home. . -My perception was that my care increased, . . . both with me and with the patient to whom I provide this care (UCL14) -. . . after we took the course so we can pay more attention to help colleagues. . . raise awareness of colleagues . . . we see something that may cause some risk and raising awareness to try to keep calm. . . (UCL34) -I think the care of the team in general is three times more than before, right, because of the fear of contamination, of contaminating a colleague, of contaminating oneself, of not taking it home, I think it was having an impact... you know, it ends up generating self-care, you have to be careful with others, whoever is there with you then automatically because of everything we have been through in this training, in the past, I think it fits well (this moment) (UCL10) -we are always alerting the next colleague, right... what I don't want for myself I don't want him to go through, right? (UCL43) -We know that we have to take care of the other, but before taking care of the other??? (UCL24)The ""License to Care"" . . . I find it extremely important because I often feel someone is taking care of me (UCL29) Yes, there was even a day when I was not emotionally well, you know, and one of the people noticed, he gave me a helping hand, so he called me, we talked a lot, I managed to keep my shift very calm, you know... it had an effect. (UCL10) yes, in fact I ended up receiving this guidance from my colleagues, because I ended up being contaminated with COVID-19, so I ended up receiving more than passing. (UCL18) -I would say that I even became a better person, because from the moment you take things more clearly, more calmly, you become a better person, so it has helped a lot, not only at work, in life. (UCL24) -My perception is that it helps a lot in our life, I even put it here in my room I always do it in the morning before leaving home (UCL07)The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a short training to increase situational awareness and mutual care designed for HCW. We also investigated the perception of this training for the COVID-19 pandemic moment, in May 2020, almost 6 months after we finished the data collection at the Emergency Care Unit which became a COVID-19 treatment reference.Before and after 1 month, both groups had improved in psychiatric symptoms, perceived stress and self-compassion ( Table 2) . Group A received the intervention and practiced 5 days a week with their leaders during this period of time. Group B participants belonged to the same health care units and despite having not received the FoCo training, they worked under the same leadership (who received the training before the research intervention started), with the colleagues of group A and possibly having some kind of interaction about the training with them. We instructed group A to avoid sharing the FoCo intervention with group B, however it could have happened. It may explain why group B also improved in their symptoms. Although we expected differences between groups, the literature has shown the impact of leadership on the work environment (20) . Leadership can affect the workforce as well as the delivery of healthcare. In an article about nursing leaders, they are identified as playing an important role in retention of nurses, producing quality outcomes for staff nurses and patients, therefore affecting the whole health care environment (21) . In a review about social and behavioral science to give support to COVID response, the authors mention the importance of leaders as representative members of the team (22) . In FoCo, leaders practice with the team and this can be one of the explanations for its effectiveness. Improved psychiatric symptoms, perceived stress and selfcompassion are also in line with the qualitative analysis, in which participants reported increased well-being doing ""Becoming Aware"" (feeling calm, relaxed, less stressed), greater self-awareness (increased perception and ability to deal with nervousness, tension) and self-care (doing well to take care of others, being generous to themselves) and an increase in risk perception.After 2 months (groups A and B clustered in one), the evaluation results indicated improvements in perceived stress and quality of sleep ( Table 3) . Stress reduction seems to be the main response to the intervention, lasting from 1 to 2 months after baseline evaluation. In the linear regression model, SRQ and PANAS-N proved to be positive predictors for PSS, and MAAS was a negative predictor for PSS. MAAS is the scale to measure mindfulness. Mindfulness is a component of SA and classically related to stress reduction and associated variables such as cardiovascular improvement and sleep (23-25). It is also an important factor for mental health, and moderates the effects of perceived stress on depression, emotional exhaustion, anxiety, positive affect and negative affect (26) . On the other hand, there were no differences in the scores of mindfulness along the study. The absence of differences in MAAS scores could be explained by the high scores in this scale of the HCW who participated in the study. Before the intervention, the mean score was 71.6 ± 9.85. In the validation study of MAAS in a Brazilian sample, the mean was 64.44 ± 7.73 in a group of meditators and 61.77 ± 10.48 in a sample of non-meditators (27) . In another study evaluating a group of participants who have been practicing meditation for more than 1 year, their mean before a meditation retreat was 55.7 ± 11.08 and after that 63.6 ± 8.27 (28) . An explanation for the high scores of mindfulness of this sample is the high level of training in this ability by health care professionals. The ECU and the RE are administered by the 38o. best hospital in the world and receive high quality training to deal with the daily activities (29) . Despite MAAS scores having not changed through the study, qualitative analysis suggested increased perception of self-awareness, attention to the tasks, and decision making. In this analysis, just after 1 month of FoCo training, the categories related to awareness were more emphasized, which means were more frequently mentioned by the interviewees.Increasing SA and mutual care (the aims of FoCo) allows participants to feel supported by colleagues, as we can see in qualitative analysis in the categories ""license to care is gratifying, "" ""caring for others, "" ""identification of risks and errors"" and ""well-being doing Becoming Aware, "" ""greater self-awareness"" and reduced stress symptoms.Some participants reported difficulty to implement ""License to Care, "" not feeling comfortable to talk to the colleagues to ""correct"" their behavior or ask whether they needed help. This is a feedback that we gave to the units involved in the project and the others where FoCo was implemented to reinforce the importance of ""License to Care"" training. Risk perception workshops in addition to Leaders talks and BA reinforcement sections were part of the ""License to Care"" augmentation process.COVID-19 pandemic is really challenging for the clinical staff. In a study comparing administrative and clinical staff, fear, anxiety and depression were significantly increased in the latter. Front line medical staff, including working in the critical departments such as respiratory, emergency, infectious disease, and ICU, showed higher scores on the scale of fear, anxiety and depression (30) . The interviews for the data collection, performed at the ECU (a reference in treatment of COVID-19) on a day when it was full of patients, showed the importance of the training before the pandemic and its incorporation into the routine.It is interesting that all participants from the 25 valid interviews have been using FoCo training during the pandemic, some of them doing part of it such as ""License to Care, "" and many of them keeping it a regular practice. Participants recognized the importance of this previous training last year for enabling them to deal with the stress of the pandemic, giving them the capacity to calm down when necessary, utilizing ""Becoming Aware"" and ""License to Care."" The initial difficulty reported to apply ""License to Care"" last year, that is, taking care of the colleagues, especially related to equipment of personal protection use, and being able to offer support when someone was probably not feeling well, was not present during the pandemic. The team was really committed to taking care of themselves and the group. The category ""Integrating selfcare and the care of other"" appeared during the pandemic, and the reports emphasized the mutual care that they were exercising at the ECU. Other changes reported were the reduction of hierarchal gradients, so that everyone at the HCW would feel comfortable to challenge each other without fear of consequences; mutual respect within the members, assuring the mutual care and everybody's right to speak up, if they noticed anything wrong or inefficient. It prevented turning a blind eye, improved patient and team safety (3) . Basically, they were grateful for having received the training last year and understood that it promoted the culture of mutual care and increased situational awareness.There are other hospitals implementing mental health protection and well-being promotion interventions for HCW (31) . However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the effects of an intervention and its effects during the present pandemic. This study has limitations such as the control group working in the same environment of the intervention group and having leaders who were already trained in the intervention. A future study should guarantee that the control group work in another unit with similar characteristics. Nevertheless, the randomized control study with additional qualitative analysis brought a wealth of information, and we recommend keeping this approach in further projects.Considering this combined approach, we conclude that FoCo training can be an important instrument for health care professionals both in times of pandemic and ""normal times, "" to increase situational awareness, the culture of mutual care and decrease the possibility of occupational injuries and illnesses.The original contributions generated for this study are included in the article/Supplementary Materials, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Ethics committee of the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein.

61b210181056be0bce03184a1b9929200728d82b,Desempeño del sistema de vigilancia colombiano durante la pandemia de COVID-19: evaluación rápida de los primeros 50 días,"La vigilancia en salud pública es una herramienta útil para la monitorización de enfermedades, particularmente las infecciosas, y se originó en el puerto marítimo de Venecia, Italia, en 1348, cuando tres guardianes de salud pública tenían como función detectar e impedir el desembarco de personas con peste negra. Este tipo de iniciativas dieron origen a estrategias preventivas como la cuarentena, la detección temprana de casos y el aislamiento (1) . Con el paso de los años, dicha vigilancia se ha ido refinando hasta convertirse en un elemento esencial para el manejo sanitario y la seguridad en cualquier país, especialmente en cuanto a las enfermedades infecciosas con potencial pandémico (2, 3) .Según los Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) de los Estados Unidos, la vigilancia en salud pública consiste en la ""recolección continua y sistemática, el análisis, la interpretación y la difusión de datos sobre un evento relacionado con la salud para su uso en acciones de salud pública encaminadas a reducir la morbilidad y la mortalidad y mejorar salud"" (4) . Si bien existen otras definiciones, todas con elementos comunes, la vigilancia en salud pública es la herramienta fundamental para el control de las epidemias, especialmente en lo tocante a los tratamientos o las vacunas para su prevención (5, 6) , como en el caso de la pandemia de COVID-19.En Colombia, la vigilancia en salud pública no ha sido ajena a los desarrollos técnico-científicos y ha seguido fundamentalmente la estrategia de formación de epidemiólogos de campo del CDC (7) . Un hito en la historia de la epidemiología de campo en Colombia ocurrió en 1993, cuando se inició la consolidación del grupo del Instituto Nacional de Salud encargado del manejo y el estudio de epidemias bajo parámetros modernos.A partir de entonces, han sido innumerables los casos de manejo de conglomerados y epidemias que pueden considerarse como éxitos de la epidemiología de campo colombiana (8) . Es el caso del manejo de pandemias como la de la influenza A(H 1 N 1 ) en el 2009, que permitió hacer una evaluación de la percepción de las competencias de los epidemiólogos y profesionales de salud pública para manejar este tipo de emergencias sanitarias (9) y contrastarla con los análisis objetivos del desempeño de la vigilancia en salud pública de otros países (10) . En ese momento pudieron detectarse, asimismo, algunas deficiencias que han tenido diversos cursos de solución con el paso del tiempo.En ese sentido, el presente trabajo tuvo como objetivo evaluar el desempeño del sistema de vigilancia en salud pública colombiano durante los primeros 50 días de la pandemia de COVID-19 en el país.Se analizaron los datos oficiales del sistema colombiano disponibles en la página web del Instituto Nacional de Salud (https://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/ Paginas/Coronavirus.aspx) y los informes situacionales de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). Si bien el sistema de vigilancia en salud pública está activo todo el tiempo, se incluyeron en este análisis los datos a partir del día en que fue diagnosticado el primer caso de COVID-19, el cual se reportó en Bogotá el 6 de marzo de 2020.Se entiende que la evaluación cobija todos los procesos involucrados en las labores de los epidemiólogos de campo en los equipos de respuesta inmediata, así como el procesamiento de muestras en el laboratorio y la generación de los reportes situacionales que se divulgan a nivel nacional e internacional.Se consideraron dos indicadores: i) la calidad de los datos según el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford, y ii) la oportunidad de la información. Este último indicador se consideró en atención a las necesidades internacionales o fronterizas de vigilancia de los fenómenos migratorios en el curso de una pandemia.Esta ley matemática, también denominada ""ley de los primeros dígitos"" , ""ley de Newcomb-Benford"" o ""ley de los números anómalos"" (11), señala que en un conjunto de números, aquellos que empiezan con el número 1 son más frecuentes que los que empiezan con otros dígitos, siguiendo un orden decreciente que se puede expresar como P(d)=log [1+(1=d)] d=1, 2, . . . , 9, donde una serie de números P(d) corresponde a la probabilidad de que un dígito sea el número inicial (12, 13) .Este método matemático ha sido particularmente útil y exitoso en la detección de datos fraudulentos (14, 15) . En el campo de la vigilancia en salud pública, se usó por primera vez durante la pandemia de influenza A(H 1 N 1 ) y, después, en las epidemias de dengue en Paraguay (16), de Zika en América (17) y de COVID-19 en China (18) .La oportunidad de la información se evaluó calculando la diferencia entre el tiempo en que se informaba el número de casos y fallecidos de Colombia en el portal del Instituto Nacional de Salud y el tiempo en que aparecía dicha información en el portal de la OMS. Dada la importancia de contar con información integral y oportuna a nivel mundial para definir las acciones multinacionales, este indicador puede entenderse como una evaluación de la magnitud del ""rezago temporal"" .Para evaluar el nivel de cumplimiento de la distribución descrita por la ley de Benford en los datos observados (casos diarios acumulados), se usaron las pruebas de razón del logaritmo de la verosimilitud y de ji al cuadrado mediante la macro digdis desarrollada por Ben Jann (ETH, Zurich). Para verificar el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford en los datos de las muestras pequeñas durante los primeros días de reporte, se usó la prueba exacta de Moreno (19) , ya que resultó tener un mejor desempeño que la prueba de Kuiper (20) . Dichos análisis se hicieron con el programa estadístico Stata 14™ (Stata Corporation, USA) o el programa R.En el cuadro 1 se encuentran los resultados del análisis del cumplimiento de la ley de los primeros dígitos en el número de casos acumulados día a día desde el 6 de marzo hasta el 24 de abril de 2020.Dado que las pruebas estadísticas para evaluar el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford son pruebas de bondad de ajuste, los valores de p más pequeños sugieren que esta no se cumplió. Debido a que se contaba con pocas observaciones en los primeros días, para estos datos se usó exclusivamente la prueba exacta de Moreno, cuyos resultados sugieren un buen desempeño el primer día; después disminuyó la calidad de los datos hasta que entre los días 3 y 11 de la vigilancia (8 a 16 de marzo) no se cumplió la ley de Benford. Para los datos a partir del día 8 de la vigilancia (13 de marzo) la evaluación se hizo con las pruebas de razón del logaritmo de la verosimilitud y de ji al cuadrado, las cuales registraron una mejoría en el cumplimiento de la ley de Benford; los días de mejor desempeño fueron el 28 y el 29 de marzo (p>0,80). Con valores más bajos, aunque estadísticamente satisficieron la ley de Benford, aparecen los días 20, 23 y 24 de abril, con valores de p entre 0,15 y 0,20. En el cuadro 2 y la figura 1 se presentan en detalle los resultados del último día de vigilancia incluido en este análisis.En la figura 2 se observan los casos acumulados según lo reportado por el Instituto Nacional de Salud y la OMS para Colombia en las mismas fechas. Como se puede apreciar, la línea azul se encuentra siempre por debajo de la línea negra, lo que equivale a una igualdad en los reportes, por lo que se concluye que hay un claro rezago (de dos días usualmente) en la información publicada por la OMS. transmitidos por insectos vectores. Sin embargo, cabe destacar que el mejor desempeño del sistema se registró con los casos probables de Zika valorados a partir de criterios clínicos y epidemiológicos, y relacionado con un mayor reconocimiento de cuadros sindrómicos específicos, como el de Guillain-Barré, y el de los defectos congénitos relacionados (22) .En cuanto a la oportunidad de la información, se pudo observar un rezago temporal importante entre el Instituto Nacional de Salud y la OMS, que corresponde, en gran medida, a las diferentes horas de cierre de cada informe situacional. La OMS suele hacer su cierre de datos hacia las 03:00 hora de Colombia (10:00, hora de verano de Europa Central), en tanto que el Instituto Nacional de Salud ha variado las horas, siendo más frecuente en las tardes (14:00 a 18:00) de cada día.En este sentido, es interesante anotar que el Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) de la Johns Hopkins University organizó un tablero interactivo en internet (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) que disminuye notoriamente este rezago temporal, pues recibe directamente de cada país o territorio los datos y va actualizando la información, lo que permite tenerla casi en tiempo real (23) . Este tablero ha sido la fuente más confiable en tiempo real de la pandemia alrededor del mundo.Uno de los avances más importantes del sistema de vigilancia colombiano es la disponibilidad de datos abiertos (https://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/ Paginas/Coronavirus.aspx), que permiten verificar la oportunidad del sistema en términos del reporte de los casos confirmados, casos que han sido investigados desde la condición probable en términos de la contención.Los hallazgos aquí descritos no corresponden a una evaluación completa de un sistema de vigilancia en salud pública. Otros elementos como la simplicidad, la flexibilidad, la aceptabilidad, la sensibilidad, la representatividad, la estabilidad y el valor predictivo positivo (24) deben contemplarse para tener una visión integral. Sin embargo, este análisis preliminar de la calidad de los datos y de su oportunidad en etapas iniciales de una epidemia resulta muy útil, pues permite realimentar rápidamente el sistema de vigilancia, con el fin de adoptar medidas correctivas si es el caso.Dado que en Colombia son muy diversas las capacidades en salud pública y epidemiología, en futuros análisis se podrán evaluar los sistemas de vigilancia en los departamentos y distritos para así determinar acciones a ese nivel que favorezcan el mejoramiento continuo de la vigilancia en salud pública.",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-12,11
5a3f9eb659b5565323abac62886504ea2c80831b,Optimal control approach of a mathematical modeling with multiple delays of the negative impact of delays in applying preventive precautions against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic with a case study of Brazil and cost-effectiveness,"On December 31, 2019, the Chinese authorities announced a dangerous virus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The virus was temporarily called the novel Coronavirus nCoV-19, then the International Virus Classification Committee named it (SARS-CoV-2) [19, 20] . This virus belongs to Corona viruses COVID-19 that infect the human respiratory system from seasonal colds. The danger of the novel Coronavirus 2019 lies in the fact that the infected person does not show symptoms of the disease in the incubation period, which ranges from two days to 14 days. The person then shows mild symptoms such as sneezing, a slight rise in temperature, then severe fatigue, a dangerous rise in temperature, difficulty breathing, and failure to breathe that leads to death, especially if the person suffers from a chronic disease such as diabetes, cancer, or HIV disease.According to the World Health Organization [1 -3] . The novel Coronavirus COVID-19 belongs to the strains of Coronaviruses, On February 26, 2020, Brazilian authorities announced the first case of COVID-19, the first case recorded in South America, of a Brazilian national from Italy. The spread of the COVID-19 virus was initially stable. Then in recent weeks, where the spread of the virus has experienced tremendous acceleration, reaching in June 02, 2020, 3 months after the registration of the first case, approximately 529,405 infected, 30,046 deaths. Brazil has become the second country in the world in terms of infected, after the United States of America.Where he recorded in State of S ao Paulo about 109,698 infected, followed by State of Rio de Janeiro about 53,388 infected, and in State of Ceará about 4 8,4 89 infected, and in State of Amazonas about 41,378 infected.A large number of mathematical models have been developed to simulate, analyse and understand the Corona virus. In a related research work, Tian-Mu Chen et al. [8] proposed a mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel Coronavirus, and Zhi-Qiang Xia et al. [9] Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modeling study. Sunhwa Choi and Moran Ki proposed [8] Estimating the reproductive number and the outbreak size of Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) using mathematical model in the Republic of Korea [22] Also, many researches have focused on this topic and other related topics [16, 17, [25] [26] [27] [28] 33, 40] . They have found the basic reproduction number R 0 and discussed the stability analysis of their model using the basic reproduction number. They found that the model is locally asymptotically stable at disease free equilibrium E 0 when R 0 < 1 and when R 0 > 1 , endemic equilibrium exists and becomes stable. In their research, equilibrium points are also globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. Besides these, many mathematical models were formulated to investigate the dynamics of infectious diseases with control (For example: [30] [31] [32] ).But they did not take into account delay in applying precautionary and preventive measures which may cause a delay in response to the potential threats.Delay in applying precautionary and preventive measures, such as:• The delay in schools closure in the affected countries. • The delay in closing airports and ports in a timely manner. • The delay in suspending air, land and navigation travels from and to the affected countries. • The delay in applying precautionary, preventive and strict measures when receiving travelers. • The delay in diagnosis of the infected cases, given that symptoms do not appear in the disease's incubation period. • The tolerance of others in the passage of passengers through airports in some countries. • The delay in diagnosis of infected cases, especially as symptoms do not appear in the disease's incubation period. • The delay in imposing quarantine among patients increases the spread of the disease.Perhaps the delay in applying the aforementioned precautionary measures was the main reason that Western Europe turned into the main focus of the global pandemic. This led to panic as the number of the infected individuals and deaths keep rising. Thousands of infected cases and hundreds of deaths are recorded daily in Italy, Spain, Germany, the United States of America and France. In Italy, on Saturday, 21 March 2020, a record number of deaths reached nearly 800 deaths, and more than 60 0 0 infected. The pandemic focus shifted from China to Western Europe and that led to the ease of transmission and spread of the disease in the neighboring countries and the countries of North Africa.In addition, most of the previous research has focused on continuous modeling. In this research, the statistical data are collected at the time (day, week, month, and year). Treatment and vacci-nation of some patients are also given at the same time. Consequently, it is more direct, more practical, and more precise to describe a phenomenon using continuous temporal modeling. Thus, differential equations appear like a more natural way of describing epidemiological models. In addition, numerical solutions are used for the discretionary differential equations, which encourages us to use the differential equations directly. and therefore can be easily implemented by mathematicians.To make the modeling of this phenomenon more realistic, we consider an optimal control problem governed by a system of differential equations with time to delay. We study an optimal control problem with time to delay in the state and control variable in a mathematical model SI W ICHR of kouidere et al. [25] and a time delay representing delay in applying preventive precaution and measures.The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , we represent our mathematical model SI W ICHR , analysis of a mathematical modeling of transmission of novel coronavirus ""COVID-19"". In Section 3 , a mathematical modeling with optimal control startegy of transmission of novel coronavirus ""COVID-19"". In Section 4 , we present a optimal control problem with multiple delays in our proposed model where we give some results concerning the existence of the optimal control and we caracterize the optimal controls using the Pontryagin's maximum principle. Numerical simulations through MATLAB are given in Section 5 . Finally we conclude the paper in Section 6 .We consider a mathematical model SI W ICHR of kouidere et al., that describes the of transmission of novel coronavirus ""COVID-19"". We divide the population denoted by N into six compartments: susceptible population Brazil S, the infected without symptoms I W , the infected with symptoms I, the infected with complications C, the number of people who have been quarantined in hospitals H and recovered R.Hence, we present the COVID-2019 mathematical model is governed by the following system of differential equation: α 2 : The rate of people have developed a rapid and dangerous development of the disease due to immunodeficiency, old age or children.α 3 : The rate of people have severe complications such as pulmonary failure.θ 1 : The rate of people with symptoms of mild virus who have been quarantined.θ 2 : The rate of people with serious complications who have been quarantined.σ : The rate of people who recovered from the virus. -δ 1 : Mortality rate due to complications. -δ 2 : The rate of people who died under quarantine in hospitals. Fig. 1 shows that, if Brazil does not apply preventive precautions to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of COVID-19 infected cases is likely to reach millions. and R (t) of system (15) are positive for all t ≥ 0 .Proof. It follows from the first equation of system (15) thatN . The both sides in last inequality are multiplied by exp (We obtainIntegrating this inequality from 0 to t gives: Proof. Also, one assumes that:It implies that the region is a postivily invariant set for the system (15) .Theorem 3. The system (15) that satisfies a given initial conditioncan be rewritten in the following form:The second term on the right-hand side of (8) satisfiesThus, it follows that the function ϕ is uniformly Lipschitz continuous, and the restriction onwe see that a solution of the system exists [18] .In this section, we will study the stability behavior of system (1) at an Disease Free Equilibrium point is denoted by E 0 and an Endemic Equilibrium point is denoted by E * . The first three equations in system (1) are independent of the variables C, H and R . Hence, the dynamics of equation system (1) is equivalent to the dynamics of the equation system:3.1. Equilibrium pointTo find the disease free equilibrium point, we equated the right hand side of model (1) to zero, evaluating it at I w = I= 0 and solving for the noninfected and noncarrier state variables. Therefore,The endemic equilibrium point E * = (S * , I * w , I * ) it occurs when the disease persists in the community. To obtain it, we equate all the model Eq.(1) to zero. then we obtain S * = μR 0where R 0 is the basic reproduction number given by:In our work, the basic reproduction number R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by an infected individual in a completely susceptible population. To obtain the basic reproduction number, we used the next-generation matrix method formulated in Bentout et al. [34] , Bani-Yaghoub et al. [35] , Driessche and Watmough [36] .Through the model equations system (2) , then by the principle of next generation matrix, we obtained:The inverse of V is given by Finally, we haveProof. The Jacobian matrix of system (3) at the disease free equilibrium point E 0 as follows:From the jacobian matrix J(E 0 ) we obtained a characteristic polynomial:we see that the characteristic equation p(λ) of J(E 0 ) has an eigenvalue λ 1 = −μ is negative. So, in order to determine the stability of the E 0 , we discuss the roots of the following equation λ 2 + aλ + b = 0 .By Routh-Hurwitz criterion, system (2) is locally stable if a > 0 and b > 0 .Obviously we see that a and b to be positive, (1 − R 0 ) must be positive, which leads to R 0 < 1 .So E 0 is stable if R 0 < 1 and unstable if R 0 > 1 .In this section, we present some numerical solutions of system (1) for different values of the parameters. The resolution of system (1) was created using the Gauss-Seidel-like implicit finitedifference method developed by LaSalle [37] , presented in Gumel et al. [38] and denoted the GSS1 method. We use the different initial values for each variable of state, and we use the following parameters:. and R 0 = 0 . 6059 < 1 . In this case, we obtained the following remarks: Over time, we notice that the number of susceptible people is close to 375 . 10 6 . We also note that the number of the people infected without symptoms and the number of the people infected with symptoms, are close to zero (see Fig. 2 ) .We start by a graphic representation of the COVID-19 diseasefree equilibrium E 0 and we use the same parameters and different initial values in table1. R 0 = 0 . 6059 < 1 R 0 < 1 . From these figures, using the different values of initial variables S 0 , I W 0 and I 0 we obtained the following remarks: The number of potential individuals increases and approaches the number S 0 = 1536 (see Fig. 2 ): Also, the number of the asymptomatic infected cases or cases with mild symptoms decreases and converges to zero (see Fig. 2 ). The number of the infected people with symptoms and carriers of the virus increases at first, after that it decreases and approaches zero (see Fig. 2 ). Therefore, the solution curves to the equilibrium E 0 = (S 0 , 0 , 0) when R 0 < 1 . Hence, model (1) is stable.According to theorem (3) , the Disease free equilibrium point E 0 of system (1) is stable on .Also, for the different initial values for each variable of state, and the following parameters:In this case, we obtained the following remarks: Over time, we notice that the number of susceptible people is close to 1 , 7 . 10 8 . We also note that the number of the people infected without symptoms is close to 1 . 504 . 10 6 , and the number of the people infected with symptoms are close to 3 . 5 . 10 6 (see Fig. 3 ).Therefore the solution curves to the equilibruim point E * when R 0 > 1 .we performed a sensitivity analysis, On the basic parameters. to help us to know the parameters that have a high impact on the breeding number of base R 0 .To achieve a sensitivity analysis of the model (1) , we followed the technique described by Karrakchou et al. [39] .This technique develops a formula to obtain the sensitivity index of all the basic parameters, defined asrepresents all the basic parameters. The sensitivity index of R 0 with respect to the remaining parameters are computed as follows:(μ+ α 3 + θ 1 )[ β 1 (μ+ α 3 + θ 1 )+ β 2 α 1 ] are obtained and evaluated at ( Table 1 ) . Their sensitivity indices are in Table 1 .As of today June 02, 2020, there is no cure or vaccine for the disease. So, we suggest the following strategies: there are four controls u (t) , v (t) , w (t) and z(t ) for t ∈ [ 0 , T ] , that represent consecutively the awareness program through sensitization and prevention, quarantine and health monitoring, diagnosis, monitoring and the last is treatment and psychological support with follow-up at time t. In order to have a realistic and logic model, we need to take in consideration that the movement of controlled individuals from the compartment of Infected without symptoms ( I W ) to quarantined in hospitals ( H), and transition by the contact between Infected without symptoms (Respectively Infected with symptoms) with susceptible to susceptible, and the transition of Infected with symptoms (Respectively Infected with complications) to quarantined in hospitals, and the transition of quarantined in hospitals to rocovered is subject to a delay. Thus, the time delay is introduced into the system as follows: at the moment,Thus, the delay is introduced into the system as follows: in time, only a percentage of individuals ( I W , C, I, H) that have been treated and controlled τ i time unit ago, that is to say that at the time k − τ i with i ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } , are removed to other compartments.So, the mathematical system with time delay in state and control system of variables is given by the nonlinear retarded system of differential equations:In addition, for biological reasons, we assume, for ϕ ∈ [ −τ, 0 ] , that S ϕ , I W ϕ , I ϕ , C ϕ , H ϕ and R ϕ are nonnegative continuous functions and u ϕ = 0 , v ϕ = 0 , w ϕ = 0 and z ϕ = 0 . It implies that the region is a postivily invariant set for the system (4) .Theorem 6. The controlled system (4) that satisfies the given initial condition (4) can be rewritten in the following form:The second term on the right-hand side of (5) satisfieswhere M 1 and M 2 are some positive constants, independent of the state variables S ( t ) , I W ( t ) , I ( t ) , C ( t ) , H ( t ) and R (t) .Thus, it follows that the function ϕ is uniformly Lipschitz continuous, From the definition of the controls u (t) , v (t ) , w (t ) and z(t ) and the restriction on S ( t ) ≥ 0 , I W ( t ) ≥ 0 I ( t ) ≥ 0 , C ( t ) ≥ 0 , H ( t ) ≥ 0 and R (t) ≥ 0 , we prove that a solution of the system exists [18] .The problem is to minimize the objective functionalwhere A, B, G and K are the cost coefficients. They are selected to weigh the relative importance of u (t) , v (t) , w (t) and z(t ) at time t, T is the final time.In other words, we seek the optimal controls u * , v * , w * and z * such thatwhere U is the set of admissible controls defined byIn this section we introduce a result concerning the existence of optimal control.There exists an optimal control (u * , v * , w * , z * ) ∈ U such thatProof. The existence of the optimal control can be obtained using a result by Fleming and Rishel [12] , checking the following steps: • The right hand sides of equations of system (4) are continuous, bounded above by linear function in the state and controls variable.• The integrand L (I, . . . , H, u, v , w, z) of the objective functional is clearly convex on U.There exists constants ζ 1 , ζ 2 , and β > 1 such that The integrand in the objective functional satisfiesThe state variables being bounded, letTherfore, from Fleming and Rishel [12] , we conclude that there exists an optimal control.In order to derive the necessary conditions for the optimal control, we apply Pontryagin's maximum principle [11] we have thewhere f i, is the right side of the difference equation of the i th state variable.Given the optimal controls (u * , v * , w * , z * ) and the solutions S * , I W * I * , C * , H * and R * of the corresponding state system (4) , there exists adjoint variables λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 , λ 4 , λ 5 and λ 6 satisfying:Furthermore, for t ∈ [ 0 , T ] , the optimal controls u * , v * , w * and z * are given by u * = min 1 , max 0 ,Proof. The Hamiltonian ∧ H is defined as follows:For t ∈ [ 0 , T ] , the adjoint equations and transversality conditions can be obtained by using Pontryagin's maximum principle [5, 10, 23] such thatFor t ∈ [ 0 , T ] , the optimal controls u * , v * , w * and z * can be solved from the optimality condition,By the bounds in U of the controls, it is easy to obtain u * , v * , w * and z * are given in (11) -(14) the form of system (4) .In this section, we present the results obtained by numerically solving the optimality system. In our control problem, we have initial conditions for the state variables and terminal conditions for the adjoints. That is, the optimality system is a two-point boundary value problem with separated boundary conditions at times step i = t 0 and i = t f . We solve the optimality system by an iterative method with forward solving of the state system followed by backward solving of the adjoint system. We start with an initial guess for the controls at the first iteration and then before the next iteration, we update the controls by using the characterization. We continue until convergence of successive iterates is achieved. A code is written and compiled in Matlab using the following data.Different simulations can be carried out using various values of parameters. In the present numerical approach, we use the following parameters values taken from [13] : The rate of people who died under quarantine in hospitals. 0.08 σ The rate of people who recovered from the virus 0.08 Denote the incidence of susceptible.2,000,000 Table 3 Population values used in numerical simulation Since control and state functions are on different scales, the weight constant value is chosen as follows: Table 2 and 3 below we will discuss only the negative impact of delay on the evolution of potential people and recovered people from the disease and their response to precautionary and preventive measures.The proposed control strategy in this work helps to achieve several objectives.For This strategy we use only the optimal control u (t) .From Fig. 4 and Table 2 and 3 , Delays in implementing the strategy to guide, educate and protect against COVID-19 in Brazil had very serious consequences after the outbreak of the epidemic after the initial settlement. This has resulted in a large and recently accelerated spread of more than 370,0 0 0 cases of COVID 19 virus, and its results will be a delay in early detection, which reduces the number of people healed and has significantly increased the number of deaths in Brazil.This delay is not taking into account advice and measures of prevention in a real and serious way:• Not taking the disease seriously in Brazil. • Not to wearing medical masks while keeping the hand clean, while reducing handshake. • Some consider this a regular virus, just like any other seasonal flu. • Not leaving a safe distance between him and the affected person.In Fig. 2 shows that the number of recovered from the disease decreased negatively, we notice that after 100 days the number of recovered decreased From 1 . 01 × 10 4 to 8 . 11 × 10 3 after the delay of 10 days, while the decrease in the number of suscepetible increased from 1 . 01 × 10 4 to 6 . 29 × 10 3 after the delay of 50 days.In his strategy, we combined two optimal controls w (t) and z(t ) . In Fig. 5 and Tables 2 and 3 showed that the number of recovered from the disease decreased negatively, we noticed that after 100 days the number of recovered decreased From 1 . 01 × 10 4 to 8 . 11 × 10 3 after the delay of 10 days, while the decreased in the number of suscepetible increased from 1 . 01 × 10 4 to 6 . 29 × 10 3 after the delay of 20 days. We explained these results by the following: whenever the delay in the application of the strategy of surveillance and diagnosis of expatriates in Brazil from endemic countries such as Italy is a model of the fact that the first infected with Brazilian citizen came from Italy, with a diagnosis of his health and placing it under sanitary control for a period of at least 14 days. This has led to the massive spread of the virus in all regions of Brazil. For This strategy we combined two controls v (t) and z(t ) .In Fig. 6 and Tables 2 and 3 and showed that the number of recovered from the disease decreased negatively, we notice that after 100 days the number of recovered decreased From 8 . 1 × 10 4 to 4 . 08 × 10 5 after the delay of 10 days, while the decreased in the number of suscepetible increased from 8 . 1 × 10 5 to 6 . 72 × 10 3 after the delay of 50 days. We clarify these results by the following: The delay in implementing the quarantine strategy for infected with COVID-19, whether inside hospitals or at home in Brazil, and has led to a spread widespread in all regions of Brazil, where the number of people infected now exceeds 370,0 0 0 cases of infection of COVID-19.To use this optimal strategy, we combine between the optimal controls v (t) , w (t) and z(t ) From Fig. 7 , and depending on the values in Table 2 , we note that the longer the delay in serious use and rapid interaction to reduce the spread of the virus. Fig. 4 shows that the number of people recovering from the disease decreased negatively and we notice that after 150 days the number of people recovered decreased From 4 . 56 × 10 5 to 3 . 17 × 10 5 after the delay of 10 days, while the decrease in the number of people recovered increased from 4 × 10 5 to 3 . 57 × 10 3 after the delay of 50 days. This decrease is due to several factors, including ( Figs. 6 and 7 ) : and without control v (t) and z(t ) and with delay.• The delay in schools closure in Brazil.• The delay in closing airports and ports in a timely manner in Brazil. • The delay in suspending air, land and sea travels from Brazil to affected countries. • The delay closure of schools, universities in Brazil. • The delay in applying precautionary, preventive and strict measures when receiving travelers to Brazil. • The tolerance of others in the passage of passengers through airports in some countries • The delay in diagnosis of infected cases, especially as symptoms do not appear in the disease's incubation period. • The delay in applying total quarantine among patients increases the spread of the disease in all over Brazil.In this section, we analyze the profitability of the previous three scenarios and strategies by comparing these two control strategies to determine the most profitable strategy. Following the method applied in several studies [29] [30] [31] , we assess costs using the differential cost-effectiveness (ICER). This ratio used compare the differences between costs and health outcomes of two competing intervention strategies.The ICER is defined as the quotient of the difference in costs in strategies i and j, by the difference in infected averted in strategies i and j(i, j ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } ) .Given two competing strategies (1) and (2), where strategy (2) has higher effectiveness than strategy (1) (T A (2) > T A (1) ), the ICER values are calculated as follow:where the total costs (T C) and the total cases averted (T A ) are defined, during a given period for strategy i for i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 by:is the optimal solution associated to the optimal control ( u * , v * , w * , Z * ) Using the simulation results and we ranked, in the Table 3 our control strategies in order of increased numbers of averted infections. Strategy I is compared with strategy J with respect to increased effectiveness, in reference to Table 4 . So ( Table 4 ) Since ICER (2) < ICER (3) , then strategy 3 is less effective than strategy 1. Therefore, strategy 2 is excluded from the set of alternatives. Next, strategy 2 is compared to strategy 4. The ICER values for strategy 4 Since ICER (2) < ICER (1) , then strategy 1 is less effective than strategy 2. Therefore, strategy 2 is excluded from the set of alternatives. Therefore, the conclusion is that strategy 1 (awarness campaigns to protect potential individuals infected with the virus, prevent contact with people infected with COVID-19 and with hospital quarantine for the infected) is the most effective strategy as previously mentioned by the proportions.In this paper, we introduced a mathematical model SI W ICHR of kouidere et al, that described the spread of COVID-19 virus in Brazil. We divided the population denoted by N into six compartments, susceptible population Brazil S, the infected without symptoms I W , the infected with symptoms I, the infected with complications C, the number of people who have been quarantined in hospitals H and recovered R . We analyzed a mathematical model and the local and the global stability of COVID-19 free equilibrium and COVID-19 endemic equilibrium are obtained. We also studied the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters to know the parameters that have a high impact on the reproduction number R 0 . In addition, in order to minimize the number of infected and infected with several complications and number of people in guarantine. We also introduced four controls which, respectively, represent sensitization, prevention, quarantine, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment and psychological support with follow-up. We also studied the optimal control with delay which represents measuring the extent of interaction with the means of treatment or awareness campaigns. that if preventive and proactive measures are implemented, such as awareness-raising and quarantine campaigns in all overe Brazil, the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic will be reduced, thus the number of people infected with the virus and the number of deaths will be reduced. We applied the results of the control theory and we managed to obtain the characterizations of the optimal controls. The numerical simulation of the obtained results showed the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.None.Approval was not required.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.

1f655dca0885acbc19980c69382bfb71811b9d32,COVID-19 challenges to dentistry in the new pandemic epicenter: Brazil,"Brazil has emerged as a new COVID-19 pandemic epicenter with steadily growing caseloads. By July of 2020, Brazil was the country with the second-most cases and deaths [1] . With dentistry being a context of high contraction risk and the international supply of personal data on possible changes in dental coverage between public and private assistance networks and new dental office routines that could be associated with economic burdens for dentists. In addition, the instrument was designed to assess how dentists were behaving during the pandemic, including their confidence of seeing COVID-19 patients and their fear of contracting the disease at work. The strategy for recruiting participants combined emails sent to dentists and a social media campaign, as further detailed. In order to maximize participation, the questionnaire was designed to be short and having only close-ended questions.In accordance with open science practices, the research protocol, questionnaire in its original language, databank of responses, and other information related to this study are published in an open platform (doi: 10 .17605/OSF.IO/DNBGS). An English translation of the questionnaire is presented in S1 Table. SURGE guidance [10] and CHERRIES reporting guideline [11] were consulted for this article, which does not cover the full survey content.A self-administered questionnaire was developed through consultation with eight experienced dental researchers in three discrete review rounds. The questionnaire was hosted online in Google Forms (Google; Mountain View, CA, USA). To obtain information about the reliability and validity of the tool and items, we conducted a pre-test in a sample of 22 dentists who were asked to evaluate its clarity, writing style, question sequence, and internal consistency. The population of pre-testers included differences in sex, age, working sector, region of country, experience, and education levels in an endeavor to resemble the population of dentists in Brazil [2, 12] . The pre-testers were asked to respond the questionnaire and record the time to complete; the mean time to complete ± standard deviation (SD) was 7 ± 2 min. Pre-testers scored the clarity of each question on a scale of 1 (not clear) to 5 (very clear). A text box was available after every question for pre-testers to explain their scores and place comments, critiques, suggestions, and other response options. All items with a score �3 (n = 9) were discussed by at least three researchers to obtain a consensus regarding how to improve them based on pre-tester feedback and then edited accordingly. The mean clarity scores ± SD were high in all cases, varying from 4.79 ± 0.10 for the 9 items that needed revision to 4.91 ± 0.11 for all 30 items considered together. The individual mean score of each question was � 4.86 in 25 questions, and between 4.59 and 4.82 in 5 questions (#5, #9, #12, #14, and #23). The pre-test was important to include other response options in questions #5, #9 and #23, which aided in reducing response bias. Different regulatory authorities were aggregated in question #12, and online training was grouped with general instructions in #14. These groupings were important to avoid overlapping between questions that did not collect multiple answers. Since the changes were minor, the decision was that a second pre-test round was not necessary. The questionnaire was reviewed and revised iteratively by the executive group for approval. Pre-testers were precluded from participating in the main study to avoid response bias.The first page of the questionnaire contained the study title and objective, an invitation for only dentists to participate and complete the questionnaire only once. They were noticed that their participation was voluntary and not paid, given potential risk and benefit information, and assured that all responses would be treated confidentially and anonymously. In addition, the respondents were asked not to participate if they were not dentists and not to respond the survey again if they have already done it before, reducing the risk for duplicate answers. Participants were directed to print or save the first page of the questionnaire as a PDF file to retain a copy of the informed consent form. Contact information of the researchers and institution responsible for the survey were provided. The participant had to click 'Yes' after the question ""Do you agree to participate in the study voluntarily?"" to access the questionnaire. The definitive questionnaire contained 30 mandatory close-ended items (three screens), divided into three sections: demographic and professional profile (n = 8); professional practices during the pandemic (n = 11); and structure and routine of the respondent's main workplace (n = 11). No randomization of items or adaptive questioning were used. The main outcomes were related to the professionals' behavior regarding their clinical routines. The options 'I'd rather not say', 'I don't know how to answer', and 'Does not apply' were available to avoid response errors (see the S1 Table for details about questionnaire content).A source population of 24,126 registered dentists were sent email invitations to participate. The source list was provided in April 2020 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The email contained a brief statement that included the study objective, the average response time, notification of the university conducting the study, and a website link to the questionnaire. The initial emails were sent on May 15, 2020; reminder emails were sent 5 days later. Additionally, we created an Instagram social networking campaign targeting dentists in Brazil (Facebook, Menlo Park, CA). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to use Instagram to recruit healthcare professionals. This social network is highly used by dentists in Brazil; as of, July 8, 2020, there were 5.1 million and 6.8 million posts with #dentistry and #odontologia (Portuguese for dentistry). The campaign, which started on May 20, invited dentists to participate in an online survey regarding the impact of the pandemic on their practices. A significant challenge was the fact that Instagram does not allow placing linking in comments or pots. Thus, an Instagram professional account was created (@odcovid) with a website link to the questionnaire in its bio page. Invitations were posted calling for the participation of dentists; they included the same information provided in the email invites and directed the dentists to use the hyperlink available on the @odcovid bio page. We used hashtags related to dentistry and COVID-19 to increase reach to the target population. Participating researchers shared the invitations on their personal Instagram profiles (feed and stories) and asked other dentists to aid in disseminating the campaign. Brazilian dentists with professional Instagram profiles were asked to also share the invitation post. We reached professionals categorized as micro (<10,000 followers) and meso (10,000-1 million) on the followers scale [13] . A second Instagram campaign with similar content but a slightly different visual presentation was created two days later.All dentists practicing in Brazil were eligible. Given a target population of~348,000 professionals, we estimated that 2,385 responses would be necessary to ensure a 95% confidence interval and 2% margin of error. Responses were collected between May 15 and May 24, 2020.Partial questionnaire completion was not possible. In some cases, responses were restricted to a specific population. The response options 'I'd rather not say', 'I don't know how to answer', and 'Does not apply' were treated as missing data. Descriptive statistics were used to identify frequencies and distributions of variables. Responses to questions on numbers of patients assisted weekly, before and after the pandemic, were subjected to t-test. Proportions were compared using chi-square tests. COVID-19 case and death counts in each Brazilian state were obtained from official Ministry of Health reports [14] on May 20, 2020, the date when the greatest number of survey responses was received. For analysis purposes, data were converted into thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths per one million inhabitants in each state. The units of analysis of both variables were the states. Multilevel mixed effect models were used to test the association between the contextual status of the pandemic in each state and dentistryrelated outcomes. Outcomes included decrease in number of patients assisted weekly (numerical), fear of contracting COVID-19 at work (no/a little vs. yes/a lot), and current work status (normal/reduced vs. not working/emergencies only). Linear and logistic models were used for numeric and binary outcomes. The models considered two levels of organization: dentist (level 1) and state (level 2). β-coefficients and Odds Ratios (OR) were reported. Contextual level variance was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for linear models and Median Odds Ratios (MOR) for logistic models (α = 0.05). All analyses were performed in Stata 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).A total of 3,122 valid responses were received over 10 days from all 26 Brazilian states and the federal district. No questionnaires were submitted with an atypical timestamp. Gathering of responses over time is shown in Fig 1A. The first 5 days included only email invitation responses. The response rate in this period was 2.1%, but the numbers of actual rejections/ losses cannot be calculated because we cannot estimate how many dentists actually received the questionnaire and decided not to respond, for instance. We received 1,572 responses in the first 24 h after the Instagram campaign started. As shown in Table 1 , respondents were most female (75%) and in practice for �20 years (74%). Meanwhile, 53% were working mainly in private clinics, whereas 36% were working in the public sector. The mean age ± SD of the respondents was 38 ± 11 years. Table 2 shows a demographic comparison between overall dentists working in Brazil and respondents who participated in the present survey. The distributions of responses by region, sex, and age were similar to the overall distributions of dentists in Brazil, except for a higher response rate from females and from Southern Brazil.Current work status was reported to be affected by 94% of the respondents. Only 2% reported normal or increased patient volumes. Not working/emergency only statuses were more common among dentists working in the less developed North and Northeast regions, and also in the Southeast region ( Fig 1B) . Interestingly, 59% of respondents reported be willing to assist or having already assisted patients online, and 26% regarded such virtual consults as being positive experiences.The proportion of dentists who reported not seeing patients at all due to the pandemic was similar between public and private networks ( Fig 1C) . However, whereas only 52% of private dentists reported seeing less patients than usual due to the pandemic, 76% of public clinic dentists reported maintaining only emergency appointments, yielding a significant difference on the effect of the pandemic on the volume of patients treated weekly (Table 3) . Before the pandemic, the public network covered more patients per dentist. During the pandemic, reductions in weekly dental care levels were reported to be 23 patients/private dentist and 39 patients/dentist in the public network.The effects of COVID-19 confirmed-case and death rates on the numbers of patients assisted (Table 4 ) showed dentists seeing two fewer patients/week for each 1000 cases per one million inhabitants, and three fewer patients/week for each 100 deaths. This effect was more pronounced in the public network: 2.45 and 3.25 fewer patients were seen each week for every 1000 cases or 100 deaths per one million inhabitants, respectively. In this analysis, the number of patients seen by dentists working in private practice was not significant.The impact of the pandemic on clinic routines was considered high or very high by 84% of respondents (0.6% reported no impact). Though 80% of respondents reported increased financial costs, only 15% adjusted prices for patients. The pandemic required infrastructural changes in the work setting for 74% of dentists. Most had new types of PPE available for all clinical appointments, including face shields (84%), N95 masks (71%), and disposable coats (66%). Patient screening became more expensive and time consuming due to antimicrobial mouthwashes (46%), completion of COVID-19 questionnaires (35%), and temperature monitoring (24%) mainly. For 35% of respondents, N95 masks were the predominant mask used (with at least half of patients).As reported in Table 1 , more than four out of five dentists reported undergoing at least some training in COVID-19 preventive measures, though fewer than one in twenty participated in practical in-clinic training. While almost a quarter of respondents reported feeling well/very well prepared to treat patients with COVID-19, only 5.3% had done so (Table 1) . Perception of preparedness to provide care for COVID-19 patients was influenced by education level ( Fig  1D) . It was more common for dentists who treated patients with COVID-19 to also have COVID-19 (6.4%), than for those who had not seen COVID-19 patients (0.7%) (Fig 1E) . Testing was also more frequent for dentists who had seen COVID-19 patients. Although 90% feared contracting the disease at work, only 8% indicated that they had been tested for COVID-19 (1.1% had a positive test). Fear varied among regions, being particularly elevated in the North and Northeast (Fig 1F) , and with years in practice ( Fig 1G) . Fear of contracting COVID-19 at work related positively to the numbers of cases and deaths reported in the state in which the respondent was working. Each 1000 cases per million inhabitants and each 100 deaths per million inhabitants increased the odds of having fear to contract COVID-19 (Table 5) . Likewise, MOR indicated that, compared to dentists in less impacted states, dentists practicing in more highly impacted states had a more than 30% greater likelihood of fearing that they may contract COVID-19 and were more than twice as likely to be offering emergency only appointments or to be closed altogether rather than maintaining a usual or even reduced volume of patients with full-service availability. For each 1000 cases and each 100 deaths per million residents in the state, the likelihood of not working or treating emergencies only, as opposed to working with a reduced or typical patient volume, increased by 36% and 58%.Here, we report the findings of the first survey, to the best of our knowledge, in which both email and Instagram social networking campaigns were used to reach healthcare professionals. The work statuses of 'not working' or 'emergency only' were more frequent in the less developed North and Northeast regions, and also in the Southeast (p<0.001). (C) Work status by sector: 52% of private dentists reported seeing less patients than usual, while most public dentists reported emergency appointments only (p<0.001). (D) Education level influenced how prepared professionals feel to assist COVID-19 patients (p<0.001). (E) Dentists who had confirmed contraction of COVID-19 themselves (6.4%) were more likely (p<0.001) to have assisted patients with COVID-19 (tested positive) than dentists who had not (0.7%). (F) Fear of contracting COVID-19 at work varied across regions, being higher in the North and Northeast regions than in other regions (p<0.001). (G) Fear of contracting COVID-19 at work was influenced by years in practice (p<0.001).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242251.g001 Details on the populations participating in the survey that were recruited by different approaches were addressed in a separate report [15] . Although the use of social media in research has been discussed [16] [17] [18] , there is scarce information regarding its use to recruit hard-to-reach populations [19] [20] [21] . A combined strategy was important to recruit dentists working in both public and private networks, and doing so allowed us gather one of the largest samples to date for a COVID-19 survey in the dental field [4, 5, 7, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The pandemic may have facilitated our recruitment owing to people spending more time at home and on social media [27] . Online surveying methods are particularly important during this time when sanitary measures prevent traditional research approaches [15] . This report in concentrated on the early COVID-19 impacts to the dental sector in Brazil. The present results provide early evidence of three major aspects being at stake in dentistry in the new pandemic epicenter. First, differences in care coverage between public and private clinics suggest an intensification of regional and socioeconomic inequalities. Second, although dentists have a similar fear of contracting COVID-19 at work as other healthcare providers, they seem to report feeling less prepared to assist patients [28] . Third, dentists have adopted new routines and incurred increased costs, which eventually will be transferred to patients in the private network, or paid by the government in public clinics. The scenario is aggravated by disjointed responses from the Brazilian government and the associated lack of an effective coordinated national response to the pandemic [29] . The multi-level analysis showed that mounting COVID-19 case and death counts are affecting dentists' behavior in the new pandemic epicenter. Other studies also have observed that the pandemic is bringing fear to dentists at work. In a survey [5] , 85% of respondents reported feeling afraid when heard news about COVID-19 caused deaths. In addition, 92% were afraid of carrying the infection from offices to their families. The aerosolized cloud in dental offices is a constant reminder of danger. Training in preventive measures and the use of up-to-date screening methods may be appropriate first steps for dentists to feel better prepared to attend to COVID-19 patients. Individual cognizance and knowledge of pertinent information are important factors in healthcare workers feeling confidence in dealing with and overcoming the pandemic [28] . Brazilian dental sector stakeholders seem to be paying diligent attention to the ongoing situation. Dental councils and sanitary agencies have already released important guidance documents in the meantime. The vast majority of our study respondents (91%) indicated that they are following official regulatory standards in their new routines, and that they, by and large, Table 2 . Distribution of dentists working in Brazil by sex, age, and region (%) compared with the survey participants, Brazil, 2020 (N = 3,122) . have made substantial efforts to cope with the new clinical requirements. In corroboration, studies in other countries [5, 30] addressed that the fear of dentists in getting infected from COVID 19 could be mitigated by dentists and the dental team carefully following recommendations from regulatory authorities. While patient appointment volumes reported in May were significantly below from pre-pandemic levels, our data indicate that Brazilian dentists are open to the incorporation of telehealth programs, which may, despite its associated challenges, be a good strategy for mitigating the impact of the pandemic, while improving preventive actions and reducing unnecessary referrals [31] . A survey in Italy [4] reported that only 37% of dentists considered telehealth as a valid program, and less than 13% reported to have used it before. In contrast, 46% of dental practitioners believed that digital dentistry could be used more often in the post-pandemic period. A recent article [32] recommended the implementation of fully digital approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic to limit infection risks, whenever possible. Another report suggested that although the pandemic has caused many difficulties for provision of dental care, an opportunity is established for dental educators to modernize their teaching approaches using novel digital and online communication [33] . Table 4 . Effect of numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths � on differences in numbers of patients seen by work sector, Brazil, 2020 (n = 2,534 dentists �� ). The low volume of patients reported being seen in the public network in Brazil may reflect a prioritization of PPE supplies for healthcare professionals providing medical treatment to COVID-19 patients as well as Ministry of Health directives to provide care for dental emergencies only. Another study showed similar findings in Spain [30] , indicating a significant decrease in the number of patients seen by dentists during the national state of alarm; 86% of participants reported seeing up to five patients per week due to recommendations to treat only urgent situations. In the early stages of the pandemic worldwide, a shortage of PPE was also a significant concern. Lack or inadequate availability of PPE has been reported to potentially impose negative impact on the mental health of professionals [34] , and may worsen the scenario. One could argue that pandemic-associated increases in the need for medical devices and PPE, and the emerging vaccine industry, should be favorable to business in the biomedical industry. However, in Brazil, this industry accounts for less than 43% of the national consumption production in general biomedical supplies [35] . KaVo, a major dental company worldwide, recently closed its manufacturing facilities in Brazil, which may be an early sign of employment loss in the sector. Government-aided measures to support PPE supply and biomedical industries could be necessary in the long term.The present study also points out concerns with regard to economic burden associated with changes in routine dental practices. In corroboration, a prior economic analysis showed that COVID-19 mitigation/suppression measures will cause financial distress to private dental clinics in Germany [36] . A total 35% dentists participating in the present survey, for instance, reported that N95 masks were the predominant mask used (with at least half of patients). Taking into account the pre-pandemic volume of patients treated weekly by this sample (average 39.6 patients/dentist), and the~348,000 dentists registered in Brazil, generalizing the figure of 35% of dentists treating at least half of their patients wearing N95 masks without re-use, dentists in Brazil can be expected to use some 9.6 million masks per month. Considering typical prices for surgical masks (0.4 USD) and N95 masks (2.92 USD) (quotes retrieved by authors and available in doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/DNBGS), the yearly cost of this simple PPE change would be~290 million USD, which would amount to approximately 1.16 billion USD over a potential 4-year COVID-19 resurgence risk period [37] .It should be noted that our study design does not allow one to establish cause-effect relationships, thus our findings should be treated with caution. In addition, it should be considered that regional COVID-19 rates could be influenced by socioeconomic factors, which may additionally play a role on the behavior of dental professionals. Although the representativeness of the sample may have limitations, the distributions of responses by region, sex, and age were similar to the overall distributions of dentists in Brazil (Table 2) , except for higher response rates from females and from dentists working in Southern Brazil. Notwithstanding, our sample variability was supported by the large numbers of responses received. A report from 2009 [12] showed that the proportion of female dentists in Brazil was in a rise, which also may account for the differences in sex observed between respondents here. The present findings also suggest that female dentists could be more likely to engage in survey research than male dentists, at least during the pandemic. Collecting responses by an open campaign on social media also imposes limitations [15] , including a higher chance of recruiting dentists who were more afraid about the pandemic or more willing to cooperate with sanitary measures. The fact that the social media campaign was originated in Southern Brazil explains the higher proportion of respondents from the South region [15] . It is also worth mentioning that the South and Southeast regions, which have similar human development index and per capita income values [38, 39] , represent the highest-income regions of Brazil.Future studies will be necessary to monitor how dentists are coping with the pandemic. Data from this study may be useful as a baseline relative to future developments and useful in designing interventions. The scenario observed in May 2020 can be used for future observations on the impact and evolution of the pandemic to the dental sector in Brazil and Latin America, as well as potentially associated crises. Brazil is a big player in dentistry worldwide, with a particularly predominant role in Latin America. Unfortunately, given its concentrated effects in the public dental care sector, the pandemic appears to be contributing to a deepening of already marked inequalities in oral health within Brazil, and such effects may extend more broadly into Latin America. Inadequate public healthcare funding in the short to long term may increase the risk of exacerbating historical inequalities between regions in Brazil. Actions taken now will affect how Brazilian dentistry is regarded after the pandemic, and whether Brazil will be a good or bad example of dental practices, especially for neighboring countries. Even after the contagion curve is flattened, we can expect precautionary changes to dental clinic routines and associated stress to persist for years given that dental professionals will continue to be at high risk of exposure, especially in the event of a future resurgence. Ultimately, the outlook of the dental sector depends on political, professional, and personal actions in this turbulent period during which major aspects are at stake.This survey gathered 3,122 responses from all regions of Brazil in May 2020, when the country was a new pandemic epicenter and the contagion curve was escalating. The results provide early evidence of three major impacts of the pandemic on the dental sector: increasing inequalities due to care coverage differences between the public and private networks; the adoption of new clinical routines, which are associated with an economic burden for dentists; and associations of regional COVID-19 incidence/mortality with fear of contracting the disease at work. Constant monitoring of the situation is encouraged over the course of events in the ongoing pandemic.Supporting information S1 ",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-30,11

A prompt and accurate detection method is crucial for the detection of COVID-19 in order to keep its proliferation under control. Recently the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been fully revealed and thus the use of techniques like real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), has been widely used and developed as kits for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Zhao et al. have shown the possibility of fabricating ""simple magnetic nanoparticles"" that can be further implemented into the RNA magnetic extraction method that will be used later as template in the real time RT-PCR for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 5 . However, the main drawback of this technique is the need for specialized and homogenous magnetic nanoparticles with a strong negative charge, so that the viral RNA extraction and purification process becomes faster and cleaner improving the number of clinical tests per day for COVID-19. Although, even if this technique can be implemented in every country, developing countries like Ecuador and many others in Latin America are struggling to implement it due to the relatively high prices of MNP in the international market and their import time frame. An example of this problem is confirmed by the city of Guayaquil in Ecuador, that has suffered extremely from the results of late detection and control along the explosive expansion of the novel coronavirus 6 .In this communication, a 'simplified three step method' to produce large quantities of MNP for RNA extraction based on Zhao et al. synthesis 5 is presented, optimized and scaled: a) Coating of magnetite nanoparticles (MNP) with APTES to form the amino-magnetic nanoparticles compound (NH 2 -MNP), b) Diacrylate-amine nanoparticles coated with a negatively charged polymer (Poly) to be used in the extraction of RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 is represented in Fig. 1a -c. The magnetic nanoparticles were prepared using a simple and lowcost co-precipitation method followed by a hydrolysis process using 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) (Fig. 1a) . In parallel, the poly (amino-ester) was prepared based on a modification of the protocol reported by Zhao et al. 5 and Sunshine et al. 7 by a diacrylate-amine polymerization using 1,4-butanediol diacrylate and 6-aminocaproic acid. (Fig. 1b) . Finally, the amino-magnetic nanoparticles (NH 2 -MNP) were coated with the poly (amino-ester) material by following a Michael addition methodology 8 in order to completely coat the magnetic nanoparticles with the polymer (Poly-NH 2 -MNPs) (Fig. 1c) introducing the desired negative charge required for the proper extraction of RNA. The synthesis protocol reported here was designed to produce 100 mL at (10% w/v) of Poly-NH 2 -MNP to fill the required amount of magnetic nanoparticles for their implementation into a real time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in Ecuador. In contrast to the experiment conducted by Zhao et al. where 40 g of polymer per gram of NH 2 -MNP were used 5 , we employed down to 0.2 mL of polymer (~ 0.1 g at 0.1% w/w) per gram of NH 2 -MNP. It is important to state at this point that our synthesis process did not include the use of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and the magnetite nanoparticles were directly functionalized with (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane -APTES-). On the other side, the main purpose of the coating is to have a negative charge on the surface of the nanoparticles. The latter optimization implies a considerable reduction in time and cost on the scaling up process. A 100 mL of Poly-NH 2 -MNP will permit the execution of about 5000 RNA extraction/purification procedures from nasopharyngeal cells that will be used as a template in the real-time RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 detection. However, the way that this epidemic has been developing around the world requires a more persuasive and robust method that could cover the real needs of developing countries as the amount of people to be tested is much higher every day. Thus, we scaled the synthesis method (Supplementary Fig. 2a ) by parallelizing simultaneously each step from Fig. 1 being able to increase the production of MNP in one order of magnitude. We are able to obtain 1 L of Poly-NH 2 -MNP (10% w/v) in just two days in a basic laboratory. This result will allow the execution of about 50,000 real time RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 detection in Ecuador and become a potential solution for developing countries.Characterization of magnetic nanoparticles as prepared for the RNA extraction method. A morphological analysis of the samples (Fig. 1d ,e) was conducted using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based on a secondary electrons detector from a Versa Probe III X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. In Fig. 1d we confirm that our first treatment for dispersion of MNP was successful and our pristine magnetite nanoparticles were coated. The latter is an important and crucial property of the synthesis of MNP for RNA extraction as the succes in further coatings processes (Fig. 1a-c) is determined by an effective initial dispersion and coating of the MNP. The evident cracks along the surface of the dried dispersion of MNP on the SiO 2 wafer (Fig. 2d) confirm www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the presence of a rough compact surface derived from the intrinsic magnetic interaction between the nanoparticles covered with APTES that may shrink during the drying process. The latter was double checked by depositing a drop of the MNP independently on an Al and Ti wafers. We noticed the presence of MNP clusters (see Supplementary Fig. 4a,b and e,f accordingly). In contrast, for the final end of this synthesis process, one desires to have a continuous and heterogeneous polymer/nanoparticle system that allows the correct performance along the RNA extraction technique. In Fig. 1e we corroborate this fact by a noticeable smooth and continuous surface derived from the presence of the poly (amino-ester) coating within the NH 2 -MNP. The latter was verified by the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ deposition of a drop of the Poly-NH 2 -MNP independently on an Al and Ti wafers. The presence of a continuous layer formed on the metal was evident to the extent of the resolution of the equipment as it can be observed in the Supplementary Fig. 4c ,d and g,h respectively. We can still identify small agglomeration sites before and after the coating with Poly that are the result of the magnetic interaction between the nanoparticles during the drying process over the substrate. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight the fact that the coating on the magnetic nanoparticles with APTES and the polymer could reduce their intrinsic magnetic properties of the nanoparticles 9 . However, as it will be shown in the following, the precise characterization of the coating process will bring two main pieces of information: (1) the correct coating formation is as a good indicator of the APTES and Poly MNP's functionalization required for the RNA binding, and (2) the coating should be enough to bring enough negative charge to the nanoparticle, but not too large so that the magnetic extraction procedure for RT-PCR works properly (see Supplementary Fig. 5 ).In order to prove the efficiency of the coating process described in Fig. 1a -c, we employed Raman spectroscopy as a fast and precise characterization tool for nanomaterials. This method is well known in the characterization of magnetic nanoparticles 12, 13 and their interaction with organic solvents, polymers, and molecules 10,14 . In Fig. 2 , the evolution of the Raman spectrum from the MNP is presented. We can trace the scheme in Fig. 1 with respect to the obtained Raman spectra as follows: i) As a first step, the MNP have to be synthesized and dispersed homogeneously in isopropanol solution. We found the characteristic peak from magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) 12,15 at 670 cm −1 using a 633 nm laser excitation and low laser power < 1 mW (Fig. 2g-red) . We also featured the presence of a peak at ~ 380 cm −1 resulting from the [OH]groups linked to the surface of magnetite nanoparticles ( Fig. 2c -orange) derived from the ammonium hydroxide and ethanol used during the synthesis of MNP nanoparticles in addition to the drying process performed on the SiO 2 substrate under ambient conditions that open the possibility of humidity absorption along with the Raman analyses. ii) The second step of the synthesis requires a special coating with APTES molecules that eclipse the magnetite Raman response by a broad background as observed in Fig. 2e . iii) In a third step the APTES treated MNP (NH 2 -MNP) are dissolved and washed with DMSO enhancing the magnetite Raman response at 670 cm −1 due to a slight decoating of the initial APTES shell within the additional emergence of a double peak around 3000 cm −1 characteristic of DMSO. iv) Finally, the nanostructured NH 2 -MNP is binded to a polymer (amino-ester) that will serve as a negative charge carrier for the optimal RNA extraction methodology. Our Raman measurement of this final sample (Poly-NH 2 -MNP) shows again a broad background characteristic of a fluorescent polymer at 532 nm in addition to a perceptible signal of magnetite at 670 cm −1 . During each Raman measurement, optical images of the samples were taken (Fig. 2b,d,f,h) to ensure no degradation of the sample during the measurement, and a surface morphological confirmation when compared to Fig. 2d ,e.In order to verify the presence of the final nanoparticle coating, that is a crucial step for the effectiveness of the MNP when used in the RNA extraction method, we used two accurate standar techniques: a) Infrared spectroscopy (Fig. 3) , and b) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS- Fig. 4) .In Fig. 3a the spectrum of magnetite nanoparticles is shown and confirmed by the presence of v(Fe-O) stretching vibration at ~ 572 cm −112, 16 . The distinctive Fe-O-Si band is present around 580 cm −1 17 and overlaps with the Fe-O vibration band, however it can be observed that the band in this region considerably increases the intensity, supporting the adsorption of APTES molecules on the magnetite surface (Fig. 3a to c) as expected from the first step in Fig. 1a .The 18 .The infrared spectrum confirms the efficient coating of MNP with Poly. According to Zhao et al. 5 this particular negatively charged coating is essential for the optimal extraction and purification of the RNA sample that will improve the performance of the real time RT-PCR analysis process in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 5 .The final chemical surface characterization for the MNP was conducted using XPS spectroscopy. As it is shown in Fig. 4 , the binding energy comparative survey analysis exhibit clear features among the samples:1. The iron analysis in XPS spectroscopy is a tool to confirm the presence of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) nanoparticles.Our initial material (Fig. 4a) revealed the strongest peak from the Fe2p3 core level with a 24.8% atomic concentration. By performing a high resolution XPS analysis in the region from 705 to 730 eV, we confirmed the presence of magnetite by a doublet peak corresponding to the Fe2p 1/2 and Fe2p 3/2 15 components ( Supplementary Fig. 3a) . After the first coating process (Fig. 4b) , we observed an attenuation down to 3.2 (atm%) of the Fe peak derived from the presence of NH 4 OH deposited on the MNP's surface. After washing the MNP with DMSO, the signal intensity of Fe2p3 raised to 7.7 (atm%) in Fig. 4c as the DMSO washed out the excess of the non-attached NH 4 OH coating material. In the final step (Fig. 4d) , the nanoparticles were coated with a polymer (3-Aminopropyl) and thus the signal of magnetite was strongly reduced to less than 0.1 (atm%). In the end, we confirmed that the final coating created on the MNP is of around 9 nm, which is the limit for photon penetration in the sample coming from the XPS surface technique. 2. Regarding the N1s core level (~ 400 eV) analysis, we found this peak to be absent (as expected) in the pristine MNP sample in Fig. 4a due to the lack of amino groups. After the first coating with NH 4 OH the nitrogen concentration was increased to 8.4% (Fig. 4b) . Subsequently, the excess of NH 4 OH molecules was washed www.nature.com/scientificreports/ by DMSO (Fig. 4c) . We noticed then a reduction in the nitrogen atomic concentration to 7.5% as is shown in Table 1 . We attribute this effect, as observed in the infrared analysis, to the removal of some NH 4 groups from the first coating surface of the nanoparticles. In the final step (Fig. 4d) , when the MNP are being coated with 3-Aminopropyl (Poly-NH 2 -MNP), the nitrogen concentration is raised to 10.3 atomic% ( Table 1 ). The latter nitrogen development is a clear signature of the successful coating process essential to have magnetic nanoparticles covered with a negative charged polymer for the RNA extraction. The detailed development of the nitrogen functional groups formation on the MNP can be observed in the Supplementary Information in a close region from 398 to 405 eV ( Supplementary Fig. 3) showing the characteristic peaks corresponding to NH 4 OH and NH 2 molecular elements present in the sample 19, 20 . 3. The carbon C1s signal in the pristine MNP (Fig. 4a) is minimum (~ 10% Table 1 ) denoting the clean precursors that mostly contain magnetite nanoparticles. The C1s core level appears at (284.8 eV) after the first coating deposition with 41.7 (atm%) in Fig. 4b and Table 1 correspondingly followed by a reduction (32.4%) due to the DMSO processing. At the final part of the process, the C1s signal increased in agreement to the 3-Aminopropyl addition as the last coating (Fig. 4d) having a 53.5 (atm %) on the sample. 4. The O1s feature at (532 eV) for MNP (Fig. 4a) has an atomic percentage of 60.4 with a final value of 32.2% at the final step (see Table 1 ) confirming an intensity reduction due the signal attenuation of the Fe 3 O 4 , leaving just the oxygen contribution from the 3-Aminopropyl coating. Traces of Cl, Si and Na are present at (~ 196 eV, 101 eV and 1072 eV correspondingly) due the composition of the precursors used in the synthesis and in each consecutive coating process as it is shown in Table 1 , where atomic chemical elemental composition for each step is exhibited.Real time RT-PCR test results using RNA extracted with our synthesized Poly-NH 2 -MNP magnetic nanoparticles. The RNA extraction process is the first and most important step in the procedure to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the MNP extraction method allows for an improved purification and quality factor of RNA in less time raising the number of clinical tests per day for COVID-19. The methodology for real-time RT-PCR begins by transforming RNA into DNA by reverse transcription, then the DNA chain is opened to verify if the virus genes (RdRP, E and N) are present with complementary primers to those genes 21 . Attached to the ends of the primers are two molecules: a fluorophore and a quencher, which emit light when they are separated, so if both are close in the same primer there will be no light emitted 22 .Since the genetic material of the virus is very small (29,891 nucleotides in size), millions of copies are needed to make it detectable 23 . Thus, it is essential to replicate it in a reaction of several cycles in which the primer disintegrates in such a way that the fluorophore keeps far away from the quencher and emits fluorescence 24 .In Fig. 5 we present the results from the real time RT-PCR amplification analysis conducted by the private company InnovativeHealth LATAM in Quito-Ecuador. The results here revealed an increase in the fluorescence quantified in arbitrary fluorescence units approximately from the minute 38th (35th cycle) using a positive control sample, which establishes that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was present and its RNA was correctly extracted by using our Poly-NH 2 -MNP magnetic nanoparticles (Fig. 5c ). Our real time RT-PCR amplification study proved that the RNA extraction method followed by the company using our synthesized Poly-NH 2 -MNP magnetic nanoparticles (see methods section) is functional but not as effective when compared to the processed data from RNA samples extracted using commercial MNP with the same positive control sample (Fig. 5a) . We vary the concentration of nanoparticles in order to reveal the effect of this variable along the polymerase chain reaction and observed no substantial difference in the time of the fluorescence amplification (Fig. 5d-f) . The time of the analysis for these three particular samples was stopped before the positive and negative control, as well as in the Poly-NH 2 -MNP magnetic nanoparticles (Fig. 5a-c) . The latter confirms no quenching of the RT-PCR signal by increasing the concentration of nanoparticles in the solution and a constant reliable and accurate extraction behavior of our MNP that is of high importance when conducting thousands of tests per day. At this point our synthesis process did not include the use of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and magnetite nanoparticles were directly functionalized with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) with a reduced concentration of the polymer of ~ 0.2 mL for each gram of NH 2 -MNP when compared to the experiment conducted by Zhao et. al. (40 g of polymer per gram of NH 2 -MNP) 5 . We consider it necessary to conduct further studies varying the type, size and coating of the magnetic nanoparticles in order to look for an optimal material for a greater qRT-PCR amplification response even if we already revealed a favorable response starting from 10 µL of magnetic nanoparticles. Table 1 . Atomic percentages at each coating stage process evaluated from the X-ray photoelectron spectra. www.nature.com/scientificreports/In summary, we reported a comprehensive study on the synthesis of functionalized coated MNP with a negatively charged polymer for viral RNA extraction and purification that could be implemented in the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on a large scale. This work set a systematic characterization protocol in the synthesis of MNP that can be used as a benchmark for the correct fabrication of MNP specialized for high quality RNA extraction method before their potential implementation into a real time RT-PCR. The synthesis protocol reported here serves for the production of 100 mL at (10% w/v) of Poly-NH 2 -MNP that can be extended to 1L of Poly-NH 2 -MNP (10% w/v) in just two days in a basic laboratory ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) by parallelizing the synthesis process allowing for the execution of about 50,000 real time RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 detection. Our final 1L Poly-NH 2 -MNP (10% w/v) was sent to be tested as part of a real time RT-PCR analyses in a private company aiming for the optimal extraction of RNA to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus. By real time RT-PCR amplification analysis conducted by a private company in Ecuador we confirmed an increase in the fluorescence quantified in arbitrary fluorescence units at ~ 38 min., which confirms: a) the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the sample, and b) a correct RNA was extracted by using our Poly-NH 2 -MNP magnetic nanoparticles. With this work we ( Supplementary Fig. 6) provided a solution to a national Latinamerican problem along the detection and control of the explosive expansion of the novel coronavirus despite the country budget constraints and chemical and laboratory facility availability during this declared International Public Health Emergency.Infrared spectroscopy. The infrared analysis of the samples was done using an Agilent Technologies spectrometer Cary 360 with a diamond attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory and resolution of 4 cm −1 . For each spectrum 32 scans acquisitions were compiled in a range between 400 and 4000 cm −1 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Raman spectroscopy. The spectroscopic Raman detection was carried out under ambient conditions using a HORIBA LabRam spectrometer with a 514 nm and 633 nm excitation wavelengths at ~ 0.65 mW and 1.5 mW between − 50 and 4000 cm −1 . To avoid laser-induced damage on the samples the laser power was kept below 1 mW. Raman measurements were carried out using a micro-Raman setup with a 100X short distance objective in backscattering geometry. A charge-coupled device is used to detect the signal after analyzing the signal via a monochromator similar to previous Raman spectroscopy studies we have conducted 14 . The spectrometer was calibrated in frequency with the Rayleigh peak to be set at 0 cm −1 .X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface chemistry characterization was recorded by using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) PHI VersaProbe III (Physical-Electronics) equipped with a 180 hemispherical electron energy analyzer and excited by a monochromatized Al-K α source with an energy 1486.6 eV. Its energy analyzer operates in the pass energy mode at 280 eV for Survey and 55 eV for high resolution. The analysis spot had a diameter of 50 μm and 45° detection angle relative to the substrate surface. Atomic concentration for each element was calculated using Mutipak Version 9.8.0.19 (Ulvac-phi, Inc.) this software uses the peak intensity (peak area) in units of counts per second taking into account the specific relativity sensitivity factor for each element 25, 26 . Background subtraction was not necessary due the high intensity peaks and non important energy losses prior to emission from the sample.To evaluate the effectiveness of the Poly-NH 2 -MNP, a commercial IVD kit was used with already standardized reagents and whose only differential variables were the Poly-NH 2 -MNP in different concentrations and in different extraction procedures. The steps of the kit extraction protocol were followed (see Table 2 ) and 5, 10, 25 and 40 µL (microliters) of Poly-NH 2 -MNP were added to our nasopharyngeal swab samples along with a positive control of a known sample with the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.After obtaining the genetic material, 8 µL of extracted RNA (stored between 2 and 8 °C) was used to start the PCR with a final volume of 20 µL. Chemicals and solvents. Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate, Iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate, ammonium hydroxide, (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), isopropanol, ethylenediamine and ethanol, 1,4-butanediol diacrylate and 6-amino caproic acid were bought from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and used as received (99.99% purity).Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) were prepared using a simple and low-cost co-precipitation method (Fig. 1a) 27 . 6.5 g of Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate and 3.5 g of Iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate were mixed in 100 mL of distilled water at 50 °C, and 20 mL of ammonium hydroxide was added into the mixture with vigorous stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere. A rapid change of solution colour was observed from orange to black, indicating the formation of MNP. The solution mixture was continuously stirred for another 30 min, and the resulting black products (MNP) were collected with a magnet and dispersed into ethanol after washing several times with deionized water and ethanol as in reference 27 .Subsequently, the prepared MNPs were dispersed into 50 mL isopropanol, and 2 mL of APTES was dropwise mixed with MNPs solution (Fig. 1a) 28 . The mixture was incubated under continuous sonication for 3 h at room temperature, followed by the collection of amino-modified MNPs (NH 2 -MNP) with a magnet and washing with distilled water and ethanol to remove free APTES. The final prepared NH2-MNP was preserved in ethanol and the loading of the -NH 2 group on the surface was verified by infrared spectroscopy (Fig. 3) as donde in reference 28 .",Ecuador,first author,2020-11-04,11
6f73ae03173159c27300771a81aee8e8f625f2b7,Psychological impact of the pandemic on ambulatory cardiometabolic patients without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The CorCOVID Latam Psy Study Psychological impact of the pandemic on ambulatory cardiometabolic patients without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The CorCOVID Latam Psy Study,"On December 2 nd , 2019, a new epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV2) broke out in Wuhan, China, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11 th , 2020 and named coronavirus-19 disease (COVID- 19) . 1 Socio-cultural, economic and health-system factors limited the implementation of adequate preventive measures and led Latin America to become one of the foci of the pandemic. 2 Many strict preventive measures were taken by governments in the form of social distancing, quarantining of people coming from highly affected areas or countries, isolation of the infected or suspected individuals or with vulnerable conditions. In Latin American countries, various aspects of life have been affected and impacted by the pandemic, including the economy, industry, global markets, agriculture, human health, and health care. Protocols and changes in lifestyle were established by the political and health authorities to limit population mobility and disease propagation. These changes in routines and behaviors disrupted normal social, economic, occupational, leisure, and religious activities. Most of the population confronted several simultaneous changes that were challenging and stressful, inducing the appearance or worsening of a diversity of both physical and mental symptoms such as anger, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, loss of interest and emotional exhaustion, among others.Moreover, millions of people were made unemployed. The quarantine curtailed the movement of people potentially exposed to a contagious disease and resulted in a range of psychological conditions and posttraumatic stress symptoms. [3] [4] [5] The WHO had expressed concerns over the pandemic's mental health and psycho-social consequences of self-isolation and quarantine that could affect usual activities, routines, and livelihoods of people that may lead to an increase in loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and increase in the intake of alcohol and other recreational drugs of abuse. 6 This scenario 5 requires an evaluation of how the pandemic and restrictive measures are affecting the mental health and well-being of people.The aim of CoRCOVID Latam Psy study was to assess the mental health of individuals during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in a Spanish speaking population from Latin American countries and its relationship to socio-cultural and demographic factors such as gender, lifestyle, psychosocial stressors and family structure, among others.The project CorCOVID Latam is a research initiative of the Interamerican Society of Cardiology which invited cardiologists of Spanish-speaking Latin American countries to join as collaborators of the study on June 1 st , 2020. Sixty-six cardiologists from 13 of the 21 Spanish speaking countries in Latin America agreed to participate. A detailed explanation of the study design has been previously published. 7 The main objective of the CorCOVID Latam Psy was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on psychological and social aspects in Spanish speaking Latin American individuals with cardiometabolic disorders by screening for the presence of depressive symptoms during the last 30 days. Secondary goals of the study were: 1) to determine the presence and magnitude of the association between demographic variables and the presence of symptoms of major depression during the pandemic, and 2) to determine the presence and magnitude of the association between education level and economic and socio-cultural status on the presence of symptoms of major depression during the pandemic.Inclusion criteria: all subjects at cardiology consultation with cardiovascular or metabolic disease without evidence or suspicion of being sick from SARS-CoV2. 6 Exclusion criteria: patients less than 18 years old, a previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV2, recent hospital stay, or not willing to provide the information contained in the survey.A survey was created in the Google Forms platform (Mountain View, CA). The questionnaire was divided into seven clusters including basic demographic data and psychological assessments and consisted of 38 questions. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants in accordance with the requirements of Interamerican Society of Cardiology Ethics Committees.Following government measures to limit population mobilization in some countries, the survey was conducted either by face-to-face visits or by phone or video chat in which case informed consent was verbally taken. The basic demographic profile included educational level, income, occupation, family structure and habitat, cardiovascular disease, and treatment. The second part examined the patient's behavior during the last 30 days regarding physical activity, nutrition, body weight, alcohol intake and tobacco habits, treatments accessibility, mood, and quality of sleep.Questions contained opposite multiple options. Questions were not forced, and respondents were permitted to select multiple responses depending on the question.Participants were screened for the presence of depressive symptoms. They were asked the following: if they had lost interest in what they usually like to do and had been feeling depressed (both considered as main criteria of major depression), if in their perception they had gained or lost weight, had felt tired or less energetic, had trouble concentrating on work or watching television, had trouble getting proper sleep due to wakefulness or insomnia, experienced subjective poor sleep, if they were doing less physical activity than in previous months, or had not done new things in the last month such as arts and crafts, reading books or hobbies. All of 7 the latter were considered as additional criteria. Following the diagnostic criteria for major depression according to the Diagnosis Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), a positive answer to one of the main criteria questions and three or more positive answers to the additional criteria were considered the threshold to be classified as suffering from major depression. 8Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations if normally distributed or as medians and interquartile ranges if asymmetrically distributed. Normality of data distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Bivariate comparisons between patients with and without major depression were performed by w2 or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and by an unpaired t-test or a Mann-Whitney test for continuous data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the differences among group means. The potentially associated factors with major depression were explored using logistic regression analysis.Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were carried out to investigate variables independently associated with the presence of major depression. As adjusted variables, significant parameters were included in bivariate analysis and those with clinical relevance because of potential confounding. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each independent covariate, and a probability p value < 0·05 was regarded as significant. Analysis was conducted in Stata version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA), using two-sided significance tests at the 5% significance level.The CorCOVID Latam Psy study included 4,216 patients diagnosed with cardiometabolic diseases. A total of 1,590 (37·71%; IC95% 36·24 -39·19) were considered as having major depression. The most frequent symptoms of major depression were diminished interest or pleasure in activities, followed by psychomotor changes and sleep disturbances (Table 1) .Individuals with depressive symptoms were more likely to be female (945 -59·43 %), and reporting a low or very low income (892 -56·1 %). The frequency of hypertension in subjects with major depression was 72·7 % (1,156), dyslipidemia 37·67 % (599), and diabetes 22·64 % (360). Coronary artery disease was present among 291 (18·3 %), stroke 81 (5·09 %), and heart failure 208 (13·08 %) among those considered as suffering from major depression. Most of the sample with evidence of depressive symptoms was at some point hospitalized (846 p -53·21 %) and receiving less than 4 medications/day (1,004 p -63·14 %) ( Table 2 ).In the bivariate logistic regression analysis, the group that was associated with symptoms of major depression was more likely to be female, be unemployed, report a very low income, and were more likely to have a previous history of stroke, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, cardiac valvular disease, arrhythmias, previous hospitalization, treatment with more than 5 different medications/day, conduct less than 100 minutes per week of physical activities, have a lower fruit and vegetable consumption, have reduced food consumption and demonstrate poor treatment adherence (Table 3) .After adjusted by age, gender, educative level, income, type of job, cardiovascular disease, previous hospitalization, medication, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetable intake, treatment adherence and vaccines a multivariate analysis showed that female sex, taking > 5 medications per day, performing < 100 minutes per week of physical activity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, poor treatment adherence and reduced food consumption still remained associated with symptoms of major depression (Table 4 ).The CorCOVID Latam Psy included individuals from Spanish speaking Latin American countries with differences in race, ethnicity, social support, behavior, and income. The study results demonstrated that one third of its total sample suffered from symptoms of major depression during the COVID-19 outbreak. Basic information about socio-demographic variables like age, gender, education, and employment status was included in the survey. This information serves as a cross-sectional assessment of the current status of the population during the pandemic, and included characteristics that both do not change over time such as sex and others more dynamic which may be relevant to mental health status.A meta-analysis of 43 studies that included 20,293 patients showed that the prevalence of depression after a stroke was 29% (95% CI 25-32) and remains stable up to 10 years after the event. 9 In a retrospective cross-sectional study from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) that included adults 50 years or older with a myocardial infarction, a sample of 24,483 subjects was collected, and 26·19% reported having depression. 10 The Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015 showed that depression is the third leading cause of disability-adjusted life years in Latin America, and in Tropical Latin America (Brazil and Paraguay) depression is the second leading cause. 11 Epidemiological evidence on the prevalence of depression in Latin America is scarce. CESCAS (Centro de Excelencia en Salud Cardiovascular para América del Sur), a population-based cross sectional study with 7,524 participants recruited from randomly selected samples in 4 Latin American cities, evaluated the presence of major depressive episodes assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -9. The overall prevalence was 14·6% (95% CI 13·6 -15·6). 12 A study that is part of the 10/66Dementia Research Group's population survey included 11,472 adults from Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. After receiving a semi-structured psychiatric interview that elicited information about ICD-10 depression and sub-syndromal depression, the prevalence was 5·4% and 20·6%, respectively. 13 As supported by several previous studies, our results confirm that major depression was more frequent in patients of female gender (60·61%). 14 These data could be explained in part by the diagnosis of cardiometabolic disease at older ages in women and because men tend to underreport depressive symptoms compared to women and are less likely to seek treatment. [15] [16] [17] The presence of major depression was independently associated with demographic and behavior variables during the pandemic lockdown such as physical activity, food consumption and treatment adherence. The most frequent depressive symptoms detected were diminished interest or pleasure in activities, sleep disturbances and psychomotor changes. Lockdown had a major effect on lifestyle and increased psychosocial stress, people experienced a fear of developing COVID-19, and therefore some habits were modified. 18 Many attempts have been made to establish a relationship between individuals undergoing social stress and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The CoRCOVID Latam Psy study utilized the diagnostic criteria for major depression of the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), which requires the presence of sadness or anhedonia with a total of five or more symptoms during a period of at least 2 weeks. This information was obtained through a structured survey that included nine specific questions related to depression. 7, 8 . Other epidemiological studies applied equally validated methodologies to assess the psycho-11 emotional state of people. The Social Network Index evidenced a relationship between social and community ties and mortality independently of other co-variables like socio-economic status, health behavior or health services accessibility. 19 The PURE study evaluated the association of symptoms of depression with cardiovascular disease and mortality by an adaptation of the Short-Form Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF) for major depressive disorders.Like in CoRCOVID Latam Psy, subjects were asked whether they had felt sad, blue, or depressed for 2 weeks or longer in the previous year and if so, whether they experienced loss of interest in pleasurable activities, tiredness, unintentional weight changes, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, feeling worthless, or thoughts about death during the same period. 17, 20 The Danish National Patient Registry demonstrated the bidirectional association between cardiovascular disease and depression in ten population-based cohorts of patients diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, stroke, self-reported chest pain, depression or use of antidepressant medications.Participants were evaluated by the Major Depression Inventory (MDI). Coronary disease and stroke were associated with subsequent depression (hazard ratio: 1·79, 95% CI 1·43-2·23 and 2·62, 95% CI 2·09-3·29, respectively), but depression was associated with higher risk of subsequent ischemic heart disease (HR = 1·63, 95% CI 1·36-1·95) and stroke (HR = 1·94, 95% CI 1·63-2·30) after adjustment for co-variables. 21, 22 Socioeconomic instability could be associated with an increase in major depression symptoms, more prevalent in unemployed and very low-income status, which may require social-economic support. This was related to a lack of adherence to non-pharmacological recommendations like less consumption of vegetables and fruits or physical activity, as well as with pharmacological treatment. 23, 24 12 CoRCOVID Latam Psy supports the notion that depression could be strongly associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome and an increase in the burden of cardiovascular disease as a high frequency of cardiovascular diseases were observed. 25, 26 All these conditions could modify psychosocial status in vulnerable population inducing emotional distress and potential mental disorders. Major depression should be considered in daily clinical practice and especially during conditions of chronic or longstanding stress such COVID-19.CorCOVID Latam is the first initiative created and carried out in Latin America by a scientific society interested in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The results provide valuable information regarding the mental health condition in a large population predominantly from lowmiddle to middle-high income countries, and the social and psychological situation experienced through the lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are some limitations. In absence of a specific validated major depression questionnaire, the survey was derived from a created and adapted survey from the ""Manual of Mental Disorders"" DSM-5. Unfortunately, we do not know the mental health and psychological status of this sample before the pandemic outbreak. Finally, the report of major depression was made during the pandemic lockdown period and could be important to evaluate the time-varying effects, when normal or daily activities should be restored. All of this should be an important point of view for futures studies.The restriction of many work related, academic and social activities during the COVD-19 pandemic lockdown promotes an important environmental stress that could induce or worsen major mental illnesses such as depression. More than one third of this sample of patients with 13 cardiometabolic syndrome from Latin America reported suffering symptoms of major depression during COVID-19 outbreak. In this situation, it appears that depression is even more prevalent among subjects with cardiovascular risk factors and associated cardiovascular diseases. ",Argentina,first author,2020-11-02,11
9a5d29151bb64096e1d9ec2c70d95a20589e5eaf,Journal Pre-proof Maternal clinical characteristics and perinatal outcomes among pregnant women with Coronavirus Disease 2019. A systematic review Maternal clinical characteristics and perinatal outcomes among pregnant women with Coronavirus Disease 2019. A systematic review,"Three reviewers (R.N., W.Q. and P.Ll.) first independently screened articles by titles and abstracts. There was a consensus on the titles selected, and a fourth reviewer (W.V.) resolved the differences. Articles not meeting the selection criteria were excluded. The full-text was then reviewed in detail, and data about the characteristics of the study, the clinical characteristics of the infection and the maternal and perinatal outcomes was extracted, using Microsoft Excel (2013 version, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The inconsistencies were discussed, and a consensus was reached. Data duplication was avoided by choosing the most informative study from among cases published more than once.Only full-text articles were included and reviewed. The authors of articles were contacted as needed.The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was employed to assess the risk of bias for case-control studies. (11) using which, a maximum of 9 points was allocated in four domains: 4 points for study group selection, 2 for group comparability and up to 3 points for exposure and outcome ascertainment. Additionally, a modified Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for case reports and case series to remove items relating to comparability and adjustment (irrelevant to non-comparative studies) and retaining items that focused on selection and were representatives of cases and outcome and exposure ascertainment. This modified NOS was tested in several systematic reviews with good interrater agreement.(12) We obtained five binary responses (yes/no) to questions, indicating whether the item suggests poor methodological quality or not. The quality of the report was deemed to be good when all five criteria were fulfilled, moderate when four were fulfilled and poor when three J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f or less were fulfilled. The three reviewers assessed the methodological quality of the studies and discussed any disagreements.The distributions of absolute, relative and accumulated frequencies of the categorical variables were reported using descriptive analysis. For numerical variables, summary measures were calculated as averages and ranges. Observational studies reporting the proportion of symptoms, clinical and laboratory characteristics and perinatal outcomes were included for quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). Since case reports lack a denominator for a given variable, they were excluded for the meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata Software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). The meta-analyses were performed using Review and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were analyzed using weighted mean difference (WMD). The degree of statistical heterogeneity was estimated using the I 2 test. Funnel plots were used to investigate publication bias (Supplemental J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fWe identified 12168 articles, removing 1054 duplicates and reviewing 11114 as per titles and abstracts. Further, 10971 without clinical information about pregnant women were removed. We evaluated 143 in full-text for eligibility. The references included in publications, websites of national reports and academic non-government organizations yielded 22 new articles fitting our criteria. We excluded 106 articles and, ultimately, included 37 articles in this review ( Figure 1 ): four case-control studies,(13-16) nine cases series,(17-25) 23 case reports, and one national report. (10) This review excluded 106 articles (Supplemental table 1); 53 were excluded due to non-relevance to our scope (national reports, practice guidelines, etc.), 14 due to different population, five due to insufficient data, six due to wrong outcome (psychological evaluation of the pregnant woman), and 28 due to duplicate cases.The different characteristics of articles to consider duplication were evaluated: author, city, hospital of data source, number of pregnant women, period of admission or recruitment and specific characteristics attributed to patients (symptoms, laboratory results, birth weight). Twenty-six articles with Chinese pregnant women, were excluded as the patients were also included in a recent case series from Yan J. et al. (22) Two articles from USA, (75, 76) were also excluded since Breslin et al.(17) published a case series including the same population from the same hospitals (Appendix B). (17) A descriptive analysis based on 33 articles and a meta-analysis based on 4 casecontrol studies was performed. For the descriptive analysis, we included a total of 322 pregnant women, 111 (34.5%) patients from Netherlands,(10) 80(24.8%) from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f USA, (17, 19, 21, 40, 42, 46) 76(23.6%) from China, (22, 23, 26, 27, 30, 32, 33, 37, 39, 47) 43(13.3%) from Italy, (18, 29) 2(0.6%) from Canada, (20) Using NOS in the case-control studies, out of a maximum of nine stars, the highest score was eight; the lowest six. Every study had a proper case definition and was representative of the cases in hospitals; however, bias risk was considered in controls selection. Only two studies tried to control for some confounders by agematching. (14, 16) All studies had ascertainment of exposure with a standard method.Most studies had the same rate of non-response for both groups (Supplemental   table 3a ). The quality of case series and case reports evaluated using the modified NOS were: three studies were deemed to be good, (20, 26, 46) 23 were moderate, (17, 19, 22-24, 27-31, 34-44, 47, 48) and six were poor in methodological quality (Supplemental table 3b ). (18, 21, 25, 32, 33, 45) The Dutch Association for Obstetrics and Gynecology's official report was no assessed for quality.(10)The main characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and detailed description in Supplemental Table 4 . Maternal age between 20-45 years, and the gestational age ranged from 5+2 to 40+5 weeks (+days). Two twin pregnancies were reported. Data regarding time to diagnosis COVID-19 by trimester in 179 women were collected. Among 169 pregnant women, 42 (28.4%) were asymptomatic at admission but qRT-PCR tested SARS-CoV-2-positive. Among 248 women, the most common being cough (n=148,59.7%) and fever (n=147,59.3%). Less common symptoms were tachypnea (n=25,10.1%), myalgia (n=23,9.3%), fatigue (n=16,6.5%), dyspnea (n=14,5.6%), sore throat (n=13,5.2%), tachycardia (n=13,5.2%), headache (n=12,4.8%), chest pain (n=8,3.2%), malaise (n=4,1.6%) and diarrhea (n=4,1.6%).There were 125 ongoing pregnancies during the report. Among 111 of them, 92 (82.9%) were in home isolation with no or mild symptoms. (Detailed description in Supplemental Table 5 ).Twenty articles including 88 patients reported the laboratory characteristics. (19, 20, 22, 28, 30, 31, 33-38, 40, 42-44, 46, 47) high alanine transaminase ALT (n=8,9.1%), high aspartic transaminase AST (n=7,8.0%), high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (n=6,6.8%), anemia (n=6,6.8%) and thrombocytopenia (n=5,5.7%) were also reported. All four patients from two studies had high IL-6 values(23, 35) and all 3 patients from one study had high IL-10 levels (100.0%).(23) (Detailed description in Supplemental Table 6 ). and pleural effusion in five (6.1%). Data from 15 patients showed bilateral lesions in 13 (86.7%). Albeit other modalities were rarely reported, it is noteworthy that seven cases were reported with pneumonia by x-chest ray (77.8%), (19, 20, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 ) and 2 reports found signs of pneumonia on ultrasound lung examination. (36, 40) (Detailed description in Supplemental Table 6) -Maternal outcomes are listed on Table 3 and detailed description in Supplemental Table 3 shows 30 patients (10.3%) with COVID-19 complications requiring intensive care unit. Nine patients had data on the risk factors for admission to ICU being the most frequent obesity 3/9 (30%). All nine patients were admitted after 29 weeks of gestation, i.e. third trimester. Eight patients (8/9) underwent delivery by cesarean section. One patient had a preterm vaginal delivery spontaneously in the ICU.The main complications were severe pneumonia occurred in 24 patients (13.4%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome in 19(10.6%). In six cases, the specific complication was unstated. One (0.3%) woman died of pneumonia by SARS-Cov-2 and multiorgan failure. Table 4 . Apgar scoring was higher than 7 at 1minute and 5-minute in 84 (96.6%) and 85 (97.7%) newborns respectively.Breastfeeding restriction was reported in 28 (25.7%) infants. Low birth weight was reported in 9/62 newborns (14.5%). In this low birth weight group, we found seven neonates reporting some data. All seven patients had preterm delivery. One out of seven neonates were reported to have COVID-19 infection.Two infants had asphyxia (5.6%), two (5.6%) respiratory distress syndrome and one (2.8%) developed pneumonia. Twenty-four (27.9%) newborns were severely ill, requiring NICU admission, but only two (5.6%) required mechanical ventilation. We made a sub-analysis to identify risk factors and characteristics of patients for NICU admission. However, only seven neonates had some data. One out of seven had COVID-19 infection and five out of seven (71%) had preterm delivery. Yan J et al (22) reported a newborn of 35+2 weeks delivered by cesarean with severe neonatal asphyxia treated with invasive ventilation died two hours after birth. The mother developed severe pneumonia and septic shock. Eighty-seven (77.7%) infants had been discharged during the report (Detailed description in Supplemental Table 9) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table 5 shows the data on vertical transmission. Every mother (322, 100%) included in this study was tested qRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab. Some patients were additionally tested in different type of samples. One out of 16 (6.25%) were vaginal swab-positive. SARS-CoV-2 was not found in breast milk Table   10 ) This systematic review summarizes information about maternal clinical characteristics; and maternal and perinatal outcomes among 322 pregnant women with COVID-19.We report that maternal mortality is rare. However, but there is a considerable proportion of women that required ICU due to complication of COVID-19 infection.Additionally, we report that maternal clinical characteristics are slightly different in pregnant women compared with the general population. The common symptom reported is cough and fever if they are symptomatic, but these are frequently less than the general population. There is a considerable proportion of asymptomatic include cases that had been previously included in different articles, even with different authors. This has raised serious concern since it represents a lapse in ethical standards of scientific reporting and potentially misleads our understanding of the disease and responding to it with ineffective public health decision.(77) In order to adhere to our strict protocol, we had to exclude many articles with every reason stated in Supplemental Table 1 .Among pregnant women with COVID-19 presented at hospital for obstetric reasons, three hospital-based studies recently reported the proportion of asymptomatic pregnant women at presentation in the range of 66% to 88% when a universal testing was performed in areas with high prevalence of the disease. (17, 21, 78) A lower proportion of asymptomatic pregnant women, of about 28%, was found here, since we included most cases from the patients being admitted to hospitals, likely reflecting a bias selection for more complicated cases. Furthermore, we should consider that some of the women were asymptomatic at admission, but they might have developed symptoms later, i.e. they were presymptomatic rather than asymptomatic, which is unstated in the three previous reports. An epidemiological study reported the proportion of asymptomatic in the general population being 50% at first testing; and after data modelling, they could estimate that only 18% would be truly asymptomatic. (79) In the pediatric population, the disease is known to be mild, with mortality being extremely low; even among them, the proportion of truly asymptomatic children is 4%, and 50% of them will have very mild symptoms. Two recent reports from New York suggest that the overall clinical outcomes in pregnant women are similar to those in non-pregnant women. (17, 21) A rationale to believe that COVID-19 may have a deleterious effect on pregnancy is the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS-causing virus, which is more aggressive than COVID-19 in pregnant women, leading to high admission at ICU and high mortality. (7) A rationale to believe that COVID-19 might have a deleterious effect on pregnancy is the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-Cov-1 and MERS-CoV, which are more aggressive than COVID-19 in pregnant women (7) , leading to higher rates Respiratory viruses such as H1N1 possess women at higher risk for severe complications leading to iatrogenic preterm birth. (98) Therefore, there is some concern regarding COVID-19 and the risk of preterm birth. Here, we have found a risk of preterm birth of 19%, higher than that commonly reported in pregnant women (about 10%). (99) Interestingly, most of the preterm births reported had a medical indication, supporting the thesis that COVID-19-complications lead to iatrogenic preterm birth rather than causing spontaneous preterm birth. Low birth weight was found slightly increased in neonates born to infected mothers and could be explained by the increased number of preterm births. Data on fetal growth restriction as a diagnosis were not collected. In our review, most of the neonates scored Apgar greater than 7 at first and 5 minutes, suggesting no acute intrauterine hypoxic environment at delivery in the infected women. A very high proportion (28%) of neonates being admitted to NICU was found. However, it is likely that a bias is present as we cannot exclude those admitted due to most common indications such as preterm birth and those admitted as a cautious measure to avoid any possible transmission or following a local protocol recommending temporally separating infants born to mothers with COVID-19. Data collected on the clinical manifestation among neonates is insufficient to draw any conclusion from this systematic review, though data from other studies suggest a mild clinical course with relatively quick recovery and no major concern about the morbidity of infants born to mother with ",Peru,first author,2020-11-19,11
cd87286ce320a65604bd6062d980b45a76562bef,,"The current pandemic has challenged health systems given the uncontrolled spread and high mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. During the last months, several clinical trials have been conducted to discover new treatments that may reduce the burden of the disease. However, none of these studies have reached the expected primary endpoint, and only the RECOVERY study (treatment with Dexamethasone), showed a significant difference of 3% in mortality [1] .However, a reduction of this magnitude in a condition with about 20% of mortality in critically ill patients, is disappointing.Convalescent plasma (CP) emerged as potential treatment for COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic. This is a strategy of passive immunization that has been used in prevention and management of infectious diseases since early 20 th century [2] . The CP is obtained using apheresis in survivors with prior infections caused by pathogens of interest and that developed antibodies against the causal agent of disease. The major target is to neutralize the pathogen for its eradication [3] . Given its rapid obtaining, CP has been considered as an emergency intervention in several pandemics, including the Spanish flu, SARS-CoV, West Nile virus, and more recently, Ebola virus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .Several studies have shown the potential efficacy of CP in COVID-19. A recent meta-analysis of randomized and matched-control studies, showed a reduction of 57% of mortality in COVID-19 patients treated with CP [10] . However, some concerns arise around this analysis. First, quality of evidence across the studies was not evaluated, and pooled estimation of effect came from the mixture of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f randomized and case-control studies. This approach may produce biased estimations of the effects and may not reflect the true efficacy of CP in COVID-19.In addition, high methodological heterogeneity has been observed in most of the studies on CP. Inclusion criteria, outcomes, dosage, and concentration of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), are some factors that may influence the efficacy of this therapy and hinder the pooling of evidence in this topic. Herein, we analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), their risk of bias, comparability and the potential confounding factors that may disturb conclusions on this treatment.A systematic review of the literature about RCTs in COVID-19 was done following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [11] . MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS were systematically searched for published and unpublished studies. Additional manual searches of the references cited in the articles were done. The search included articles up to October 21, 2020 . No restrictions were placed on study period or sample size. Only those articles written in Spanish or English were considered. Other information sources such as personal communications, author's repositories and preprint servers were included. Title and CP text terms in combination with ""COVID-19"", and ""Randomized"" were used.Risk of bias analysis included the following: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, selective reporting and incomplete outcome data. Risk of bias was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f conducted for mortality and clinical improvement outcomes. Furthermore, the Cochrane GRADE approach was used to assess quality of evidence [12] . Studies were graded from very low quality to high quality in a 4-tiered system. All studies for this review were RCTs and started the evaluation as high quality of evidence. A narrative summary of evidence was performed.Five articles were obtained from the systematic review [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . General characteristics of studies are shown in Table 1 . Clinical features varied across studies and represented different stages of disease. Three of 5 five studies included critically ill patients, as well as non-severe COVID-19 cases [13, 14, 16 ]. In addition, two studies did not mention severity of disease and just reported a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test [15, 17] . This represents the first aspect to discuss in the comparability and reproducibility of RCTs.Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still not completely understood, four overlapping and escalating phases have been proposed to explain the clinical course of the disease [18] . First, there is a viral phase that may well be asymptomatic or mild in the majority, perhaps 80% of patients. In the remaining 20% of cases, the disease may become severe and/or critical. In most patients of this latter group, a hyperresponsiveness of the immune system is characteristic. A third phase corresponds to a state of hypercoagulability. Finally, in the fourth stage organ injury and failure occur [18] .Severity of disease at inclusion is pivotal and may influence outcomes in unknown ways. At this respect, all RCTs have included patients at different stages of disease (Table 1) . For example, 24.3% of patients in the study of Li et al. [13] were on mechanical ventilation (MCV) at the moment of the inclusion. Remaining subjects were on high-flow, low-flow or without requirement of oxygen. Since CP may help patients with non-severe disease [9] , selection of patients by severity of disease is critical. Fusion of all these groups into one may not reflect the real effect of CP. In addition, sample size estimation may require an adjustment by this confounder. Thus, further RCTs should aim to estimate the efficacy of CP in every stage of disease with an appropriate sample size.Little is known about the accurate plasma concentration of NAbs required to produce a significant clinical effect, as well as timing to transfusion. The US food and drug administration (FDA) recommended a minimal titer of NAbs of 1/160 to treat COVID-19 patients [19] . NAbs concentration varied across RCTs, and in some cases, NAbs were below the minimal cut-off proposed by the FDA ( Table 1 ).The first completed RCT conducted in India by Agarwal et al. [17] , CP with low As shown in Table 1 , most studies focus on mortality and early discharge.However, variability in inclusion criteria, and the clinical stage of disease, make studies not equivalent. Other outcomes such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and number of patients requiring orotracheal intubation haven been poorly studied. Thus, these outcomes should be considered given the current public health emergency and the high rate of ICU admission in this condition.Risk of bias analysis revealed that none of the RCTs included in this review was on low risk of bias ( Table 1) . Lack of blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment were the most common bias in these studies. In addition, there were not information about allocation concealment in 3 out of 5.These observations influence the decision to rate all the studies in either high or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f unclear risk of bias for mortality and clinical improvement outcomes (Figure 1 ). This is of critical relevance since selection and measurement bias could have influenced the results of these trials. In addition, the current analysis allowed us to downgrade the quality of evidence in at least 2 points indicating that the evidence on CP is of low quality according to GRADE [12] . Double blinded RCTs are required to provide better evidence for the use of CP in COVID-19.About 10% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 present antibodies against type I and II IFN [21] . In addition, other antibodies against IFN-γ, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-22, IL-17A, IL-17F, and/or TNFβ may also be found [21] . This is of critical relevance in production of CP, since some donors, especially those recovered from critical disease, may have this type of antibodies with unpredictable effects on CP receptors. In addition, it is unknown whether some CP contains pro-inflammatory cytokines that could exacerbate the disease. Thus, besides the measurement of NAbs, standards for cytokine concentration and cytokine autoantibodies are recommended.Recent evidence has emerged on the evolutionary processes associated with adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans. Two major strains of SARS-CoV-2 were described in Wuhan (i.e., strain ""L"" and ""S"") [22] . It has been suggested that S strain could be considered more aggressive. In the same line, two studies have shown that the non-synonymous mutation D614G in the spike gene is associated with an increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 [23, 24] . Evolutionary models have suggested that the novel coronavirus could change infectivity and mortality over J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f time influenced by lockdowns and other unpredictable evolutionary factors [25] .Altogether, these data indicate that efficacy of CP could be influenced by the evolutionary change of SARS-CoV-2 over time and argue for the inclusion of mutation analysis in epidemiological surveillance.In the early 1950s, purification and concentration of immunoglobulins from healthy donors or recovered patients (i.e., intravenous immunoglobulins -IVIg), provided an option to treat serious infectious diseases as well as immune conditions including primary immunodeficiencies, allergies, and autoimmune diseases [9] .Recently an observational study on IVIg in COVID-19 showed that this treatment may improve hypoxia, hospital length and reduce progression to mechanical ventilation [26] . Since different concentrations of NAbs were found in this review ( Table 1) . Production of IVIg from recovered COVID-19 donors may provide an option to standardize doses and concentration of NAbs transfused. Not applicable ",Colombia,abstract,2020-11-04,11
eda07ce9610eb88183c33c3b5eca05c081da7c29,Prophylactic dressings in the prevention of pressure ulcer related to the use of personal protective equipment by health professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized clinical trial,"parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial without the use of a control group to compare the use of foam and extra-thin hydrocolloid in preventing DRPI associated with the use of PPE by health professionals working on the front lines against coronavirus.In total, 88 professionals were divided into two groups: foam and hydrocolloid. Data were collected using two instruments and related to demographic and professional characteristics and skin evaluation. Each volunteer received one of the dressings, both with the same dimensions and arranged over similar regions, and data were gathered at baseline and after 6 or 12 hours. Descriptive and inferential analytic statistical methods were used; the significance level adopted was 5%. No participant developed DRPI, but four areas with hyperemia were observed in the foam group (two in the forehead, one in the cheeks, and one in the nose bridge), as well as four areas with hyperemia in the hydrocolloid group (two in the nose bridge, one in the right ear, and one in the left ear). There was no difference between the groups regarding skin conditions and discomfort (P > .05). The average cost obtained was $ 5.8/person and $ 4.4/person in the foam group and the hydrocolloid group, respectively, considering the dressing measurements. The results show that foam and extra-thin hydrocolloid were effective in preventing DRPI associated with the use of PPE.The disease caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, is a respiratory tract infection that led the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 1 Human transmission occurs through droplets of saliva, contact, and air. The recommendation to reduce transmission is effective isolation of the population, meaning that COVID-19 causes not only a disruption in the health system but also a socioeconomic one given the necessary measures needed to control dissemination. 1 Due to its transmission route, 2 high rate of transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality, 3 the availability and correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are essential in maintaining the safety of health professionals. 1 However, due to the prolonged use of PPE, frontline professionals in the fight against COVID are at a high risk of developing a Device-related pressure injury (DRPI). [4] [5] [6] Medical devices can cause humidity, heat, and pressure between the device and skin, leading to pressure-related injuries from medical devices. 7 According to the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP), DRPI is defined as a pressure injury caused by a device applied for therapeutic and diagnostic reasons. The injury may have a similar shape as the device. 8 These skin injuries can compromise the physical and psychological integrity of professionals, which compromises patient safety and the quality of care. 9 According to the literature, DRPI can be avoided with technologies that protect the exposed areas from these adverse events. [4] [5] [6] However, before the pandemic, most studies related to DRPI prevention were carried out with patients. 10, 11 A three-arm clinical trial investigated two different dressings, Tegasorb and Tegaderm, and a control group without dressings for pressure relief on the nose bridge in patients undergoing non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The results showed that the participants of the two groups that used dressings had a lower occurrence of pressure injury compared to the control group. However, the results were not significant. 10 Another preclinical study on the nasal occurrence of pressure injury induced by nasotracheal intubation found that a combination of Soft Liner and hydrocolloid reduced the size and severity of the injury. 12 Recently, a cross-sectional study conducted with health profes- In evaluating the skin injuries of 1844 participants, 55.0% answered that they did not use preventive treatment and 45.0% received treatment with dressings, oil agents, or other methods.Among those who did not present skin injuries, 17.7% of the participants reported the use of prophylactic dressing for the prevention of skin injuries, including foam, hydrocolloids, oil, or cream, among others. 13 A systematic review of the use of prophylactic dressings to prevent pressure injuries suggested that their use decreased the incidence of this medical device-associated event. However, there was no clinical evidence of which type of dressing was the most effective. 14 Given this context, DRPI prevention among professionals at the front lines of the fight against COVID is crucial, mainly to reduce the contamination risk due to the absence of cutaneous integrity and the inability to use PPE in the presence of pressure injury. However, the best dressing for preventing skin injuries remains unknown.This study this aimed to compare the use of foam and extra-thin hydrocolloid in the prevention of DRPI associated with the use of PPE by health professionals working on the front line against coronavirus.This is a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial without a control group. The following steps were carried out: consultation of the Consolidated Statement of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for randomization, group follow-up, blinding, and data analysis. 15 The study was registered on the Brazilian Clinical Trials platform (ReBEC), available at http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br, under number RBR-7 drpyr.The study participants were professionals working in the Adult Intensive Care Units of a teaching hospital at the University of Campinas, Brazil. The sample size was calculated considering the objective of comparing prophylactic dressing groups (foam × hydrocolloid), according to the presence of a pressure ulcer (without ulcer, with ulcer). The calculation was made considering the methodology of a sample calculation for a Pearson's Chi-square test. 14 In this estimate, a 5% significance level, an 80% test power, a 0.30 of freedom, and effect size were assumed, which can be considered a medium degree effect size. 16 The sample size obtained was 88 professionals (44 per group). The software PASS 13 17 was used.The study included professionals who provided direct care (nurses, physicians, and physical therapists) or indirect care (cleaning staff) to patients with suspected or diagnosed coronavirus and needed to use PPE (face shield, gloves, caps, and particulate respirator) for six or 12 consecutive hours.The following professionals were excluded from the sample: those who did not finish the shift, those who needed to remove the dressing due to discomfort or signs of allergy, the presence of skin damage in the region of the face, and those who did not complete the checklist received along with the dressing to prevent DRPI resulting from the use of PPE. Despite the professionals' skill and knowledge levels, all the participants received theoretical and practical training about the personal protective device before this research.The selection of participants was random and considered the inclusion criteria. Eighty-eight opaque envelopes were prepared by a team member who had no contact with the participants. The envelopes contained the dressing to be used by the professional and were then randomly distributed using the website http://www.randomization. com/. The professionals were then allocated to the respective groups.The statistician who performed the data analysis was blind to the denomination of the groups.This study used an instrument for personal and professional characterizations of the sample that included the variables: age, sex, skin color, presence of comorbidities, profession, and time of experience in the profession and the unit.The data on skin characteristics were collected using a form specifically designed for this study after reviewing the literature. This form had its face validity evaluated by three specialists, selected for convenience. The form included the following information: characteristics of the skin (intact without hyperemia, intact with hyperemia that pales with digit pressure, or pressure injury classified by I to IV stages For the foam group, the participants received a material based on polyurethane foam, which was placed over the forehead (15 cm × 3 cm), nose bridge and cheeks (15 cm × 3 cm), and ears (5 cm × 3 cm). In the hydrocolloid group, the participant received extra-thin hydrocolloid plates with the same dimensions, which were installed over the same regions. The areas for installing the dressings and the cuts that were made on the plates were chosen according to recommendations from the literature. 18, 19 The outcome was the evaluation of the presence or absence of skin injuries in the regions covered with foam or hydrocolloid.Both groups were approached only once, and, to maintain the safety requirements established in the guidelines, 20,21 the following guidelines and care were reinforced when installing the dressing before entering the work environment: hand hygiene, installation of the technology in the recommended places, placing the N95 mask on the face, and performing the sealing test according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For analyzing the costs related to the dressings, the cost for the purchase of products and the measurement of cuts established for each participant were considered. When asked about the discomfort related to the use of the dressings, the participants reported difficulties when removing the dressing, as well as itching, problems with the mask moving and sealing, among others ( Table 3) .The mean cost was $5.8/person for the foam group and $4.4/ person for the hydrocolloid group, based on the dressing measures used to prevent skin injuries in each studied region (nose bridge, right and left ears, cheeks, and forehead).Until now, research about the use of prophylactic dressing in the prevention of skin injuries by medical devices was done in patients. 10, 11 However, the current situation caused the development of DRPI related PPE use by health professionals to become a concern; thus, research on this topic has recently started.This study showed that both prophylactic dressings were effective in preventing DRPI on the nose bridge, forehead, cheeks, and ears since no participant had skin injuries. Nevertheless, four occurrences of hyperemia were observed in each group (foam and hydrocolloid).Even though there was no difference between the groups examined in this study, who used the dressing for 6-to 12-hour periods, hyperemia must be highlighted as a signal within the development chain of the DRPI.Previous research to investigating the use of PPE and the occurrence of DRPI showed that the prevalence of skin injuries was higher in physicians, people who sweat more, males, aged over 35 years old, and who used PPE for more than 4 hours. 13 However, since no participant developed skin injuries in our study, it is impossible to compare the findings.Most professionals in the institution where this study was conducted continuously used the N95 mask during their shift. Considering a series of cases that demonstrated the relationship between the occurrence of pressure injuries on the nose bridge and the use of N95 mask over 4 hours, 22 we can infer that the use of prophylactic dressing led to the prevention of this occurrence.Although these prophylactic dressings were initially developed to prevent pressure ulcers in bone prominences of bedridden patients, 23,24 they also had positive effects when adapted to prevent this event in professionals working in health settings, perhaps because the mechanical forces involved in the development of skin injuries are the same for patients and professionals who use PPE for prolonged periods. 3, 4, 25, 26 The literature presents a divergence of opinion among researchers regarding the use of these dressings to prevent DRPI by using PPE. 3, 18, 19, 27 The most cautious ones emphasize the increased risk of professional contamination by coronavirus when a dressing is placed under a particulate respirator. 3 However, to reduce this risk, those in favor recommend using dressings that are thin, nontraumatic in the removal, absorbent, and adaptable to the contours of the facial structures, thus ensuring the correct sealing of the mask. 18, 19, 27 Although authors claim that these characteristics are found in thin foam dressings with silicone, hydrocolloid, and film, 18,28 the absence of some of these attributes reported by the professionals who participated in this study was noted.Despite being known for having a better capacity to absorb, retain, and release moisture, thus maintaining the proper balance in preserving dry skin, 28 the polyurethane foam had several reports of detachments that even culminated in the exclusion of three participants.In the group that used hydrocolloid, the reports of discomfort were higher compared to the foam group, highlighting the difficulty in removing the dressing, followed by the sensation of itching and pain.One can assume that such discomforts may contribute to increasing the risk of contamination by COVID-19 or other diseases, as there may be greater contact between the professionals' hands and their face. However, there are no studies that have analyzed discomfort regarding the use of prophylactic dressing in healthcare professionals.On the other hand, a study that compared two dressings, Tegasorb and Tegaderm, in the prevention of pressure injury on the nose bridge and around the mask concluded that the dressings prevented these injuries and increased the patients' tolerance and comfort. 10 The choice of an efficient and safe dressing is crucial since the development of skin injuries increases the risk of infection, 18 in addition to being uncomfortable and causing pain. Furthermore, the development of DRPI in professionals can lead to a public health problem as it can cause not only physical, but also financial, emotional, psychological, and social impacts. 4, 29 Although both dressings demonstrated effectiveness in preventing DRPI, we have to consider the small sample size in this study. Future research should on a larger sample size can lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of these dressing and preventing DRPI. The cost of these materials is also a factor that should be considered by health managers to incorporate these dressings into clinical practice. Furthermore, one must emphasize the need to pay attention to the quality of the PPE used, particularly face masks, respirators, and goggles, since the anatomical characteristics of the face can influence the development of skin injuries. 4 Limitations of this study include being conducted without a control group and using professionals from a single health institution who were only followed up with once. Another characteristic that requires careful evaluation is the facial anatomical characteristics of each individual, which may have influenced the reports of discomfort. Therefore, the products must be rethought to meet the specificities of each audience.In conclusion, foam and extra-thin hydrocolloid proved to be effective in preventing the DRPI associated with the use of PPE by health professionals working on the front line against coronavirus.Discomfort related to the use of the dressing was reported in both groups, but no significant differences were found.This study was supported by grants from the University of CampinasResearch Fund -Faepex (Grant No. 2374/20).",Brazil,first author,2020-11-28,11
c1e6cdf54cb3eb6b3ea628c6e9b928b8aab2feaa,Saliva NMR-Based Metabolomics in the War Against COVID-19,"A severe respiratory disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, 1 in December 2019 has been officially named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. 2 The causal agent of this disease was identified as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, 3 that was renamed by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy as severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2, i.e., SARS-CoV-2. 4 COVID-19 is a worldwide public health concern. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in nearly 26 763 217 confirmed cases and 876 616 deaths as of September 6, 2020. 5 Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended specimen types for detection of SARS-CoV-2; however, the importance of saliva in human transmission and detection of this virus has also been discussed. 6 A proper understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease will provide more targeted treatment strategies.Metabolomics is a very useful tool that has the unique feature of connecting all ""omics"" techniques and best represents the phenotype. 7, 8 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) are the most used techniques in metabolomics. NMR has the advantage of being able to analyze most biofluids with only minor preparation. Additionally, NMR is non-destructive and more reproducible than MS. 9,10 NMR approaches can identify the differences in low molecular weight molecules that exist in states of health or disease. NMR metabolomics has elucidated metabolic pathways related to different local and systemic diseases, such as osteoarthritis, 11−13 Type I diabetes, 14 melanoma, 15 oral cancer, 16 and dental caries. 17, 18 Most of the infections promoted by different types of viruses, including SARS-CoV, 19 Zika Virus, 20−22 Dengue Viruses, 23, 24 Chikungunya Virus, 25, 26 Influenza Virus, 27, 28 HIV, 29,30 and Hepatitis C, 31 have been shown to modulate the metabolic profile of their target cells.For instance, even 12 years after recovery, patients affected by SARS-CoV infection continue to present serum alterations in lipid metabolism as well as enhanced levels of lactate, cysteine, alanine, aspartic acid, and succinic acid. 19 Additionally, it has been demonstrated that Zika virus infection leads to modulation of phospholipids and carboxylic acids in the microglia. 20 Meanwhile, infections caused by Dengue Viruses enhance the levels of fatty acids, acylcarnitines, glycerolipids, fructose, and hydroxyl ketones, 32 while infection by West Nile Virus enhances the levels of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids while reducing the levels of cholesterol esters. 33, 34 Recent studies have been conducted to determine the metabolomic profile of the serum and plasma of COVID-19 patients. Shen et al. performed a cross-sectional study of serum metabolomics in healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with different severity levels of COVID-19 35 and found differences in amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids among the groups. An additional cross-sectional study also identified plasma profiles relating to various COVID-19 outcomes, demonstrating changes in the plasma at different stages of the disease. 36 It is worthy to note that the aforementioned studies were all conducted using either in vitro models or invasive methods. Therefore, noninvasive methods and longitudinal studies to better understand the disease evolution are still lacking. Saliva has been extensively used in NMR metabolomics studies; 14,37−39 however, saliva NMR metabolomics are still under explored in the study of viral infections.The COVID-19 pandemic has driven the world's attention towards fast and easy diagnostics. Interestingly, most of the current tests require buccal swab collection, since the virus can be transmitted through the saliva or nasal fluids. 40, 41 Moreover, the virus enters cells through ACE2 receptors, which are highly expressed by epithelial cells of the oral mucosa 42 and salivary gland ducts, 43, 44 suggesting a probable route of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Despite great efforts to maximize the availability of diagnostic tools as well as the intense search for therapies to provide efficient control of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, many questions related to the metabolic pathway of this disease remain to be addressed while the literature remains scarce. 45 Metabolomics points out intermediate metabolites that may be targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. An understanding of the disease course will require investigations at the level of the metabolic phenotype, which results from the local microenvironment and the affected cell metabolism. In this sense, more than 200 endogenous and exogenous biomolecules from whole saliva can be identified by NMR, including molecules relating to glandular metabolism, such as salivary secretions, as well as gingival fluid, which carries systemic metabolites, dietary compounds, and products derived from oral health and pharmaceutical products. 46 Whole saliva is composed of a variety of electrolytes, lipids, and proteins, including components of the immune response with antiviral activity, such as αand β-defensins, secretory immunoglobulin A, agglutinin gp340 (DMBT-1), lactoferrin, lysozyme, and cathelcidin (LL-37) as well as low molecular weight metabolites, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, polyphenols, and fatty acids, among others; 17,18,47 these various metabolites are responsible for maintaining the balance of oral tissues and can reflect both local and systemic conditions. The infection resulting from SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood at the cellular metabolite level; in this sense, the SARS-CoV-2 metabolic fingerprint would benefit from the comprehension of both the disease course as well as the heterogeneous spectra of clinical phenotypes seen from COVID-19, which vary from mild flu symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and, in some cases, multiple organ failure and death. Moreover, this sort of analysis would aid in the comprehension of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly people and people with specific systemic comorbidities. 48, 49 Recently, the Australian National Phenome Center (ANPC) started a collaboration with Bruker (the largest NMR manufacturer in the world) in an attempt to deliver diagnostic and prognostic solutions for COVID-19 utilizing NMR and MS. 50 However, at this point, the researchers are collecting only plasma and urine. In this context, more international cooperation, longitudinal studies, and observational and clinical trials are essential to determine the COVID-19 metabolomic profile, establish the evolution of the disease, and evaluate potential treatments.In March 2020, the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) added a temporary loss of taste (ageusia) and smell (anosmia) to the symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 51 The exact mechanisms underlying this olfactory and gustatory dysfunction remain uncertain. 52 It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 targets the olfactory epithelial support cells that express molecules involved in coronavirus entry and dissemination (ACE2 receptor and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2-TMPRSS2), thus leading to anosmia and alterations in taste perception. 53 Some drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers) are known to affect taste perception. 54, 55 It is Probable that SARS-CoV-2 alters taste sensitivity by a mechanism analogous to the ACE inhibitors. 56 In this scenario, saliva metabolomics emerges as a potential strategy for identifying biomarkers with diagnostic potential as well as providing a description of the metabolic pathways involved in the olfactory and taste disorders observed in COVID-19 patients. Although it seems that the taste changes in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly related to neurological events, metabolomics will open new perspectives of analysis, as mentioned above. The concentration of salivary components directly affects taste perception. The taste receptors are bathed in saliva and adapt to the concentrations of salivary components, such as salt, glucose, and urea. In order to perceive a taste, the concentration of a food must exceed the basal salivary levels resulting in sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and/or umami taste. For example, renal failure subjects presenting with higher levels of urea in their saliva also have a higher threshold for bitter taste perception. 38, 57 There is evidence that subjects insensitive to the perception of oleic acid present higher levels of acetate and butyrate in their saliva, along with a reduced concentration of lysine and fatty acids. 58 An additional study demonstrated that sensitive oleic acid perceivers presented increased levels of acetate, propionate, formate, lysine, valine, and GABA in their saliva, while insensitive oleic acid perceivers demonstrated higher concentrations of galactose, glucose, lactate, threonine, phosphocholine, and ethanolamine. 59 Additionally, L-Arg seems to be capable of modulating bitter taste function and suppressing the bitterness of quinine by specifically blocking the T2R4 receptor. 60 Therefore, these findings reinforce the role of additional factors related to metabolomics and taste perception in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.Salivary metabolomics is a promising field in terms of better understanding COVID-19 phenotypes and how SARS-CoV-2 impacts human physiology. However, specific challenges relating to this biofluid, as well as other technical limitations, must be outlined so that strategies to overcome these limitations can be developed. The major concern is the difficulty involved in screening a large number of subjects in order to find valid, representative biomarkers. In this sense, networked collaborations between medical centers will be required to safely obtain the samples, while investments in metabolomic centers will be needed to address automatization and biosafety issues. It is also recommended that small groups conduct multicentric studies to increase the sample size. Another barrier to the saliva metabolomics approach is the low signal in saliva when compared with others biofluids, such as plasma, serum, or urine, due to the lower concentration of metabolites. Whole saliva is composed of ∼99% water, while the remaining 1% consists of organic and inorganic content. 61 Although seemingly minor, the 1% composed of metabolites remains as a unique information source from the oral cavity regarding the body's physiological condition. The reduced levels of salivary metabolites can be overcome by using higher field magnets, pulse sequence improvements, and concentrating samples via the lyophilization process. Another limitation is the fluctuation in metabolites levels that occurs throughout the day; these oscillations are controlled by the circadian cycle, which is independent of sleep or food intake. 62, 63 For this reason, sampling for metabolomic studies that use saliva as the biofluid must occur at the same period of the day, preferentially in the early morning (i.e., 8:00 to 10:00 am), in order to avoid these fluctuations.Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in the literature that intraindividual variability in the metabolic composition of saliva is strongly influenced by dietary habits. 64−66 Additionally, Walsh et al. 66 demonstrated that inter-and intraindividual variation is not reduced by standardization of diet intake on the day before saliva collection. If food consumption patterns modulate the metabolic fingerprint of saliva, then why are there numerous studies that do not perform dietary interventions on their volunteers and how did this method successfully elucidate the salivary metabolomic fingerprint of specific diseases? 38,57,67−69 To answer these questions, some key reflections must be pointed out. Variability in food consumption increases interindividual variability among subjects in the same study group, and this variation is possibly overlaid by the metabolic changes resulting from the disease process when compared to the control subjects. Another key point that deserves attention is the short period of confounding effects on salivary metabolomics from food and drink intake. Protocol recommendations for NMR-based salivary metabolomics include that the participants should abstain from ingesting substances prior to saliva collection. Saliva collection should be done at least 1 h after eating, as this is an adequate interval of time for the elimination of carbohydrate peaks that blur salivary metabolite results. 70 Additionally, Fidalgo et al. preconize refraining from oral activities including toothbrushing for 2 h prior to sample collection. 17, 18 Finally, a key concern in the use of salivary metabolomics for analyzing systemic conditions is the interpretation of biomarkers without considering the current oral condition. Several studies have demonstrated that salivary metabolomics can reflect oral status and oral disease fingerprint, including dental caries and periodontal disease. 17, 68, 71 Therefore, to control for this issue, it is highly recommended to exam the oral cavity to determine whether the eligible biomarker is actually related to a disturbance in the oral condition.Identification of the salivary profile of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals throughout the different stages of the disease could help predict disease progression, recovery, and the therapeutic effects of various treatments. All told, salivary metabolomics is a promising, noninvasive tool for shedding light on how this virus affects host metabolism, and may provide valuable information regarding the pathophysiology of this disease.It is important to highlight that a recent projection points to Brazil as the next putative global pandemic epicenter for COVID-19, 72 and in September of 2020, Brazil became the country with the second most confirmed cases, equal to 4 123 000. 73 Fortunately, Brazil has the biggest NMR facility in Latin America, the National Center of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which houses several field magnets, including 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 MHz magnets as well as the recently installed 900 MHz magnet (the strongest NMR field magnet in Latin America). These conditions place Brazil on the frontlines of the war against COVID-19, however, also with powerful weapons against this virus.de Janeiro (FAPERJ), Coordenacaõ de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), Centro Nacional de Ressonancia Magnetica Nuclear (CNRMN), and Instituto Nacional de Ciencia and Tecnologia de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem (INBEB) for their financial support for metabolomics research.

8ffc31a312f3cda4ed06c1c53cf4001f92950269,Socioeconomic Vulnerabilities and the Intensity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 Testing Efforts in the Public Health System in São Paulo State,"Governments across the world have demonstrated that more intensive efforts to identify infected individuals are essential to an effective containment of COVID-19 along with other nonpharmaceutical interventions (1) (2) . Molecular tests, commonly referred to as RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests, are considered the gold standard as they detect the virus's RNA in infected individuals and who are potentially transmitting the virus to other individuals. In turn, serological tests, such as ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), chemiluminescence, and rapid tests, identify the presence of antibodies produced following a SARS-CoV-2 infection (3) . Due to these differences, RT-PCR tests are considered the first-best test for controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as an essential part of a surveillance strategy that should also include identifying and isolating infected individuals and ensuring the quarantine of people who were in contact with those who tested positive (4) . In this study, we developed a new index to measure and evaluate the intensity effort of RT-PCR testing within the public health system based on the best-recommended guidelines in testing effort, especially those issued recommendations issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) (4) (5) (6) We then analyzed the proposed index to assess the RT-PCR testing intensity efforts undertaken by São Paulo and its 17 Regional Health Departments (RHD), considering the laboratories maintained by the public health system. São Paulo state, one of the most populous states in Brazil (8), has been an important epicenter of the pandemic in the country, and has 62% of its population depending exclusively on the public health system. There has been variation in the RT-PCR testing efforts across the state's regions over the past six months, and since April 2020, the labs in the public health system are centrally managed by São Paulo's state government (9) .Initially, in late February and March 2020, the earliest cases were registered in the capital and few other cities outside the Metropolitan Region (RHD I), but the cases were largely concentrated in the São Paulo metropolis (10). As of August 31, 2020, the capital accounted for 32% of the cases, and the rest of the state accounted for 68% of the total cases. Since June 2020, the state's interior has surpassed the capital in the number of COVID-19 registered cases (11) , and the RT-PCR testing capacity outside the metropolis has also simultaneously expanded.We developed an RT-PCR testing intensity effort index (RT-PCR TIEI) and conducted an observational time-series cross-sectional study to apply the proposed index to assess the RT-PCR public testing efforts in São Paulo state and its 17 Regional Health Departments (RHD).Given time lags in data reporting, we analyzed information reported from epidemiological week 10 to week 35 (March 1st to August 29, 2020 ).The official data for the state of São Paulo is based on several government sources. Specimens of anonymized daily data on the RT-PCR tests conducted in all public laboratories and the number of daily new confirmed cases in the state of São Paulo, including mild and severe cases, are drawn from the Health Secretariat's Intelligent Monitoring System (SIMI) (11) . For testing, this data source provides the number of RT-PCR performed in the network of public labs for hospitalized and ambulatory patients. The SIMI database informs only one date; it is not clear if it corresponds to the collection of samples to perform the RT-PCR test or when the result was reported in the system. Data on the 2020 population and social vulnerability were provided by the Foundation for Statewide System Data Analysis (13) (14) . The 2010 Social Vulnerability Index of São Paulo State is based on five socioeconomic and four demographic indicators (14) . Social vulnerability is measured as the percentage of people living in each of the 17 RHD under high or very high social vulnerability (including urban and rural areas), capturing the regional vulnerability. For each RHD, these values represent the mean value of all municipalities in the specific region.We also obtained the proportion of the population which was exclusively dependent on the Brazilian public health system, known as Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) in Portuguese, in May 2020. These data are provided by the Information Health System of the Secretariat of São Paulo State (15) . The per capita income estimates are based on 2010 census data (16) ; while the population density was estimated as the ratio between the total population living in each RHD in relation to the geographic area.The RT-PCR TIEI is based on seven indicators, as shown in Table 1: 1. Daily testing targets for RT-PCR tests (17) 2. The RT-PCR positivity rate (4) 3. The diagnostic (e.g., RT-PCR) test turnaround time (specimen collection to test report) (5) 4. Local or regional public laboratory test processing capacity (5) 5. Repeat testing of individuals (3) 6. The percentage of cases interviewed for contacts (7) 7. The quality of RT-PCR testing data provided (18) The composite score is an additive index re-scaled to range from zero (lowest) to 100 (highest level of testing effort).The first five indicators are based on testing surveillance policies per se; one indicator includes a measure to assess if testing is being used for contact tracing, and the last indicator aims to evaluate the quality of the information provided from official sources. The maximum score is attributable to the observance of mainly WHO and CDC recommendations, and the remaining scores are declining ordinal measures with a minimum value of zero. Table 1 .We estimated multivariate regression models to examine the association between the RT-PCR TIEI scores (dependent variable), per capita income, population density, the proportion of the population that depends on the SUS and living under high social vulnerability across 17 RHDs in São Paulo State in epidemiological weeks 10 to 35. The regression models included an intercept, and the lag of the RT-PCR TIEI and standard errors were clustered by RHD (20) . In our analyses, the p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using STATA version 16. The RT-PCR TIEI, which comprises seven indicators, is a useful tool to analyze the intensity of RT-PCR testing effort to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and provide a metric to assess the public health testing efforts in association with other surveillance measures. Using this approach, our data show that between epidemiological week 10 to 35, the RT-PCR testing intensity effort was highly heterogeneous across the 17 RHD in the state and trending down. The presence of a local public laboratory was the indicator with the highest impact on the final score.This finding is consistent with the lack of data for three indicators that received zero scores:One of the factors affecting the disparity in testing intensity across RHDs is the lack of a local laboratory, reflecting low past public health investments in infrastructure before the onset of the pandemic. The majority of RHDs have a local laboratory (12 of 17 RHDs). Laboratories are expensive and difficult to install during a public health emergency (22) . It is expected that tests can be processed more quickly in regions with local laboratories that can provide timely results, given they have the capacity to accommodate the testing demand, and that supplies necessary to process tests (e.g., reagents) are readily available (5) . Some regions were able to further increase their test processing capacity by partnering with universities and research institutes. However, the universities, laboratories, and research institutes collaborating in providing public access to RT-PCR are concentrated in only five RHDs, while others have public laboratories in their territories. There is no public laboratory in RHD XII (23), and its municipalities are among those with the lowest levels of social and economic development (14) .Our results confirmed that socioeconomic vulnerability is a determining factor affecting access to RT-PCR testing and its subsequent control strategies in São Paulo State. This finding is in line with Souza et al. (26) that found an association between confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and per capita income in São Paulo, the capital of São Paulo State. Given that demand for testing is not necessarily associated with regional testing supply, and further considering each region's population density, our study's findings highlight structural inequities contributing to the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO has emphasized both the importance and the distribution of laboratories that should also be monitored to reduce inequities (5) . The findings provide evidence that a key component of surveillance capacity, laboratory testing, was underperformed during the pandemic and might have contributed to the emergency's poor handling even in Brazil's richest and most well-endowed state.There are limitations to this study. The Health Secretariat's Intelligent Monitoring System does not report anonymized individual RT-PCR testing data conducted in private labs (11) . Given these limitations, we were not able to estimate the diagnostic RT-PCR test turnaround time.When observing the evolution of the pandemic in the state of Sao Paulo and the RT-PCR TIEI in the RHDs, there is evidence suggesting that there have been significant public resources directed at RT-PCR testing since March. Nevertheless, the results presented here indicate that the RT-PCR testing effort's intensity needs to increase to improve pandemic control measures.Unfortunately, there were no data available in processing capacity by laboratory over time.Given our goal of assessing RT-PCR testing efforts in public laboratories, our study also highlights that the Brazilian Health System (SUS) can play an instrumental role in reducing inequalities. Its decentralized structure allows for targeted policies, considering the distinct epidemiological profiles and vulnerabilities (30) . During pandemics, control measures must be guided by the characteristics of the pandemic settings and the health system's capacity in different locations. In this regard, the SUS allows municipalities and RHDs to adopt distinct strategies to test, identify, and isolate infected people, contact tracking, and quarantine infected people. Finally, our data suggest that in addition to the improvement in testing capacity, the autonomy of RHDs to modify their surveillance and control measures requires that federal and state authorities adopt policies that are aligned with these efforts, which was not the case through the course of the pandemic.Local accurate testing availability is being undertaken to repeatedly test individuals over time 1 Local accurate testing availability is being undertaken to repeatedly test individuals over time 0Contact tracing success may be evaluated by considering the number of contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (and identified) in relation to the number of contacts interviewed (7) .

As of July 12, there were more than 12,740,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 565,000 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The United States (US) led the world with over 3,280,000 cases of COVID-19 and over 135,000 deaths as of July 12, 2020. The rate of new cases continues to rise in the US, Brazil and India with no apparent end in sight.To meet diagnostic needs as the pandemic grows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted several commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Since that, there has been a race against time to develop tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection so individuals with COVID-19 could be identified and isolated to slow the spread of the disease. In January 2020, the CDC developed a TaqMan probe-based molecular test (2) . In the following months, several commercial assays became available and have been used in the laboratory under the FDA's EUA (3) (4) (5) (6) . With the rapid development of those tests, came the challenge of assay sensitivity and specificity. Our laboratory at Tampa General Hospital validated a modified version of the CDC assay following the FDA EUA guidelines and brought in commercial assays to help respond to the testing demand. The modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay involves off-instrument cell lysis and nucleic acid extraction steps, and an amplification step on a different instrument. The assay includes a panel of primer/probe sets targeting the viral N gene and the human RNase P gene.The NeuMoDx™ SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa® Covid-19 Direct assays are fully automated sample-to-answer multiplex assays targeting two different regions of the viral genome.NeuMoDx assay targets the Nsp2 and the N genes while DiaSorin test targets the ORF1ab and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f S gene. The NeuMoDx™ SARS-CoV-2 assay is performed on a random-access, high throughput instrument allowing for with high priority and high volumes testing which is crucial in an outbreak.In this study, we sought to describe a modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay validation and compare its performance and workflow to that of the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assays using respiratory specimens.The primer/probe sets used in this validation were selected from regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleocapsid (N) gene and were described in the CDC EUA protocol for COVID-19 diagnostic testing (7) . The CDC original panel was designed for both universal detection of SARSlike coronaviruses (N3 primer/probe set) and specific detection of the SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 primer/probe sets). Moreover, the original CDC protocol included two sets of controls: HSC (human specimen extraction control) and RP (human RNase P gene to assess specimen quality).Our modified protocol included the N1 and N2 primer/probe sets and the RP control. Primer and probe sets used in this validation were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out on the bioMérieux NucliSens® easyMAG® automated system (bioMerieux, France) from a 200 µl of the sample and eluted in 50 μl of EasyMag elution buffer. A separate reaction mix containing 5 µl of the eluate, 5 µl of TaqPath TM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (4x), 1.5 µl of combined primer/probe Mix (500nM and 125nM final concentration of primers and probes, respectively) and 13.5 µl of Nuclease-free Water was made for each of the assay target (N1, N2, and RP). A no-template water control (NTC) and nCoVPC plasmid were used as template for each of the primer/probe set; Hs_RPP30_Positive Control plasmid was used as template for RP primer/probe. The RT-PCR cycling conditions were set up on the Rotor-Gene 3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research, Australia) as followed: 25°C for 2 min, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 55°C for 30 s with fluorescence (FAM) detection during the 55°C incubation step. A sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 if at least one of the two targets (N1, N2) was detected regardless whether RP was amplified, negative if none of the targets was detected and RP was detected, and invalid if RP and the two targets were not detected.For the analytical evaluation, we used SARS-CoV-2 RNA (strain USA_WA1/2020) kindly provided by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston. A series of two-fold dilutions of the RNA were spiked in pooled sputum at concentrations of 800 copies/ml to 0.05 copies/ml to determine the limit of detection (LoD) of the assay. All samples were processed and tested in triplicate as described above. The LoD was confirmed by further testing in 20 replicates. The analytical specificity was determined by testing 22 samples previously positive for different respiratory species, including 15 patient samples, 4 ATCC strains, and 3 commercially available nucleic acid controls. The clinical performance was established by testing 30 contrived NP swabs and sputum specimens and 30 non-reactive specimens. Of the 30 contrived specimens, 20 were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 strain USA_WA1/2020 RNA at 1x-2x LoD concentrations and 10 were spiked at concentrations spanning the assay's testing range (60,000 copies/ml to 234 copies/ml).A total of 159 NP swabs were used to compare clinical performance of the three SARS-CoV-2 assays. Samples were processed as described above for the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay;for the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay and the DiaSorin Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assay samples Since the CDC primer/probe panel became available, many SARS-CoV-2 isolates have been sequenced. Therefore, we ascertained that the primer/probe sets were specific to all available sequences for SARS-CoV-2 in the NCBI's GenBank. Multiple sequence alignment of the nucleocapsid gene of SARS-CoV-2 and the two closely related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, showed the positions of the primer/probe sets (Fig. 1A) . The N1 set amplified a 72 bp fragment of the nucleocapsid gene, N2 amplified a 67 bp of the same gene, and the primer/probe set for human RP gene internal control produced a 57 bp amplicon (Fig. 1B) . The PCR efficiency was determined by testing a series of 10-fold dilutions of the 200,000 copies/µl concentration of the nCoVPC plasmid. The data showed that the PCR was linear over 6 orders of magnitude with great PCR efficiency (N1=111% and N2=100) and R 2 of 0.99 for each of the primer/probe set (Fig. 2) .The analytical sensitivity of the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay was determined by testing pooled sputum samples spiked with a series of two-fold dilutions at concentrations of 800 copies/ml to 50 copies/ml of SARS-CoV-2 strain USA_WA1/2020. The LoD was determined to be 200 copies/ml (Table 1A) . It was confirmed by further testing 20 replicates that were inoculated with 200 copies/ml; all 20 replicates were tested positive (Table 1B) . The analytical specificity of the assay was determined by testing 22 previously positive samples, which included 15 patient samples, 4 ATCC strains, and 3 commercially available nucleic acid controls. The result showed that none of the targets was detected ( Table 2 ). The performance of the assay was evaluated in 60 sputum samples to mimic the extent of viral colonization in respiratory specimens. The assay detected SARS-CoV-2 in all 30 contrived samples; no amplification was seen in the 30 nonreactive samples (Table 3) .One hundred and fifty-nine NP samples with a wide range of Ct values were used to compare the performance of the three assays. Of the 43 samples used for comparison between modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay and Simplexa Covid 19 Direct assay, 37 samples were run within 2 days and 6 were run within 5 days of first testing. Of the 116 samples used for comparison between the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay and NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay, 102 samples were run within a day and 14 were run within 5 days of first testing. All the samples tested by the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay matched the results using the two commercial assays evaluated yielding a 100% PPV and NPV for each assay (Table 4A ). NeuMoDx did not yield a Ct value for one of the two targets in 5 samples: 4 were negative for Nsp2 gene target and 1 was negative for the N gene target. However, they were still considered positive as only one detected target was needed for a positive result.Although 100% agreement was observed among the assays, further analysis showed that there were some differences in the Ct values. The average Ct value difference in samples ran within 24 hours between NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay was -0.14, and -2.13 between samples ran within 5 days. The overall Ct value difference for all samples ran between the two assays was -0.346. On the other hand, the average Ct values difference between samples ran within 2 days between DiaSorin Simplexa Covid 19 Direct assay and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay was -2.42, and -6.0 between samples ran within 5 days. The overall Ct value difference for all samples between the two assays was -3.47.We assessed the workflow and compared the throughput, time of sample-to-result, and cost per sample for each assay. Based on 8 samples/run, it was estimated to be 2 h and 50 min for sample processing and PCR runs were staggered. The most cost-effective test was the NeuMoDx. Reagents for this test is a little more expensive than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, but less expensive than the DiaSorin. The labor involved on the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, however, is considerably greater than on the NeuMoDx and DiaSorin assays, which ends up increasing the cost of the test.The ongoing pandemic still poses great risks for many around the world, and with the easing of certain restrictions, the need for health care facilities to be equipped and accurately test for the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f virus to limit its spread is as crucial as it will ever be. To that extent, laboratories have brought in SARS-CoV-2 assays and molecular platforms to respond to the need of their communities. There have been a few publications on head-to-head comparisons of those assays, including a couple very recently as we were preparing this article, in order to shed light on their performance characteristics and help laboratories make informed decisions on acquiring those assays (4, (8) (9) (10) .In this study, we validated a modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay and found that the assay is very sensitive and specific to SARS-CoV-2. The clinical performance comparison between NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay, Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assay, and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay showed an overall agreement of 100%. The Ct value difference between the modified CDC assay and the NeuMoDx assay suggests that there is not a significant difference between the two assays; however, there seems to be a greater difference in Ct values between Simplexa SARS-CoV-2 Direct assay and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, with the former having lower Ct values. The difference is greater in samples that were run 5 days after the routine testing on the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. This is in line with previously published data that showed Ct values on Simplexa SARS-CoV-2 Direct assay was much lower than those on an a modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay by an average Ct difference of -2.1 (9) . The overall data also suggest that depending on the viral burden NP samples can be refrigerated for at least 5 days and still maintain the RNA integrity for viral detection by the assays in this study.A limitation of this study was that the same samples were not tested by the three different assays, so a head-to-head comparison of the three assays was not performed due to the limited kits available for routine patient care. However, a head-to-head comparison of the assay's workflow was performed. NeuMoDx has the shortest time-to-result, the highest throughput, and is the most cost-effective of the three assays evaluated. Therefore, it allows the clinical laboratory to significantly increase throughput and reduce TAT in a time when more testing is needed, and faster result is crucial to speed up isolation measures. The TAT comparison between the three J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f assays was based on 8 samples/run since the LIASON® MDX instrument can only accommodate 8 samples/run. The overall throughput of the modified SARS-CoV-2 CDC assay can be improved to 24 samples if the 72-PCR tube adaptor option for the Rotor-Gene 3000 is used. Laboratories that are equipped with 96-well nucleic acid extraction platforms and PCR instruments, as well as the personnel can further scale up testing and significantly increase the throughput of the CDC assay. Nevertheless, the increased demand for testing highlighted a well-known short resource of skilled laboratory personnel and having to train new staff usually takes some time. Acquiring two NeuMoDx96 instruments helped our laboratory to increase the testing capacity from 200 tests/day to about 700 tests/day while maintaining the same number of laboratory personnel.Therefore, although the three assays have the same accuracy, due to its random-access and high throughput capacity, NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay outperforms the other two assays.Diagnostic laboratories around the world have faced with unprecedented challenges due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The testing requirement has not only forced laboratories to bring in new technologists to help with testing, but it has also led to shortage of reagents. Consequently, multiple assays and platforms are used to meet testing demand. As much as LDT assays, were instrumental at the onset of the pandemic, their overall testing capacity are very limited. Therefore, it is necessary for laboratories to acquire multiple high throughput automated instruments that can test high volume of samples quickly with almost the same number of qualified laboratory professionals.There is no conflict of interest to disclose.

6f53079314268acf4904ef011fe24c12838adf00,Ileum Perforation in Crohn's Disease Patient During SARS-Cov-2 Infection,"To the Editors, Gastrointestinal and liver manifestations are described in approximately 15% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and digestive comorbidities are reported in 4% of such patients. 1 To the best of our knowledge, only 1 case of small bowel perforation in a Crohn's disease (CD) patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 has been described. 2 We report a case of a CD patient in the remission phase who presented with a small bowel perforation during SARS-CoV-2 infection.A 43-year-old male physician reported an anal abscess 10 years ago followed by self-limited episodes of diarrhea. He did not have any comorbidities. The symptoms intensified, and abdominal distension began 1 year ago. The MR enterography findings were suggestive of CD. The diagnosis was confirmed after a pathologic study of the ileum, which was resected 10 months prior. He did not present criteria for postoperative recurrence. Metronidazole was prescribed for 3 months. A new imaging study was scheduled for 6 months later. He was completely asymptomatic and postponed the evaluation because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eleven days before hospital admission, he started showing symptoms such as dry cough, fever, coryza, and headache. After 4 days, he started to have anosmia, ageusia, and diarrhea and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. He was admitted to the emergency room, reporting sudden and severe abdominal pain for 6 hours without improvement despite taking analgesics. Imaging revealed pneumoperitoneum, and laparoscopic surgery was performed. A preoperative chest computed tomography scan revealed a consolidating focus with nodules and ground-glass opacities in the lower right lobe. Intraoperatively, a small amount of free, enteric-like fluid was identified, without pus, fibrin or peritonitis, which could suggest recent perforation. A friable terminal ileum was observed. Two perforated ulcers, 2 mm each, without inflammatory adhesions, were identified close to the previous enteric anastomosis, approximately 15 centimeters from the ileocecal valve. The affected segment was resected, and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed with nonabsorbable thread. The pathological features of the resected segment showed edema, vascular congestion, acute inflammation, perforation, and normal lymph nodes (Fig. 1) . After 11 days, he was discharged, asymptomatic, without sequelae, and a swab specimen tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection.The occurrence of ileum perforation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients could be misinterpreted as disease activity in patients who are not under strict follow-up. The uncertainty about etiology could make the management of this threatening complication difficult. Our patient was in surgical remission from CD, and after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, he remained completely asymptomatic. Furthermore, the surgical and pathological findings did not suggest CD activity. Staff of inflammatory bowel disease reference centers need to be aware of this possible complication in CD patients who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection. ",Brazil,first author,2020-11-30,11
dbb5df014d76a97065ff1bb3fb76c27f331f556b,Dynamics of epidemics: Impact of easing restrictions and control of infection spread,"The emergence of infectious diseases with epidemic potential requires massive interdisciplinary efforts to understand and develop measures to prevent or, at least, mitigate outbreaks [1, 2] . In this context, mathematical models have played an important role in understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases and in designing health policy strategies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In fact, these models have been used extensively to investigate different types of infection dynamics such as influenza A [8] , Zika [9] , Ebola [10] , SARS [11, 12] , MERS [13, 14] , and, more recently, COVID-19 [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .During a pandemic like COVID-19, besides the important work of forecasting [21] and evaluating public health strategies [22] , the impact of easing containment measures should be carefully evaluated to avoid drastic spikes in infections and, consequently, reimpose heavy social and economic restrictions.In this work, we investigate possible outcomes for the COVID-19 outbreak in the phase of lifting containment measures. For numerical studies, we consider the SEIR model (Susceptible -Exposed -Infected -Removed) with an additional parameter to simulate the * Corresponding author.E-mail address: thomaz@ufsj.edu.br (S.L.T. de Souza). restrictions. We also provide a control strategy to prevent spikes in infections by easing restrictions. In other words, our main purpose is to cast further light on the dynamical scenarios for the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of reopening the economy and society. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , we introduce the SEIR model with an additional control parameter providing an initial overview of the epidemic behavior. In Section 3 , we investigate the impact of easing restrictions on the infection dynamics. In Section 4 , we explore a control strategy to avoid spikes and reduce the transmission rate. The last section contains our main remarks.Compartmental models derived from classical SEIR model have been used extensively to forecast the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The main idea to introduce these type of models is to divide the population into a set of distinct classes. For example, individuals for the basic SEIR model are separated into four compartments: susceptible ( S), exposed ( E), infected ( I), and recovered or removed ( R ) classes.For numerical simulation, we consider the SEIR model with additional control term ( 1 − σ ) as used by Boldog [28] . Thus, the compartmental deterministic model is given by the set of ordinary differential equations:dI dtdR dtwhere β ≡ R 0 /T in f is the transmission rate, ω ≡ 1 /T inc is the transition rate from E to I, γ ≡ 1 /T in f is the transition rate from I to R, and N = S + E + I + R is the total population for incubation period T inc , infectious period T in f , and basic reproductive number R 0 with σ on the interval [0,1]. In this case, the effective reproductive number is given by R t = R 0 (1 − σ ) S/N. Thus, in case of R 0 = 3 the parameter σ must be 2/3 or greater ( 2 / 3 ≤ σ ≤ 1 ) in order to suppress the epidemic spreading [29] . Additionally, the parameter σ describes the intensity of restrictions associated with control policies to reduce the infection spread. For example, this parameter can represent the fraction of the infected individuals subjected to isolation. Based on recent study on dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19 [30] , we consider the control parameters T inc = 5 . 2 days, T in f = 2 . 9 days and R 0 = 3 . The basic reproductive number R 0 depends on various factors, such as the probability of infection and the rate of contacts. In Wuhan during January of 2020, the median R 0 values ranged from 1.6 to 2.6 [30] . At the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, the European Union presented R 0 = 4 . 22 ± 1 . 69 [31] . Therefore, R 0 equal to 3 is inside the interval of values observed in many places. For numerical investigation we use I 0 = R 0 = 0 , E 0 = 1 and S 0 = N − 1 as initial conditions, fixing the population at N = 10 0 0 (normalized to 10 0 0). In order to evaluate the number of individuals S, E, I, and R for a real population of people ( P ), we have to multiply these dynamical variables by P/ 10 0 0 . Fig. 1 a displays a typical time-series picture of the SEIR model in terms of the dynamical variables S (blue line), E (yellow line), I (red line), and R (green line) for σ = 0 . 0 . In Fig. 1 b, taking into account σ to reduce the spread of the epidemic, we provide a qualitatively robust verification of the curve phenomenon flattening, whose signature is indicated by attenuated and delayed peaks of infections. In other words, increasing the σ value, the amplitude of peaks decreases considerably from 105.5 infections ( σ = 0 , red line) to 77.4 ( σ = 0 . 2 , blue line), 42.2 ( σ = 0 . 4 , indigo line), 22.7 ( σ = 0 . 5 , green line), and 5.6 ( σ = 0 . 6 , black line) infections per 10 0 0. Considering E 0 = 1 , the peak of I for N = 10 6 is obtained later than the one for N = 10 3 . The results for N = 10 3 and N = 10 6 are the same when it is considered E 0 = 1 and E 0 = 10 3 , respectively.In fact, for practical purposes flattening the curve is a desirable outcome associated with mitigation strategies, such as physical distancing, mobility restriction, isolation of infected people, and so on. Despite the importance of restriction measures, during the epidemic process easing restrictions will be certainly considered as planning procedures to reopen the economy and society. To evaluate the impact of these procedures we explore the dynamics of the contagious curve by varying the parameter σ .Initially, we report possible outcomes as a result of moving to a situation without any restrictions (old normal life) modeled by ap- This unrealistic scenario illustrates a biased view that getting past peak (curve in black) the epidemic is over (curve in blue) and the public health interventions can be totally relaxed. In general, the second peak is much more prominent, whose amplification is associated with the number of susceptible people. For instance, To provide a better overview of the effects resulting from removing all restrictions, we investigate the epidemic model using two-dimensional diagrams. (Such diagrams have been used extensively to characterize the dynamics of the diverse chaotic oscillators in two-parameter space [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .) In Fig. 3 a-d we display the diagrams in terms of time and the parameter σ for a grid of 10 0 0 × 10 0 0 cells. In the same manner as designed in Fig. 2 a-d, the simulation is performed for an epidemic curve by applying a particular σ (ranging from 0.4 to 0.7) at the very beginning and turning off σ (setting σ = 0 ) at a specific time (ranging from 0 to 400 days). indicate the behavior shown in Fig. 2 b and the area in blue corresponds to the same attenuated curve behavior shown in Fig. 2 a. Fig. 3 b presents another display showing colors according to the difference between numbers of infections at the peak and at the initial suppression of restriction moment ( σ = 0 ). Besides, we consider two more possibilities to evaluate the outcomes by using the ratio between the new peak value and the flattened curve peak and using the effective reproductive number ( R t = R 0 S/N) as shown in Fig. 3 c and d, respectively. Comparing Fig. 3 b and d we verify that the size of peaks depends directly on effective reproductive numbers (susceptible people). Moreover, we also identify in Fig. 3 a and c that the size of peaks for a specific time is subject to the hardiness of a priory restrictions. In other words, the new peaks increase according to the intensity level of the initial σ . In summary, any scenario described by a reasonable level of restrictions moving to total suppression restrictions results in a spike denoting the acceleration of spreading. Fig. 4 a presents the effect of a partial relaxing intervention, changing σ from 0.57 (in black) to 0.50 (in red and in blue). In this case, it is remarkable the difference between applying the same intensity of intervention at before and after passing the peak of the outbreak. Before passing the peak moment any easing restriction (a small change in σ ) results in a significantly different outcome composed of a high amplitude spike. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4 b for σ = 0 . 30 , even after the peak (in black) a high spike (in blue) can be obtained. However, in Fig. 4 c using again σ = 0 . 30 and postponing the implementation, a second peak (in blue) without high amplitude is obtained as outcome. Here, the second peak, like the main one, presents around 10 infections (10 per 10 0 0 population). In Fig. 4 d applying, after the main peak again, a smaller σ ( σ = 0 . 20 ) at the moment for a few numbers of infections, we face the manifestation of a second wave. stance, taking σ = 0.35 into account the spikes present amplification of peaks between three and five times compared to the flattened curve peak. Even passing the peak (142 days) relaxing restriction can provoke spikes associated with high second peaks, as obtained for σ = 0.20 around 200 days with a spreading amplification of twice. In Fig. 6 a and b, we show the effects of the containment measures during the outbreak and the late appearance of the secondwave infections. Fig. 6 a displays the epidemic curve (blue line) for σ = 0 . 6 . When σ is changed to 0, we observe a second wave (black line). Similarly, Fig. 6 b displays the infection evolution, but initiating the intervention at two weeks with σ = 0 . 6 (red line). As a consequence of delaying containment measures, the number of infections increases considerably in a short time.We use the two-dimensional diagrams to explore the dynamical properties for the effects shown in Fig. 6 a and b. Fig. 7 a displays the impact on the amplitude of the first wave in terms of the intensity of intervention σ (ranging from 0 to 0.8) and the number of infections I (initial moment of intervention, ranging from 1 to 100). The amplitude of the first wave is amplified by increasing the delay moment of interventions. Figure 7 b illustrates the effect of the second wave, whose amplitude increases by enlargement of parameter σ applied to the first wave. The red cross corresponds to the curve shown in Fig. 6 a with peaks of 5 infections ( Fig. 7 a, cyan area) and 39 infections ( Fig. 7 b, light gray area) for the first and second waves, respectively. Moreover, the amplitude of the second wave is associated with the number of susceptibles at the end of the first wave. This effect is verified by comparing Fig. 7 c (magnification of Fig. 7 b) with Fig. 7 d for color allocated according to the effective reproductive numbers ( R t = R 0 S/N).In the end, we investigate a possible strategy to suppress spikes during easing plan measures. First, considering 10 infected people for the first wave as an acceptable level of infection to prevent collapse in healthcare systems. Such strategy is adopted for just 2 years, based on the assumption that a vaccine or an effective treatment will be available in this period. The interventions are applied at a specific time after the main wave peak and 0.1 infected people moment. Moreover, the new values of parameter σ are evaluated checking the number of susceptible people S and setting R t = 1 for In Fig. 8 c, we investigate another case considering the effects of delaying containment measures at the initial stage of the outbreak.To contain the rapid transmission for σ = 0 (in black), we apply σ = 0 . 65 (in light green) at the moment with 7.5 infected people, maintaining the number of infections below 10. The following interventions are given by σ = 0 . 61 (at 30 days, in blue) and σ = 0 . 51 (in red). The necessary intensive intervention is closely associated with neglecting the outbreak at the initial stage. However, this configuration implies a considerable number of susceptible people, 667, at the end of 2 years. In contrast to the previous case, in Fig. 8 d we apply moderate early σ = 0 . 65 (the same value of σ used in Fig. 8 c) at the moment with 2.5 infected people (instead of 7.5), resulting attenuation of the main peak to (in light green) and significant increase in susceptibles (from 667 to 788) at two years.Besides preventing spikes during easing measures, the adopted control strategy enables an interesting scenario with a low number of infections (less than 0.1) for a long time (see Fig. 8 a-d, lines in red). This scenario is translated into less than 100 infected people for a population of 1 million. A low number of infections facilitates enormously the implementation of public policy responses such as identification, isolation of infected individuals, and efficient contact-tracing approaches [38, 39] .Another aspect identified from the control strategy is the variation of the number of susceptibles at two years according to configurations. In fact, the control actuation reshapes the infection curves resulting in this variation. The number of susceptibles is an important outcome, indicating the impact of the disease for the period. In short, increasing susceptible individuals means decreasing the death rate. Fig. 9 shows susceptibles (at two years, the number per 10 0 0) in terms of the moment of first intervention after the peak ( t = t − t P ) modeled by σ = 0 . 57 since the very beginning (in blue), σ = 0 . 65 since 7.5 infected people (in red), and σ = 0 . 65 since 2.5 infected people (in green). The pattern of susceptible outcomes is composed of wells following by saturation plateaus. Fig. 10 The cross corresponds to the curve shown in Fig. 6 a. thermore, the moment of the first intervention after the peak must also be carefully evaluated to improve the outcomes.To study the infection dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic, we considered the SEIR model with an additional parameter ( σ ) to simulate the containment restrictions (mitigation measures). Initially, varying σ, we modeled the infection spread obtaining the flatten curves related to all mitigation measures. The curve phenomenon flattening is related to mitigation measures. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of easing restrictions, reducing the value of σ, for the process of reopening the economy and society. In this case, for any easing restrictions applied during increasing infection rates, we obtained high spikes of cases indicating significant acceleration of infections. In general, for the period of decreasing infections, we also obtained prominent spikes describing second-wave of infections. Finally, we provided a control strategy to suppress spikes during easing restrictions. The interventions are applied at a specific time after the main wave peak and at a moment with low number of infected people. A sequence of control interventions were applied tailoring the parameter sigma during the decreasing infection period. Besides preventing spikes, the analyzed control could contain the transmissibility, for a long time, below 0.1 infections, that means 100 infected people for a population of 1 million. In a practical situation, this low number of infections facilitates enormously the implementation of public health policies such as isolation of infected individuals and contact-tracing.In this work, we assume that the recovered people can not be infected again. We also consider that the births and natural deaths are balanced, in consequence, the model does not have terms related to the birth and death rates [40] . In future works, we plan to analyse the effects of unbalanced birth and death rates, as well as the possibility of reinfection, in the impact of easing restrictions and control of infection spread.We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this work and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.

ef7344a9880022a658f7178e3caf4b982de84fd2,COVID-19 pandemic impact on clinical outcomes of patients with obstructive pyelonephritis,"Obstructive pyelonephritis (OPN) is a very common clinical condition in urological practice [1] , with high rates of sepsis and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions [2, 3] , leading to prolonged hospital length of stay and an overall mortality of 2% [4, 5] . Obstructive pyelonephritis is an emergency, where targeted treatment [6, 7] and prompt decompression of the collecting system [8, 9] can potentially improve clinical outcomes, with a high impact on patient morbidity and mortality [10, 11] .Concerns about the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been raised due to its high infectiousness, demanding radical changes in the basic structure of our present society [12] . Social distancing campaigns and a strict quarantine were implemented in numerous countries in an attempt to contain the COVID-19 dissemination [13, 14] . Brazil had the first confirmed case on February 26, 2020 and even before that, rumors about a potential pandemic were already impacting people's daily activities, as well as access to urgent healthcare. Even though it is difficult to assess the real impact of the COVID-19 on the healthcare system, several hospitals around the country have undergone radical changes to adapt to these new demands. Notably, there has been changes in patient flow at the emergency departments during the pandemic, and decreased hospital admissions due to cardiovascular diseases where reported by Huet et al. [15] in France, and Ebinger et al. [16] in the United States. In addition, ER visits for evaluation of patients with respiratory diseases increased dramatically during this period and consequently played a major role defining strategies as well as on how resources should be allocated to meet these new demands [12, 13] .In view of the intense changes evidenced in the routine of hospital care, we raised the hypothesis that patients with obstructive pyelonephritis are presenting themselves with greater severity due to the delay in seeking medical care. Thus, we sought to investigate the time elapsed between symptoms onset and medical care in this group of patients, as well as symptom severity when compared to patients with the same pathology outside the context of the pandemic.After Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective chart review of patients who required decompression of the collecting system due to acute obstructive pyelonephritis from June 2019 to July 2020 was conducted. Basic demographic information, pre-operative, and peri-operative data were recorded. Patients were assigned in two groups: ""Pre-Covid"" and ""Post-Covid"". The latter was composed of patients admitted from February 26th, 2020 to July 2020. All patients admitted before February 26th, 2020 were included in the ""Pre-Covid"" group.Acute obstructive pyelonephritis was defined as the presence of more than 5 white blood cells (WBC's)/high power field (hpf) in a centrifuged urinary specimen, an isolated bacterial count of 10 4 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in the urine specimen, high-grade fever of more than 38 °C in a patient with flank/lumbar pain and an obstructive ureteral stone confirmed by non-contrast CT scan. After diagnosis, patients were admitted in the ER for fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and emergent decompression of the collecting system using. According to the institutional protocol, an initial attempt of placing a double-J stent was performed due to the lower patient morbidity and because it is readily available in the institution. After a failed attempt, a nephrostomy tube would be placed under ultrasound guidance.In those cases where a renal abscess was present, a cutoff of size of 3 cm was used as a criterion when choosing between percutaneous drainage and conservative treatment. Refractory cases would be subject to further puncture or surgical drainage at the discretion of the assistant team. Patients with clinical or radiological findings of pulmonary involvement were systematically screened for COVID-19 utilizing a RT-PCR test from respiratory samples (e.g., nasopharynx), according to the Institutional Infection Control Commission.Pre-operative data such as basic demographic information, comorbidities, time of initial symptoms onset, prior antibiotic usage, basic metabolic panel and C-reactive protein levels, radiological findings such as stone location, stone size, presence of hydronephrosis or perirenal abscess were collected. Information regarding postoperative complications, ICU admissions, time between admission and kidney decompression, hospital length of stay, as well as respiratory symptoms were assessed. SIRS was defined as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: body temperature < 36 °C or > 38 °C, respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute or arterial CO 2 tension < 32 mmHg, heart rate > 90 beats per minute, white blood cell count > 12,000/ mm 3 or < 4000/mm 3 . The qSOFA score (respiratory rate > 22 breaths per minute, Glasgow Coma Scale < 15 and systolic arterial pressure ≤ 100 mmHg) was applied to all patients during the admission. Sepsis was defined as the presence of OPN and a qSOFA score ≥ 2 [17] . Postoperative complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification [18] .The decision of admitting patients to the ICU was based on the diagnosis of OPN associated with hemodynamic instability or the presence of multiple comorbidities. After ICU discharge, patients presenting clinical stability and two consecutive drops in WBC's count and C-reactive protein levels were discharged with appropriate antibiotic regimen. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (V.9, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the histogram analysis were applied to assess the normal distribution of variables. Descriptive analyses were performed using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney test for numerical variables and Chi-square to compare categorical variables. Significance was defined at p ≤ 0.05.A total of 63 patients were included in our analysis, with 23 (36.5%) patients in the Post-COVID group and 40 (63.5%) in the Pre-COVID group. All patients were successfully managed with a double-J stent. Mean age and time since symptom onset were 46.8 ± 13.4 years and 5.5 ± 4.1 days, respectively. Mean length of stay was 5.2 ± 4.8 days. SIRS and sepsis were present in 23 (36.5%) and 6 (9.5%) patients, respectively, with an overall mortality rate of 1.5%.In the Post-COVID group, 56% of patients were females with a mean age of 47 ± 15 years and a mean time since symptoms onset of 7.8 ± 5.5 days. During the initial evaluation, 57% of patients had SIRS and 13% had sepsis. Mean time from initial evaluation until stent placement was 22.6 ± 8.7 h, with 48% of patients presenting pyuria immediately after kidney drainage. Basic demographic data, laboratorial and CT scan findings are described in Table 1 . In the same group, three (13%) patients were admitted at the intensive care unit postoperatively. Clavien ≥ 2 complications were present in 26%, with one patient requiring dialysis, one patient underwent nephrostomy tube placement due to persistent fever even after stent placement and one patient died after 24 days of admission. Mean length of stay in this group was 7.6 ± 7 days.During the COVID-19 pandemic, two (8.6%) patients presented at the ER with respiratory symptoms and one (4.3%) had typical pulmonary findings on CT scan imaging. This patient required ICU admission, where he presented clinical worsening due to persistent obstruction of the collecting system even after the placement of the double-J stent, with the need of additional drainage utilizing a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. The patient showed progressive clinical improvement and was discharged after 25 days. No patient in this group was readmitted or had respiratory complications after 2 weeks of the initial evaluation.The Pre-COVID group had 55% of women, with a mean age of 46 ± 12 years. Mean time since symptoms onset was 4.3 ± 2.4 days and 52% of patients presented fever at the initial evaluation. SIRS and sepsis were present in 25% and 7% of patients, respectively. Mean time since the initial evaluation and kidney decompression was 23.7 ± 10 h, with the presence of pyuria in 37% of the cases after double-J placement. Basic demographic and complementary data are shown in Table 1 . In this group, 4 (10%) of patients required ICU admission postoperatively due to hemodynamic instability after kidney decompression. Despite that, all patients showed progressive clinical improvement and were discharged within a week of hospitalization. Furthermore, four (10%) patients presented Clavien ≥ 2 complications, with the need of broad-spectrum antibiotics in three patients and hemodialysis in one case. Mean length of stay for this group was 3.8 ± 2 days and no patient required a new hospitalization within 2 weeks of discharge.Among the 23 patients who underwent surgery during the pandemic, only 1 (4.3%) had a confirmed diagnose of COVID-19 concomitantly with obstructive pyelonephritis, and no correlation between the COVID-19 and symptom severity (p = 0.334) was established. Patients from the Post-COVID group sought medical care with a longer history of symptoms (7.8 vs. 4.3 days; p = 0.012), had a higher incidence of SIRS on admission (57 vs. 25%; p = 0.012) and a higher incidence of perirenal abscesses on CT scan (13 vs. 0%; p = 0.019). Only one of the three cases presenting renal abscesses required percutaneous drainage. All patients in this group had a good clinical outcome, with a mean hospital stay of 4.6 days. The Post-COVID group also had higher overall complication rates (p = 0.047; Fig. 1 ) and longer length of stay (7.6 vs. 3.8 days; p = 0.007). Comparative data are summarized in Table 2 .The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the healthcare system in Brazil, not only because of the escalating demand from patients infected by the virus, but also due to a sudden decrease in the availability of resources for diagnosis and treatment of numerous other diseases. Emergency departments across the country were also affected and deserve a closer look, as a significant portion of patients presenting at the ER demand a faster course of action from the medical team to improve clinical outcomes and reduce inpatient mortality [19] . Obstructive pyelonephritis is a common and potentially fatal condition that requires prompt intervention with antibiotics and decompression of the collecting system. To date, the real impact of the COVID-19 on the urinary tract is still not clear, but recent reports showed kidney dysfunction in 0.1-29% of cases and increased mortality rates within this group of patients (60-90%) [20] .Previously to the pandemic, studies reported a mean time between symptom onset and hospital admission of 2-3 days, with a positive correlation between this variable and the incidence of septic shock [21, 22] . In this study, patients from the Post-COVID group had a longer interval of time since symptom onset and hospital admission (7.8 vs. 4.3 days; p = 0.012). We estimate that this delay is probably a consequence of the strict social distancing measures imposed during the pandemic and the fear from a potential infection by the virus during the medical evaluation at the ER.In a recent study by Fukushima et al. [23] prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors reported a SIRS rate of 72% in patients with obstructive pyelonephritis. Our results showed a greater severity in patients who presented OPN during the pandemic, with higher incidence of SIRS (57 vs. 25%; p = 0.012) and perirenal abscesses (13 vs. 0%; p = 0.019) at admission when compared to the control group. Renal or perirenal abscesses are uncommon conditions with an incidence from 1 to 10 per 10,000 hospitalizations in the United States [24] , but are usually associated chronic diseases [25] and therefore it could explain the higher incidence of these findings in the Post-COVID group. White blood cells count and CRP were previously associated with higher patient severity, as described by Flukes and Yamamoto [21, 23, 26] . However, our analysis did not find any correlation between these two parameters and worse clinical outcomes (WBC 17.3 vs. 16.1 × 10 3 /µL; p = 0.567 and CRP 142 vs. 200 mg/dL; p = 0.125).Earlier studies reported ICU admission rates of 7-17% for patients with APN [24] [25] [26] [27] . This study presented an overall ICU admission rate of 13%, with no differences between groups. However, the lack of a sufficient number of ICU beds in the Brazilian public health system is a possible confounding factor, aggravated by the redistribution of a large percentage of ICU beds to patients with complications of the COVID-19 infection. This could justify the similar rates regarding ICU admission between the two groups, despite the greater severity of patients from the Post-COVID group. These patients presented higher rates of clinically significant complications (Clavien ≥ 2), with a total of 6 (26%) cases. Historically, hospital lengths of stay of patients with OPN vary from 4.25 to 12 days [22, 27, 1] . This study demonstrated that patients from the Post-Covid group had a significantly higher length of stay when compared to the Pre-Covid group (7.6 vs. 3.8 days; p = 0.007), possibly due to the higher Clavien ≥ 2 complication rates in the first group.A positive correlation between COVID-19 and OPN still lacks evidence, and the limited availability of tests to detect infected patients in this study precludes any causality analysis. Nonetheless, public health measures created to mitigate the impact of the pandemic ultimately resulted in delayed hospital admissions and possibly contributed to the higher severity of the Post-Covid group of patients. The novel coronavirus is a serious public health issue, which requires a coordinated course of action to optimize resource allocation without compromising patient care. Efforts should be made to improve patient inflow at the ER to identify patients with suspected OPN and avoid any treatment delay, which could impact patient outcomes and increase mortality.This study has some limitations. First, the limited number of patients and a retrospective design preclude more accurate conclusions and limit the generalizability of the results. However, we presented the first report on patients with obstructive pyelonephritis at a high volume tertiary academic center located at the largest city in Brazil. In an era of ever-growing medical knowledge concerning COVID-19, we provided preliminary information that can contribute to the development of protocols for patients with suspected OPN. Second, only three patients in the study were tested for COVID-19, mainly due to established governmental protocols that did not recommend mandatory screening for COVID in asymptomatic patients presenting at the ER in an attempt to avoid test shortage. Thus, it is impossible to determine whether there were asymptomatic carriers of the virus and if this had influenced the severity of cases of OPN in the Post-COVID group.COVID-19 is a serious public health problem, which deserves all the care inherent to tragedies of this magnitude. However, it should not delay or postpone the treatment of potentially serious conditions such as Obstructive Pyelonephritis. Studies like ours serve as a warning to health professionals and public managers, who must be alert and implement measures that minimize the side effects of the pandemic. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with acute obstructive pyelonephritis presented themselves at the emergency room with a longer interval of time since symptoms onset and with greater disease severity. In addition, length of hospitalization was longer for this group of patients when compared to patients with OPN prior to the pandemic.Author contributions Silva (first author): data collection, data analysis, and manuscript writing.

39c3201aa0f951dae3b3ef72cc9668b2abe6fcd9,"Different Crises, Different Patterns of Trauma. The Impact of a Social Crisis and the COVID-19 Health Pandemic on a High Violence Area. Level of evidence III","Santiago, Chile underwent two separate periods of crisis over the past year. The first period, the 'social crisis,' started in mid-October 2019 and extended for thirteen weeks through early January 2020. It started with mass street protests for income inequality, and was characterized by vandalization, rioting, and violent clashes between police and protesters. The weeks following were characterized by nighttime curfews, traffic restrictions, and military patrols. The second period, the 'health crisis,' began in early March with Chile's first case of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within weeks, a new curfew was initiated with 'stay at home orders' for commuters, traffic restrictions, the shuttering of most businesses except for 'essential' services for most of Santiago's residents.A lockdown is a political or public health measure imposed in crisis situations to control riots or reduce the spread of infectious disease. Multiple reports have shown decreased overall visits to the hospital during crisis periods, but its impact on trauma epidemiology is less well understood [1] . Some early studies report fewer injury-related admissions with significant reductions seen in major traumatic injuries while others report an increase in violence, especially gunshot injuries [2, 3] .Sotero Del Rio is a 900-bed hospital located in the heart of south-east Santiago, an area with a population of 1.7 million, sixty times the rate of poverty, and less than 1/8th the health spending per capita than other parts of the city. Sotero Del Rio also houses the South-East Metropolitan Health Service Trauma Registry (SEMHSTR), which was established in 2017 through a combination of public and private funding and collects prospective information on trauma patients at two public trauma hospitals serving the south-east Santiago [4] . We sought to understand the impact of curfews from two national crises, the ''social crisis'' and the ''health crisis,'' on trauma epidemiology through the SEMHSTR.We performed a retrospective review of the South-East Metropolitan Health Service Trauma Registry (SEMHSTR), extracting data for 35 weeks between September 1, 2019 and May 1, 2020. We defined the time period for the 'social crisis' as beginning on October 14, 2019 and continuing in varied intensity for the next 13 weeks, though a nightly curfew was in place for most of that time. We defined the time period for the 'health crisis' as beginning with the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 3, 2020. Official social distancing recommendations began on this day, though formal 'stay-at-home' orders and more restrictive measures, including curfews, were not initiated until additional cases were registered several weeks later. We confirmed the length of these crisis periods by evaluating total medical, surgical, and trauma visits to the adult emergency department through a separate internal hospital registry. These visits declined sharply during these time periods and returned to baseline in the intervening period between the two crises, compared to the year prior ( Fig. 1) , thus providing further confirmation of the 'crisis' periods of interest.Patients older than 15 years and admitted to the hospital with a traumatic injury were included in the SEMHSTR registry. Traumatic injuries were defined as penetrating, blunt, and burn injuries of any part of the body including the brain and extremities proximal to the wrist. Injuries to the hand were only included if ligaments, bone, and vascular systems were affected.We extracted data from the SEMHSTR registry on hospital admissions for penetrating and blunt trauma, the number of patients who underwent a trauma operations, and the number of patients who died each week from September 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020, encompassing both crisis periods. We also extracted this information from the registry from September 1, 2018 to May 1, 2019 to serve as a baseline. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the South-East Metropolitan Health Services.We performed a descriptive analysis presenting categorical variables as proportions and continuous variables as means with standard deviations. A student's t-test was performed comparing means of continuous variables, and we used a two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 to classify as statistically significant. We used R Studio 1.2 (www.rstudio.com) for statistical analysis.There were a total of 14614 emergency department visits for surgical complaints from September 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020, averaging 3783 visits per week during the social crisis and 2729 visits per week during the health crisis. In comparison, there was an average of 4257 visits per week and 4721 visits per week in the same time periods in 2018 and 2019, respectively (Fig. 1) . Averages for blunt and penetrating trauma, operative trauma, and trauma deaths during these crisis periods are summarized in Table 1 . We observed a sharp increase in trauma admissions, including both penetrating and blunt trauma, at the onset of the social crisis that remained higher, on average, than during the immediate weeks preceding the social crisis (Table 1 , Fig. 2 ). However, we do not see differences between the periods analyzed with respect to age, ISS or type of transfer to the hospital center or damage control surgery requirements. In contrast, there was a progressive increase in cases of penetrating trauma along with a decrease in blunt trauma as weeks of health crisis continued. In the later weeks of the health crisis, penetrating trauma was more common than blunt trauma. (Fig. 3) . Penetrating trauma volume, blunt trauma volume, and overall trauma volume were depressed during the social crisis and health crisis relative to their respective baseline periods from the previous year with the exception of penetrating trauma, which was higher during the health crisis compared to its previous year's baseline.We found that operative trauma volume remained higher in both crisis periods compared to the weeks immediately preceding them, but they were both substantially lower than the year prior (Fig. 4) . There were slight increases in the number of deaths amongst admitted trauma patients during both the social crisis and the health crisis relative to the year prior, but these differences were not statistically significant.Two crises events in Santiago over a single year presented a unique opportunity to explore the impact of social lockdowns on trauma epidemiology. Crisis periods were associated with depressed emergency department visits, and that while there were spikes in trauma volume during both crises, overall it was much lower than the previous year's baseline. Strikingly, penetrating trauma increased relative to blunt trauma during the health crisis but not during the social crisis. Interestingly, we found that the severity of the patients, when observing the ISS and damage control surgery requirements, is not affected between the periods. We believe that this is determined by the great interpersonal violence that exists in the urban area analyzed. The spike in trauma volume at the onset of the social crisis can be explained by rioting and violent clashes between police and protesters. Soon thereafter, confinement measures began with a night curfew, replete with military patrols and traffic restrictions, and these measures seemed to reduce the number of individuals who visited emergency departments or were brought in as victims of trauma. As the health crisis began, another ''lockdown'' was initiated. This included shuttering of most nonessential Fig. 2 Box-and-whisker plots of operative trauma case, blunt trauma admissions, and penetrating trauma admissions during the social and health crises (solid, dark boxes) with the baseline time period of the year prior (striped boxes) and the weeks immediately preceding the crises (white box) as comparison businesses in addition to curfews and traffic restrictions and mandates for social distancing. Consequently, ED visits declined even further than during the social crisis, as did overall trauma volume relative to the year prior. This suggests that that the combination of restrictive measures imposed by the government with many individuals' desire to avoid hospitals in the setting of COVID contributed in reduced access of hospital facilities for emergency visits and trauma. These findings align well with recent literature during the global COVID pandemic showing that patients suffering from a wide variety of ailments, from acute coronary syndromes to strokes, are arriving to the hospital in less frequency during COVID lockdowns [1, 5] .Interestingly, we found penetrating trauma volume increased during the health crisis and there were (Fig. 5) , more penetrating injuries during the health crisis than the year prior. Simultaneously, blunt traumatic injuries decreased during this time period (and compared to the year prior). Other studies have shown that curfew measures, such as the stay-at-home orders and traffic restrictions imposed during the health crisis in Santiago, increase rates of interpersonal violence including domestic violence [6] . Further, the risk of death increases five times when there is a weapon at home [7] . Southeastern Santiago is the location of the city's most violent trauma and is known for high levels of gang violence. This finding suggests, that communities that have a high underlying level of interpersonal violence may be predisposed to increased penetrating trauma with curfews.Recent literature from Philadelphia also shows increasing gun violence [8] in the setting of overall fewer trauma admissions during the COVID crisis. Similarly, trauma data from New Orleans shows steady penetrating volume in the setting of reduced blunt volume [3] .Notably, divergent trends with increasing penetrating injuries and decreasing blunt trauma was not observed during the curfew period of the social crisis. While there was a slight uptick of penetrating trauma cases at the later stages of the social crisis, blunt trauma also increased. This may be explained by the social crisis curfew being initially where businesses were open, and most individuals were not restricted from leaving to work. The burden of traffic collisions and occupational injuries increased as restrictive measures decreased. Future research will be needed to further explore this relationship.Our data were limited in that our registry did not distinguish between violence-related and violence unrelated traumatic injury. We used penetrating trauma as a proxy for violence-related trauma given data completeness in the registry, though we recognize that not all penetrating trauma is the product of violence nor is all blunt trauma nonviolent. Further, because our registry did not include trauma visits that did not result in admission, our data only speak to the most severe of trauma seen during the crisis periods.In summary, this study suggests that confinement measures such as curfews and lockdowns to deal with crisis situations effectively decrease emergency hospital visits and trauma volume. Penetrating trauma may increase in the setting of prolonged, restrictive confinement measures in communities with high preexisting levels of firearm possession and baseline violence. Blunt trauma likely decreases with the reduction of road traffic collisions, fewer occupational accidents, and possible difficulty accessing health facilities. In the future, governments considering a confinement measure to deal with a crisis should consider the impact on community health to reallocate resources and design strategies to mitigate interpersonal violence [9] . Reducing trauma burden during these crisis periods is particularly important because of limited hospital resources, availability of critical care unit beds, blood products, personal protective equipment and healthcare staff.Authors contribution JPR: Study conception, literature search and writing.

c368e75c648402dd35e5510218d95f34c2822ebd,Assessing the Gender-Sensitivity of International Financial Institutions' Responses to COVID-19: Reflections from Home (with Kids) in Lockdown,"domestic work change according to the different stages of our life and economic cycles and that of other people in the family. This reconciliation runs through our entire lives along with our personal experiences and sensitivity to social injustices; all of it being the fuel that drives our research.Thus, when we made up our family (nuclear, biparental, heterosexual, with two kids) we began to face these fundamental questions: What funds, services and time is provided by the State of the country in which we reside towards people's care? What services are provided by the market; could we afford them and under what conditions? What public policies did the State offer and was it able to finance them to ensure the realisation of the right to care? What macroeconomic conditions, fiscal targets, tax policies and labour regulations did the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) impose on the State, exogenous requirements that through a number of causal mechanisms ended up having an impact on how we resolve care at home? And why were these questions even more pressing in the context of the pandemic?These complex questions-whose answers have had deep repercussions in our daily family life-became burning questions when our kids were born and even more so when the pandemic hit us all. We decided to join forces and began to explore how gender inequalities on the one hand, and human rights and IFIs' policies, on the other, were interlinked and how we could contribute to discussions in this field of study (and to make our family life easier!).We live in a country (Argentina) that has endured International Monetary Fund's (IMF) orthodox conditionalities for years and now, again, is beginning to renegotiate this multilateral debt. In Argentina, as in most countries, women are currently, and once again, more exposed to the effects of the pandemic and the economic recession (CEPAL 2020; Rodriguez Enriquez 2020). They are disproportionately affected by the invisibilisation of unpaid domestic and care work, and also by austerity policies that were implemented during the previous administration (2015-2019) through cuts in social and health budget, and the deregulation of labour market, which deepens occupational segregation. Within this context, we found it necessary to link IFIs' policies during the pandemic with gender inequalities and international human rights law. Our own university education did not prepare us to easily identify these links nor the legal standards against which we could assess the gendered impact of IFIs conditionalities, so this became for us a familial and an academic challenge.The fact that retrogressive economic reforms have normally direct and adverse consequences on human rights, in particular on gender equality, is something well documented (UN Independent Expert 2018). Orthodox economic policies, such as austerity, fiscal consolidation, privatisation and deregulation of labour and financial markets, have been promoted and even pushed by IFIs (mainly the IMF and the World Bank) for more than a decade in both developing and developed countries (Ortiz and Cummins 2019) , with devastating and lasting effects on women's human rights.The current global economic system is sustained by gender inequality and discrimination against women due, to a great extent, to asymmetric distribution of care responsibilities, gender stereotypes and gaps in laws and policies (Pautassi 2007; Rodríguez Enríquez 2012; Rodríguez Enríquez and Pautassi 2014; Carrasco 2009; Rico and Robles 2016) . In particular, mainstream economic thinking often does not recognise the economic value of unpaid domestic and care work, thereby privileging male-based macroeconomic policies that are detrimental to women and exacerbate structural inequalities (Rodríguez Enríquez 2015) . In such scenarios, women are at increased risk of gender-based violence, which further undermines the realisation of their human rights. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities and risks (UN Women 2020).In a recent study, ActionAid (June 2020) showed that every single low income country which received IMF advice to cut or freeze public employment in the past three years had already been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as facing a critical health worker shortage. The gender dimension of this finding is alarming. Julia Sánchez, Secretary General of ActionAid, explained:Women are on the frontline of Covid-19, as health workers, carers, home schoolers and informal workers. Without decent public services, women will continue to bear the brunt of this and future crises. As we start building economies that care for both people and the planet, women's voices and needs must be heard. (ActionAid 2020)The IMF and the World Bank are responding to the economic and financial crisis by offering massive credit lines to help countries cope with COVID-19 and its social and economic effects. We have written elsewhere (Bohoslavsky and Rulli 2020) that the first signs of this financial multilateral strategy do not seem set to bring welcome news for women. The IMF is already showing what it really thinks (and wants) (Bretton Woods Project 2020; Kentikelenis et al. 2020) : as the April 2020 IMF Fiscal Monitor Report explains, ""once the COVID-19 crisis is over, high-debt countries should, in general, pursue fiscal consolidation supported by growth-friendly measures"" (IMF 2020a). And the World Bank is channelling its funds through the International Finance Corporation, which means that, instead of strengthening the public health sector, financial aid is directed towards the private sector.Let us take, for example, the case of Ecuador. It is one of the countries that has been hit hardest by COVID-19 (Financial Times 2020). The previous-years of austerity policy backed by the IMF and implemented in the country dismantled the public health sector: public investment in the health sector fell 64 per cent in the last two years (Iturralde 2020). Yet, still today the Government is undergoing IMF-mandated structural reforms and the latest agreement includes stringent fiscal consolidation commitments (IMF 2020b) that may further dismantle the Ecuadorian health system.In this short reflection we will not focus on whether Bretton Woods institutions are already (yes, they are, OXFAM 2020) pushing for orthodox reforms in the context of the pandemic. Instead, we focus on whether and how the Guiding Principles on Human Rights Impact Assessment of Economic Reforms, voted by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2019 (HRC 2019), 1 could help prevent, minimise and compensate violations of women's human rights in the context of economic policies and reforms to be implemented by governments, some of which are being promoted by IFIs.An ex ante human rights impact assessment is a structured process to review alternative policy options and analyse the impacts of proposed measures on human rights before they are enacted (CESR 2018) . This process contributes to evidencebased policymaking by making human rights impacts more visible on the basis of historical experience, and provides a firmer basis for forecasting potential impacts and assessing the effects of proposed prevention, mitigation and compensation measures (Principle 17.1). In terms of substantive standards against which economic reforms must be assessed, among other human rights principles, these should prevent any kind of direct and indirect form of discrimination based on gender, in law or practice, and should promote substantive and transformative gender equality.Human rights impact assessments should always include a comprehensive gender analysis (Principle 8). Human rights impact assessments, incorporating a clear gender focus, can support the realisation of women's human rights in practice through contextualised analysis aimed at identifying and preventing direct and indirect discrimination; addressing structural socioeconomic and sociocultural barriers; redressing current and historical disadvantage; countering stigma, prejudice, stereotyping and violence; transforming social and institutional structures; and facilitating women's political participation and social inclusion (Principle 8.3).For example, decisions on fiscal policy should not result in expenditure cuts that curtail the guarantee of rights, mainly in sectors such as education, health and social insurance-particularly important for women, children and disabled people-or in deepening social or economic inequality and poverty through indirect and regressive taxes, such as value added tax (Principle 11.3). Direct and progressive taxes should be prioritised. Tax policy should promote the redistribution of wealth to overcome the disadvantaged situation of the population in situations of social vulnerability (economically disadvantaged people, minority groups and women, among others) and other priority care groups, notably older adults, children and disabled people (Principle 11.4).Economic reforms which encourage, among other things, labour market flexibilisation, reductions in the coverage of social protection benefits and services, cuts to public sector jobs and the privatisation of services tend to have a negative impact on women's enjoyment of human rights. Economic reform should aim to prevent gender discrimination and transform existing inequalities, instead of creating such situations (Principle 8.2). Policies that might improve overall social indicators might not benefit women, or particular groups of women.However, as Corkery and Isaacs (2020, 1284) remind us, ""…evidence-based policymaking is an 'extremely malleable' term that gives 'no obvious indication of which evidence is the right evidence on which to base particular policies'"". For impact assessments to advance the goals of the Guiding Principles, closer attention needs to be paid to the political dynamics at play in shaping the methodologies through which evidence is created, selected and interpreted. If not, neo-classical economics could easily become dominant, resulting in assessments being co-opted and narrowed into a technocratic box ticking exercise, stripping out political context and local concerns or justifying policies which limit rights as 'welfare enhancing'.In this regard, it is important to highlight that gender equality can be justified on intrinsic grounds, as a goal in and of itself, which speaks to human rights-based arguments. However, gender equality can also be justified on instrumental grounds, that is, as a means to achieve (only) economic growth and development goals. The recent focus of the IMF, along with the approach adopted by a number of states, appears to be mostly instrumental. These two approaches (intrinsic vs instrumental value of gender equality) offer different evidentiary hierarchies.How can we contest economic androcentric orthodoxies through analysis that combines quantitative and qualitative data, offering a compelling feminist cognitive infrastructure? How can we confront neo-classical styles of reasoning and policy devices dominant in mainstream economics that systematically produce patriarchal biases (Corkery and Isaacs 2020)? If the validity and credibility of the data collected needs to be assessed in the light of standards that reflect the principles of non-discrimination, equality and inclusion (Principle 20.3), then participation is one answer. In formulating measures requiring human rights impact assessments, states and IFIs must allow for and seek the broadest possible national dialogue, with the effective, timely and meaningful participation of all individuals and groups, including marginalised groups and those particularly at risk of vulnerability from such policies. As women, children and disabled people are generally underrepresented in both the political and economic spheres, special efforts must be made to ensure their capacity to co-decide measures by using innovative methods of participation (Principle 19.1). In turn, genuine participation can only be possible if governments provide timely, comprehensive and accessible information on all aspects of public finance, including budgets and macroeconomic performance (Principle 19.3).We could never overestimate the political traction of the choices on the nature of the data used to make economic policy decisions. Consider, for example, a single mother explaining to a public audience, in the context of an official human rights impact assessment, how tragic her life has been since privatisations and fiscal consolidation were implemented. The Guiding Principles explain that, in terms of qualitative data, targeted studies, surveys, testimonies and consideration of other types of analysis are paramount, including, when available, data on administrative complaints, case law and jurisprudence on individual and collective cases, as they also offer a glimpse of the type of violations, trends and limitations encountered when accessing assistance, reparation and justice. Even in contexts where disaggregated data are readily available, they should always be triangulated with qualitative data on discriminatory situations (Principle 20.6).Who should conduct the human rights impact assessments? The Guiding Principles are flexible enough to be adjusted to the particular needs of government departments, advisory bodies, parliamentary committees, national human rights institutions, courts, IFIs, private creditors, international human rights mechanisms, academic institutions or civil society organisations (Principle 22). Human rights impact assessments should be independent, robust, credible and gender responsive. Each country should decide which institution(s) is/are best suited to be in charge of carrying out this exercise, based on applicable criteria. States should take steps to support the ability of affected communities and civil society generally to provide parallel information to assessment processes and, as far as possible, to conduct human rights impact assessments directly (Principle 22.5). The European Network of National Human Rights Institutions, for example, recommended in May 2020 to use the Guiding Principles to assess the recovery measures in order to help protect people against discrimination and a widening of existing inequalities (ENNHRI 2020).An interesting example is the work of the UK's Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which commissioned a Cumulative Impact Assessment in 2014. Of note is also its latest cumulative impact of tax and welfare reforms, which studied the differentiated impact on women (UK EHRC 2018). The Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) undertakes annual equality impact assessments of its budget which includes a gender perspective (SHRC 2018). While a more rightsbased narrative would be needed in these cases, these experiences prove that impact assessments of economic reforms are technically feasible. The Center for Economic and Social Rights (CESR) has also developed a sophisticated and gender-sensitive methodology for assessing the human rights impacts of fiscal consolidation policies, which has been implemented by civil society organisations to assess the impact of austerity policies in Brazil, South Africa and Spain (CESR 2018).The Human Rights Council resolution in which the Guiding Principles were endorsed reads:[The Council] encourages Governments, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized agencies, funds and programmes and other intergovernmental organizations to consider taking into account the guiding principles in the formulation and implementation of their economic reform policies and measures, and encourages national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to give due consideration to the guiding principles in their work. (HRC 2019, emphasis added).The pandemic and recession hit women harder, and IFIs insist on androcentric policies, therefore, now more than ever human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) are needed to expose those links. This is why the Checklist for a Human Rights-Based Approach to Socio-Economic Country Responses to COVID-19, published in July 2020 by three UN agencies (Office of the High Comissioner of Human Rights (HCHR), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG)) represents a crucial step forward towards incorporating and institutionalising a gender perspective to macroeconomic policies. The Checklist includes a set of questions related to macroeconomic response and multilateral collaboration as a practical way to undertake a quick HRIA in the context of the pandemic and economic recession, while citing the Guiding Principles as a resource to consider when undertaking such a task. The United Nations Checklist explicitly poses the following pertinent questions: 2 1. Have you undertaken a quick but comprehensive mapping of the at-risk groups experiencing the highest degree of socio-economic marginalization and/or discrimination, requiring specific attention? Has a gender analysis been applied to the mapping? 2. Are there measures in place to IFIs and donors refrain from attaching conditions to their financing that could undermine the state's ability to respect, protect, and fulfil its human rights obligations in the allocation of resources and the design of policies? 3. Are loans and grants from IFIs and donors monitored, including by national human rights institutions and civil society organizations, to ensure that they are used to address demonstrated needs, with a focus on those most at risk of being left behind?.As ""the political-economic forces that mediate between economic policy reform and women's human rights are entailed by the interactions and interdependencies of structural, institutional and ideational forces that reproduce categorical inequalities"" (Kendrick 2020 (Kendrick , 1366 , human rights impact assessments can indeed help build a compelling truth that awakens consciences and changes values. This probably explains, to a great extent, why neither governments nor IFIs have conducted human rights impact assessments on their economic reforms currently being or due to be implemented during the pandemic, even when multilateral loans are already attaching stringent conditionalities (see Bretton Woods Project 2020; Kentikelenis et al. 2020 ). If inequality is a comorbidity that leads the pandemic and economic recession to disproportionately impact disadvantaged people, in particular women, and the interdependence of human rights is now more evident than ever, then not conducting human rights impact assessments of economic policies is something that could not be reasonably explained or defended.Governments have a responsibility to ensure that economic reforms and policies do not lead to violations of women's human rights. By undertaking gender-responsive human rights impact assessments of economic reforms before, during and after implementation, governments can both prevent and begin to reverse the process of marginalisation and impoverishment of women and girls. In turn, IFIs can be held responsible for complicity with human rights violations if they push governments to implement reforms with foreseeable adverse consequences on women's human rights .Despite their public commitment to support governmental efforts to protect people's lives in the context of the pandemic, IFIs still make the point that fiscal discipline and pro-market options continue to be the priorities in the mid-term. As the president of the World Bank anticipated in March 2020, ""countries will need to implement structural reforms to help shorten the time to recovery and create confidence that the recovery can be strong"" (Malpass 2020) .We well know the adverse consequences that these policies have on women's rights. Human rights impact assessments on the conditionalities attached to IFIs' loans should be conducted. Women's effective participation in these assessments is crucial as the evidentiary hierarchy that is used is, above everything, a political choice. The Guiding Principles voted by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2019 provide legal ammunition to fight this battle.",Argentina,first author,2020-11-12,11
98706ee1284dee7754df4151c8799264041822f5,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical Case Report The challenge of concomitant infections in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic era: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in a patient with chronic Chagas disease and dimorphic leprosy,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first officially described in São Paulo, Brazil on February 26 th , 2020, and since then, the country has experienced a concerning increase in the incidence of COVID-19. As of June 10 th , 2020, 772,416 positive cases had been identified, with 39,680 deaths 1 . The growing number of reports of concomitant infections with SARS-CoV-2 and pathogens that cause diseases endemic to tropical countries, such as dengue and chikungunya fever, has drawn attention 2 . Chagas disease and leprosy continue to remain public health problems in many developing countries, including Brazil 3 . In this manuscript, we describe a case of concomitant leprosy, chronic Chagas disease, and COVID-19, highlighting the cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical behavior of household contacts who had previously received prophylactic Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines. Patient inclusion was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Universidade de Brasília after informed consent was obtained (95411718.2.0000.0030).The patient, a 43-year-old female resident of Paranoá, in the Federal District of midwestern Brazil, was diagnosed with dimorphic leprosy in 2010 via positive smear microscopy and the presence of asymmetric multiple mononeuritis. She started treatment with multibacillary multidrug therapy (MDT-MB) in August 2010. However, she experienced multiple interruptions in treatment due to adverse reactions, until the therapy was finally terminated in April 2020 after the administration of dapsone caused hemolytic anemia. She was also diagnosed with Chagas disease in 2013 via serology (chemiluminescence), and because she had cardiac involvement and arrhythmia, she required a pacemaker as well as treatment with propranolol (80 mg/day) and Marevan (5 mg/day). The patient was scheduled to start a monthly treatment regimen with rifampicin, ofloxacin, and minocycline. However, she returned in May 2020 with complaints of fatigue, odynophagia, anosmia, ageusia, and headache for the prior 3 days. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was performed from a nasopharyngeal swab sample, and the result was positive. Her condition progressed, and she developed diarrhea and rectal bleeding in addition to cheilitis and painful, ulcerated lesions on her genital (Figure 1) and oral mucosae; however, the patient did not experience worsening of her leprosy symptoms, nor did she develop reactional states. No fever or respiratory symptoms were observed. The patient lived with her husband, who was also using MDT-MB treatment for leprosy, and her daughter, who had received BCG vaccine chemoprophylaxis in January 2020. Although her husband and daughter were classified as close household contacts, neither presented with symptoms, nor did they test positive for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using serology.Leprosy is a chronic, infectious, granulomatous disease that affects the skin and peripheral nerves and is caused by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. The majority (90%) of current leprosy cases are found in Brazil, India, Nepal, Myanmar, Madagascar, and Mozambique, and 80% of the cases that occur in the Americas are concentrated in Brazil 4 . There are no current data regarding cases of concomitant COVID-19 and leprosy. However, information about the possible effects of these concomitant diseases and the effects of the drugs used for the treatment of either COVID-19 or leprosy may be important. Another important focus is the possible increase of the frequency and intensity of the reactional state, as would be expected in cases in which leprosy patients contract other viral infections 5 . Leprosy reactions are characterized by malaise and the exacerbation of preexisting lesions, with subsequent erythema and pain that are usually accompanied by neuritis and severe edema of the extremities, occurring in 40% of borderline lepromatous patients 5 .In the present case, the patient was in the chronic phase of Chagas disease, characterized by congestive cardiac failure, arrhythmia (not controlled by drugs), and right bundle branch block, which were treated with a pacemaker, propranolol, and an anticoagulant 6 .Recent data from the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that the virus can affect the cardiovascular system. The damage due to COVID-19 is probably multifactorial, and can result from an imbalance between high metabolic demand and low cardiac reserve, systemic inflammation, and/or thrombogenesis. Direct cardiac damage from the virus also occurs, primarily in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or preexisting cardiovascular diseases 7 .Although the patient was classified as having borderline leprosy and Chagas cardiomyopathy, she did not experience a recrudescence of leprosy symptoms, worsening of previous cardiovascular manifestations, or a severe case of COVID-19. Although the vast majority of patients with COVID-19 have a good clinical outcome, we hypothesize that leprosy treatment, due to its immunomodulatory properties, could also have protected this patient. Moreover, exposure to M. leprae itself, due to its immunogenic similarities to M. bovis, could conceivably confer protection against the severe manifestations of COVID-19, given that the BCG vaccine has already been postulated to possess such properties 8 . These hypotheses are worth testing directly in future studies.The present patient also developed mucosal manifestations, likely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as reported elsewhere. Initial studies from China reported low frequencies of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients (0.2%), but reports are increasing, including acro-ischemia, chilblain-like eruptions, petechiae or purpuric rash, chickenpox-like rash, urticaria, erythema multiforme, maculopapular rash, mottling, and pityriasis rosealike rash 8 . Ulcerative mucosal lesions, similar to those seen in our patient, were also described by Carreras-Presas et al 9 . These mucosal ulcers are common primary lesions observed in other viral infections, such as herpes and hand, foot, and mouth disease. It is worth noting that our patient had no fever or cough but initially presented with mucosal manifestations.It is important to highlight the hypothesis raised by the scientific community that the BCG vaccine may mitigate the effects of COVID-19, as it could explain why the patient's daughter did not contract COVID-19 despite being in close contact with her. Recent studies have demonstrated an inversely proportional relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases in countries with widespread BCG vaccine use and the relatively high numbers",Brazil,abstract,2020-11-06,11
